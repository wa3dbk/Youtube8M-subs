00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.190 
his new nightmare animatronics possibly
having<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.119> same<00:01:33.299> ability<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.990> that's

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
having the same ability and that's

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.200 
having the same ability and that's
because<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.619> one<00:01:34.799> key<00:01:35.189> distinctive<00:01:35.970> feature

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
because of one key distinctive feature

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.880 
because of one key distinctive feature
and<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:37.079> they<00:01:37.200> all<00:01:37.409> seem<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.710> be

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
and that is that they all seem to be

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.700 
and that is that they all seem to be
having<00:01:38.070> five<00:01:38.549> fingers<00:01:39.180> yes<00:01:39.810> still<00:01:40.110> debatable

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
having five fingers yes still debatable

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.749 
having five fingers yes still debatable
whether<00:01:40.740> or<00:01:41.070> not<00:01:41.189> these<00:01:41.340> nightmare

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
whether or not these nightmare

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.760 
whether or not these nightmare
animatronics<00:01:42.420> are<00:01:42.509> actually<00:01:42.960> real<00:01:43.200> but<00:01:43.619> maybe

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
animatronics are actually real but maybe

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.920 
animatronics are actually real but maybe
this<00:01:44.280> minigame<00:01:44.700> actually<00:01:45.180> offers<00:01:45.540> some<00:01:45.720> light

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
this minigame actually offers some light

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.929 
this minigame actually offers some light
on<00:01:46.229> if<00:01:46.439> they<00:01:46.590> are<00:01:46.740> real<00:01:46.950> or<00:01:47.189> not<00:01:47.369> yeah<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:47.759> I

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
on if they are real or not yeah and I

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:48.830 
on if they are real or not yeah and I
think<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.210> first<00:01:48.420> thing<00:01:48.509> we<00:01:48.600> have<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.750> think

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
think the first thing we have to think

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.270 
think the first thing we have to think
of<00:01:49.049> eyes<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.350> course<00:01:49.590> they're<00:01:49.799> conditioned

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
of eyes of course they're conditioned

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.350 
of eyes of course they're conditioned
because<00:01:50.399> they're<00:01:50.579> very<00:01:50.670> damaged<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.270> we've

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
because they're very damaged and we've

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.789 
because they're very damaged and we've
mentioned<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.780> lot<00:01:52.020> but<00:01:52.200> they're<00:01:52.500> with<00:01:52.649> it

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
mentioned this a lot but they're with it

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.679 
mentioned this a lot but they're with it
in<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.009> very<00:01:53.040> similar<00:01:53.670> style<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.030> spring-trap

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
in a very similar style to spring-trap

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:55.999 
in a very similar style to spring-trap
aren't<00:01:54.990> they<00:01:55.110> yes<00:01:55.619> they<00:01:55.649> are

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
aren't they yes they are

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.920 
aren't they yes they are
so<00:01:56.369> this<00:01:56.700> alone<00:01:56.969> could<00:01:57.180> hint<00:01:57.360> towards<00:01:57.479> them

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
so this alone could hint towards them

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.200 
so this alone could hint towards them
possibly<00:01:58.530> being<00:01:58.860> maybe<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.579> existence<00:02:00.060> before

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
possibly being maybe in existence before

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.420 
possibly being maybe in existence before
five<00:02:00.719> nights<00:02:00.960> at<00:02:01.079> Freddy's<00:02:01.350> 2<00:02:01.380> yeah<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.340> it

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
five nights at Freddy's 2 yeah and it

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.740 
five nights at Freddy's 2 yeah and it
makes<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.729> think<00:02:02.880> like<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.450> don't<00:02:03.540> know

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
makes you think like I don't know

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.810 
makes you think like I don't know
because<00:02:03.960> I've<00:02:04.259> said<00:02:04.829> in<00:02:04.950> previous<00:02:05.159> videos<00:02:05.640> why

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
because I've said in previous videos why

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.130 
because I've said in previous videos why
don't<00:02:06.090> we<00:02:06.240> see<00:02:06.479> these<00:02:06.689> nightmare

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
don't we see these nightmare

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.719 
don't we see these nightmare
animatronics<00:02:07.740> like<00:02:07.920> obviously<00:02:08.399> there<00:02:08.550> must

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
animatronics like obviously there must

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.460 
animatronics like obviously there must
have<00:02:08.759> been<00:02:08.849> some<00:02:09.119> kind<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.360> prototype<00:02:09.780> yeah

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
have been some kind of prototype yeah

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.770 
have been some kind of prototype yeah
they<00:02:10.679> just<00:02:10.709> went<00:02:11.009> extremely

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
they just went extremely

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.690 
they just went extremely
wrong<00:02:11.930> but<00:02:12.230> maybe<00:02:12.530> this<00:02:12.920> minigame<00:02:13.250> actually

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
wrong but maybe this minigame actually

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.190 
wrong but maybe this minigame actually
showed<00:02:13.880> us<00:02:14.030> why<00:02:14.270> they<00:02:14.540> scraps<00:02:14.959> these

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
showed us why they scraps these

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.780 
showed us why they scraps these
nightmare<00:02:15.620> animatronics<00:02:16.100> if<00:02:16.250> they<00:02:16.430> are<00:02:16.580> real

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
nightmare animatronics if they are real

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.910 
nightmare animatronics if they are real
maybe<00:02:17.360> because<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:18.260> phone<00:02:18.470> guy<00:02:18.620> seems<00:02:18.830> to

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
maybe because the phone guy seems to

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.160 
maybe because the phone guy seems to
take<00:02:19.069> a<00:02:19.100> very<00:02:19.430> prominent<00:02:20.030> liking<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:20.690> foxy<00:02:21.080> and

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
take a very prominent liking to foxy and

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.780 
take a very prominent liking to foxy and
ironically<00:02:21.590> it's<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:21.890> fourth<00:02:22.220> nightmare

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
ironically it's the fourth nightmare

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.040 
ironically it's the fourth nightmare
character<00:02:23.120> we're<00:02:23.240> about<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.690> see<00:02:23.870> by<00:02:24.020> the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
character we're about to see by the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.890 
character we're about to see by the
looks<00:02:24.440> of<00:02:24.590> things<00:02:24.800> yes<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:25.790> I<00:02:26.030> think<00:02:26.090> a<00:02:26.480> really

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
looks of things yes and I think a really

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.090 
looks of things yes and I think a really
important<00:02:27.350> factor<00:02:27.680> that<00:02:27.709> we<00:02:27.920> have<00:02:27.950> to

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
important factor that we have to

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.800 
important factor that we have to
consider<00:02:28.489> towards<00:02:28.880> this<00:02:29.000> mini<00:02:29.270> game<00:02:29.450> here<00:02:29.690> in

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
consider towards this mini game here in

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.330 
consider towards this mini game here in
comparison<00:02:30.319> to<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.739> five<00:02:30.980> nights<00:02:31.130> at

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
comparison to the five nights at

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.080 
comparison to the five nights at
freddy's<00:02:31.640> 2

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
freddy's 2

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.400 
freddy's 2
withered<00:02:32.390> guys<00:02:32.569> is<00:02:32.720> that<00:02:32.900> this<00:02:33.020> guy<00:02:33.200> looks

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
withered guys is that this guy looks

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.290 
withered guys is that this guy looks
actually<00:02:33.590> distinctively<00:02:34.370> different<00:02:34.489> from

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
actually distinctively different from

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.970 
actually distinctively different from
the<00:02:35.450> withered<00:02:35.690> animatronics<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.350> just<00:02:36.830> the

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
the withered animatronics and just the

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.860 
the withered animatronics and just the
the<00:02:37.250> overall<00:02:37.550> layout<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:37.970> where<00:02:38.150> this<00:02:38.270> foxy

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
the overall layout of where this foxy

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:39.940 
the overall layout of where this foxy
minigame<00:02:39.170> seems<00:02:39.350> to<00:02:39.410> take<00:02:39.530> place<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:39.890> seems

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
minigame seems to take place it seems

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.650 
minigame seems to take place it seems
like<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.250> establishment<00:02:40.489> is<00:02:40.910> just<00:02:41.120> two<00:02:41.330> rooms

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
like the establishment is just two rooms

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.059 
like the establishment is just two rooms
and<00:02:41.870> it<00:02:41.959> looks<00:02:42.110> very<00:02:42.260> different<00:02:42.530> doesn't<00:02:42.920> it

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
and it looks very different doesn't it

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.949 
and it looks very different doesn't it
yeah<00:02:43.430> I<00:02:43.459> mean<00:02:43.880> also<00:02:44.390> what<00:02:44.540> you<00:02:44.600> said<00:02:44.780> there

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
yeah I mean also what you said there

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.630 
yeah I mean also what you said there
they<00:02:45.050> look<00:02:45.200> different<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.769> sprites<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.459> each

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
they look different the sprites and each

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.250 
they look different the sprites and each
minigame<00:02:47.000> look<00:02:47.330> very<00:02:47.510> different<00:02:47.810> as<00:02:47.900> well<00:02:48.080> as

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
minigame look very different as well as

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.920 
minigame look very different as well as
seeing<00:02:48.769> this<00:02:48.980> unnamed<00:02:49.340> minigame<00:02:49.970> voted<00:02:50.570> what

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
seeing this unnamed minigame voted what

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.870 
seeing this unnamed minigame voted what
appears<00:02:51.170> to<00:02:51.230> be<00:02:51.320> shorts<00:02:51.920> yeah<00:02:52.310> but<00:02:52.519> in<00:02:52.670> the

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
appears to be shorts yeah but in the

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.420 
appears to be shorts yeah but in the
save<00:02:53.180> their<00:02:53.450> minigame<00:02:53.930> he's<00:02:54.350> just<00:02:54.680> red<00:02:55.040> with

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
save their minigame he's just red with

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.790 
save their minigame he's just red with
metal<00:02:56.180> legs<00:02:56.450> yeah<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:57.019> it<00:02:57.080> also<00:02:57.230> appears<00:02:57.739> that

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
metal legs yeah and it also appears that

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.170 
metal legs yeah and it also appears that
there's<00:02:58.190> something<00:02:58.400> which<00:02:58.850> is<00:02:58.970> a<00:02:59.000> bit

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
there's something which is a bit

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.520 
there's something which is a bit
different<00:02:59.330> with<00:02:59.600> the<00:02:59.780> armors<00:03:00.260> while<00:03:00.410> if<00:03:00.500> we

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
different with the armors while if we

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.470 
different with the armors while if we
actually<00:03:00.680> look<00:03:01.010> in<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.400> save<00:03:01.880> them<00:03:02.120> help<00:03:02.330> the

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
actually look in the save them help the

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.820 
actually look in the save them help the
minigame<00:03:02.810> it<00:03:02.930> seems<00:03:03.110> like<00:03:03.260> there's<00:03:03.470> just<00:03:03.650> an

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
minigame it seems like there's just an

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.650 
minigame it seems like there's just an
exposed<00:03:04.310> metal<00:03:04.700> arm<00:03:04.970> so<00:03:05.120> it's<00:03:05.209> quite<00:03:05.420> clear

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
exposed metal arm so it's quite clear

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.300 
exposed metal arm so it's quite clear
we're<00:03:06.050> seeing<00:03:06.319> these<00:03:06.440> animatronics<00:03:07.040> after

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
we're seeing these animatronics after

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.500 
we're seeing these animatronics after
they've<00:03:07.459> definitely<00:03:07.670> been<00:03:07.910> withered<00:03:08.390> and

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
they've definitely been withered and

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.570 
they've definitely been withered and
damaged<00:03:08.900> but<00:03:09.170> yeah<00:03:09.530> you<00:03:09.860> know<00:03:09.950> this<00:03:10.130> guy<00:03:10.340> here

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
damaged but yeah you know this guy here

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.979 
damaged but yeah you know this guy here
he<00:03:10.670> looks<00:03:10.819> completely<00:03:11.360> clean<00:03:11.600> and<00:03:11.630> if<00:03:11.840> these

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
he looks completely clean and if these

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.930 
he looks completely clean and if these
guys<00:03:12.200> seem<00:03:12.890> to<00:03:13.010> be<00:03:13.130> coming<00:03:13.250> from<00:03:13.489> a<00:03:13.640> similar

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
guys seem to be coming from a similar

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.910 
guys seem to be coming from a similar
genre<00:03:14.540> then<00:03:14.780> it<00:03:15.019> does<00:03:15.230> make<00:03:15.440> you<00:03:15.590> think<00:03:15.860> like

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
genre then it does make you think like

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.340 
genre then it does make you think like
this<00:03:16.579> must<00:03:16.910> be<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.239> different<00:03:17.720> and<00:03:17.900> totally

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
this must be a different and totally

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.840 
this must be a different and totally
unique<00:03:18.680> suit<00:03:19.010> in<00:03:19.130> comparison<00:03:19.610> to<00:03:19.640> these

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
unique suit in comparison to these

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.850 
unique suit in comparison to these
withered<00:03:20.180> animatronics<00:03:20.810> yeah<00:03:21.320> and<00:03:21.530> it<00:03:21.620> also

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
withered animatronics yeah and it also

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.979 
withered animatronics yeah and it also
makes<00:03:22.220> you<00:03:22.370> think<00:03:22.610> you<00:03:22.910> know<00:03:23.060> was<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:23.750> pink

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
makes you think you know was the pink

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.050 
makes you think you know was the pink
guy<00:03:24.170> behind<00:03:24.530> what<00:03:24.920> we're<00:03:25.100> seeing<00:03:25.370> well<00:03:25.880> yeah<00:03:26.000> I

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
guy behind what we're seeing well yeah I

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.160 
guy behind what we're seeing well yeah I
was<00:03:26.150> going<00:03:26.269> to<00:03:26.360> say<00:03:26.510> there's<00:03:26.750> been<00:03:26.780> a<00:03:26.900> lot<00:03:27.140> of

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
was going to say there's been a lot of

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.840 
was going to say there's been a lot of
talk<00:03:27.440> about<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:27.799> purple<00:03:28.130> guy<00:03:28.250> in<00:03:28.370> recent

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
talk about the purple guy in recent

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.940 
talk about the purple guy in recent
months<00:03:29.060> that's<00:03:29.450> pretty<00:03:30.320> much<00:03:30.410> solely<00:03:30.739> based

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
months that's pretty much solely based

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.350 
months that's pretty much solely based
on<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.340> fact<00:03:31.519> that<00:03:31.579> five<00:03:31.820> nights<00:03:32.000> at<00:03:32.120> freddy's

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
on the fact that five nights at freddy's

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.080 
on the fact that five nights at freddy's
3<00:03:32.390> it<00:03:33.079> mostly<00:03:33.680> revolves<00:03:34.160> around<00:03:34.459> him<00:03:34.880> really

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
3 it mostly revolves around him really

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.970 
3 it mostly revolves around him really
doesn't<00:03:35.360> it<00:03:35.480> for<00:03:35.959> obvious<00:03:36.049> reasons<00:03:36.230> of<00:03:36.739> course

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
doesn't it for obvious reasons of course

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.410 
doesn't it for obvious reasons of course
he's<00:03:37.160> the<00:03:37.190> main<00:03:37.459> guy<00:03:37.489> inside<00:03:37.880> a<00:03:37.910> spring-trap

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
he's the main guy inside a spring-trap

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.910 
he's the main guy inside a spring-trap
and<00:03:38.600> just<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:38.959> whole<00:03:39.079> spring-trap<00:03:39.650> thing

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
and just the whole spring-trap thing

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.560 
and just the whole spring-trap thing
it's<00:03:40.070> like<00:03:40.190> spring-trap<00:03:40.670> as<00:03:40.820> a<00:03:40.880> relation<00:03:41.359> to

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
it's like spring-trap as a relation to

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.300 
it's like spring-trap as a relation to
Bonnie<00:03:41.930> it's<00:03:42.109> like<00:03:42.200> a<00:03:42.230> generation<00:03:42.799> 2<00:03:43.040> there

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
Bonnie it's like a generation 2 there

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.099 
Bonnie it's like a generation 2 there
and<00:03:43.519> yeah<00:03:43.820> as<00:03:44.060> we've<00:03:44.269> said<00:03:44.450> before<00:03:44.510> it<00:03:44.930> doesn't

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
and yeah as we've said before it doesn't

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:47.440 
and yeah as we've said before it doesn't
make<00:03:45.320> sense<00:03:45.560> why<00:03:45.739> the<00:03:45.799> main<00:03:46.190> mascot<00:03:46.640> aka<00:03:47.239> the

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
make sense why the main mascot aka the

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.120 
make sense why the main mascot aka the
phone<00:03:47.660> guy<00:03:47.870> would<00:03:48.230> kind<00:03:48.560> of<00:03:48.620> perish<00:03:48.950> and<00:03:49.070> be

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
phone guy would kind of perish and be

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.370 
phone guy would kind of perish and be
stuffed<00:03:49.430> into<00:03:49.609> the<00:03:49.790> predecessors<00:03:50.510> suit<00:03:50.810> so<00:03:51.140> I

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
stuffed into the predecessors suit so I

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.870 
stuffed into the predecessors suit so I
think<00:03:51.560> there's<00:03:51.859> definitely<00:03:51.890> some<00:03:52.430> undercover

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
think there's definitely some undercover

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.310 
think there's definitely some undercover
things<00:03:53.239> we<00:03:53.420> don't<00:03:53.540> know<00:03:53.810> yet<00:03:54.079> and<00:03:54.109> I

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
things we don't know yet and I

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.990 
things we don't know yet and I
definitely<00:03:54.620> think<00:03:54.859> that<00:03:55.220> if<00:03:55.459> this<00:03:55.640> is<00:03:55.820> set

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
definitely think that if this is set

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.580 
definitely think that if this is set
prior<00:03:56.269> to<00:03:56.480> five<00:03:56.660> nights<00:03:56.810> at<00:03:56.959> Freddy's<00:03:57.260> 2<00:03:57.290> then

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
prior to five nights at Freddy's 2 then

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.110 
prior to five nights at Freddy's 2 then
this<00:03:57.680> put<00:03:57.920> this<00:03:58.070> pink<00:03:58.370> I<00:03:58.519> may<00:03:58.790> have<00:03:58.910> been<00:03:59.060> in

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
this put this pink I may have been in

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.000 
this put this pink I may have been in
existence<00:03:59.329> then<00:03:59.930> and<00:04:00.140> it<00:04:00.440> leaves<00:04:00.620> a<00:04:00.769> lot<00:04:00.920> of

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
existence then and it leaves a lot of

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.500 
existence then and it leaves a lot of
questions<00:04:01.459> up<00:04:01.640> in<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:01.880> air<00:04:02.030> at<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.239> minute<00:04:02.450> as

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
questions up in the air at the minute as

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.640 
questions up in the air at the minute as
to<00:04:02.630> who<00:04:02.750> was<00:04:02.840> responsible<00:04:02.900> for<00:04:03.560> these

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
to who was responsible for these

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.440 
to who was responsible for these
original<00:04:04.130> murders<00:04:04.489> so<00:04:04.790> yeah<00:04:04.940> hopefully<00:04:05.180> in

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
original murders so yeah hopefully in

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.819 
original murders so yeah hopefully in
five<00:04:05.630> nights<00:04:05.780> at<00:04:05.959> Freddy's<00:04:06.200> 4<00:04:06.230> if<00:04:06.560> we<00:04:06.590> are

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
five nights at Freddy's 4 if we are

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:08.500 
five nights at Freddy's 4 if we are
correct<00:04:07.070> with<00:04:07.340> this<00:04:07.519> pink<00:04:07.760> guy<00:04:07.970> and<00:04:08.180> purple

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
correct with this pink guy and purple

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.420 
correct with this pink guy and purple
guy<00:04:08.660> theory<00:04:09.230> then<00:04:09.530> I<00:04:09.769> don't<00:04:10.010> know<00:04:10.070> maybe<00:04:10.250> we'll

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
guy theory then I don't know maybe we'll

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.310 
guy theory then I don't know maybe we'll
find<00:04:10.670> out<00:04:10.880> more<00:04:11.120> about<00:04:11.359> this<00:04:11.510> character<00:04:11.720> yeah

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
find out more about this character yeah

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.720 
find out more about this character yeah
it<00:04:12.440> seems<00:04:12.590> to<00:04:12.709> make<00:04:12.799> sense<00:04:12.859> I<00:04:13.220> mean<00:04:13.250> five

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
it seems to make sense I mean five

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.400 
it seems to make sense I mean five
nights<00:04:13.910> at<00:04:14.000> Freddy's<00:04:14.269> for<00:04:14.540> the<00:04:14.750> final<00:04:15.170> chapter

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
nights at Freddy's for the final chapter

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.219

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
mostly oriented around this purple guy

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:22.710 
mostly oriented around this purple guy
so<00:04:22.039> you<00:04:22.370> know

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
we'll find out a lot more about this

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.410 
we'll find out a lot more about this
character<00:04:24.220> here<00:04:24.610> he's<00:04:24.820> a<00:04:24.850> very<00:04:25.150> mysterious

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
character here he's a very mysterious

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.480 
character here he's a very mysterious
and<00:04:25.900> quite<00:04:26.500> frankly<00:04:26.650> we<00:04:26.950> don't<00:04:27.130> actually<00:04:27.220> know

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
and quite frankly we don't actually know

a<00:04:27.520> lot<00:04:27.880> of<00:04:27.910> solid<00:04:28.390> evidence<00:04:28.450> towards<00:04:29.050> his<00:04:29.380> pink

guy so I think we need a lot of
questions<00:04:31.420> answered<00:04:31.720> in<00:04:31.840> regards<00:04:32.530> to<00:04:32.590> that

once<00:04:35.260> again<00:04:35.350> another<00:04:35.860> interest<00:04:36.370> in<00:04:36.610> theory

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
once again another interest in theory

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.790 
once again another interest in theory
fuel<00:04:37.180> this<00:04:37.540> one<00:04:37.750> was<00:04:37.870> discussing<00:04:38.260> if<00:04:38.530> in<00:04:38.680> the
