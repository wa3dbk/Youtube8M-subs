00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
as kind of developing how much better

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.779 
as kind of developing how much better
have<00:00:16.920> you<00:00:17.010> gotten<00:00:17.220> from<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.430> time<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.670> got

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
have you gotten from the time you got

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.880 
have you gotten from the time you got
here<00:00:17.850> until<00:00:18.090> now<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.660> lot<00:00:19.199> better<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:19.529> mean<00:00:19.680> the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
here until now a lot better I mean the

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.279 
here until now a lot better I mean the
thing<00:00:20.250> that's<00:00:20.400> been<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.910> biggest<00:00:21.420> area

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
thing that's been the biggest area

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.750 
thing that's been the biggest area
improvement<00:00:22.650> for<00:00:22.769> me<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:22.980> just<00:00:23.160> like<00:00:23.279> the

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
improvement for me is just like the

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.120 
improvement for me is just like the
mental<00:00:24.119> aspect<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.779> obviously<00:00:24.900> my<00:00:25.350> you

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
mental aspect of it obviously my you

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.009 
mental aspect of it obviously my you
know<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.250> came<00:00:26.580> in<00:00:26.699> pretty<00:00:26.910> good<00:00:27.689> at<00:00:27.840> snapping

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
know I came in pretty good at snapping

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.410 
know I came in pretty good at snapping
when<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.380> first<00:00:28.590> got<00:00:28.740> here<00:00:28.920> but<00:00:29.099> just<00:00:29.420> advancing

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
when I first got here but just advancing

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.759 
when I first got here but just advancing
the<00:00:30.539> mental<00:00:30.840> aspect<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.380> was<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.590> most

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
the mental aspect of it was the most

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.290 
the mental aspect of it was the most
important<00:00:32.189> part<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.460> me<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.730> was<00:00:32.880> I've

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
important part to me and I was I've

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.850 
important part to me and I was I've
gotten<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> lot<00:00:33.780> better<00:00:33.899> at<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.140> okay<00:00:34.620> well

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
gotten a lot better at that okay well

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.229 
gotten a lot better at that okay well
you<00:00:34.950> can<00:00:35.160> do<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.399> but<00:00:35.700> can<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.940> teach<00:00:36.210> it

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
you can do it but can you teach it

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
it now for four and a half years gotcha

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.400

hopefully what see hopefully we get a

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.840 
hopefully what see hopefully we get a
lot<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.260> sorry<00:00:46.590> Scott<00:00:47.219> let's<00:00:47.520> do<00:00:47.640> this

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
lot of that sorry Scott let's do this

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.029 
lot of that sorry Scott let's do this
teach<00:00:48.059> me<00:00:48.210> on<00:00:48.270> long<00:00:48.480> snap<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:48.989> got<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.530> field

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
teach me on long snap I got you field

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.950 
teach me on long snap I got you field
goal<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.309> usually<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.760> easier<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.390> two

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
goal is usually the easier of the two

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.459 
goal is usually the easier of the two
it's<00:00:52.350> more<00:00:52.590> mental<00:00:53.219> than<00:00:53.510> technical<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:54.899> all

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
it's more mental than technical so all

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.590 
it's more mental than technical so all
you<00:00:55.649> got<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.890> do<00:00:56.010> with<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.370> field<00:00:57.090> or<00:00:57.300> PA<00:00:57.510> t

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
you got to do with the field or PA t

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.650 
you got to do with the field or PA t
snap<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.320> kind<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.160> just<00:00:59.340> so<00:00:59.789> I<00:01:00.300> like<00:01:00.390> what<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.539> do

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
snap is kind of just so I like what I do

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.080 
snap is kind of just so I like what I do
is<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:00.989> come<00:01:01.170> over<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> ball<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.890> get<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.820> wider

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
is I come over the ball I get a wider

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.490 
is I come over the ball I get a wider
base<00:01:03.359> because<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.780> might<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.140> don't<00:01:04.170> need<00:01:04.409> as

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
base because I might I don't need as

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.289 
base because I might I don't need as
much<00:01:04.619> power<00:01:04.890> around<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.189> snap<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.760> then<00:01:06.210> I

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
much power around the snap and then I

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.270 
much power around the snap and then I
just<00:01:06.479> ripped<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.750> ball<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.229> did<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.189> I'm

that one away that at least have a

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.930 
that one away that at least have a
spiral<00:02:34.440> on<00:02:34.800> that<00:02:34.980> one<00:02:35.130> it<00:02:35.280> did<00:02:35.460> yeah<00:02:35.670> that's

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
spiral on that one it did yeah that's

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.660 
spiral on that one it did yeah that's
far<00:02:36.180> away<00:02:36.270> at<00:02:36.810> least<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.080> look<00:02:37.230> good<00:02:37.640> yeah<00:02:38.640> I

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
far away at least the look good yeah I

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.220 
far away at least the look good yeah I
look<00:02:38.850> pretty<00:02:39.120> just<00:02:39.330> one<00:02:39.420> about<00:02:39.630> 90<00:02:39.930> yards<00:02:40.050> the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
look pretty just one about 90 yards the

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.190 
look pretty just one about 90 yards the
other<00:02:40.290> way<00:02:40.470> all<00:02:40.650> right<00:02:40.740> let's<00:02:41.460> try<00:02:41.640> that<00:02:41.730> again

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
other way all right let's try that again

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.960 
other way all right let's try that again
let's<00:02:43.200> try<00:02:43.320> that<00:02:43.500> again

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
let's try that again

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.340 
let's try that again
so<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.090> aiming<00:02:45.540> point<00:02:45.570> should<00:02:46.020> be<00:02:46.110> right<00:02:46.320> here

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
so the aiming point should be right here

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.040 
so the aiming point should be right here
at<00:02:46.680> my<00:02:46.800> knee<00:02:46.860> or<00:02:47.370> where<00:02:47.820> my<00:02:47.850> hand<00:02:48.240> is<00:02:48.480> whatever

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
at my knee or where my hand is whatever

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.600 
at my knee or where my hand is whatever
whatever<00:02:49.290> one<00:02:49.470> is<00:02:49.710> more<00:02:49.980> easier<00:02:50.250> for<00:02:50.490> you<00:02:50.580> to

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
whatever one is more easier for you to

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.449 
whatever one is more easier for you to
grow<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.300> grow<00:02:51.660> I<00:02:52.170> didn't<00:02:52.740> aim<00:02:52.860> that<00:02:53.040> last<00:02:53.280> one
