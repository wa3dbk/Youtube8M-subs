something<00:00:29.419> like<00:00:29.539> this<00:00:29.839> with<00:00:30.320> all<00:00:30.439> these

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:30.589 
something like this with all these

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.069 
something like this with all these
graphics<00:00:31.189> on<00:00:31.339> a<00:00:31.369> on<00:00:31.640> a<00:00:31.820> graphics<00:00:32.300> card<00:00:32.360> but<00:00:32.990> on

graphics on a on a graphics card but on
a<00:00:33.140> motherboard<00:00:33.470> you<00:00:33.829> know<00:00:33.950> that<00:00:34.280> sort<00:00:34.520> of<00:00:34.550> says

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
a motherboard you know that sort of says

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.830 
a motherboard you know that sort of says
to<00:00:34.940> me<00:00:35.060> that<00:00:35.090> this<00:00:35.360> is<00:00:35.510> going<00:00:35.630> to<00:00:35.690> be

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
to me that this is going to be

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.229 
to me that this is going to be
absolutely<00:00:36.280> brilliant<00:00:37.280> so<00:00:37.489> just<00:00:37.940> looking<00:00:38.149> at

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
absolutely brilliant so just looking at

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:39.610 
absolutely brilliant so just looking at
the<00:00:38.329> front<00:00:38.539> of<00:00:38.660> the<00:00:38.750> box<00:00:38.870> we<00:00:39.050> can<00:00:39.199> see<00:00:39.379> it's<00:00:39.500> got

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
the front of the box we can see it's got

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.799 
the front of the box we can see it's got
the<00:00:39.800> foxconn<00:00:40.460> logo<00:00:40.850> and<00:00:41.090> it's<00:00:41.210> got<00:00:41.390> quantum

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
the foxconn logo and it's got quantum

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.049 
the foxconn logo and it's got quantum
force<00:00:42.020> just<00:00:42.710> having<00:00:42.920> a<00:00:42.980> little<00:00:43.100> bit<00:00:43.280> of<00:00:43.340> a<00:00:43.520> look

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
force just having a little bit of a look

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.060 
force just having a little bit of a look
into<00:00:44.270> the<00:00:44.600> whole<00:00:44.750> foxconn<00:00:45.289> range<00:00:45.530> quantum

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
into the whole foxconn range quantum

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.830 
into the whole foxconn range quantum
force<00:00:46.219> seems<00:00:46.550> to<00:00:46.699> be<00:00:46.820> what<00:00:47.570> they're<00:00:47.690> actually

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
force seems to be what they're actually

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.150 
force seems to be what they're actually
running<00:00:48.199> with<00:00:48.410> with<00:00:48.590> these<00:00:48.770> motherboards

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
running with with these motherboards

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.970 
running with with these motherboards
it's<00:00:49.520> all<00:00:50.120> part<00:00:50.359> of<00:00:50.510> the<00:00:51.199> actual<00:00:51.469> chipset<00:00:51.949> and

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
it's all part of the actual chipset and

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.459 
it's all part of the actual chipset and
the<00:00:52.219> heatsink<00:00:52.879> cooling<00:00:53.300> but<00:00:54.019> we<00:00:54.109> will<00:00:54.260> talk

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
looked at in the past you get all these

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.600 
looked at in the past you get all these
graphics<00:01:42.680> and<00:01:42.830> all<00:01:42.920> these<00:01:43.040> great<00:01:43.190> things<00:01:43.250> on

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
graphics and all these great things on

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.710 
graphics and all these great things on
the<00:01:43.670> front<00:01:43.940> but<00:01:44.120> then<00:01:44.210> you<00:01:44.300> look<00:01:44.420> at<00:01:44.540> the<00:01:44.600> back

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
the front but then you look at the back

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.960 
the front but then you look at the back
and<00:01:44.750> it's<00:01:44.990> boring<00:01:45.170> but<00:01:45.440> this<00:01:45.770> is<00:01:46.100> actually<00:01:46.520> an

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
and it's boring but this is actually an

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.940 
and it's boring but this is actually an
exception<00:01:47.570> to<00:01:47.690> that<00:01:47.720> rule<00:01:47.990> on<00:01:48.230> the<00:01:48.590> back<00:01:48.770> it

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
exception to that rule on the back it

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.380 
exception to that rule on the back it
does<00:01:49.160> give<00:01:49.370> you<00:01:49.490> a<00:01:49.520> lot<00:01:49.700> of<00:01:49.790> information<00:01:50.270> and

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
does give you a lot of information and

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.480 
does give you a lot of information and
is<00:01:50.510> still<00:01:50.690> sort<00:01:51.110> of<00:01:51.170> bright<00:01:51.380> colorful<00:01:52.310> and

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
is still sort of bright colorful and

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.280 
is still sort of bright colorful and
does<00:01:52.970> look<00:01:53.150> quite<00:01:53.360> mean<00:01:53.630> once<00:01:53.870> again<00:01:54.140> with<00:01:54.260> a

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
does look quite mean once again with a

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.380 
does look quite mean once again with a
flaming<00:01:54.620> blade<00:01:55.010> up<00:01:55.370> there<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:55.790> quantum<00:01:56.180> force

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
flaming blade up there the quantum force

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.780 
flaming blade up there the quantum force
net<00:01:56.990> web<00:01:57.200> site<00:01:57.440> address<00:01:57.560> and<00:01:57.920> a<00:01:58.340> picture<00:01:58.550> of

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
net web site address and a picture of

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.340 
net web site address and a picture of
the<00:01:58.910> motherboard<00:01:59.390> which<00:01:59.660> I<00:01:59.780> really<00:02:00.110> like<00:02:00.260> the

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
the motherboard which I really like the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.660 
the motherboard which I really like the
color<00:02:00.530> scheme<00:02:00.680> on<00:02:00.920> this<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:01.220> red<00:02:01.430> and<00:02:01.610> the

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
color scheme on this the red and the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.160 
color scheme on this the red and the
black<00:02:01.910> I<00:02:02.150> just<00:02:02.480> think<00:02:02.570> it<00:02:02.750> works<00:02:02.960> really

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
black I just think it works really

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.920 
black I just think it works really
really<00:02:03.530> well<00:02:03.800> and<00:02:04.610> also<00:02:04.910> underneath<00:02:05.480> it<00:02:05.810> you

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
really well and also underneath it you

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.360 
really well and also underneath it you
can<00:02:06.080> see<00:02:06.230> some<00:02:06.470> of<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.620> main<00:02:06.770> features<00:02:06.800> so

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
can see some of the main features so

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.680 
can see some of the main features so
like<00:02:07.820> we<00:02:07.910> already<00:02:08.090> spoke<00:02:08.270> about<00:02:08.330> is

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
like we already spoke about is

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
panel separate but it is something to

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.170 
panel separate but it is something to
think<00:03:12.890> about<00:03:13.010> if<00:03:13.400> you<00:03:13.550> are<00:03:13.700> going<00:03:13.970> to<00:03:14.090> get

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
think about if you are going to get

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.700 
think about if you are going to get
something<00:03:14.570> like<00:03:14.720> this<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:15.080> now<00:03:15.350> technically

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
something like this and now technically

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.110 
something like this and now technically
to<00:03:15.830> look<00:03:15.950> at<00:03:16.070> the<00:03:16.160> side<00:03:16.370> of<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.640> box<00:03:16.760> we<00:03:16.970> can

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
to look at the side of the box we can

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.210 
to look at the side of the box we can
see<00:03:17.330> once<00:03:17.720> again<00:03:17.840> flaming<00:03:18.470> blade<00:03:18.680> quantum

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
see once again flaming blade quantum

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.310 
see once again flaming blade quantum
force<00:03:19.400> net<00:03:19.880> and<00:03:20.030> then<00:03:20.330> in<00:03:20.480> various<00:03:21.170> different

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
force net and then in various different

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.810 
force net and then in various different
languages<00:03:21.950> it<00:03:22.160> talks<00:03:22.430> us<00:03:22.580> through<00:03:22.610> to

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
languages it talks us through to

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.280 
languages it talks us through to
specification<00:03:23.630> so<00:03:23.780> if<00:03:23.870> we<00:03:23.959> look<00:03:24.020> at<00:03:24.170> the

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
specification so if we look at the

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.530 
specification so if we look at the
English<00:03:24.530> specifications<00:03:25.090> it<00:03:26.090> says<00:03:26.300> it's

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
really excited about this motherboard so

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.740 
really excited about this motherboard so
let's<00:04:30.860> open<00:04:31.100> it<00:04:31.190> up<00:04:31.310> so<00:04:32.120> to<00:04:32.180> open<00:04:32.510> up<00:04:32.600> this<00:04:32.690> box

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
let's open it up so to open up this box

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.240 
let's open it up so to open up this box
we<00:04:33.080> can<00:04:33.200> see<00:04:33.320> it's<00:04:33.410> got<00:04:33.500> a<00:04:33.560> carrying<00:04:33.889> handle<00:04:33.919> on

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
we can see it's got a carrying handle on

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.640 
we can see it's got a carrying handle on
the<00:04:34.340> top<00:04:34.520> so<00:04:34.790> it's<00:04:34.970> just<00:04:35.060> a<00:04:35.210> matter<00:04:35.240> of<00:04:35.650> opening

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
the top so it's just a matter of opening

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.280 
the top so it's just a matter of opening
this<00:04:37.040> part<00:04:37.280> of<00:04:37.340> the<00:04:37.400> box<00:04:37.550> and<00:04:37.930> then<00:04:38.930> you<00:04:39.050> can

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
this part of the box and then you can

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.629 
this part of the box and then you can
open<00:04:40.190> this<00:04:40.310> flap<00:04:40.720> open<00:04:41.720> that<00:04:41.870> flap<00:04:42.169> and<00:04:42.639> open

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
open this flap open that flap and open

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:44.980 
open this flap open that flap and open
up<00:04:43.700> the<00:04:43.790> Box<00:04:44.000> in<00:04:44.210> its<00:04:44.330> side<00:04:44.480> we<00:04:44.600> can<00:04:44.750> see<00:04:44.780> that

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
up the Box in its side we can see that

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.350 
up the Box in its side we can see that
we've<00:04:45.110> actually<00:04:45.260> got<00:04:45.500> two<00:04:45.800> boxes<00:04:46.160> so<00:04:46.430> we<00:04:47.120> start

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
we've actually got two boxes so we start

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.659 
we've actually got two boxes so we start
by<00:04:47.450> taking<00:04:47.660> this<00:04:48.200> top<00:04:48.470> one<00:04:48.500> out<00:04:51.430> then<00:04:52.430> we<00:04:52.520> can

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
by taking this top one out then we can

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:54.700 
by taking this top one out then we can
have<00:04:52.790> a<00:04:52.850> look<00:04:53.000> what's<00:04:53.330> inside<00:04:53.510> here<00:04:53.840> so<00:04:54.530> now<00:04:54.650> we

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
have a look what's inside here so now we

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.830 
have a look what's inside here so now we
can<00:04:54.889> continue<00:04:55.310> to<00:04:55.669> open<00:04:56.060> up<00:04:56.150> this<00:04:56.360> box<00:04:56.419> which

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
can continue to open up this box which

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.720 
can continue to open up this box which
yet<00:04:57.410> just<00:04:57.680> dissolves<00:04:58.040> guessing<00:04:58.340> it's<00:04:58.490> full<00:04:58.639> of

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
yet just dissolves guessing it's full of

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.070

should be surgery sellotape can then

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:19.030 
should be surgery sellotape can then
tighten<00:07:17.330> up<00:07:17.479> out<00:07:17.660> of<00:07:17.690> the<00:07:18.169> anti-static<00:07:18.770> bag
