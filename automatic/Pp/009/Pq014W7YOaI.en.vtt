00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 Nine people and welcome to 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.960
 new video today is about the topic 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.420
 android 4 0 4 asp or station with 9 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.010
 at the broker and that is the final 3 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.360
 what I had already uploaded that 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.370
 video how to install it now 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.529
 come as turn one sees of course 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.660
 it runs very smoothly even when locking 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.939
 the same you can whirl around here 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.250
 it depends nothing you can lock out the 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.600
 are camera or simply unlock 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.720
 in the camera and then we can 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:34.140
 First of all, you look the hair goes 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:37.410
 something here is in video mode we have 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.000
 and a panorama mode investors so well 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.950
 if I'm honest you can use the camera 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.140
 not totally forgotten because the whole 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:49.309
 android 4 version because it just hangs 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.329
 too expensive, for example, will go to panorama mode 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.920
 You can totally forget that 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.770
 because that is so when you catch 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.660
 it's done well, you have to stop yourself 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.300
 So , just come now 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.190
 At least we have the normal 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.260
 surface one sees the running very well 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:10.049
 I have six programs right now 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.960
 six programs are running and one is running 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.689
 sees it runs superfluid then 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.400
 clean up the whole time sat down 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.780
 installed is great that android 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.299
 assistant I believe that today known 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.280
 his 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.770
 You can see place horizon wreaths here 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.360
 available apollo hammer on it and great 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:34.049
 user then has the widgets 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.130
 not much changed digital clock and yes 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.930
 what's up there 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.250
 if we now in the settings 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.110
 can show a bit how to 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.990
 example here from above if you almost him 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.610
 in the status bar communities go 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.040
 Settings menu or in the care 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.630
 attitude so now we are menu 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.170
 we have the normal android 4.0 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:59.720
 surface was who because here 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:05.850
 maybe three ice cream sandwiches 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:10.649
 then this funny rain of android 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:13.410
 we see maybe three are victims 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.150
 basis of change so you would notice it 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.320
 runs very smoothly you can 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.390
 overclock 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.710
 we can now here current cpu 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:25.320
 So current cd frequency hammer here 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.570
 what a hundred well he's working with right now 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:32.010
 and we can overclock the whole thing 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:36.180
 on 900 to 1 gigahertz so you me 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:41.880
 would say 844 megahertz rich totally 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:45.510
 From here you can see the mobile phone is working around 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:49.350
 too much megahertz degree so relatively colorful 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.350
 mixed memory management 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.820
 We also can see 26 percent 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.380
 everything is compressed that is 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.370
 For example, if we have 100 megabytes full 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:03.269
 then 26 states will become the new one 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:08.180
 Memory from 100 megabytes to 84 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:10.200
 megabyte then 74 that would turn then 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:15.480
 we can also downgraded 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.739
 disable tools comparison 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.230
 stayed the same 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.670
 her husband john j setting the neither 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.440
 runs relatively smooth data consumption 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.049
 bluetooth works on the launcher 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:30.900
 We can all set apps 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:33.900
 general junk on designs kimba that 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.780
 install other castro teams here 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.220
 for example the galaxy s3 themes or 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.650
 something else that was one here 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.540
 set when we go the system 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.980
 can the status bar a bit 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.959
 seems to show what we want to have 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:51.209
 We have now seen the rest away 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:52.560
 since we can battery status in percent 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:59.070
 we have up here then 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:01.620
 Vollmann battery is notified 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.829
 mistakes can be made then would be here 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.489
 above, for example, one notified 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:07.560
 notifications are down 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:11.840
 but always that is three 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.940
 notification and son krams you can 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.120

 Constantly getting emails every now and then 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:41.280
 We just have espresso backgrounds 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.510
 live wallpaper we have remained face 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.560

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:59.760
