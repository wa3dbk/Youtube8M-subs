here it's a little more comfortable with

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.910 
here it's a little more comfortable with
large<00:01:02.520> moldings<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.920> semi-gloss

got my floor protected smooth it out
it's<00:01:44.899> kind<00:01:45.140> of<00:01:45.170> like<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.530> back<00:01:45.710> strokes<00:01:46.100> when

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
it's kind of like the back strokes when

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.620 
it's kind of like the back strokes when
we<00:01:46.490> were<00:01:46.610> rolling<00:01:47.259> we're<00:01:49.030> after<00:01:50.030> we're<00:01:50.329> happy

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
consistency if it is very difficult and

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.150 
consistency if it is very difficult and
it's<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:12.900> very<00:03:13.320> rough<00:03:14.220> surface<00:03:14.730> there<00:03:16.040> you<00:03:17.040> may

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
it's a very rough surface there you may
