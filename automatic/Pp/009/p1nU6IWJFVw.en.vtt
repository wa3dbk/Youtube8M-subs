00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
hope it doesn't play something else but

00:01:52.829 --> 00:02:00.310 
hope it doesn't play something else but
probably<00:01:53.549> will<00:01:54.590> row<00:01:55.590> thief<00:01:55.969> hmm

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
in or just beat in hopefully I beat in

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.560 
in or just beat in hopefully I beat in
before<00:02:07.520> killing<00:02:07.700> it<00:02:07.909> because<00:02:08.179> then<00:02:08.450> I<00:02:08.509> could

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
before killing it because then I could

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.070 
before killing it because then I could
just<00:02:08.750> trade<00:02:08.929> for<00:02:09.110> both<00:02:09.229> these<00:02:09.380> guys<00:02:10.870> but<00:02:11.870> I

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
will probably miss play here because I

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.490

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
that can draw cards because it is very

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:46.680 
that can draw cards because it is very
annoying<00:02:37.940> when<00:02:38.120> it<00:02:38.300> is<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.510> 24

that but we're not happy with our way of

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.140 
that but we're not happy with our way of
dealing<00:02:53.620> with<00:02:53.770> it<00:02:53.890> it<00:02:54.460> means<00:02:54.640> we<00:02:54.670> had<00:02:54.820> a<00:02:54.880> sack<00:02:55.120> a

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
dealing with it it means we had a sack a

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.730 
dealing with it it means we had a sack a
guy<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.510> kill<00:02:55.870> it<00:02:57.900> but<00:02:58.900> I<00:02:59.170> mean<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.620> obvious

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
fling is 52 a target which means we

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.580 
fling is 52 a target which means we
could<00:03:28.210> just<00:03:28.360> pitch<00:03:28.600> hellhound<00:03:29.020> at<00:03:29.200> him<00:03:29.350> after
