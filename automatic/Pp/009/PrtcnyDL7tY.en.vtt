hi guys here we are with the QA V 400
and<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.480> CC<00:00:04.049> 3d<00:00:04.620> controller<00:00:05.279> I've<00:00:05.670> been

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
and the CC 3d controller I've been

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.150 
and the CC 3d controller I've been
having<00:00:06.450> issues<00:00:06.600> with<00:00:06.810> it<00:00:07.259> pitching

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
having issues with it pitching

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.100 
having issues with it pitching
uncontrolled<00:00:08.849> early<00:00:09.179> to<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.389> right<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:09.870> left

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110

uncontrolled early to the right and left
immediately<00:00:10.980> after<00:00:12.530> liftoff<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:14.750> barely

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
immediately after liftoff and barely

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.519 
immediately after liftoff and barely
lifting<00:00:16.109> off<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:17.240> some<00:00:18.240> guy<00:00:18.390> said<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.900> do<00:00:19.170> the

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
lifting off and some guy said to do the

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.800 
lifting off and some guy said to do the
ESC<00:00:20.250> calibration<00:00:21.029> in<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.210> ground<00:00:21.420> station

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
ESC calibration in the ground station

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.870 
ESC calibration in the ground station
control<00:00:22.170> so<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.470> did<00:00:22.740> all<00:00:22.949> four<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.519> then<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:23.640> did

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
control so I did all four and then I did

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.950 
control so I did all four and then I did
individually<00:00:24.800> so<00:00:25.800> let's<00:00:26.160> see<00:00:26.400> if<00:00:26.609> that

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
individually so let's see if that

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.990 
individually so let's see if that
corrected<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.109> problem<00:00:28.680> or<00:00:29.189> not<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.880> don't

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
corrected the problem or not I don't

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.400 
corrected the problem or not I don't
know<00:00:30.179> if<00:00:30.300> maybe<00:00:30.510> there's<00:00:30.840> something<00:00:31.140> wrong

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
know if maybe there's something wrong

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.650 
know if maybe there's something wrong
with<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.740> gyro<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.369> board<00:00:32.669> that's

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
with the gyro and the board that's

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.770 
with the gyro and the board that's
causing<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:34.800> but<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.370> seems<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.969> be<00:00:36.149> very

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
causing this but it seems to be very

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.229 
causing this but it seems to be very
erratic<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:38.370> can't<00:00:38.579> tell<00:00:38.820> what<00:00:39.030> it's<00:00:39.149> going

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
erratic you can't tell what it's going

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.049 
erratic you can't tell what it's going
to<00:00:39.360> do<00:00:39.540> from<00:00:39.750> one<00:00:39.960> moment<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.440> next

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
to do from one moment to the next

00:00:41.059 --> 00:01:00.580 
to do from one moment to the next
so<00:00:42.059> let's<00:00:42.360> see<00:00:42.600> let's<00:00:43.820> arm<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:48.260> armed

now<00:01:23.790> goes<00:01:24.060> left<00:01:24.360> one<00:01:25.230> is<00:01:25.800> going<00:01:26.040> right<00:01:26.600> next

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
now goes left one is going right next

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:38.750 
now goes left one is going right next
minute<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:27.900> going<00:01:28.050> left<00:01:37.160> there<00:01:38.160> you<00:01:38.340> go

this is no input no input it immediately
goes<00:01:53.160> to<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.610> right<00:01:55.759> no<00:01:56.759> input<00:01:57.180> whatsoever

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
goes to the right no input whatsoever

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.080 
goes to the right no input whatsoever
here<00:01:59.460> we<00:01:59.550> go

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
here we go

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:09.749 
here we go
no<00:02:01.719> input<00:02:07.800> see<00:02:08.800> it<00:02:08.920> wants<00:02:09.220> to<00:02:09.310> go<00:02:09.429> that<00:02:09.580> way

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
no input see it wants to go that way

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.880 
no input see it wants to go that way
then<00:02:10.000> I<00:02:10.810> gave<00:02:10.989> it<00:02:11.140> a<00:02:11.170> little<00:02:11.290> left<00:02:11.560> stick
