00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.219
 how about friends how are i am ryder 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.900
 here I am again with another map and this 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.879
 time with a survival map that is 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.610
 excellent the map is called the four 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.199
 pillars and is made by the friend dj more 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.900
 back that the truth this map what was 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.420
 excellent one of the survival maps 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.730
 that I like that is also 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.830
 based on good pc obviously we have 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.300
 to play in survival mode and for 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.399
 here we will find trunks with 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.960
 wagons so we can get to the 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.329
 game point 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.850
 I'm going to fly away to get more 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.949
 Quick 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.809
 do not worry that this map is not 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.719
 will freeze the console this map is 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.610
 again so they will not have the problem 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.740
 is that the console froze 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.840
 this map is a bit like the sky 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.210
 blog but now they will see the 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.850
 good difference over here we see about 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.800
 Signs with instructions that should 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.910
 continue to be able to climb the island because 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.489
 the extractive island 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.140
 this is like a water lift and it goes 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.580
 we return a block of land this what 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.060
 we have to place when we get 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.060
 above 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.430
 and I could see why they were 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.430
 they call the four pillars 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.079
 over here we see a trunk this trunk we have 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:23.350
 that see the way to power the things that 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:24.880
 there's down because because that's not how 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.959
 we can open we had to do with a 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.539
 platform to be able to open and destroy it 

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:34.240
 Well, as you can see there are trunks for everyone 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.960
 sides in the parts of the spirals of 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.619
 the pillars forgive 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:44.480
 avilÃ©s there is also cactus for her we see 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:46.370
 another trunk I'll show you and then 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.910
 what we have to do is survive 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.760
 It has no challenges in itself but what we have 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.920
 what to do is just survive here 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.190
 minerals, we have it in the 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.800
 pillars as you can see is full of 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.700
 gold iron ore and diamond 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.030
 now we have clay and also sand 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.960
 there is oxidiana because the map is very good 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.270
 what I would do is a platform 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.520
 giant down to start 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.040
 build my house all the things that are 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.200
 they need to survive and well 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.750
 friends I hope you like the map and 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.650
 they know how to leave your comment its like and 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.650
 until next time
