00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.210
 hello friends of gta 5 I am treating you and you 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.910
 I bring a boyfriend to the channel and well 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.770
 today I'm not going to bring you any clichÃ©s or 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.420
 strange trick but good news 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.160
 and that is for many of the lovers of 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.960
 the rare vehicles we can now save 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.350
 a series of vehicles like in this case 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.850
 it's the news car that's good 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.710
 this time I found it in this 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.750
 location that I leave you there on the map 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.640
 but I also know that it is in 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.170
 other sites and at different times in 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.040
 this case I found it approximately 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.020
 at 12 o'clock at night, good as 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.210
 you have seen I have also uploaded today a 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.219
 Video on how to edit vehicles 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.260
 with the computer program as well as 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.059
 You see what I have here is the same 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.120
 tupper form or edited by me if you see 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.370
 of one side is chrome plated and 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.199
 on the other side where the sun hits 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.360
 that the background truth is red in the background 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.789
 a very very cool effect apart from having 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.440
 the green crystals and the tires good 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:09.240
 we are already here on the computer and as 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.070
 you see we are in the program in the know 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.170
 editor so what we have to do is 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.970
 if we want to use the files as 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.200
 the one that I left you in the description what 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.800
 only thing we have to do is come 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.720
 about this button and press it as it is 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.670
 to replace a vehicle in this case 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.890
 as you have seen we had a motorcycle 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.710
 well we choose the course that is the one that 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.400
 has left in the description and we open it 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.310
 it will automatically put us that has 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.590
 been replaced and as you see it changes 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.540
 all the configuration and you put the one on 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.580
 vehicle in question which in this case is 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.470
 the form of all the news so 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.210
 nothing now I will teach you that the 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.740
 vehicle also if you find it in the 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.840
 street can be secured with total 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.120
 normality now what we will do will be 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.190
 proceed to put the insurance to this 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.190
 good van is as simple as 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.600
 approach the saints just put it and 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.240
 put the insurance like any 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.190
 normal vehicle good what yes that you 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.900
 I'm going to say is that this form does not 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.700
 can avoid in any way that is to say 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.250
 we will not be able to do anything in the 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.860
 saints custom neither paint it nor put it 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.690
 tires or anything special so the 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.850
 only option is with the program that you 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.130
 I mentioned earlier and with the 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.660
 file if you want this in particular that 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.460
 I will leave you in the description as 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.470
 mentioned previously well well here 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.880
 like and we put the insurance and what yes 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.440
 what is true is that to keep it in 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.060
 the garage the only thing we have to do 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.100
 is to get to our farm take a 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.570
 vehicle and back 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.760
 that vehicle and automatically the 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.290
 van will appear inside so nothing 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.420
 I hope you liked the video of 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.130

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.130
