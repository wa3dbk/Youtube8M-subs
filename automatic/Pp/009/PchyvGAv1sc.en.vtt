00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.530 
bullet punch I'm just gonna go forward
the<00:06:10.980> thunder<00:06:11.980> wave<00:06:12.130> I<00:06:12.610> don't<00:06:13.060> know<00:06:13.210> why<00:06:13.510> I

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.540 
the thunder wave I don't know why I

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.320 
the thunder wave I don't know why I
won't<00:06:13.780> fit<00:06:13.900> anyway<00:06:14.200> does<00:06:14.500> it<00:06:14.530> really<00:06:14.680> matter<00:06:15.330> I

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
won't fit anyway does it really matter I

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.060 
won't fit anyway does it really matter I
think<00:06:17.050> it's<00:06:17.170> because<00:06:17.260> I<00:06:17.500> didn't<00:06:17.800> notice<00:06:17.920> that

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.070 
think it's because I didn't notice that

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.700 
think it's because I didn't notice that
