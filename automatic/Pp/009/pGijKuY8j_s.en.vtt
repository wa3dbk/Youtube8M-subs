00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
safety mechanisms this top which is

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.540 
safety mechanisms this top which is
where<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.140> put<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.350> beans<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.890> lid<00:00:44.160> has<00:00:44.370> to

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
where you put the beans this lid has to

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.209 
where you put the beans this lid has to
be<00:00:44.640> all<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.910> way<00:00:45.030> down<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.559> then<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.739> hopper

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
be all the way down and then the hopper

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.010 
be all the way down and then the hopper
where<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.670> coffee<00:00:48.030> grinds<00:00:48.450> come<00:00:48.510> out<00:00:48.719> has<00:00:48.989> to

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
where the coffee grinds come out has to

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.170 
where the coffee grinds come out has to
be<00:00:49.230> all<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.530> way<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:49.760> so<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.820> probably<00:00:50.969> knew

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
be all the way in so you probably knew

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.600 
be all the way in so you probably knew
that<00:00:51.210> already<00:00:51.360> however<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.280> brand<00:00:53.520> new

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610

light<00:00:55.770> comes<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:57.559> and<00:00:58.559> then<00:00:58.739> stops<00:00:59.219> just<00:00:59.699> in

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
light comes on and then stops just in

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.010 
light comes on and then stops just in
the<00:00:59.850> middle<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.120> running<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.690> might<00:01:00.840> want

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
the middle of running it you might want

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.630 
the middle of running it you might want
to<00:01:01.079> check<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.530> make<00:01:01.680> sure<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.100> your<00:01:02.250> top<00:01:02.460> is

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.329 
to check to make sure that your top is
on<00:01:02.760> securely<00:01:03.210> as<00:01:03.480> well<00:01:03.660> as<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.899> bottom<00:01:04.220> so<00:01:05.220> if

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
on securely as well as the bottom so if

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.130 
on securely as well as the bottom so if
you<00:01:05.460> found<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.790> video<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.450> probably<00:01:06.600> are

to check on your unit before throwing in

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.570 
to check on your unit before throwing in

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
the towel so I'm going to zoom in a

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.300 
the towel so I'm going to zoom in a
little<00:01:23.700> bit<00:01:23.909> here<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:25.890> first<00:01:26.100> thing<00:01:26.250> I

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
little bit here and the first thing I

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.760 
little bit here and the first thing I
want<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.490> talk<00:01:26.640> about<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.689> lid<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.229> this

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
want to talk about is the lid and this

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.950 
want to talk about is the lid and this
is<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.040> my<00:01:29.159> opinion<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:30.030> biggest<00:01:30.360> fault<00:01:30.780> for

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
is in my opinion the biggest fault for

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.480 
is in my opinion the biggest fault for
this<00:01:31.049> grinder<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.439> think<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:31.890> little<00:01:32.070> sign<00:01:32.369> is

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
this grinder I think this little sign is

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.429 
this grinder I think this little sign is
not<00:01:32.640> super<00:01:32.970> great<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.689> does<00:01:33.900> have<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.229> be<00:01:34.320> all

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
not super great it does have to be all

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.380 
not super great it does have to be all
the<00:01:34.530> way<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.430> way<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.850> works<00:01:36.090> is

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
the way in and the way that it works is

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.859 
the way in and the way that it works is
that<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.950> edges<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:38.759> lid<00:01:39.060> have<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.750> be

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
that the edges of this lid have to be

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.929 
that the edges of this lid have to be
all<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.350> way<00:01:40.470> down<00:01:40.680> inside<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.579> unit<00:01:41.610> back

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
all the way down inside the unit back

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.539 
all the way down inside the unit back
here<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.420> as<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.170> can<00:01:43.290> see<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.250> sort<00:01:44.490> of

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
here and as you can see this is sort of

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.990 
here and as you can see this is sort of
started<00:01:45.329> cracking<00:01:45.570> already<00:01:46.520> due<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.700> stress

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
started cracking already due to stress

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.609 
started cracking already due to stress
and<00:01:48.030> just<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.630> know<00:01:48.720> pushing<00:01:49.049> down<00:01:49.259> on<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.500> all

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
and just you know pushing down on it all

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.130 
and just you know pushing down on it all
the<00:01:49.710> time<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.479> it's<00:01:51.479> just<00:01:51.540> sort<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.869> split

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
the time and it's just sort of split

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.810 
the time and it's just sort of split

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
you'll be able to see this but the piece

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.360 
you'll be able to see this but the piece
that<00:02:49.630> broke<00:02:49.750> my<00:02:50.020> grinder<00:02:50.440> or<00:02:50.920> kept<00:02:51.160> it<00:02:51.280> from

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
that broke my grinder or kept it from

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.250 
that broke my grinder or kept it from
working<00:02:51.700> was<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.360> little<00:02:52.690> bit<00:02:52.810> smaller<00:02:53.050> than

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
working was a little bit smaller than

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.410 
working was a little bit smaller than
this<00:02:53.410> and<00:02:53.710> it<00:02:54.100> was<00:02:54.190> really<00:02:54.220> flat<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:54.910> hard<00:02:55.270> to

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
this and it was really flat and hard to

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.180 
this and it was really flat and hard to
see<00:02:55.450> because<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:56.170> inside<00:02:56.560> of<00:02:56.740> this<00:02:56.860> grinder

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
see because the inside of this grinder

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.390 
see because the inside of this grinder
is<00:02:57.310> black<00:02:57.550> so<00:02:58.300> use<00:02:58.660> that<00:02:58.840> tool<00:02:59.070> the<00:03:00.070> second

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
is black so use that tool the second

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.700 
is black so use that tool the second
thing<00:03:00.520> that<00:03:00.550> you'll<00:03:00.940> have<00:03:01.120> to<00:03:01.240> do

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
thing that you'll have to do

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.950 
thing that you'll have to do
periodically<00:03:02.710> is<00:03:03.010> clean<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:04.060> dispenser

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
periodically is clean the dispenser

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.380 
periodically is clean the dispenser

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
little hard to see it might be a little

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:18.840

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
here looks like a complete rectangle but

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.780 
here looks like a complete rectangle but
it's<00:03:26.230> actually<00:03:26.530> not<00:03:26.680> it's<00:03:26.920> sort<00:03:27.220> of<00:03:27.280> at<00:03:27.670> an

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
units broken but it actually isn't if

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.470

this<00:04:05.200> area<00:04:05.530> is<00:04:05.680> impacted<00:04:06.400> it<00:04:06.820> will<00:04:07.060> sound<00:04:07.300> like

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
this area is impacted it will sound like

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.660 
this area is impacted it will sound like
the<00:04:07.780> motor<00:04:07.989> struggling<00:04:08.500> really<00:04:08.650> hard<00:04:08.770> and<00:04:09.250> it

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
the motor struggling really hard and it

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.000 
the motor struggling really hard and it
won't<00:04:09.820> grind<00:04:10.000> anything<00:04:10.480> so<00:04:11.080> you'll<00:04:11.560> have<00:04:11.739> to

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
won't grind anything so you'll have to

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.420 
won't grind anything so you'll have to
take<00:04:12.580> the<00:04:12.640> hopper<00:04:12.970> out<00:04:13.090> and<00:04:13.500> clean<00:04:14.500> it<00:04:14.530> that's
