00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.780
 detail that has escaped them in the 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.569
 bottom right of the screen 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.629

 you know the arclight installations 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.510
 research facility a title that posts 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.860
 to the being of the origins of the saga in the 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.710
 that we will have the possibility of 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.830
 control two different characters 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.140
 being able to alternate between one and the other 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.290

 the first installment of the saga

 capcom could have decided to do what 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.110

 Resident remake just as good 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:51.670
 it would almost be not all this could be a 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:55.300
 assembly of the capcom itself as good 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.120
