00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
same size that tells you what size the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.770 
same size that tells you what size the
artichoke<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.670> an<00:00:29.960> 18<00:00:30.960> count<00:00:31.669> artichoke<00:00:32.669> is

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
artichoke is an 18 count artichoke is

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.580 
artichoke is an 18 count artichoke is
bigger<00:00:33.780> than<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.290> 24<00:00:34.829> counts<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.700> 36

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
bigger than a 24 counts and a 36

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.209 
bigger than a 24 counts and a 36
obviously<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.710> smaller<00:00:38.070> than<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.340> 24<00:00:38.850> ok<00:00:39.270> so

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
obviously is smaller than a 24 ok so

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.580 
obviously is smaller than a 24 ok so
there's<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.579> few<00:00:42.059> different<00:00:42.450> ways<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:43.260> one

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
there's a few different ways that one

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.060 
there's a few different ways that one
can<00:00:43.890> trim<00:00:44.700> or<00:00:45.030> prepare<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.899> artichoke<00:00:46.500> for

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
can trim or prepare the artichoke for

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.529 
can trim or prepare the artichoke for
boiling<00:00:47.430> which<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:48.000> what<00:00:48.120> we're<00:00:48.210> going<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.390> do

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
boiling which is what we're going to do

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.900 
boiling which is what we're going to do
today<00:00:48.829> but<00:00:49.829> I'm<00:00:50.039> going<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.250> simplify<00:00:50.670> this

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
today but I'm going to simplify this

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.000 
today but I'm going to simplify this
particular<00:00:51.629> demonstration<00:00:52.260> with<00:00:52.860> this

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
particular demonstration with this

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.860 
particular demonstration with this
artichoke<00:00:53.370> by<00:00:53.760> telling<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.629> can

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
artichoke by telling you that you can

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.979 
artichoke by telling you that you can
cut<00:00:55.940> come<00:00:56.940> on<00:00:57.030> down<00:00:57.239> here<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.480> zoom<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.870> on

cut come on down here and zoom in on

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.799 
cut come on down here and zoom in on
this<00:00:58.109> artichoke<00:00:58.710> now<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.670> cut<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.180> top<00:01:00.510> of

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
this artichoke now you cut the top of

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.470 
this artichoke now you cut the top of
the<00:01:00.989> choke<00:01:01.260> off<00:01:01.530> right<00:01:02.309> here<00:01:02.609> that's<00:01:02.969> just<00:01:03.239> so

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
the choke off right here that's just so

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.780 
the choke off right here that's just so
that<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.780> water<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.559> boiling<00:01:05.159> water<00:01:05.309> can

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
that the water in the boiling water can

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.609 
that the water in the boiling water can
get<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.090> there<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.720> want<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.960> leave<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.350> stem

going to time he lapses and we'll be

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.580 
going to time he lapses and we'll be
back<00:02:44.650> in<00:02:44.730> probably<00:02:45.730> 15<00:02:46.239> minutes<00:02:46.569> also<00:02:47.379> known

or take on the choke and pretty sure
that<00:02:56.590> this<00:02:56.709> choke<00:02:56.980> is<00:02:57.160> done<00:02:57.400> I'm<00:02:57.790> going<00:02:57.910> to

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
that this choke is done I'm going to

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.319 
that this choke is done I'm going to
begin<00:02:58.120> by<00:02:58.540> giving<00:02:59.379> these<00:02:59.650> plates<00:03:00.129> that<00:03:01.000> I<00:03:01.060> put

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
begin by giving these plates that I put

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:08.990 
begin by giving these plates that I put
on<00:03:01.480> here<00:03:01.690> off<00:03:01.900> of<00:03:01.930> there<00:03:06.959> I've<00:03:07.959> kept<00:03:08.379> the<00:03:08.530> choke

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
on here off of there I've kept the choke

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.360 
on here off of there I've kept the choke
submerge<00:03:10.000> throughout<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.629> cooking<00:03:10.810> process

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
submerge throughout the cooking process

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.580 
submerge throughout the cooking process
now<00:03:13.319> how<00:03:14.319> to<00:03:14.379> test<00:03:14.890> the<00:03:15.280> choke<00:03:15.579> for<00:03:15.940> doneness

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
now how to test the choke for doneness

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.870 
now how to test the choke for doneness
testing<00:03:17.590> an<00:03:17.680> artichoke<00:03:17.919> for<00:03:18.310> doneness<00:03:18.519> is<00:03:18.819> a

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
testing an artichoke for doneness is a

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.539 
testing an artichoke for doneness is a
little<00:03:19.329> bit<00:03:19.510> like<00:03:20.169> testing<00:03:20.680> a<00:03:20.769> chicken<00:03:21.340> for

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
little bit like testing a chicken for

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.479 
little bit like testing a chicken for
doneness<00:03:21.790> ok<00:03:22.299> meaning<00:03:23.109> you<00:03:23.500> go<00:03:23.769> to<00:03:23.829> the<00:03:24.160> part

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
doneness ok meaning you go to the part

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.940 
doneness ok meaning you go to the part
of<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:24.849> artichoke<00:03:25.450> that<00:03:25.959> takes<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.470> longest

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
of the artichoke that takes the longest

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.030 
of the artichoke that takes the longest
to<00:03:27.250> cook<00:03:27.299> when<00:03:28.299> that's<00:03:28.450> done<00:03:28.690> it's<00:03:29.169> done<00:03:29.440> just

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
to cook when that's done it's done just

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.409 
to cook when that's done it's done just
like<00:03:30.190> when<00:03:30.280> you<00:03:30.310> chat<00:03:30.609> test<00:03:30.819> the<00:03:30.940> chicken<00:03:31.299> you

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:31.419 
like when you chat test the chicken you

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.330 
like when you chat test the chicken you
go<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:31.599> the<00:03:31.750> base<00:03:31.959> of<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:32.290> thigh<00:03:32.560> and<00:03:33.129> when

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
go to the base of the thigh and when

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.670 
go to the base of the thigh and when
that's<00:03:33.459> cooked<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.389> whole<00:03:34.450> chickens<00:03:34.870> go<00:03:35.019> so

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
that's cooked the whole chickens go so

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.009 
that's cooked the whole chickens go so
the<00:03:36.310> bottom<00:03:36.760> of<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.060> artichoke<00:03:37.569> which<00:03:37.840> is

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
the bottom of the artichoke which is

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.000 
the bottom of the artichoke which is
located<00:03:38.230> right<00:03:38.620> at<00:03:38.859> the<00:03:39.220> base<00:03:39.400> of<00:03:39.459> this<00:03:39.790> stem

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
located right at the base of this stem

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.670 
located right at the base of this stem
has<00:03:42.010> to<00:03:42.280> be<00:03:42.400> tender<00:03:42.760> enough<00:03:42.790> to<00:03:43.090> eat<00:03:43.299> and<00:03:43.930> it<00:03:44.560> is

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
has to be tender enough to eat and it is

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.319 
has to be tender enough to eat and it is
it's<00:03:44.889> often<00:03:45.340> up<00:03:45.430> now<00:03:45.639> we're<00:03:46.180> going<00:03:46.269> to

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
it's often up now we're going to

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.069 
it's often up now we're going to
submerge<00:03:46.810> this<00:03:47.139> choke<00:03:48.810> into<00:03:49.810> an<00:03:49.930> ice<00:03:50.049> bath

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
submerge this choke into an ice bath

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.050 
submerge this choke into an ice bath
then<00:03:50.620> we're<00:03:50.739> going<00:03:50.829> to<00:03:50.919> have<00:03:51.040> to<00:03:51.160> time<00:03:51.459> elapsed

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
then we're going to have to time elapsed

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.819 
then we're going to have to time elapsed
this<00:03:52.209> video<00:03:52.569> a<00:03:52.629> little<00:03:52.870> longer<00:03:53.079> because<00:03:53.620> it

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
this video a little longer because it

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.369 
this video a little longer because it
takes<00:03:54.010> about<00:03:54.220> 15<00:03:55.060> minutes<00:03:55.230> for<00:03:56.230> that

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
takes about 15 minutes for that

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.860 
takes about 15 minutes for that
artichoke<00:03:56.709> to<00:03:57.190> for<00:03:57.609> the<00:03:57.730> ice<00:03:57.970> cold<00:03:58.299> water<00:03:58.419> to

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
artichoke to for the ice cold water to

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.020 
artichoke to for the ice cold water to
penetrate<00:03:59.019> that<00:03:59.500> artichoke<00:03:59.799> okay<00:04:00.310> then<00:04:00.940> I'm

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030

better<00:06:11.030> for<00:06:11.360> it<00:06:11.419> to<00:06:11.510> be<00:06:11.630> cooked<00:06:11.930> a<00:06:12.050> little<00:06:12.169> too

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
better for it to be cooked a little too

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.830 
better for it to be cooked a little too
much<00:06:12.830> than<00:06:13.220> a<00:06:13.250> little<00:06:13.760> bit<00:06:13.970> not<00:06:14.510> enough

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
much than a little bit not enough

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.659 
much than a little bit not enough
because<00:06:15.500> a<00:06:15.650> little<00:06:15.979> bit<00:06:16.099> not<00:06:16.280> enough<00:06:16.520> we'll

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:16.669 
because a little bit not enough we'll

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:18.790 
because a little bit not enough we'll
make<00:06:16.789> it<00:06:16.820> inedible<00:06:17.389> a<00:06:17.840> little<00:06:18.349> bit<00:06:18.470> too<00:06:18.620> much

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
make it inedible a little bit too much

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.310 
make it inedible a little bit too much
it's<00:06:19.370> the<00:06:19.520> difference<00:06:19.849> between<00:06:19.940> a<00:06:20.510> real<00:06:21.139> al

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:21.320 
it's the difference between a real al

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.290 
it's the difference between a real al
dente<00:06:21.770> artichoke<00:06:22.699> and<00:06:22.849> one<00:06:22.970> that's<00:06:23.120> really

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
dente artichoke and one that's really

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.300 
dente artichoke and one that's really
tender<00:06:23.750> okay<00:06:24.110> and<00:06:24.440> they're<00:06:24.590> both<00:06:24.800> more<00:06:25.190> or

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310 
tender okay and they're both more or

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.610 
tender okay and they're both more or
less<00:06:25.430> acceptable<00:06:26.139> well<00:06:27.139> the<00:06:27.199> raw<00:06:27.380> artichoke

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
less acceptable well the raw artichoke

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.560 
less acceptable well the raw artichoke
is<00:06:27.979> not<00:06:28.310> acceptable<00:06:28.729> okay<00:06:29.770> so<00:06:30.970> there<00:06:31.970> is<00:06:32.330> the

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:32.570 
is not acceptable okay so there is the

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.779 
is not acceptable okay so there is the
bottom<00:06:32.990> of<00:06:33.199> the<00:06:33.440> choke<00:06:33.680> okay<00:06:34.039> and<00:06:34.460> we'll<00:06:34.580> put

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:34.789 
bottom of the choke okay and we'll put

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:37.930 
bottom of the choke okay and we'll put
the<00:06:34.909> bottom<00:06:35.300> of<00:06:35.450> the<00:06:35.539> choke<00:06:36.070> on<00:06:37.070> a<00:06:37.370> plate<00:06:37.669> there

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940 
the bottom of the choke on a plate there

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.420 
the bottom of the choke on a plate there
okay

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
okay

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:44.760 
okay
now<00:06:41.370> inside<00:06:42.370> this<00:06:42.670> heart<00:06:43.170> are<00:06:44.170> some<00:06:44.500> really

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:44.770 
now inside this heart are some really

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:51.530 
now inside this heart are some really
prickly<00:06:45.460> purple<00:06:46.000> leaves<00:06:46.210> and<00:06:46.660> they<00:06:46.810> come<00:06:47.050> out

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:51.540 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.290 

part<00:06:52.540> of<00:06:52.630> that's<00:06:52.750> good<00:06:53.050> but<00:06:53.940> not<00:06:54.940> too<00:06:54.970> many

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.300 
part of that's good but not too many

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.850 
part of that's good but not too many
parts<00:06:55.570> of<00:06:55.660> it<00:06:55.750> there's<00:06:56.230> some<00:06:56.440> more<00:06:56.560> pink

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:56.860 
parts of it there's some more pink

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.490 
parts of it there's some more pink
quickly<00:06:57.280> leaves<00:06:57.490> on<00:06:57.700> that<00:06:57.850> one<00:06:58.140> so<00:06:59.140> here's<00:06:59.350> how

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.500 
quickly leaves on that one so here's how

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.680 
quickly leaves on that one so here's how
I<00:06:59.530> would<00:06:59.790> break<00:07:00.790> it<00:07:00.910> down<00:07:01.060> and<00:07:01.240> serve<00:07:01.420> it<00:07:01.480> if<00:07:01.600> I

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:01.690 
I would break it down and serve it if I

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.280

wanted to serve it cold I would put the

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:15.679 
wanted to serve it cold I would put the
heart<00:07:05.860> leaves<00:07:08.190> around<00:07:09.190> the<00:07:09.670> bottom
