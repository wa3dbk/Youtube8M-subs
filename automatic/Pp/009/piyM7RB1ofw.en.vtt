00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.160
 we greet everyone so here I am using the frame of the 24 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.159
 August 

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:12.589
 Abbé Pierre 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:15.589
 for the last pretty white china 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.990
 m 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.520
 always i'm good 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.250
 4 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.380
 that's why the first year 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.380
 step for this first place yesterday 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.820
 then I get the plate of 30 elected arsenal collected icecool two 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.180
 losses 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.180
 who is on the website like 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.050
 and so we will stick the little flowers 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.160
 ap ap 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.160
 and I also recover from all the holidays 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.070
 but to always place it the same 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.360
 So I do not know what it's going to be like 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.240
 we test 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.270
 according to hugues duboscq a little sweet tea a little too 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.320
 very light and very discreet 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:17.859
 perhaps 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:22.779
 his target 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.219
 m 

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:54.369
 m 

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:06.199
 at the approach of the recover the scorer crime 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:08.159
 in the arsenal 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.159
 people to come 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.209
 I will go back inside the petals 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.639
 n st-p 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.639
 I wanted to resume the land lobby 

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:59.229
 there is not enough gold in the details 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:02.229
 no in the possible services 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.579
 totality 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.079
 so that's what gives it close 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.879
 less alarmist 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:27.879
 for the continuation the continuation and then 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.900
 I recovered my share anyway I also recovered small rhinestones 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:35.659
 when we find it's because it's a goal and a pass but it's 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.610
 he never sleeps doubted port-au-prince 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.110
 doctor who the pointy of collar for a breed specialist glitter 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.400
 8 then 10 sec 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.580
 boiling 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:05:00.279
 why he thought himself 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.919
 so work 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.919
 in the middle of the flowers 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.960
 xx tournis 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.139
 want to 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.610
 that's what gives it for this decor 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:47.349
 for the gap the first match from peggy saïdi 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:51.960
 it's a tribute why so many sparkle the mattress 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.529
 it will serve more than anything 

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:56.529
 for places it was 30 and we need to 

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:00.999
 define I am more 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.780
 the TV screen of 30m 10s 24 

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:09.339
 so I used several liner so 

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:13.559
 on site initially six trips 

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:16.749
 and then da for the special stamping leberg is to know 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:27.969
 better to avoid 

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:29.439
 so here soon
