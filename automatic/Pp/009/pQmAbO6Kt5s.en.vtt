00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.980 

here's<00:00:12.160> a<00:00:12.280> naturally<00:00:12.880> occurring<00:00:13.390> emulsion

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
here's a naturally occurring emulsion

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.880 
here's a naturally occurring emulsion
which<00:00:14.140> is<00:00:14.350> in<00:00:14.500> an<00:00:14.650> egg<00:00:14.830> it's<00:00:15.700> the<00:00:15.820> egg<00:00:16.090> yolk

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
which is in an egg it's the egg yolk

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.470 
which is in an egg it's the egg yolk
let's<00:00:17.890> get<00:00:18.160> that<00:00:18.369> out<00:00:18.640> of<00:00:18.700> there<00:00:19.090> we'll<00:00:19.330> get

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
let's get that out of there we'll get

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.150 
let's get that out of there we'll get
rid<00:00:19.630> of<00:00:19.660> the<00:00:19.840> white<00:00:20.110> we<00:00:20.410> don't<00:00:20.590> need<00:00:20.770> the<00:00:20.950> white

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
rid of the white we don't need the white

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.019 
rid of the white we don't need the white
on<00:00:21.430> this<00:00:22.650> wipe<00:00:23.650> it<00:00:23.830> on<00:00:23.920> my<00:00:24.070> apron<00:00:24.550> of<00:00:24.640> course

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
on this wipe it on my apron of course

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.839 
on this wipe it on my apron of course
and<00:00:25.500> pour<00:00:26.500> it<00:00:26.590> back<00:00:26.619> see<00:00:27.099> how<00:00:27.189> strong<00:00:27.550> the

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849 
and pour it back see how strong the

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.130 
and pour it back see how strong the
membrane<00:00:28.570> is<00:00:30.060> it's<00:00:31.060> so<00:00:31.270> strong<00:00:31.599> that<00:00:31.840> I<00:00:31.900> can

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
membrane is it's so strong that I can

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.020 
membrane is it's so strong that I can
actually<00:00:32.320> pick<00:00:32.800> it<00:00:32.829> up<00:00:33.870> by<00:00:34.870> the<00:00:34.899> membrane

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
actually pick it up by the membrane

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.330 
actually pick it up by the membrane
let's<00:00:37.030> bring<00:00:37.270> it<00:00:37.420> over<00:00:37.510> to<00:00:37.810> the<00:00:37.960> blender<00:00:38.340> I'm

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
let's bring it over to the blender I'm

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.750 
let's bring it over to the blender I'm
just<00:00:39.670> going<00:00:39.880> to<00:00:40.000> poke<00:00:40.270> it<00:00:41.160> get<00:00:42.160> all<00:00:42.340> the<00:00:42.520> yolk

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
just going to poke it get all the yolk

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.950 
just going to poke it get all the yolk
to<00:00:42.790> come<00:00:43.240> out<00:00:46.620> throw<00:00:47.620> the<00:00:47.770> membrane<00:00:48.220> away<00:00:48.960> then

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
to come out throw the membrane away then

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.560 
to come out throw the membrane away then
I'm<00:00:50.080> going<00:00:50.320> to<00:00:50.380> add<00:00:50.820> little<00:00:51.820> water<00:00:52.920> but<00:00:54.570> about

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
I'm going to add little water but about

I'm going to add little water but about
an<00:00:55.810> equal<00:00:56.320> part<00:00:56.710> of<00:00:57.250> water<00:00:57.820> to<00:00:58.660> the<00:00:58.840> yolk<00:00:59.080> and

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.240 
an equal part of water to the yolk and

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.870 
an equal part of water to the yolk and
now<00:01:01.240> we're<00:01:01.630> going<00:01:01.840> to<00:01:02.020> add<00:01:02.170> the<00:01:02.470> oil<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:03.579> time

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 
now we're going to add the oil this time

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.719 
now we're going to add the oil this time
we're<00:01:04.000> using<00:01:04.030> a<00:01:04.390> thinner<00:01:04.720> oil<00:01:05.170> and<00:01:05.530> the<00:01:06.460> thing

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
we're using a thinner oil and the thing

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.090 
we're using a thinner oil and the thing
that<00:01:07.329> might<00:01:07.600> amaze<00:01:07.930> you<00:01:08.229> is<00:01:08.470> that<00:01:08.710> this<00:01:08.920> is

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
that might amaze you is that this is

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.530 
that might amaze you is that this is
going<00:01:09.310> to<00:01:09.400> turn<00:01:09.610> out<00:01:09.790> to<00:01:09.939> be<00:01:09.970> a<00:01:10.090> thicker

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
going to turn out to be a thicker

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.639 
going to turn out to be a thicker
emulsion<00:01:11.880> eggs<00:01:12.880> tend<00:01:13.509> to<00:01:13.689> turn<00:01:13.930> to<00:01:14.170> turn<00:01:14.439> out

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
emulsion eggs tend to turn to turn out

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:20.910 
emulsion eggs tend to turn to turn out
of<00:01:14.859> very<00:01:15.219> thick<00:01:15.549> emulsion<00:01:19.409> yes<00:01:20.409> that<00:01:20.710> looks

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
of very thick emulsion yes that looks

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.120 
of very thick emulsion yes that looks
good

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.800 

now<00:01:26.130> let's<00:01:26.340> pour<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.880> out<00:01:29.360> look<00:01:30.360> how<00:01:30.450> nice

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
now let's pour that out look how nice

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
now let's pour that out look how nice
and<00:01:31.080> thick<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.380> is

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
and thick that is

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.310 
and thick that is
if<00:01:34.830> you've<00:01:35.550> ever<00:01:35.730> made<00:01:35.970> hollandaise<00:01:36.600> sauce<00:01:36.630> or

if you've ever made hollandaise sauce or

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.130 
if you've ever made hollandaise sauce or
mayonnaise<00:01:37.880> this<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.060> exactly<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.900> same

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
mayonnaise this is exactly the same

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.410 
mayonnaise this is exactly the same
thing<00:01:40.530> except<00:01:41.430> we're<00:01:41.580> using<00:01:41.730> linseed<00:01:42.300> oil

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
thing except we're using linseed oil

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.550 
thing except we're using linseed oil
this<00:01:42.750> time<00:01:44.630> now<00:01:45.630> we'll<00:01:45.750> put<00:01:45.960> out<00:01:46.050> a<00:01:46.080> little<00:01:46.290> bit

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
this time now we'll put out a little bit

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.130 
this time now we'll put out a little bit
of<00:01:46.680> pigment<00:01:47.010> this<00:01:47.910> is<00:01:48.240> called

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
of pigment this is called

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.020 
of pigment this is called
Chinna<00:01:49.650> brazier<00:01:50.220> Rossa<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.560> we'll<00:01:52.640> open<00:01:53.640> it

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
Chinna brazier Rossa and we'll open it

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.520 
Chinna brazier Rossa and we'll open it
up<00:01:54.180> just<00:01:54.390> like<00:01:54.510> we're<00:01:54.780> going<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.080> make<00:01:55.200> pasta

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
up just like we're going to make pasta

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:06.590 
up just like we're going to make pasta
and<00:01:57.500> pour<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.860> emulsion<00:02:02.750> and<00:02:04.850> just<00:02:05.850> mix<00:02:06.390> it

and pour in the emulsion and just mix it

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.900 
and pour in the emulsion and just mix it
together<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:07.290> don't<00:02:07.470> have<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.830> mull<00:02:08.070> this<00:02:08.399> you

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
together you don't have to mull this you

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.940 
together you don't have to mull this you
don't<00:02:09.149> have<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.510> grind<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.990> as<00:02:10.590> though<00:02:10.830> you

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
don't have to grind it as though you

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.120 
don't have to grind it as though you
were<00:02:11.040> making<00:02:11.370> oil<00:02:11.640> paints<00:02:12.590> it<00:02:13.590> goes<00:02:13.890> together

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
were making oil paints it goes together

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.210 
were making oil paints it goes together
fairly<00:02:14.670> well<00:02:15.200> takes<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.380> little<00:02:16.560> bit<00:02:16.770> of<00:02:16.920> time

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
fairly well takes a little bit of time

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.550 
fairly well takes a little bit of time
there<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.820> can<00:02:18.000> see<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.420> richness<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:19.350> that

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
there you can see the richness of that

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.160 
there you can see the richness of that
color<00:02:19.890> that's<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.490> really<00:02:20.790> nice<00:02:21.000> red<00:02:21.660> look<00:02:22.050> at

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
color that's a really nice red look at

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.690 
color that's a really nice red look at
the<00:02:22.260> quality<00:02:22.709> of<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:22.860> paint<00:02:23.250> now<00:02:24.170> that's

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
the quality of that paint now that's

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.820 
the quality of that paint now that's
really<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.730> nice<00:02:27.030> paint<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.780> work<00:02:27.990> with<00:02:28.730> and

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
really a nice paint to work with and

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.340 
really a nice paint to work with and
seeing<00:02:31.830> as<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.220> bridges<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.790> gap<00:02:33.000> between

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
seeing as it bridges the gap between

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.610 
seeing as it bridges the gap between
water<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.590> oil<00:02:36.019> let's<00:02:37.019> pour<00:02:37.380> in<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.590> little

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
water and oil let's pour in a little

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.460 
water and oil let's pour in a little
water<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:39.180> thin<00:02:39.480> it

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.670 

look<00:02:43.070> at<00:02:43.250> that<00:02:43.460> it<00:02:44.270> thins<00:02:44.960> with<00:02:45.320> water<00:02:47.680> but

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
look at that it thins with water but

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.250 
look at that it thins with water but
there's<00:02:49.070> more<00:02:49.370> oil<00:02:49.400> in<00:02:50.150> this<00:02:50.900> particular

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
there's more oil in this particular

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.860 
there's more oil in this particular
emulsion<00:02:52.130> than<00:02:52.340> there<00:02:52.520> is<00:02:52.640> water<00:02:53.000> so<00:02:53.600> let's

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
emulsion than there is water so let's

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.770 
emulsion than there is water so let's
pour<00:02:54.140> in<00:02:54.320> some<00:02:54.500> oil<00:02:54.800> and<00:02:55.190> you'll<00:02:55.910> see<00:02:56.270> that<00:02:56.570> it

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
pour in some oil and you'll see that it

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.860 
pour in some oil and you'll see that it
goes<00:02:57.020> together<00:02:57.680> a<00:02:58.070> little<00:02:58.760> bit<00:02:59.060> better<00:02:59.300> when

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
goes together a little bit better when

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.990 
goes together a little bit better when
we<00:02:59.990> have<00:03:00.020> the<00:03:00.410> oil<00:03:03.220> now<00:03:04.220> feel<00:03:04.490> free<00:03:04.730> to<00:03:04.760> add

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
we have the oil now feel free to add

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.710 
we have the oil now feel free to add
balsam<00:03:05.870> Zoar<00:03:06.350> resins<00:03:07.070> or<00:03:07.600> solvents<00:03:08.600> or

balsam Zoar resins or solvents or
anything<00:03:09.110> you<00:03:09.410> want<00:03:09.620> to<00:03:10.580> this<00:03:11.710> these<00:03:12.710> emulsion

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
anything you want to this these emulsion

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.990 
anything you want to this these emulsion
paints<00:03:13.930> go<00:03:14.930> together<00:03:15.110> just<00:03:15.670> let<00:03:16.670> it<00:03:16.760> let<00:03:16.940> it

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
paints go together just let it let it

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.090 
paints go together just let it let it
sit<00:03:17.120> for<00:03:17.300> about<00:03:17.630> another<00:03:17.780> 15<00:03:18.140> minutes<00:03:18.710> and

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
sit for about another 15 minutes and

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:27.470 
sit for about another 15 minutes and
then<00:03:19.700> it<00:03:19.820> gets<00:03:19.970> smoother

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.630 

now<00:03:28.020> using<00:03:28.230> that<00:03:28.560> emulsion<00:03:29.130> that<00:03:29.160> we<00:03:29.400> just

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
now using that emulsion that we just

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.410 
now using that emulsion that we just
mixed<00:03:30.060> up<00:03:30.770> I'm<00:03:31.770> going<00:03:32.010> to<00:03:32.099> paint<00:03:32.340> that<00:03:32.640> out<00:03:32.940> on

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
mixed up I'm going to paint that out on

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.280 
mixed up I'm going to paint that out on
this<00:03:34.200> board<00:03:34.620> this<00:03:35.580> is<00:03:35.640> a<00:03:35.849> very<00:03:36.360> smooth<00:03:36.840> board

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
this board this is a very smooth board

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.520 
this board this is a very smooth board
so<00:03:37.770> it's<00:03:38.040> going<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.400> show<00:03:38.700> up<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.330> lots<00:03:39.720> trickier

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
so it's going to show up a lots trickier

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.830 
so it's going to show up a lots trickier
than<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:40.770> would<00:03:41.099> on<00:03:41.310> a<00:03:41.400> canvas<00:03:42.110> but<00:03:43.110> still<00:03:44.840> if

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
than it would on a canvas but still if

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.020 
than it would on a canvas but still if
you<00:03:46.470> use<00:03:46.680> this<00:03:46.890> as<00:03:47.100> an<00:03:47.220> underpainting

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
you use this as an underpainting

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.650 
you use this as an underpainting
it<00:03:48.690> will<00:03:48.989> be<00:03:49.140> a<00:03:49.170> streaky<00:03:49.680> under<00:03:49.950> painting<00:03:50.660> you

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
it will be a streaky under painting you

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.449 
it will be a streaky under painting you
don't<00:03:51.840> like<00:03:52.020> streaky<00:03:52.470> under<00:03:52.709> paintings<00:03:53.190> I

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
don't like streaky under paintings I

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.720 
don't like streaky under paintings I
don't<00:03:53.940> know<00:03:54.120> why<00:03:55.100> Rubens<00:03:56.100> use<00:03:56.310> them<00:03:56.550> all<00:03:56.700> the

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
don't know why Rubens use them all the

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.850 
don't know why Rubens use them all the
time<00:03:56.910> and<00:03:57.560> he<00:03:58.560> did<00:03:58.769> good<00:03:59.069> paintings<00:04:00.650> so<00:04:01.650> we'll

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
time and he did good paintings so we'll

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.750 
time and he did good paintings so we'll
just<00:04:02.069> paint<00:04:02.340> that<00:04:02.519> out<00:04:04.400> thing<00:04:05.400> with<00:04:05.610> the

just paint that out thing with the
emulsions<00:04:06.330> is<00:04:06.510> that<00:04:06.690> it<00:04:06.840> goes<00:04:07.019> along<00:04:07.410> very

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
emulsions is that it goes along very

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.160 
emulsions is that it goes along very
very<00:04:08.100> quickly<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:10.700> it<00:04:11.700> dries<00:04:12.060> to<00:04:12.090> a<00:04:12.390> wonderful

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170

very quickly and it dries to a wonderful
surface<00:04:13.790> that<00:04:15.169> accepts<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.400> oil<00:04:17.400> paint

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
surface that accepts the oil paint

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.030 
surface that accepts the oil paint
that's<00:04:18.120> going<00:04:18.359> to<00:04:18.450> go<00:04:18.540> on<00:04:18.720> top<00:04:18.989> of<00:04:19.019> it<00:04:19.350> accepts

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
that's going to go on top of it accepts

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.950 
that's going to go on top of it accepts
