00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.640
 Hey, it's Linnéa here! 

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.900
 Hope you enjoy this wonderful Thursday! 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.960
 That's a thing right now? It's a thing now! 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.240
 My teacup is the best cup in the world! 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.860
 So, as you may have noticed, I think of Harry Potter ... 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.260
 BUT JUST A LITTLE! 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.620
 It's not that I'm dependent ... 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.520
 At all! 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.720
 So I got an idea 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.320
 We run "the Harry Potter tag!" 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.440
 "favorite book?" 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.780
 This one is easy, Captured from Azkaban! 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.620
 For Harry to meet Remus Lupine and Sirius Black! 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.880
 JK Rowling, I'm SIRIUS this is perfection! 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.360
 "Favorite movie?" 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.820
 It must be, Caught from Azkaban and the Chamber of Secrets! 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.720
 I love the cover! check out Ron! 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.940
 He is soo sweet. 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.320
 "Which is the worst book?" 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.300
 First, JK Rowling is a great writer! 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.280
 Secondly, that's not fair! 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.180
 But if you have to take one, then the flaming goblet ... 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.980
 It is good, BUT it is not as good as the other books! 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.020
 The flaming goblet, fuck you! 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.440
 "Parts that made you cry?" 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.920
 Can't count! 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.860
 I need tea for this! 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.300
 Probably when Severus died, Harry saw all his memories and so. 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.060
 And I started grinning ... 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.480
 I cried a lot when Remus and Tonks died. 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.640
 When Fred died ... 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.900
 "Percy shook his brother and Ron was kneeling beside them" 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.120
 "Peace's eyes stared without seeing, his last laugh still played on his face" 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.360
 JK Rowling became a serial killer! 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.100
 "If you could lie with what character you wanted, who would it be?" 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.520
 Luna lovegood! 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.300
 Or Remus Lupine if he was in my age! 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.600
 "Favorite character?" 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.020
 Remus Lupine is about to hunt ... 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.880
 That's a damn difficult question! 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.200
 "What would your patronus be?" 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.100
 Probably a cat ... 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.660
 BUT! It would be cruel if the muggle-born could type one 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.220
 Pikachu! 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.440
 Or type a Godzilla! 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.020
 "If you could have: The Resurrection Stone, the Elder Stake or the Invisible Sheath, what would you take?" 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.240
 I would probably take the invisibility mantle, because I'm not stupid. 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.900
 And that's probably the ONE who would come to use. 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.640
 "In which student home are you in?" 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.500
 I'm HUFFLEPUFF! 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.420
 "If you could meet any of the actors, who would you like to meet?" 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:33.920
 Ian Mckellen! 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.400
 Or trio ... 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.480
 Emma Watson. 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.980
 Rupert Grint. 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.360
 Daniel Radcliffe 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.340
 "Have you played any of the games?" 

00:02:42.454 --> 00:02:44.454
 Yes, I have and they are awesome! 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:52.120
 I have played: The Chamber of Secrets, The Flaming Cup, the Fenix ​​Order and the Half Blood Prince! 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.740
 "Are you satisfied with the end?" 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.400
 If I'm going to be honest, I think the end is amazing " 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.460
 In addition to the fact that there are no more Harry Potter books ... 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.300
 The character has gone through SO MUCH! 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.980
 They deserved a good end! 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.300
 They deserved to have children! 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.620
 eh, spoilers ... 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.060
 "How much does Harry Potter mean to you?" 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.220
 Really? 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:15.673
 REALLY!? 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.700
 My mom pulled me into Harry Potter when I was about 3-4 years old ... 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.800
 And my addiction has not diminished! 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.200
 I'm too deep in the Harry Potter fandom! 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.980
 So, like this video if you liked it. 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.120
 Don't like this video if you hate Harry Potter, because what are you doing here? 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.220
 FRÅÅÅÅGA! 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.220
 Which student home do you belong to? 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.260
 Tell me in the comments, because I want to meet my dear Potterheads!
