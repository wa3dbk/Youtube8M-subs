00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello to everyone so I wish you 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.560
 present the system today 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.929
 sharpening spoils backpacker co which is a 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.009
 sharpening system at but everywhere with 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:17.850
 it's a very ingenious system 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:19.590
 composed of the gad guide pliers so 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.029
 there it is arranged in two parts 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:35.700
 just need to make them very 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:41.540
 simply with a screw here is here 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.540
 the guide clamp securing 2-2 stone 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:48.079
 a great ways and one for the blades 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.340
 a little more damaged 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:56.010
 with a rather strong grain here is the 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.710
 peculiarity of this system is that it 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.289
 has six possible choices 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.510
 sharpening angle so you can 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.689
 add all types of hill cutter 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.549
 Kraft mouth kitchen knife 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.420
 very very hungry knife to do the 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.689
 nets etc 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.530
 and so it's very very ingenious then 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:25.070
 I just need to place my 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:29.900
 blade pinching malam one would suggest 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:33.229
 in the pretty redundancy clip 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:38.490
 this is then to keep it in place 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:40.590
 I tighten the screw back and that's my 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.299
 madam and secure now i'm going 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.820
 choose the worst medium because it is not 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.520
 not very damaged 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.860
 so I go out the guide 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.500
 the guide that will allow me to 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.710
 just keep a sharpening angle 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.219
 perfect perfect and constant there in 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:03.610
 the occurrence I choose 22 and it does not 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:06.790
 remains only at basic water 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.820
 work my landing all over the 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.640
 blade 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:15.630
 that's when I judge him 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.600
 necessary I flip the clip 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:23.620
 I take the same angle 22 and the guil 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:28.900
 makes sure that angle remains its 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:33.610
 star so here is a very system 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:38.320
 ingenious then it stands to reason that this is 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.720
 made for cuts to com means for 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.300
 smaller knives that will be put in 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.780
 this is because the blade is not 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.450
 large 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:52.260
 or on Kraft mouth knives 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.480
 hunting dagger et cetera and so on 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.270
 so much more important here is a 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.280
 very ingenious system 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:03.430
 last little thing I advise you 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.410
 strongly to use oil 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.049
 sharpening whether it's cake or 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.780
 another no matter what will have for 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:14.650
 on the one hand to improve the leak 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.170
 age ii to make your stone last longer 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:21.570
 long and avoid for the oils of 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:24.310
 quality that the ports of the latter 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:32.100
 do not get clogged up here then once 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:32.100
 you're done we're dismantling the clip 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:54.819
 slap it all up in our 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:58.150
 small kit the stones the rate of 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:01.300
 back in his case which of course 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:04.569
 is provided with different attaches 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.310
 so here is backpacker sharpening system 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:10.260
 spoil co that I find 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.250
 personally absolutely great and 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.870
 since I'm here to advertise 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:21.519
 still gasco sharpening oil that 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:23.500
 is approved by the fbi has for a 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.229
 direct contact with food 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.270
 that's it, I hope you 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.010
 will have pleased and I wish you all 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.940
 good luck as usual 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.940
