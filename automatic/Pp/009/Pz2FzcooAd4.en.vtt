00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.510
 emmen 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.789
 goalkeeper 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.789
 the favorite sport 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.390
 marsman 9 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.240
 that was for the most part 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.150
 I think 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.210
 and my debut was in europe and 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.440
 After a shot, Father went driving and I ducked to the corner 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.380
 and that 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.350
 happens naturally in a flash 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.570
 and I thought that 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.950
 that he strayed that to the corner and 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.670
 He finally went on to know more 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.670
 so yes that was moments that you are from 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.750
 while I just don't want to be there on the field 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.980
 according to the telegraaf, fc is twente 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.960
 that can occur 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.930
 but i was fifteen when i came to twente from poland the qualities of the 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.800
 guests a resident 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.620
 and the first impression when I came to twente was fifteen I was allowed 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.440
 like the first training to train with the first 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.440
 so when he came out i went upstairs and 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.430
 if I could play these players 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.070
 it's the first day that his suitcase was happy with a not the least 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.500
 and then he was allowed to train with keepers and I trained together with 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.890
 at the time with the lead he could walk and build kees 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.280
 so then my impression was very important 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.880
 if you go with sander adrenaline then you know enough 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.920
 It will of course cost in the dressing room 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.170
 last year was with our trainer from 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.679
 catch cage deals 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.949
 eric ten hag that was 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.369
 He once played and as a voice trainer 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.419
 well that 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:21.099
 marije and the world stuff 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.009
 what you normally use as a massage 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:25.829
 the turnover is red hot 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.679
 if you put that on and then that's it 

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:31.229
 whatever that why 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:34.679
 and we had a very large box of clothes 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:39.039
 and there was also a piece of clothing from the trainers and so 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:43.829
 this is directly a booklet of the main themes that in 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.069
 and wever have been well-filled with what the red hot 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:50.569
 so he has the tea 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:51.790
 the trainings 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.109
 a bit more to say than that in March 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.299
 I have something that brings you Jan time for the competition 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.919
 I always want a link is welcome 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:03.349
 yes because that's what he is the time we count in but I don't think so 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.389
 if you hadn't done that then I suddenly found out that or that 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:08.509
 had not done and 

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:10.869
 and bad therefore went to play 

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:12.799
 who does every match went 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.219
 the stolen automatisms
