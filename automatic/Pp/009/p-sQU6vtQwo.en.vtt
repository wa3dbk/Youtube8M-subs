00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello to all i hope you go 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.150
 well you drove a video this time 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.529
 for hamsters so I'm going to you 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.630
 present objects that may have 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.860
 at home and we can recover so 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.049
 to make them accessories for 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.630
 hamster so to simply avoid 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.550
 to buy anytime pet shop where 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.560
 there are toxic products where there has been 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.029
 factories behind late I really 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.580
 against pollution against production 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.750
 mass and that's really accessory 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.449
 we can have at home 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.949
 so it's really useless to buy 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.810
 a ton of accessories it is expensive 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.130
 for nothing so if I do that it's 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.210
 also to prevent the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.800
 people buy anywhere in 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.420
 the pet shop but instead they 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.620
 buy a big cage so who will 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.540
 this stuffed animal likes a lot better for 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.940
 his hamster 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.620
 no I leave you so start with so 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.239
 this is just a simple pot 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.730
 to put the earth at 20 so instead 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.530
 to buy something specific in 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.449
 pet shop to put the land to ben 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.010
 just recover a little bit 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.870
 what 's that a little pot of cakes 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.390
 whose eve to the ground before teeth 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.739
 in addition it is much bigger than 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.140
 what they have in the pet shop end this 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.270
 that I saw in any case in pet shop and 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.670
 So here it really costs nothing knew 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.439
 should get a little box mails 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.119
 to the ground before teeth and will land it 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.729
 anyway so here we can 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.979
 also do at home a small to 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.270
 magna I made a hammock like this for 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.979
 my embarrassing hamster so proud for my 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.509
 guinea pigs so that's all I have 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.900
 just made holes in one end 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.150
 of cloth and put the little hooks and 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.950
 key rings so that's it 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.020
 the same it costs nothing I also 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.079
 to occupy ray just a washcloth 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.990
 I attach and a ring of keys to 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.399
 inside I put slats of 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.899
 handkerchiefs is like that besides attached 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.189
 to the bones one can attach this story 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.600
 at the bars of the cage of your entity 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.030
 will gather in he could make his bed 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.750
 or you have fun typing in it 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.240
 seems it costs absolutely nothing 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.829
 then we can also recover 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.439
 rolls of toilet paper or 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.990
 sopalin and so the star can go to 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.009
 interior 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.890
 be careful about what they 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.170
 do not arrange them better so these are these 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.489
 devices it still costs nothing so at 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.660
 place to buy the kills in pet shops this 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:18.250
 that you want we can use that 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.630
 then it's really hyper 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.790
 important instead of buying the voice 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.290
 all cotton for a hamster 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.430
 used slips of tissue 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.170
 so unscented for its nest there it's 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.790
 really for his health it's a lot 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.620
 more economical 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.430
 and what's more, it's for his health 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.680
 here you take the flies there and you 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.750
 do you but you slats in 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.930
 laughing like that by my spa gelatin 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.540
 and the hamster will take them and will do this 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.959
 that he wants and he will use it for his 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.569
 starch it's really super important 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:55.660
 then do not really place a big 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.010
 shoebox so with a trunk - 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.870
 jeanine like that for my hamster 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.400
 -leader in at the base I had taken 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.840
 a box to be able to put in and 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.970
 complementary literary etc and 10 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.250
 digs except that she made her nest of 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.480
 teeth instead so she does not range 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.450
 at all the box so the box is a 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.340
 little bit smaller but that's it and I have them 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.079
 put a little in his cage and make it by 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.790
 the hole here so of course I the candy 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.500
 so that she can pass without being 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.859
 badly and then she makes her nest in the 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.930
 box 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.250
 So here is enough to recover a box 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.150
 to shoes or whatever you want you 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.100
 be careful what does not suit us 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.209
 not instead of buying a hut 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.459
 specific for a mystery that is going 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.600
 really cost expensive knowing that in addition 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.519
 the huts for the absurd must be 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.590
 big enough then in pet store they 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:36.069
 are small for most so that's it 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.630
 so it does not cost anything so I 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.120
 will you still give plenty of examples 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.950
 class was only a few objects but one 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.940
 can really get plenty of things 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.970
 and do a lot of things for his 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.040
 hamster free without polluting the 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.840
 planet without buying without spending everything 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.100
 time his money and so instead 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.180
 to buy him a bigger cache 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.769
 really bought what is needed 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.010
 for your inventory no longer hide you from 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.060
 things that are not strictly for nothing 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.350
 so here I am not this little video 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.400
 you will have liked and I would tell you 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.400
 frankly a video kisses
