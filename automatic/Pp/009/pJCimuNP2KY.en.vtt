00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.910
 Greetings to all readers around the 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.610
 strut just finished the huawei event 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.880
 here in berlin this beautiful is presented 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.289
 huawei device ascends 7 networks e 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.140
 very very big because it is 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.900
 in fact, a 6 inch device is starting 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.109
 immediately from the dimensions we have a 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:30.159
 157 mm in length 81 mm in width 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:32.290
 but only 7.9 mm thick so it is 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:33.489
 very very fine as you can see 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.710
 as regards instead the 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.120
 construction work says he has 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.699
 obtained this device from a single one 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.710
 metal block in fact here between 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:45.519
 pretty much all aluminum 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:48.309
 very nice also the edges with this one 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.840
 beautiful shearing really very pleasure in 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.510
 time when you go to challenge the 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.789
 device also has a good grip due 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.320
 of the rear bend so yes 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:58.870
 keeps it steady in your hand despite 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.850
 however, its generous dimensions 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.019
 on the other hand we have with 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.009
 a strip of the upper aluminum 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.439
 an aluminum bottom strip that 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:08.750
 they go around the keys instead 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.820
 they are software as a network with quaestor 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.159
 healthy who calls you android and are not you 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.520
 the 18 with low speaker work in 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.200
 high 5 megapixel camera with i 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.509
 various sensors in the upper part 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.530
 we find 3 mm and the second jack 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.350
 microphone for deletion of 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.080
 rustling on the right of these keys which 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.330
 they have a metal texture we find it 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.909
 the torino rocker volume key and the 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.460
 button from the system and shutdown which is a 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.220
 this thesis knows well in the moment 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.479
 in which it holds the display of 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.100
 married phone at the bottom 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.020
 we have a micro usb port and the 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.179
 main microphone the view part 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.659
 instead the 2 slots for sim impacts 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:49.220
 dreiser dual sim one of the snow slot is 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.200
 only for mycosis but the other slot 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.369
 instead we can insert a nano sim 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.869
 or possibly one of this ps 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.640
 here is probably a p because not 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.740
 will be present in the Italian model of the 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.080
 device or rather only those 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.520
 Asians we have also seen with 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.780
 accents 7 for the others 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.430
 features we have a project 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.070
 realized that makes that move everything 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.530
 huawei owner though core fight 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.910
 with big.little technology what does it mean 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.820
 it means that the various who are four 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.250
 core with a15 and four core cortex 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.660
 cortex a7 running at frequency 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.600
 different in fact four powerful shots 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.820
 use 1-point 8 gb those less 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.989
 powerful at 1 point 3 gb 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.590
 this technology how it works 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.390
 practically based on the 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.580
 to the functionality we are performing 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.319
 activity I'm doing the device 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.430
 showed us the different ones 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.810
 combinations for example during 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.810
 using the split camera 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.730
 in the four largest cores at 15 and three i 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.290
 smaller cores during the call 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.870
 instead the body and only small and 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.250
 so then a good optimization 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.549
 from this point of view for 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.140
 balance performance clearly 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.980
 consumption talking about consumption the battery 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.260
 it's from 4000 miles so very much 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.810
 wide and even assures about two 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.980
 days of intensive use in the part 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.829
 back we find instead how you see 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.780
 this fingerprint sensor 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:10.269
 this finger print that doesn't work 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.650
 crawling your finger but simply 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.510
 indeed touching immediately shows the 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:19.730
 operation lock the device 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:22.610
 without turning on the display as you can see 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.560
 unlocks directly and this to pretend 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.940
 a and also works for eg 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.420
 take photographs and keeping 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.420
 mashed 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.470
 in this way so I really have to say 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.210
 implemented well for the first time on the 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.190
 android device there is a widget that 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.380
 works properly 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.760
 a bit like we also saw on iphone 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.590
 in the back we have this 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.150
 camera that is 13 megapixels and a 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.120
 sensor hesitated in the sense regions with 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.640
 Flash LED is not optically stabilized 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.800
 the for the others 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.780
 technical features of this version 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.190
 that we have that would be the golden one 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.770
 in fact device will be present in 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.930
 standard gray and black version with 2gb 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.640
 of RAM and 16GB of internal memory 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.150
 this one instead the 3gb version 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.880
 betray the gold color 3 gb of 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.700
 RAM memory and 32GB of internal memory 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.410
 we have held expandable in the in the 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.580
 Asian model also puts that 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.410
 self-styled Italians in those will not give 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.980
 the second one will be the second sim then 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.980
 you can always spread with microsd 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.830
 the custom android 4.4 software 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.140
 from huawei with lime or shaun white 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.950
 actually this is a version a 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.540
 say the 3.0 that goes to introduce some 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.460
 example holders here we find the bar 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.449
 of the soft keys that can be 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:42.409
 even hidden in this way 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:44.050
 we have a new dyer that maybe you 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:46.240
 monster 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.560
 we have no contact I can't make you 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.810
 see some of the features shown 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.520
 during the presentation we see a 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:57.849
 moment if connected to the internet I don't think so 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:05:00.220
 to make an ok no let's go right 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:01.659
 to maybe open the camera in that 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.360
 there is software functionality 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:05.860
 the focus that is nothing but functions 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.960
 of the focuses variously the photo is taken and 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.270
 then later it is possible 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.979
 change focus maybe focus 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.020
 from the object in the background or that 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:15.940
 in the foreground very very much 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.889
 fast we have the various settings here 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.759
 these are quick setting then you can 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.740
 you can't go in the various 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:22.569
 settings and decide maybe 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.099
 take pictures with with the sensor of 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:25.960
 fingerprints how he put the videos first 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:28.300
 are recorded up to 1080p then 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.639
 there is no ultra hd resolution 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.280
 this device will be available from 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.960
 end of October at a price of 499 euros per 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.110
 the standard version then the one from 16 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.969
 gb and 2 gb of memory 599 euros per 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.870
 so regarding the early version then 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:45.340
 with 3 GB and 32 GB of internal memory 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.650
 I would say that it is a very device 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.539
 interesting expect to have a test 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.699
 to make due considerations, however 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:53.190
 to be a device now 6 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:54.750
 inch 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.400
 we have also seen that the edges are 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.410
 they are much less optimized 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.770
 in fact which one says he has occupied 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:02.880
 about 83 percent of the surface 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.290
 front then it holds enough 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.780
 good hand even if it is a 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:09.270
 6-inch device first while everything 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.740
 I give you an appointment at the fence 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.270
 maybe that deepened by emanuele
