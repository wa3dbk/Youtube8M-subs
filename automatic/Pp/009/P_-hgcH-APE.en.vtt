00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
really get into the game just like I did

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.510 
really get into the game just like I did
with<00:00:22.330> the<00:00:22.480> Apple<00:00:22.780> o3<00:00:23.140> before<00:00:23.590> it<00:00:23.710> came<00:00:23.890> out<00:00:24.070> so

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:24.520 
with the Apple o3 before it came out so

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.900 
with the Apple o3 before it came out so
like<00:00:24.640> when<00:00:25.000> the<00:00:25.150> game<00:00:25.330> actually<00:00:25.630> releases

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
like when the game actually releases

like when the game actually releases
technically<00:00:27.910> open<00:00:28.120> bears<00:00:28.660> what<00:00:28.870> they<00:00:28.990> call<00:00:29.200> it

or if you uh if you go somewhere you

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:09.989 
or if you uh if you go somewhere you
expect<00:01:08.499> to<00:01:08.619> see<00:01:08.829> something<00:01:09.520> that<00:01:09.549> you've<00:01:09.789> seen

expect to see something that you've seen

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:13.980 
expect to see something that you've seen
before<00:01:10.109> there's<00:01:11.109> a<00:01:11.409> reasonable<00:01:12.719> level<00:01:13.719> of<00:01:13.840> an

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
before there's a reasonable level of an

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.129 
before there's a reasonable level of an
expectation<00:01:14.439> and<00:01:15.039> i<00:01:15.609> understand<00:01:16.090> that<00:01:16.179> but<00:01:16.869> at

00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:17.139 
expectation and i understand that but at

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:19.980 
expectation and i understand that but at
the<00:01:17.289> same<00:01:17.409> time<00:01:17.850> there's<00:01:18.850> two<00:01:19.389> factors<00:01:19.659> at

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
the same time there's two factors at

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.059 
the same time there's two factors at
play<00:01:20.020> here

00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:21.069 
play here

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:23.699 
play here

00:01:23.699 --> 00:01:23.709 
the first is that you know i can't

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:25.109 
the first is that you know i can't
really<00:01:23.859> make<00:01:24.069> a<00:01:24.130> video<00:01:24.490> boat<00:01:24.670> of<00:01:24.789> games<00:01:24.999> that

that's really what it is with these
games<00:02:20.189> I<00:02:20.430> mean<00:02:20.609> world<00:02:20.909> Warcraft<00:02:21.469> is<00:02:22.670> actually

that's not something I can really
actively<00:03:56.909> talk<00:03:57.239> about<00:03:57.569> because<00:03:57.870> it's<00:03:58.049> not

level<00:04:02.819> and<00:04:03.239> you<00:04:03.599> really<00:04:03.780> nothing<00:04:04.109> past<00:04:04.379> that

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
level and you really nothing past that

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.679 
level and you really nothing past that
so<00:04:05.099> it<00:04:05.159> comes<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.489> Diablo<00:04:05.790> there's<00:04:06.509> really

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:06.689

figured out pretty much everything the
game<00:04:35.379> with<00:04:36.129> it<00:04:36.249> becoming<00:04:36.550> so<00:04:36.879> much<00:04:36.939> easier

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
game with it becoming so much easier

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.719 
game with it becoming so much easier
there's<00:04:38.169> a<00:04:38.289> lot<00:04:38.560> of<00:04:38.680> flexibility<00:04:39.340> but<00:04:39.550> it's

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
there's a lot of flexibility but it's

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:41.879 
there's a lot of flexibility but it's
all<00:04:39.939> pointless<00:04:40.449> there's<00:04:40.870> no<00:04:40.990> goal<00:04:41.289> to<00:04:41.529> it<00:04:41.680> it's

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
all pointless there's no goal to it it's

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:43.499 
all pointless there's no goal to it it's
all<00:04:42.069> so<00:04:42.310> easy<00:04:42.490> you<00:04:42.729> can<00:04:42.759> just<00:04:42.909> do<00:04:43.210> the<00:04:43.330> game

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
all so easy you can just do the game

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:45.089 
all so easy you can just do the game
whatever<00:04:43.900> spec<00:04:44.349> you<00:04:44.469> want<00:04:44.680> if<00:04:44.800> you<00:04:44.919> have<00:04:45.069> a

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:45.099 
whatever spec you want if you have a

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:47.129 
whatever spec you want if you have a
certain<00:04:45.340> line<00:04:45.610> here<00:04:45.909> and<00:04:46.060> there's<00:04:46.689> no<00:04:46.840> reason

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
certain line here and there's no reason

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:48.629 
certain line here and there's no reason
to<00:04:47.169> even<00:04:47.289> do<00:04:47.560> that<00:04:47.770> you<00:04:48.039> just<00:04:48.099> play<00:04:48.400> for<00:04:48.460> fun

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
to even do that you just play for fun

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:51.089 
to even do that you just play for fun
and<00:04:49.029> that's<00:04:49.629> it<00:04:49.840> when<00:04:50.439> it<00:04:50.529> comes<00:04:50.710> to<00:04:50.830> a<00:04:50.889> game

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:51.099 
and that's it when it comes to a game

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:53.100 
and that's it when it comes to a game
like<00:04:51.249> path<00:04:51.460> of<00:04:51.610> Exile<00:04:51.969> there's<00:04:52.479> so<00:04:52.779> much<00:04:52.960> you

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
like path of Exile there's so much you

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.719 
like path of Exile there's so much you
can<00:04:53.289> learn<00:04:53.319> there's<00:04:53.979> so<00:04:54.189> much<00:04:54.310> you<00:04:54.460> can

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
can learn there's so much you can

experience that's new and even though
you<00:04:57.129> know<00:04:57.250> I<00:04:57.490> hope<00:04:58.120> that<00:04:58.779> even<00:04:58.960> though<00:04:59.229> some<00:04:59.650> of
