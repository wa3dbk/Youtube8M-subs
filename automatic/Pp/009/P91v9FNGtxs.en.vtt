00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
hi so today we are going to make a

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.109 
hi so today we are going to make a
butterfly<00:00:30.170> with<00:00:30.800> construction<00:00:31.369> paper<00:00:31.520> I'm

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
butterfly with construction paper I'm

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.240 
butterfly with construction paper I'm
going<00:00:32.509> to<00:00:32.630> fold<00:00:32.870> my<00:00:32.960> construction<00:00:33.470> paper<00:00:33.890> now

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
going to fold my construction paper now

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.910 
going to fold my construction paper now
and<00:00:34.780> basically<00:00:35.780> what<00:00:36.079> we're<00:00:36.230> going<00:00:36.410> to<00:00:36.650> make

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
and basically what we're going to make

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.910 
and basically what we're going to make
is<00:00:37.280> something<00:00:37.700> like<00:00:37.850> a<00:00:37.910> tall<00:00:38.239> I'm<00:00:38.829> going<00:00:39.829> to

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
is something like a tall I'm going to

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.920 
is something like a tall I'm going to
cut<00:00:40.129> the<00:00:40.309> paper<00:00:40.489> in<00:00:40.760> half<00:00:41.000> so<00:00:41.239> we<00:00:41.390> can<00:00:41.570> make<00:00:41.780> the

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
cut the paper in half so we can make the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.680 
cut the paper in half so we can make the
upper<00:00:42.640> part<00:00:43.640> of<00:00:43.820> the<00:00:44.090> body<00:00:44.269> of<00:00:44.360> the<00:00:44.449> butterfly

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
upper part of the body of the butterfly

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.619 
upper part of the body of the butterfly
as<00:00:45.320> well<00:00:45.830> as<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:46.070> lower<00:00:46.250> part<00:00:46.640> what<00:00:47.300> we<00:00:47.449> have

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
as well as the lower part what we have

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.460 
as well as the lower part what we have
to<00:00:47.809> do<00:00:47.989> is<00:00:48.230> basically<00:00:48.470> fold<00:00:49.400> up<00:00:50.360> and<00:00:50.930> down<00:00:51.199> I

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
to do is basically fold up and down I

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.329 
to do is basically fold up and down I
can<00:00:51.739> find<00:00:51.980> our<00:00:53.170> construction<00:00:54.170> paper<00:00:54.500> and<00:00:54.830> you

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
can find our construction paper and you

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:57.220 
can find our construction paper and you
can<00:00:55.580> use<00:00:55.760> two<00:00:56.030> different<00:00:56.420> types<00:00:57.019> of

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
can use two different types of

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.950 
can use two different types of
construction<00:00:57.829> paper<00:00:58.010> colors<00:00:58.730> actually<00:00:59.330> so

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
construction paper colors actually so

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.539 
construction paper colors actually so
your<00:01:00.199> butterfly<00:01:00.650> will<00:01:00.799> be<00:01:00.949> a<00:01:00.979> little<00:01:01.250> bit<00:01:01.369> more

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:01.549 
your butterfly will be a little bit more

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:03.729 
your butterfly will be a little bit more
colorful<00:01:01.940> I'm<00:01:02.299> going<00:01:02.659> to<00:01:02.839> go<00:01:02.989> with<00:01:03.199> a<00:01:03.229> basic

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
colorful I'm going to go with a basic

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.550 
colorful I'm going to go with a basic
model<00:01:03.979> and<00:01:04.420> this<00:01:05.420> will<00:01:05.780> be<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.110> wings<00:01:06.320> of<00:01:06.530> my

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
model and this will be the wings of my

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.460 
model and this will be the wings of my
butterfly<00:01:07.190> I'm<00:01:07.790> going<00:01:08.420> to<00:01:08.540> do<00:01:08.690> the<00:01:08.840> same<00:01:09.080> thing

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
we're going to put this value of the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.450 
we're going to put this value of the
butterfly<00:01:24.470> right<00:01:24.740> in<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.009> middle<00:01:25.250> of<00:01:25.340> the

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
butterfly right in the middle of the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.820 
butterfly right in the middle of the
pipe<00:01:25.670> cleaner<00:01:25.700> and<00:01:26.330> we're<00:01:27.140> going<00:01:27.409> to<00:01:27.560> twist

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
pipe cleaner and we're going to twist

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.810 
pipe cleaner and we're going to twist
around<00:01:28.299> so<00:01:29.299> there<00:01:29.479> is<00:01:29.600> no<00:01:29.840> mess<00:01:30.520> no<00:01:31.520> fuss<00:01:31.550> no

and at the at the top that you see that

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.690 
and at the at the top that you see that
I<00:01:51.160> am<00:01:51.430> NOT<00:01:51.730> twisting<00:01:53.250> those<00:01:54.250> will<00:01:54.490> be<00:01:54.670> the

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
I am NOT twisting those will be the

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.620 
I am NOT twisting those will be the
antenna<00:01:55.480> of<00:01:55.840> our<00:01:56.350> little<00:01:56.980> butterfly<00:01:57.480> we<00:01:58.480> will

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
antenna of our little butterfly we will

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.470 
antenna of our little butterfly we will
open<00:01:58.960> up<00:01:59.170> a<00:01:59.530> little<00:01:59.890> bit<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:02.140> wings<00:02:02.410> now<00:02:03.480> so

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
open up a little bit of the wings now so

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.230 
open up a little bit of the wings now so
that<00:02:04.840> it<00:02:05.740> will<00:02:05.920> start<00:02:06.250> to<00:02:06.460> look<00:02:06.640> like<00:02:06.700> a<00:02:06.910> real

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
that it will start to look like a real

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.970 
that it will start to look like a real
butterfly<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:10.330> can<00:02:10.510> fluff<00:02:10.780> it<00:02:10.990> off<00:02:11.140> again

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
butterfly so you can fluff it off again

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.400 
butterfly so you can fluff it off again
you<00:02:12.250> can<00:02:12.490> even<00:02:12.940> decorate<00:02:13.180> these<00:02:13.870> before<00:02:14.380> you

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
you can even decorate these before you

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.770 
you can even decorate these before you
actually<00:02:14.680> put<00:02:14.980> them<00:02:15.340> on<00:02:15.660> before<00:02:16.660> you<00:02:16.750> start

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
actually put them on before you start

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.840 
actually put them on before you start
folding<00:02:17.290> them<00:02:17.740> you<00:02:17.920> can<00:02:18.160> actually<00:02:18.340> take

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
folding them you can actually take

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.720 
folding them you can actually take
crayons<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.690> put<00:02:19.900> colors<00:02:20.470> or<00:02:20.800> put<00:02:21.040> dots<00:02:21.340> and

those kind of things again I'm just
going<00:02:24.070> with<00:02:24.160> a<00:02:24.250> basic<00:02:24.640> model<00:02:25.170> once<00:02:26.170> you<00:02:26.350> have

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
going with a basic model once you have

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.950 
going with a basic model once you have
your<00:02:27.550> butterfly<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.210> the<00:02:28.480> model<00:02:28.750> fluff<00:02:28.930> that

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
your butterfly to the model fluff that

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.140 
your butterfly to the model fluff that
you<00:02:29.200> want<00:02:29.440> now<00:02:29.710> it's<00:02:29.920> time<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.190> build<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.940> body

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
you want now it's time to build the body

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.360 
you want now it's time to build the body
of<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.510> butterfly<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:32.350> for<00:02:32.950> that<00:02:33.100> we<00:02:33.250> will

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
of the butterfly and for that we will

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.430 
of the butterfly and for that we will
take<00:02:33.580> a<00:02:33.640> piece<00:02:34.000> of<00:02:34.210> construction<00:02:34.450> paper<00:02:34.840> or

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
take a piece of construction paper or

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.820 
take a piece of construction paper or
black<00:02:35.890> construction<00:02:36.250> paper<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:37.410> we're<00:02:38.410> going

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
black construction paper and we're going

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.440 
black construction paper and we're going
to<00:02:38.860> glue<00:02:39.640> it<00:02:39.820> right<00:02:40.380> into<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.650> middle<00:02:41.860> of<00:02:42.450> the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
to glue it right into the middle of the

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.940 
to glue it right into the middle of the
body<00:02:43.780> right<00:02:44.500> here<00:02:45.570> or<00:02:46.570> the<00:02:47.440> pipe<00:02:47.620> cleaner

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
body right here or the pipe cleaner

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.260 
body right here or the pipe cleaner
actually<00:02:48.490> so<00:02:49.210> once<00:02:49.870> that's<00:02:50.080> done<00:02:50.880> we<00:02:51.880> let<00:02:52.060> it

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
actually so once that's done we let it

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.090 
actually so once that's done we let it
we<00:02:52.570> let<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.870> glue<00:02:53.080> dry<00:02:53.110> for<00:02:53.350> a<00:02:53.680> little<00:02:53.950> bit

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
we let the glue dry for a little bit

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.730 
we let the glue dry for a little bit
obviously<00:02:54.550> and<00:02:54.850> we<00:02:55.540> are<00:02:55.750> now<00:02:55.959> going<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.350> attach

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
obviously and we are now going to attach

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.410 
obviously and we are now going to attach
the<00:02:56.950> eyes<00:02:56.980> I'm<00:02:57.490> taking<00:02:58.120> two<00:02:58.330> googly<00:02:58.750> eyes

and<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:01.050> am<00:03:01.440> attaching<00:03:01.890> them<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.760> head<00:03:03.030> and

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
and I am attaching them to the head and

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.860 
and I am attaching them to the head and
now<00:03:04.920> I<00:03:05.190> will<00:03:06.000> put<00:03:06.480> them<00:03:06.569> out<00:03:06.810> as<00:03:07.200> well<00:03:07.500> so<00:03:07.850> I
