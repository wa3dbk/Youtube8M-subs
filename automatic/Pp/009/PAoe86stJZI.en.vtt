00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.520
 Hello everyone 

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:08.980
 It is Gucci of world rubber market Thank you for this table tennis wisdom bag 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:13.389
 Today's theme is here 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:20.079
 I would like to introduce you to how Buchigire lower rotation serve 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:23.199
 This is an attempt to introduce you to the ideal lower rotation serve, which is to keep it short and turn it down 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:25.960
 I think by remembering this serve 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:31.390
 Service ace can be taken in the rotation 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:32.320
 Before the attack that it is easy to bring it to the third ball drive smash, it is sure that this downward rotation 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.790
 enraged 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.790
 I want one to remember 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:06.310
 I will show you how to make the edge rotation of the lower rotation come back 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:12.850
 The first one-eyed procedure is first 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:13.690
 First of all, to point the foreside of the racket to the ceiling when serving 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.380
 Please give me 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:23.899
 First of all, this racket is the only way to put the lower rotation serve intensely 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:28.549
 Salt is facing just properly line the ceiling is the fore surface is important 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:32.360
 When the surface of the racket will become something like this happen before here 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:38.370
 The less rotation of the lower rotation serve as the This is it 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:40.170
 The amount of rotation this has done is less because the force to push forward is stronger, so there is less spin 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.619
 To get speed 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:48.479
 It increases would hit the rotation even less 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:52.470
 This is a bad example of people who can't break well with bottom turn serve 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:55.830
 With this, even if you remember the lower rotation serve, you can not take service alphanumerics 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:00.159
 It will not be advantageous in serving It will be returned if it is normal 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:03.520
 So please point the foreside of the racket to the ceiling and it will be right above 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:10.119
 It is a beautiful mug parallel to this table tennis table 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:16.269
 It's no good at an angle school where the stand and the fore plane are parallel. 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:17.920
 If you put the lower rotation serve in the state and you put it this way , it will come back with a spin. 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.459
 Return 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:25.660
 Poise spin moon This angle is interesting though 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:32.500
 In order to regard the ball as natural 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:34.060
 It says that the ability to fly before opening the store decreases and all energy can be poured into rotation 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:39.340
 There is a nice benefit 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.650
 So the tendency of people who stay short in the bottom turn serve at Buchigire is that the surface of the racket is just the ceiling 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.950
 Toward 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.890
 Come back it is that Tteyuu has been able to rub firmly the ball with such feeling 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.280
 I will 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.280
 Since it pushes out before it does this, it does not take rotation, and the speed comes out 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:22.950
 It's the second time I got out and I'm in the moment I'm going to have a baby here. 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:27.060
 When you hit a ball at this moment in the moment you 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:31.620
 It is important to wear cool 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:34.560
 After all , when I cut a serve, I would say I should cut it anyway. 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:39.930
 If you wear it hard, you will be barter 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:42.940
 If the power is full and it comes out with a feeling like Koa-Goo, then the other party is also cut off 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.570
 While receiving because it is well returned there after all 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:50.320
 In the case of me, I'll take power next day 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:53.530
 At first it is important to create an atmosphere that seems to be broken 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.660
 I feel relieved and the grip looks like a par 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:59.490
 Par 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:07.710
 Cut into is a state that does not have really force wobbly of state cut the par of state 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:09.330
 Miya from par at the time in that hitting the moment the perfectly cut to raise the consciousness to in toss of parallel to the table 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:13.740
 In the sense that 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:15.520
 I will cut it like this forever 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:21.040
 Spin will 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:22.930
 It will be strongly applied as in parka ragout Nissl par Karagu 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.500
 Par 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:30.000
 And so it is I feel it 's Palace from par this 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:33.630
 In the case of a parker etc. there is a strong spin 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.410
 As this Parker Gree's power is lost by all means 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:44.210
 I think I'm feeling that has put only gulp To force that impact 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:44.210
 So Saab told you has expired actually a cool likely Saab will look like is put out 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:16.439
 From par The more you speed up the temple at the time of the temple 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:20.009
 Backspin gets stronger at high speed 

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:24.180
 Because the speed of this swing speed is also quite important 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:29.339
 I feel like I 'm not asking why 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:32.779
 When it comes to scraping or scraping , the soft spin down well serves well 

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:32.779
 It is a feeling that rub you the in take 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:53.069
 We think that it is this big weapon that you can wear cool as well as just cut out serve 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:53.069
 Thank you very much 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.980
 The 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.980
 r 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.590
 Ah 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.590
 Ah
