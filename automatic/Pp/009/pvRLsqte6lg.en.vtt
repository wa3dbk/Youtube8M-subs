00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:10.290
 hello there I will show three knives 3 grip 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.719
 basis of how it will turn out the first watt 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.269
 small sweat medium two fingers and 3 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.150
 deep there will be 3 grabs from 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:22.529
 deep to shallow two turns from five 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.010
 meters here I will show now begin with 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.820
 small 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:30.850
 one finger like this 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.850
 with this small grip 2 bars. 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.239
 things 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:42.010
 now two fingers like this two 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:44.610
 finger here and so it is already deeply it 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.610
 already disastrous 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:56.290
 yeah cool but still stuck 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.090
 three fingers very deep grip 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:02.270
 actually get the whole handle will take a 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.810
 these here all pen in hand practically 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.810
 this is a deep grip 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.810
 look 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.070
 too in one of us torsion 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.660
 and why are they all stuck on the idea if 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:22.240
 I would throw them the same way they would not 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.150
 so one would be stuck to us here 2 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:33.030
 it may also not matter I used here 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:33.030
 other settings like i've seen 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:42.680
 medium and small grab 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:46.530
 I reached the target far but amplitude 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.229
 rotation made grab 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:54.270
 mean on deep grabbing and in general his 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.790
 even twisted and shorter they all 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.640
 3 stuck here so that I show 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.990
 that when experience is gained 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:08.459
 little by little you can even be different 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:11.790
 grip all the cross and it turns out 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.670
 already interesting and then even from different 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.450
 distances quietly begin to throw 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.650
 you will take into account just this 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.200
 settings 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.800
 such an arc such a hold what power 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.280
 throw 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.180
 there are some little things there twist 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.769
 brushes and this whole concert to carry 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:38.569
 gradually from cacophony turn into 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:38.569
 symphony bye bye
