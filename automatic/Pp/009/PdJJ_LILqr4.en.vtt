00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 where everybody clear that I hope 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.640
 it's good and so I want it 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.570
 for the analysis of the dlc 3 revenge in 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.950
 my family the eurid slowly and so we 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.090
 direct pass is the first image so 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.480
 the picture there and not very interesting to 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.500
 to go on Saturday with blue eyes 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.640
 normal behind just behind we see 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.390
 expected with violet eyes 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.289
 it's just a two-color English 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.939
 by the way in the intro I have not seen 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.070
 we can not download youtube 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.210
 the cut of copyrights eh ben on 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.619
 can see in the intro who has a voice 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.660
 pretty special that says you will stay here 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.329
 where you will not leave said if someday 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.980
 I remembered more so maybe 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.660
 it would be the end of our characters I 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.550
 would prefer a more or less preferred 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.670
 for its part and we pass direct Sunday 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.020
 next so here we see there the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.570
 central bank at the bottom a 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.860
 weapon and so listening to what they 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.989
 were saying the developers you have 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.480
 used with a city of brest and have it 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.390
 put in the ground so it will be rather the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.600
 map I think at 7.6 on a vase in 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.510
 1850 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.270
 a sixty and then so here 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.379
 now we move on to a haunting machine 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.570
 so on this picture where the cac 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.070
 transit character diaries who are 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.780
 back on missing from elsewhere for the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.850
 internal ema for last year remark 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.890
 among the lots afraid we say that 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.049
 now especially thomas that we can 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.850
 know a little bit about her own about 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.619
 characters 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.820
 will understand who is stonehenge invested 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.340
 roce the year now image the one 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.110
 beaten on this picture I see a new 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.229
 asset do not know how I'm already 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.869
 for animal but the symbol of cough 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.729
 do not really feel anything I 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.549
 really do not see what his wheels are 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.610
 can you say that 500 of energy maybe that 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.049
 it's a word-for-word matticks for those 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.640
 who do not know is the nature that 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.140
 prowled in a kind of moratorium 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.909
 black ops head of the road it's 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.100
 by the way but that was removed because 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.970
 of bugs found in the day and walking 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.220
 next 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.630
 there we see a prisoner from elsewhere 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.430
 the soil I cross you they will not taste 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.799
 to the developers have said that the 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.390
 prisoner there we can not care back 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.149
 like giving him weapons if I do not 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.320
 not cheat or or help him so he will do 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.820
 surely part of the estÃ©rel 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.530
 he's spinning me between the fingers of 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.090
 very interesting bouriane I have the mind 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.450
 for sannois you show rather 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.370
 in whom I am told he was there 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.920
 before our characters pass from 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.190
 the rays following images 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.989
 an image that really tells me it's at all 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.170
 in fact so we see the laser gun 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.720
 improve brand 2 from what I have 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.840
 understood it no longer causes damage when 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.160
 we shoot we'll say at a short distance 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.209
 because when you shoot on the ground 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.610
 you take yourself one of the guys is going 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.470
 take him there will be more and more 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.450
 that she gunshots and it's not 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.900
 like the basic laser gun like 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.730
 would say once all that 5th maximum 5 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.810
 Monday the cemeteries recipe 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.340
 german all the trouble that is in 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.810
 the pile so it's powerful enough finally 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.280
 much more powerful than such at 0 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.890
 beautiful following images 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.090
 there we see in the first person for 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.280
 to be present interesting still we can 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:00.500
 see that the following images and laon 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.200
 it's over so here I think I have 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.450
 all said if ever there are small of 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.220
 times questions from comments to 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.500
 listen you used comment you 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.930
 use your keyboard to support one's 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.459
 will find alone 8 and my people I said 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.769
 Wednesday for immediately on the 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.750
 multiplayer of the last of us a 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.060
 by the way I tell him that last 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.109
 the dlc pardon goes out on July 2nd it's at 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.639
 say about two weeks 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.160
 it should surely on a video 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.239
 directly on July 2nd is once 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.910
 four days before the holidays 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.260
 So I'm counting on their 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.010
 rifles I wish you a very good 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.010
