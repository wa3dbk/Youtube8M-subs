00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
doesn't have assassin so i can adjust

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.300 
doesn't have assassin so i can adjust
based<00:03:36.989> on<00:03:37.290> if<00:03:37.410> they're<00:03:37.620> having<00:03:37.800> a<00:03:38.010> lot<00:03:38.130> of<00:03:38.160> air

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
based on if they're having a lot of air

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.580 
based on if they're having a lot of air
support<00:03:38.730> in<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:38.880> air<00:03:39.090> and<00:03:39.660> i<00:03:39.780> want<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.320> stop

being seen and getting killed all the

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.610 
being seen and getting killed all the
time<00:03:42.360> then<00:03:42.989> i<00:03:43.019> think<00:03:43.230> i<00:03:43.320> have<00:03:43.410> a<00:03:43.470> couple

kill<00:04:19.650> the<00:04:19.890> rendering<00:04:20.370> town<00:04:20.549> my<00:04:20.730> laptop<00:04:21.209> I

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
kill the rendering town my laptop I

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.230 
kill the rendering town my laptop I
didn't<00:04:22.140> buy<00:04:22.260> a<00:04:22.289> laptop<00:04:22.590> last<00:04:23.160> year<00:04:23.550> knowing

didn't buy a laptop last year knowing

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.610 
didn't buy a laptop last year knowing
that<00:04:24.300> I<00:04:24.419> would<00:04:24.660> be<00:04:24.840> making<00:04:25.050> YouTube<00:04:25.590> videos

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
that I would be making YouTube videos

so I don't have the best one for
rendering<00:04:28.860> and<00:04:29.160> editing<00:04:29.669> so<00:04:30.120> I<00:04:30.150> usually<00:04:30.569> takes

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810
