 I left a sweat in a bag 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.320
 important to let him play another 10-15 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.690

 This can be useful for any 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.350
 what the woman said 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.780
 the hikes I love 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.780
 yourself 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.480
 please the hikes were invented by the 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.100
 French many many centuries ago I must 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.600
 say because it's better than 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.090
 meats were spoiled with much 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.070
 ease they did not have these refrigerated 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.080
 that we have now of course but that 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.330
 they kept their meats 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.950
 in the basements and we were much more 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.540
 cold and aida where they kept their 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.750
 meats we are going to fry bears and 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.770
 until translucent so we need it and 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.770
 I'm going to put this sauce 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:43.640
 this stage is very serious this state is 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.980
 very serious is very pro and we told them 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.270
 that I was lazy and I was the 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.920
 last Sunday in chedraui I adjust with the 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.630
 people of zinsa and santa anita and 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.070

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.930
 a lot of people went with us we went 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.300

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.950

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.350
 We really had an amazing time but 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.020
 what better to see the note while 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:09.260

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:12.950

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:52.570
 also in culinary terms and 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:55.570

 it will be enough stress 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:18.260
 but look very well is the combination 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.239
 yes this a little fattened now but it's 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.690
 a delight not only will they be able to 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.460
 lose we bathe them perfectly if 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.860

 tortillitas for the sauce too 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:37.700
