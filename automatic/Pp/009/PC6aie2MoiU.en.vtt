00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.910
 city ​​as i am sylvie and i had 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.980
 actually to make a chamber 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.639
 but somehow it tastes right now 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.639
 a little bit around 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.049
 no idea is completely shit me 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.150
 I have now decided to one 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.260
 to make small tutorial series because of me 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.470
 I'm all for my medicare irony 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.880
 account is on the way and it is 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.560
 Damn hard as eddy curry hofs 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.850
 karen anna lenz mostly like that 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.810
 are crassly disabled that's incredible 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.970
 I've never believed people to do that 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.760
 seen or likely 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.570
 if you play on diego then 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.030
 probably it's about now 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.530
 a little thing be it right 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.570
 his little tutorials will also be rather 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.610
 standard came from what I assume that 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.860
 in everyone I know now just do it 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.050
 normal it's just about it yes if 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.879
 with teleport you play that on 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.570
 make level 1 a shitty camp 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.719
 should also here again briefly the reason 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.949
 for that it is so if your teleport top 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.420
 line plays I do not know if it is 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.879
 smarter than the player though 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.440
 at least it's always good you do not have to 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.600
 start necessarily with a long short 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.160
 or middle men knock and still 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.739
 lorenz effect with the advantage 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.540
 a brand is he gives you 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.710
 it is exciting but it has the disadvantage 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.360
 take only one point 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.830
 You can compensate for this by 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:17.220
 you do not do a camp at level 1 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:18.810
 Everyone can do that, not everyone 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.680
 knew no one I'll guess 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.820
 good example here is rompel me or 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.930
 can do it i think i have it 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.939
 not even so I'm not 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.430
 Certainly you can then stop if you 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.619
 really such a sony has no camp 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.200
 stop 1 can bake the the double 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.909
 his strategy I do that 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.850
 last video explains the last one was that 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.770
 slow gameplay but the penultimate one 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.890
 video was the tutorial for the double 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.180
 long stopped know yes 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.860
 advantage but is just rather uses yours 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.780
 first team mostly not at all 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.000
 before he is at 6 so they are very rare 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.740
 situations where the used when 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.240
 is distracted or such a shit and 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.100
 you really have to complete the best one 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.680
 or should it be level 6 that matters 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.880
 93 if you make it permanent 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.680
 each clown one minute down the 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.939
 advantage is here at all too 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.290
 again you can your mittelelfrankens 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.390
 Can help if you really one 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.190
 from this champion time a camp 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.050
 can not do it alone just ask 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.390
 your with whether once may belgium the 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.970
 is not duty is who but cool as 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.000
 it takes now in the hierarchy with us 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.930
 a coup I asked 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.060
 and very important if you do that 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.290
 kill the little ones first they do here 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.569
 namely the most harm 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.850
 it is also important because it may be that 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.470
 with a little snack that is 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.180
 no problem if a small adapter to 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.459
 who goes with countries he gets anyway 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.190
 still your level 2 so I'll do that 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.690
 The camp should I in the super 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.340
 Being bad matches is ultra 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.620
 Regret simply if you want 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.760
 and then you have it all the way to me 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.010
 now have my level 2 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.330
 most of the people do not know 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.870
 how to manipulate the wave is called 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.980
 not so bad 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.080
 april ebay spots buy people and now 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.480
 I will return to comfort life again 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.590
 to which I am leaning my level 2 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.880
 opponent will probably now 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.970
 Four minions need to see him once 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.780
 Sun and has a doran of the strongest 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.640
 early times 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.549
 that was is water strongest first item 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.680
 in terms of overalls and have easy 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.720
 times five ports on the state shit 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.739
 I'm manager that we can be relative 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.420
 good system and then just have no 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.019
 problems first until may not be there again 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.810
 is because that is as well as minutes 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.060
 had returned in 330 so you know what 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.620
 That's why I do my people 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.130
 Four years later, whatever 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.319
 play 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.549
 that makes the raptor when she's scared 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.430
 you can also like the wolves 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.380
 go over that is synonymous but is believe 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.970
 I'm a little game just takes 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.799
 I think longer but I would not quite 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.200
 sure but in normal case you do that 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.569
 rap the last europe ticket at minute 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.190
 1 does not forget the raptor kills 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.660
 the small ones first so that people here was 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.859
 it with the dress tutorial as said it 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.790
 is rather came to civil 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:52.959
 if it somehow helped you then 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.160
 write the sea in the comments if 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.549
 knew this trick and not here 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.810
 people have just made in the 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.549
 Comment reasons why we do not 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.040
 that was also the first of 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.669
 me people audi rhine and up to 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.669
 next time
