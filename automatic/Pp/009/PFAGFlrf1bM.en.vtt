00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
to over strum it or play it extra loud

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.730 
to over strum it or play it extra loud
or<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:36.810> feel<00:02:37.020> like<00:02:37.200> you<00:02:37.290> should<00:02:37.470> be<00:02:37.560> adding

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
or you feel like you should be adding

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.130 
or you feel like you should be adding
more<00:02:38.040> but<00:02:38.280> you<00:02:38.340> really<00:02:38.550> just<00:02:38.700> have<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:39.110> kind<00:02:40.110> of

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
more but you really just have to kind of

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.050 
more but you really just have to kind of
get<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.410> tonality<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:41.040> really<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:41.580> think<00:02:41.760> what

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
get the tonality and really I think what

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.700 
get the tonality and really I think what
it<00:02:42.150> comes<00:02:42.210> down<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.020> sort<00:02:43.380> of<00:02:43.470> rhythm

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
it comes down to is the sort of rhythm

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.500 
it comes down to is the sort of rhythm
there's<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.370> on<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.820> second<00:02:45.210> in<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.330> fourth

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
there's a on the second in the fourth

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.170 
there's a on the second in the fourth
beat<00:02:45.900> that's<00:02:46.770> sort<00:02:47.070> of<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.220> accent<00:02:47.670> when<00:02:48.120> I

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
beat that's sort of the accent when I

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.760 
beat that's sort of the accent when I
plant<00:02:48.450> guitar<00:02:48.840> I<00:02:48.870> like<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.350> sort<00:02:49.500> of<00:02:49.560> put<00:02:49.710> a
