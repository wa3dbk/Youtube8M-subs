00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.170 

all<00:03:13.260> right<00:03:13.379> guys<00:03:13.560> these<00:03:14.220> are<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.579> finished

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
all right guys these are the finished

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.819 
all right guys these are the finished
products<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:17.239> think<00:03:18.239> that<00:03:18.629> the<00:03:18.750> jiffy<00:03:19.560> puff

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
products and I think that the jiffy puff

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.309 
products and I think that the jiffy puff
the<00:03:20.400> marshmallow<00:03:20.819> cream<00:03:21.060> actually<00:03:21.959> did<00:03:22.260> a

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
the marshmallow cream actually did a

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.050 
the marshmallow cream actually did a
better<00:03:22.500> job<00:03:22.620> than<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.099> marshmallow<00:03:23.579> itself

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
better job than the marshmallow itself

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.849 
better job than the marshmallow itself
because<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.930> marshmallow<00:03:25.349> didn't<00:03:25.650> really

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
because the marshmallow didn't really

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.800 
because the marshmallow didn't really
melt<00:03:26.190> it<00:03:26.430> just<00:03:26.609> got<00:03:26.730> hot<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.209> golden-brown<00:03:27.599> on
