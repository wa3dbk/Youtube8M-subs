00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:16.610

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.640 
wasn't something that we actually got in
the<00:00:16.700> package<00:00:17.240> and<00:00:17.900> I<00:00:18.020> thought<00:00:18.230> they<00:00:18.380> were<00:00:18.439> just

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
the package and I thought they were just

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.160 
the package and I thought they were just
need<00:00:18.890> to<00:00:19.040> look<00:00:19.189> at<00:00:19.430> their<00:00:20.270> jellybeans<00:00:20.930> and

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
need to look at their jellybeans and

need to look at their jellybeans and
they're<00:00:22.070> very<00:00:22.279> oddly<00:00:22.669> colored<00:00:23.270> and<00:00:23.660> shaped

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:23.829 
they're very oddly colored and shaped

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.030 
they're very oddly colored and shaped
and<00:00:24.829> they're<00:00:25.700> quite<00:00:26.000> large<00:00:26.380> and<00:00:27.380> what<00:00:27.919> you

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.040 
and they're quite large and what you

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.960 
and they're quite large and what you
would<00:00:28.160> consider<00:00:28.279> a<00:00:28.849> jelly<00:00:29.480> bean<00:00:29.750> so<00:00:30.189> I<00:00:31.189> don't

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
would consider a jelly bean so I don't

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.090 
would consider a jelly bean so I don't
even<00:00:32.059> know<00:00:32.239> have<00:00:32.450> to<00:00:32.660> I<00:00:32.899> think<00:00:33.440> I<00:00:33.500> want<00:00:33.829> to<00:00:33.890> cut

taste good so let's cut one see what's

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.570 
taste good so let's cut one see what's
inside<00:00:44.350> there's<00:00:45.350> quite<00:00:45.680> a<00:00:45.710> bit<00:00:45.950> on<00:00:46.190> the

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
inside there's quite a bit on the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.330 
inside there's quite a bit on the
exterior<00:00:47.210> and<00:00:47.990> it<00:00:48.170> looks<00:00:48.320> like<00:00:48.380> a<00:00:48.470> soft<00:00:48.860> inside

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
exterior and it looks like a soft inside

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.770 
exterior and it looks like a soft inside
let's<00:00:49.550> just<00:00:49.700> check<00:00:49.910> another<00:00:50.150> one<00:00:50.270> to<00:00:50.480> see<00:00:50.630> if

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
let's just check another one to see if

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.720 
let's just check another one to see if
the<00:00:50.900> color<00:00:51.140> is<00:00:51.230> always<00:00:51.530> the<00:00:51.650> same<00:00:51.890> I<00:00:54.490> think<00:00:55.490> it

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
the color is always the same I think it

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.660 
the color is always the same I think it
is<00:00:55.850> I<00:00:56.000> think<00:00:56.210> just<00:00:56.390> the<00:00:56.989> red<00:00:57.200> shell<00:00:57.560> is<00:00:57.800> giving

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
is I think just the red shell is giving

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.080 
is I think just the red shell is giving
it<00:00:58.790> that<00:00:59.829> the<00:01:00.829> red<00:01:01.070> color<00:01:01.400> this<00:01:01.640> will<00:01:01.790> probably

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
it that the red color this will probably

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.200 
it that the red color this will probably
have<00:01:02.210> a<00:01:02.239> bluish<00:01:02.810> color<00:01:03.640> almost<00:01:04.640> like<00:01:04.879> a<00:01:04.909> blue

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
have a bluish color almost like a blue

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.450 
have a bluish color almost like a blue
mint<00:01:05.449> collar<00:01:05.770> so<00:01:06.770> that's<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.100> inside<00:01:07.220> of

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
mint collar so that's the inside of

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.500 
mint collar so that's the inside of
those<00:01:07.670> Wow<00:01:08.210> there's<00:01:08.479> one<00:01:08.630> more<00:01:08.810> I<00:01:10.060> think<00:01:11.060> I<00:01:11.300> cut

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
those Wow there's one more I think I cut

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.540 
those Wow there's one more I think I cut
most<00:01:11.690> of<00:01:11.840> them<00:01:11.960> enough<00:01:12.530> to<00:01:12.740> understand<00:01:13.280> what

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
most of them enough to understand what

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:20.280 
most of them enough to understand what
we<00:01:13.670> got<00:01:13.850> here<00:01:15.250> so<00:01:16.250> I<00:01:16.280> think<00:01:16.370> I<00:01:16.580> need<00:01:16.729> to<00:01:16.850> try<00:01:17.180> one
