00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
in this video I'll be showing you what

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.530 
in this video I'll be showing you what
it's<00:00:01.740> like<00:00:01.829> to<00:00:02.220> use<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.370> Raspberry<00:00:02.820> Pi<00:00:02.850> as<00:00:03.300> a

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
it's like to use a Raspberry Pi as a

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.829 
it's like to use a Raspberry Pi as a
media<00:00:03.929> player<00:00:04.110> like<00:00:04.799> home<00:00:05.069> theater<00:00:05.430> PC<00:00:05.879> so

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
media player like home theater PC so

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.900 
media player like home theater PC so
just<00:00:07.049> how<00:00:07.200> good<00:00:07.440> could<00:00:07.830> this<00:00:07.950> device<00:00:08.309> be<00:00:08.580> you

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
just how good could this device be you

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.200 
just how good could this device be you
can<00:00:09.030> pick<00:00:09.240> up<00:00:09.420> for<00:00:09.630> around<00:00:09.780> 30<00:00:10.500> pounds<00:00:11.210> just

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
can pick up for around 30 pounds just

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.259 
can pick up for around 30 pounds just
how<00:00:12.360> good<00:00:12.540> can<00:00:12.750> that<00:00:12.809> be<00:00:12.960> compared<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:14.089> what<00:00:15.089> a

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
how good can that be compared to what a

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.900 
how good can that be compared to what a
computer<00:00:15.780> built<00:00:16.109> down<00:00:16.379> there<00:00:16.410> that's<00:00:16.890> cost<00:00:17.699> me

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
computer built down there that's cost me

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.380 
computer built down there that's cost me
well<00:00:18.210> what<00:00:18.720> around<00:00:19.380> 400<00:00:20.039> pounds<00:00:20.430> it's<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.180> more

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
well what around 400 pounds it's a more

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.689 
well what around 400 pounds it's a more
than<00:00:21.480> 10<00:00:21.720> times<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.109> amount<00:00:22.400> it<00:00:23.400> does<00:00:23.550> how

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
than 10 times the amount it does how

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.150 
than 10 times the amount it does how
good<00:00:23.880> can<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.150> be<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:24.630> comparison<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.320> so

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
good can it be in comparison to that so

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.470 
good can it be in comparison to that so
in<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.340> video<00:00:26.490> I'll<00:00:26.820> be<00:00:26.849> showing<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.269> few

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
in this video I'll be showing you a few

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.960 
in this video I'll be showing you a few
examples<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.080> what<00:00:28.170> it's<00:00:28.320> like<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.730> play<00:00:29.730> like

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
examples of what it's like to play like

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.330 
examples of what it's like to play like
a<00:00:30.000> blu-ray<00:00:30.510> quality<00:00:30.660> film<00:00:31.170> all<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:31.949> way<00:00:32.099> down

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
a blu-ray quality film all the way down

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.639 
a blu-ray quality film all the way down
so<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.730> just<00:00:33.180> stabbed<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.660> 1080p<00:00:34.520> 720p<00:00:35.870> video<00:00:36.870> and

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
so I just stabbed a 1080p 720p video and

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.010 
so I just stabbed a 1080p 720p video and
like<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.370> mobile<00:00:38.790> phone<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.210> screen<00:00:39.329> size

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
like a mobile phone the screen size

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.270 
like a mobile phone the screen size
video<00:00:41.629> and<00:00:42.629> what<00:00:42.899> I've<00:00:43.020> opted<00:00:43.320> for<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.100> use

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
video and what I've opted for is to use

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.650 
video and what I've opted for is to use
rasp<00:00:44.910> MC<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.110> stands<00:00:46.379> for<00:00:46.469> raspberry

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
rasp MC and that stands for raspberry

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.720 
rasp MC and that stands for raspberry
XBMC<00:00:49.010> now<00:00:50.010> there's<00:00:50.190> quite<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.370> long<00:00:50.489> with<00:00:50.640> the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
XBMC now there's quite a long with the

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.939 
XBMC now there's quite a long with the
name<00:00:50.910> size<00:00:51.149> privada<00:00:51.629> renfa<00:00:52.020> rolls<00:00:52.500> better<00:00:52.680> see

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
name size privada renfa rolls better see

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.520 
name size privada renfa rolls better see
kind<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.460> bit<00:00:53.579> simpler<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.379> and<00:00:55.379> that's

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
kind of a bit simpler that and that's

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.439 
kind of a bit simpler that and that's
just<00:00:55.710> really<00:00:56.010> easy<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.340> install<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:57.120> bang<00:00:57.329> it

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
just really easy to install you bang it

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.290 
just really easy to install you bang it
on<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.649> SD<00:00:58.649> card<00:00:58.760> put<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.850> in<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.000> Raspberry

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
on the SD card put it in the Raspberry

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.720 
on the SD card put it in the Raspberry
Pi<00:01:00.590> resizes<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.949> resizes<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.489> drive

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
Pi resizes and it resizes the drive

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.050 
Pi resizes and it resizes the drive
itself<00:01:03.379> reboots<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.739> then<00:01:05.309> they<00:01:05.610> are<00:01:05.790> you've

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
itself reboots and then they are you've

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.230 
itself reboots and then they are you've
got<00:01:06.619> XBMC<00:01:07.619> they're<00:01:07.950> up<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.280> running<00:01:08.340> it's<00:01:09.119> a

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
got XBMC they're up and running it's a

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.060 
got XBMC they're up and running it's a
few<00:01:09.450> tweaks<00:01:09.750> just<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.380> let<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.770> know<00:01:10.799> my

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
few tweaks just to let it know my

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.859 
few tweaks just to let it know my
amplifier<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.610> capable<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.119> playing<00:01:12.299> Dolby

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
amplifier is capable of playing Dolby

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.950 
amplifier is capable of playing Dolby
Digital<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.619> DTS<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.909> notes<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.720> not

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
Digital and DTS and notes that is not

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.670 
Digital and DTS and notes that is not
the<00:01:16.200> Dolby<00:01:17.070> true<00:01:17.400> HD<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:18.119> DTS<00:01:18.270> HD<00:01:18.750> they're<00:01:19.560> not

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
the Dolby true HD and DTS HD they're not

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.440 
the Dolby true HD and DTS HD they're not
even<00:01:19.920> listed<00:01:20.070> in<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.369> menu<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.939> I'm<00:01:21.240> not

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
even listed in the menu and I'm not

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.899 
even listed in the menu and I'm not
surprised<00:01:21.810> at<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.310> yeah<00:01:23.310> just<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.610> few<00:01:23.790> tweaks

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
surprised at that yeah just a few tweaks

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.749 
surprised at that yeah just a few tweaks
like<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.689> they're<00:01:25.170> running<00:01:25.799> my<00:01:26.610> for

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
like that and they're running my for

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:27.980 
like that and they're running my for
starters<00:01:27.090> would<00:01:27.270> just<00:01:27.390> bring<00:01:27.509> out<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.689> screen

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
starters would just bring out a screen

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.539 
starters would just bring out a screen
saver<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.710> I've<00:01:28.799> just<00:01:28.950> moved<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.250> keyboard

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
saver so I've just moved the keyboard

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.510 
saver so I've just moved the keyboard
along<00:01:30.560> and<00:01:31.560> we'll<00:01:31.650> go<00:01:31.770> into<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.070> movie<00:01:32.189> list

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
along and we'll go into the movie list

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.550 
along and we'll go into the movie list
I've<00:01:33.180> not<00:01:33.420> put<00:01:33.570> my<00:01:33.689> whole<00:01:33.840> collection<00:01:34.259> on<00:01:34.320> here

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
I've not put my whole collection on here

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.620 
I've not put my whole collection on here
simply<00:01:35.100> because<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.490> was<00:01:35.610> just<00:01:35.759> taking<00:01:36.180> far

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
simply because it was just taking far

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.300 
simply because it was just taking far
too<00:01:36.659> long<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.590> you'll<00:01:37.740> see<00:01:37.890> here<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.280> just

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
too long and you'll see here it's just

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.359 
too long and you'll see here it's just
taking<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> little<00:01:39.360> while<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:40.040> refresh<00:01:41.040> and

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
taking a little while to refresh and

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.899 
taking a little while to refresh and
move<00:01:41.790> along<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.090> menus<00:01:42.860> it<00:01:43.860> gets<00:01:44.100> there<00:01:44.369> but

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
move along the menus it gets there but

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.399 
move along the menus it gets there but
this<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.509> just<00:01:45.780> something<00:01:45.930> I'm<00:01:46.140> noticing

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
this is just something I'm noticing

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.100 
this is just something I'm noticing
first<00:01:46.799> there<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> delay<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.270> suppose<00:01:48.780> hardly

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
first there is a delay I suppose hardly

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.679 
first there is a delay I suppose hardly
surprising<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.920> Raspberry<00:01:50.579> Pi<00:01:50.610> has<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> 700

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
surprising the Raspberry Pi has a 700

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.190 
surprising the Raspberry Pi has a 700
megahertz

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.920 
megahertz
single-core<00:01:52.740> CPU<00:01:52.909> my<00:01:53.909> home<00:01:54.090> theater<00:01:54.240> PC<00:01:54.720> has<00:01:54.899> a

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
single-core CPU my home theater PC has a

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.359 
single-core CPU my home theater PC has a
quad<00:01:55.229> core<00:01:55.439> three<00:01:55.710> gigahertz

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369

so<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.090> first<00:01:57.270> movie<00:01:57.540> we're<00:01:57.659> going<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.810> start

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
so the first movie we're going to start

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.830 
so the first movie we're going to start
with<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.409> safe<00:01:58.590> house<00:01:59.570> just<00:02:00.570> go<00:02:00.689> for

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
with it is safe house just go for

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.819 
with it is safe house just go for
starting<00:02:01.170> from<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.380> beginning

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
starting from the beginning

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.749 
starting from the beginning
now<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.790> 35<00:02:03.390> gig<00:02:04.020> movie<00:02:04.740> this<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.729> a

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
now this is a 35 gig movie this is a

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.449 
now this is a 35 gig movie this is a
blu-ray<00:02:06.360> quality<00:02:06.710> kind<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.770> plays<00:02:07.950> an<00:02:08.190> average

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
blu-ray quality kind of plays an average

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.609 
blu-ray quality kind of plays an average
of<00:02:08.610> between<00:02:08.700> about<00:02:08.940> 30<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.720> 40<00:02:10.110> megabits<00:02:10.470> per

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
of between about 30 to 40 megabits per

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.700 
of between about 30 to 40 megabits per
second

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
second

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.190 
second
and<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.460> problem<00:02:12.760> is<00:02:12.790> that<00:02:13.450> is<00:02:13.600> beyond<00:02:13.960> what

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
and the problem is that is beyond what

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.740 
and the problem is that is beyond what
800<00:02:14.860> megabits<00:02:15.250> link<00:02:15.970> can<00:02:16.240> really

800 megabits link can really

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.710 
800 megabits link can really
realistically<00:02:17.440> achieve<00:02:18.510> you'll<00:02:19.510> see<00:02:19.630> you

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
realistically achieve you'll see you

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.100 
realistically achieve you'll see you
here<00:02:19.870> intercept<00:02:20.200> it<00:02:20.890> can<00:02:21.040> do<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.220> intro<00:02:21.490> okay

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
here intercept it can do the intro okay

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.930 
here intercept it can do the intro okay
but<00:02:23.110> if<00:02:23.170> I<00:02:23.260> hop<00:02:23.470> forward<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.520> just<00:02:24.550> see<00:02:24.820> it's

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
but if I hop forward you just see it's

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:25.440 
but if I hop forward you just see it's
buffering

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
buffering

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.300 
buffering
in<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.690> top<00:02:25.870> corner<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.930> fact<00:02:29.170> I<00:02:29.350> pressed<00:02:30.100> up

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
in the top corner the fact I pressed up

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.370 
in the top corner the fact I pressed up
to<00:02:30.730> move<00:02:30.880> it<00:02:30.970> forward<00:02:31.150> a<00:02:31.270> chapter<00:02:31.720> there<00:02:32.170> we<00:02:32.230> go

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
to move it forward a chapter there we go

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.330 
to move it forward a chapter there we go
okay<00:02:33.930> now<00:02:34.930> it's<00:02:35.170> moving<00:02:35.380> forward<00:02:35.800> isn't<00:02:36.040> it

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
okay now it's moving forward isn't it

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:48.450 
okay now it's moving forward isn't it
ten<00:02:36.760> minutes<00:02:46.410> so<00:02:47.410> I<00:02:47.470> just<00:02:47.710> turn<00:02:47.890> that<00:02:47.920> down<00:02:48.070> I

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
ten minutes so I just turn that down I

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.560 
ten minutes so I just turn that down I
don't<00:02:48.610> need<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.850> hear<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.060> sound<00:02:49.270> for<00:02:49.480> this

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
don't need to hear the sound for this

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.300 
don't need to hear the sound for this
I'm<00:02:50.380> just<00:02:50.500> showing<00:02:50.710> you<00:02:50.740> the<00:02:50.860> picture<00:02:51.130> calls

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
I'm just showing you the picture calls

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.700 
I'm just showing you the picture calls
here<00:02:51.610> I<00:02:51.760> need<00:02:52.330> to<00:02:52.420> see<00:02:52.600> here<00:02:52.810> it's<00:02:52.930> all<00:02:53.110> very

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
here I need to see here it's all very

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.040 
here I need to see here it's all very
grainy<00:02:54.160> this<00:02:54.430> picture<00:02:54.880> and<00:02:55.090> it's<00:02:55.840> just

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
grainy this picture and it's just

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.170 
grainy this picture and it's just
stuttering<00:02:56.560> clearly<00:02:57.130> it's<00:02:57.250> absolutely<00:02:57.850> no

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
stuttering clearly it's absolutely no

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.470 
stuttering clearly it's absolutely no
good<00:02:58.420> for<00:02:58.600> watching<00:02:58.960> this<00:03:00.240> just<00:03:01.240> get<00:03:01.360> the

good for watching this just get the
stats<00:03:01.720> about<00:03:01.960> the<00:03:02.050> movie<00:03:02.350> there<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:03.010> I<00:03:03.460> can

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
stats about the movie there and I can

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.160 
stats about the movie there and I can
just<00:03:03.730> see<00:03:03.850> as<00:03:03.970> soon<00:03:04.090> as<00:03:04.210> it<00:03:04.330> peaks<00:03:04.600> at<00:03:04.810> 13

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
just see as soon as it peaks at 13

just see as soon as it peaks at 13
megabits<00:03:05.560> per<00:03:05.680> second<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:07.420> whole<00:03:07.450> picture

just<00:03:08.440> seems<00:03:08.650> to<00:03:08.800> stop<00:03:09.300> and<00:03:10.300> it<00:03:10.360> has<00:03:10.450> to<00:03:10.570> buffer

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
just seems to stop and it has to buffer

just seems to stop and it has to buffer
that's<00:03:11.950> that's<00:03:12.160> not<00:03:12.280> good<00:03:12.490> at<00:03:12.580> all<00:03:13.200> now<00:03:14.200> drop

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
that's that's not good at all now drop

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
fast-forward it it's just fast forward

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.370 
fast-forward it it's just fast forward
again<00:03:36.850> that<00:03:37.360> just<00:03:37.540> jump<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:37.960> bit<00:03:38.050> further<00:03:40.380> okay

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
again that just jump a bit further okay

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.720 
again that just jump a bit further okay
it<00:03:41.500> took<00:03:41.620> a<00:03:41.650> little<00:03:41.800> while<00:03:42.010> to<00:03:42.070> move<00:03:42.340> forward

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
it took a little while to move forward

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.550 
it took a little while to move forward
but<00:03:43.360> now<00:03:43.450> it's<00:03:43.630> actually<00:03:43.870> playing<00:03:44.050> and<00:03:44.440> it's

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
but now it's actually playing and it's

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.490 
but now it's actually playing and it's
playing<00:03:44.860> a<00:03:45.130> perfectly<00:03:46.120> viewable<00:03:47.020> quality

playing a perfectly viewable quality
there<00:03:47.820> just<00:03:48.820> bring<00:03:48.970> out<00:03:49.090> the<00:03:49.150> stats<00:03:49.390> about<00:03:49.510> it

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
there just bring out the stats about it

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.210 
there just bring out the stats about it
okay<00:03:50.890> we<00:03:51.010> look<00:03:51.840> down<00:03:52.840> between<00:03:53.110> what<00:03:53.320> 10<00:03:53.590> to<00:03:53.770> 17

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
okay we look down between what 10 to 17

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.930 
okay we look down between what 10 to 17
that's<00:03:54.820> fine<00:03:55.090> what<00:03:55.960> CPU<00:03:56.380> usage<00:03:56.800> CPU<00:03:57.160> usage<00:03:57.730> is

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
that's fine what CPU usage CPU usage is

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.090 
that's fine what CPU usage CPU usage is

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
or we're knots about 97 I saw yeah so

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.970 
or we're knots about 97 I saw yeah so
it's<00:04:03.220> kind<00:04:03.280> of<00:04:03.400> pushing<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:03.820> CPU<00:04:04.240> a<00:04:04.270> bit<00:04:04.540> that

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
it's kind of pushing the CPU a bit that

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.250 
it's kind of pushing the CPU a bit that
well<00:04:05.980> that's<00:04:06.040> fine<00:04:06.340> it<00:04:06.580> is<00:04:06.670> working<00:04:07.260> just

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
well that's fine it is working just

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.900 
well that's fine it is working just
viewing<00:04:08.440> my<00:04:08.560> TV<00:04:08.890> there<00:04:09.070> you<00:04:09.220> can<00:04:09.340> see<00:04:09.520> that<00:04:09.550> the

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
viewing my TV there you can see that the

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.640 
viewing my TV there you can see that the
resolution<00:04:10.390> is<00:04:10.650> HD<00:04:11.650> 1080<00:04:11.980> at<00:04:12.220> 60<00:04:12.250> Hertz<00:04:13.650> close

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
resolution is HD 1080 at 60 Hertz close

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.190 
resolution is HD 1080 at 60 Hertz close
that<00:04:14.940> now<00:04:15.940> will<00:04:16.090> drop<00:04:16.239> down<00:04:16.420> in<00:04:16.570> quality<00:04:16.960> and

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
that now will drop down in quality and

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.950 
that now will drop down in quality and
go<00:04:17.320> for<00:04:17.530> a<00:04:17.560> 720<00:04:18.280> HD<00:04:19.120> 720<00:04:19.930> movie

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.680 

and<00:04:23.960> there's<00:04:24.170> no<00:04:24.530> problems<00:04:24.889> playing<00:04:25.100> this<00:04:25.220> one

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
and there's no problems playing this one

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:33.370 
and there's no problems playing this one
fast-forward<00:04:26.690> it<00:04:27.639> seeks<00:04:28.639> a<00:04:28.820> lot<00:04:29.060> quicker<00:04:32.380> you

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
fast-forward it seeks a lot quicker you

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.570 
fast-forward it seeks a lot quicker you
can<00:04:33.500> certainly<00:04:33.680> see<00:04:33.950> this<00:04:34.100> is<00:04:34.250> where<00:04:34.430> the

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
can certainly see this is where the

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.640 
can certainly see this is where the
Raspberry<00:04:35.210> Pi<00:04:35.240> is<00:04:35.419> more<00:04:35.810> comfier<00:04:36.320> at<00:04:36.470> being

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
Raspberry Pi is more comfier at being

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.460 
Raspberry Pi is more comfier at being
around<00:04:37.630> 720p<00:04:38.630> moon<00:04:38.870> HD<00:04:39.320> 720<00:04:39.950> movies<00:04:41.260> just<00:04:42.260> look

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
around 720p moon HD 720 movies just look

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.830 
around 720p moon HD 720 movies just look
down<00:04:42.680> at<00:04:42.860> the<00:04:42.950> amplifier<00:04:43.610> you<00:04:46.600> see<00:04:47.600> that<00:04:47.750> it's

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
down at the amplifier you see that it's

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.350 
down at the amplifier you see that it's
doing<00:04:47.960> Dolby<00:04:48.410> Digital<00:04:48.820> and<00:04:49.820> it's<00:04:50.030> certainly

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
doing Dolby Digital and it's certainly

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.700 
doing Dolby Digital and it's certainly
there<00:04:50.540> is<00:04:50.570> the<00:04:50.690> Raspberry<00:04:51.080> Pi<00:04:51.110> down<00:04:51.440> there<00:04:51.620> on

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
there is the Raspberry Pi down there on

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.190 
there is the Raspberry Pi down there on
the<00:04:51.770> floor<00:04:52.240> there<00:04:53.240> will<00:04:53.330> go<00:04:53.450> down<00:04:53.660> in<00:04:53.840> quality

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
the floor there will go down in quality

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.190 
the floor there will go down in quality
a<00:04:54.230> bit<00:04:54.290> more<00:04:54.650> and<00:04:55.370> go<00:04:55.460> through<00:04:55.640> a<00:04:55.669> naked<00:04:56.000> gun

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
a bit more and go through a naked gun

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.510 
a bit more and go through a naked gun
and<00:04:57.200> it's<00:04:57.350> take<00:04:57.560> a<00:04:57.590> little<00:04:57.800> while<00:04:57.980> to<00:04:58.010> refresh

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520

I know it's opening it quality here is

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.040 
I know it's opening it quality here is
perfectly<00:05:10.010> good<00:05:11.110> to<00:05:12.110> seek<00:05:12.320> forward<00:05:12.710> a<00:05:12.770> bit

perfectly good to seek forward a bit

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.770 
perfectly good to seek forward a bit
take<00:05:15.050> a<00:05:15.080> little<00:05:15.229> while<00:05:15.350> to<00:05:15.380> seek<00:05:15.620> for<00:05:15.860> word

take a little while to seek for word
it's<00:05:17.780> playing<00:05:17.990> it<00:05:18.140> perfectly<00:05:18.620> fine<00:05:20.200> CPU<00:05:21.200> usage

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
it's playing it perfectly fine CPU usage

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.550 
it's playing it perfectly fine CPU usage
it's<00:05:21.650> a<00:05:21.680> bit<00:05:21.800> lower<00:05:22.090> that's<00:05:23.090> good

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
it's a bit lower that's good

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.710 
it's a bit lower that's good
DVD<00:05:24.560> quality<00:05:24.710> absolutely<00:05:25.550> fine<00:05:28.390> now<00:05:29.390> for<00:05:29.600> we'd

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
DVD quality absolutely fine now for we'd

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.480 
DVD quality absolutely fine now for we'd
lower<00:05:29.870> the<00:05:29.960> quality<00:05:30.140> even<00:05:30.680> more<00:05:30.890> going<00:05:31.340> for

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
lower the quality even more going for

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.430 
lower the quality even more going for
something<00:05:31.790> that's<00:05:31.940> like<00:05:32.120> about<00:05:33.080> the<00:05:33.140> size<00:05:33.350> of

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
something that's like about the size of

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.760 
something that's like about the size of
a<00:05:33.530> mobile<00:05:33.830> phone<00:05:34.100> screen<00:05:35.440> so<00:05:36.440> for<00:05:36.590> that<00:05:36.650> I've

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
a mobile phone screen so for that I've

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.620 
a mobile phone screen so for that I've
opted<00:05:37.040> for<00:05:37.130> my<00:05:37.250> music<00:05:37.580> videos<00:05:40.090> alright<00:05:41.090> as

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
opted for my music videos alright as

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.790 
opted for my music videos alright as
this<00:05:41.750> one<00:05:42.550> except<00:05:43.550> it's<00:05:43.760> not<00:05:43.880> playing<00:05:44.120> it<00:05:44.800> now

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
this one except it's not playing it now

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.200 
this one except it's not playing it now
it's<00:05:45.919> playing<00:05:46.160> it<00:05:46.340> it's<00:05:46.640> only<00:05:46.789> playing<00:05:47.060> the

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
it's playing it it's only playing the

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.270 
it's playing it it's only playing the
audio<00:05:47.300> for<00:05:47.660> this<00:05:47.750> one<00:05:47.960> this<00:05:48.590> is<00:05:48.710> a<00:05:48.770> web<00:05:49.010> EMA

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
audio for this one this is a web EMA

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.450 
audio for this one this is a web EMA
format<00:05:50.000> so<00:05:50.870> there's<00:05:51.050> no<00:05:51.310> decoding<00:05:52.310> in<00:05:52.400> the

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
format so there's no decoding in the

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.880 
format so there's no decoding in the
Raspberry<00:05:52.789> Pi<00:05:52.820> for<00:05:53.210> that<00:05:53.330> the<00:05:54.320> last<00:05:54.590> video

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
Raspberry Pi for that the last video

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.610 
Raspberry Pi for that the last video
we'll<00:05:55.100> look<00:05:55.250> at<00:05:55.460> is<00:05:56.419> this<00:05:56.690> one<00:05:56.840> this<00:05:56.960> is<00:05:57.020> proper

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
we'll look at is this one this is proper

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.400 
we'll look at is this one this is proper
low<00:05:58.100> resolution<00:05:58.850> star<00:05:59.450> spoilers<00:05:59.960> keep<00:06:00.260> on

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
low resolution star spoilers keep on

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:05.920 
low resolution star spoilers keep on
moving<00:06:02.770> now<00:06:03.770> on<00:06:03.860> my<00:06:03.979> system<00:06:04.400> it<00:06:05.120> up<00:06:05.419> scales

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
moving now on my system it up scales

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.990 
moving now on my system it up scales
these<00:06:06.350> videos<00:06:06.860> so<00:06:07.340> we<00:06:07.460> have<00:06:07.610> really<00:06:07.820> low

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
these videos so we have really low

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.920 
these videos so we have really low
quality<00:06:08.710> it<00:06:09.710> just<00:06:09.950> smooths<00:06:10.340> everything<00:06:10.490> out

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
quality it just smooths everything out

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.380 
quality it just smooths everything out
you'll<00:06:11.930> see<00:06:11.960> at<00:06:12.200> the<00:06:12.289> moment<00:06:12.700> when<00:06:13.700> it<00:06:13.850> does

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:14.390 
you'll see at the moment when it does

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.830 
you'll see at the moment when it does
like<00:06:14.570> a<00:06:14.630> fast-moving<00:06:15.050> section<00:06:15.970> the<00:06:16.970> images

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 
like a fast-moving section the images

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.330 
like a fast-moving section the images
just<00:06:17.990> light<00:06:18.200> load<00:06:18.410> of<00:06:18.530> squares<00:06:18.800> I'm<00:06:19.039> not<00:06:19.190> sure

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
just light load of squares I'm not sure

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.860 
just light load of squares I'm not sure
how<00:06:19.460> well<00:06:19.640> this<00:06:19.760> come<00:06:20.000> out<00:06:20.090> on<00:06:20.210> video<00:06:20.479> that's

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
how well this come out on video that's

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.010 
how well this come out on video that's
why<00:06:21.050> I<00:06:21.080> just<00:06:21.289> love<00:06:21.440> talked<00:06:22.250> about<00:06:22.490> it<00:06:23.020> there

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
why I just love talked about it there
