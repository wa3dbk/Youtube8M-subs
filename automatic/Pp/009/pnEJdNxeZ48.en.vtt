00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:22.159 
this is the actual texture pack the ones

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:24.580 
this is the actual texture pack the ones
that<00:04:22.340> have<00:04:22.520> like<00:04:22.939> the<00:04:23.120> couple<00:04:23.270> packed<00:04:23.960> up<00:04:24.110> pngs

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:46.849 
you're going to drag it into the texture

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:52.149 
you're going to drag it into the texture
pack<00:04:47.060> folder<00:04:49.840> just<00:04:50.840> like<00:04:50.960> that<00:04:51.169> I<00:04:51.379> can<00:04:52.039> show

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:52.159 
pack folder just like that I can show

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:53.769 
pack folder just like that I can show
you<00:04:52.219> an<00:04:52.400> alternative<00:04:53.000> method<00:04:53.150> later<00:04:53.539> in<00:04:53.689> the

video now once you have that done make

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:58.990 
video now once you have that done make
sure<00:04:57.289> like<00:04:57.889> close<00:04:58.129> to<00:04:58.159> stuff<00:04:58.520> and<00:04:58.729> then<00:04:58.819> make

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
sure like close to stuff and then make

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.360 
sure like close to stuff and then make
sure<00:04:59.150> that<00:04:59.300> this<00:04:59.449> fax<00:04:59.750> pure<00:05:00.229> bdcraft<00:05:00.650> file

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
sure that this fax pure bdcraft file

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.269 
sure that this fax pure bdcraft file
actually<00:05:02.270> did<00:05:02.569> add<00:05:02.810> those<00:05:03.710> things<00:05:04.009> so<00:05:04.129> make

00:05:04.269 --> 00:05:04.279 
actually did add those things so make

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:05.529 
actually did add those things so make
sure<00:05:04.310> it<00:05:04.520> has<00:05:04.669> everything<00:05:04.939> that<00:05:05.090> I<00:05:05.210> had<00:05:05.389> before

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
sure it has everything that I had before

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:08.769 
sure it has everything that I had before
but<00:05:06.349> it<00:05:06.469> should<00:05:06.590> also<00:05:06.650> have<00:05:07.389> folders<00:05:08.389> such<00:05:08.569> as

00:05:08.769 --> 00:05:08.779 
but it should also have folders such as

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:12.369 
but it should also have folders such as
code<00:05:09.020> chicken<00:05:09.500> and<00:05:10.120> whatnot<00:05:11.120> so<00:05:11.479> that's<00:05:12.139> that

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:12.379 
code chicken and whatnot so that's that

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:14.350 
code chicken and whatnot so that's that
it's<00:05:13.370> up<00:05:13.520> to<00:05:13.669> you<00:05:13.729> what<00:05:13.849> you<00:05:13.879> want<00:05:14.060> to<00:05:14.150> do<00:05:14.240> with

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
it's up to you what you want to do with

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.969 
it's up to you what you want to do with
the<00:05:14.509> actual<00:05:14.629> add<00:05:14.930> on<00:05:15.080> at<00:05:15.229> this<00:05:15.379> point<00:05:15.650> I'm

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 
the actual add on at this point I'm

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:17.080 
the actual add on at this point I'm
going<00:05:16.159> to<00:05:16.250> back<00:05:16.400> it<00:05:16.550> up<00:05:16.639> because<00:05:16.849> I'll

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
going to back it up because I'll

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.459 
going to back it up because I'll
probably<00:05:17.120> end<00:05:17.479> up<00:05:17.569> needing<00:05:17.750> it<00:05:18.050> in<00:05:18.169> the<00:05:18.289> future

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:18.469 
probably end up needing it in the future

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:21.070 
probably end up needing it in the future
again<00:05:18.979> so<00:05:19.580> as<00:05:19.789> I<00:05:19.969> did<00:05:20.180> there<00:05:20.449> or<00:05:20.690> you<00:05:20.960> could

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
again so as I did there or you could

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.439 
again so as I did there or you could
just<00:05:21.110> delete<00:05:21.500> it<00:05:21.560> totally<00:05:22.069> up<00:05:22.219> to<00:05:22.370> you<00:05:22.400> so<00:05:23.180> this

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:23.449 
just delete it totally up to you so this

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:27.360 
just delete it totally up to you so this
is<00:05:23.629> the<00:05:23.900> new<00:05:24.379> and<00:05:24.650> improved<00:05:25.039> you<00:05:25.550> know<00:05:25.639> add-on

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
is the new and improved you know add-on

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.369 
is the new and improved you know add-on
included<00:05:28.370> in<00:05:28.580> everything<00:05:28.849> text<00:05:29.509> your<00:05:29.569> back<00:05:29.719> so

00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:30.379 
included in everything text your back so

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:31.360 
included in everything text your back so
you<00:05:30.409> would<00:05:30.589> install<00:05:30.830> that<00:05:30.979> just<00:05:31.190> like<00:05:31.279> you

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
you would install that just like you

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.829 
you would install that just like you
would<00:05:31.460> any<00:05:31.639> other<00:05:31.699> texture<00:05:32.150> pack<00:05:32.300> and<00:05:32.569> I'm

00:05:32.829 --> 00:05:32.839 
would any other texture pack and I'm

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:34.779 
would any other texture pack and I'm
also<00:05:33.020> going<00:05:33.349> to<00:05:33.469> rename<00:05:33.949> it<00:05:34.129> because<00:05:34.400> you<00:05:34.550> can

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:34.789 
also going to rename it because you can

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:38.860 
also going to rename it because you can
so<00:05:35.509> this<00:05:35.750> is<00:05:35.779> fax<00:05:36.339> for<00:05:37.339> tickets<00:05:37.969> three<00:05:38.690> point

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
so this is fax for tickets three point

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.629 
so this is fax for tickets three point
one<00:05:38.900> point<00:05:39.020> two<00:05:39.409> final<00:05:40.039> and<00:05:40.190> I<00:05:40.250> just<00:05:40.400> like<00:05:40.550> to

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
one point two final and I just like to

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:42.339 
one point two final and I just like to
call<00:05:40.789> it<00:05:40.819> final<00:05:41.300> to<00:05:41.479> let<00:05:41.629> me<00:05:41.719> know<00:05:41.810> that<00:05:41.990> it<00:05:42.110> has

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:42.349 
call it final to let me know that it has

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:44.680 
call it final to let me know that it has
everything<00:05:42.710> in<00:05:42.979> there<00:05:43.159> it's<00:05:43.490> not<00:05:43.639> just<00:05:44.060> the<00:05:44.180> TP

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
everything in there it's not just the TP

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.050 
everything in there it's not just the TP
and<00:05:44.930> it's<00:05:45.379> not<00:05:45.529> just<00:05:45.589> the<00:05:46.189> add-on<00:05:46.520> it's<00:05:46.759> both

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
and it's not just the add-on it's both

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.689 
and it's not just the add-on it's both
so<00:05:47.839> I'm<00:05:47.960> going<00:05:48.080> to<00:05:48.139> actually<00:05:48.379> back<00:05:49.129> that<00:05:49.339> up<00:05:49.370> to

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:49.699 
so I'm going to actually back that up to

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:51.339 
so I'm going to actually back that up to
just<00:05:50.300> for<00:05:50.479> fun<00:05:50.599> because<00:05:50.870> I'll<00:05:50.960> probably<00:05:50.990> need

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:51.349 
just for fun because I'll probably need

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:53.529 
just for fun because I'll probably need
it<00:05:51.500> on<00:05:51.589> my<00:05:51.620> other<00:05:51.800> computers<00:05:52.339> so<00:05:53.240> there<00:05:53.419> it<00:05:53.509> is

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:53.539 
it on my other computers so there it is

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:55.600 
it on my other computers so there it is
and<00:05:53.930> of<00:05:54.349> course<00:05:54.379> if<00:05:54.800> you<00:05:54.889> want<00:05:55.069> to<00:05:55.129> add<00:05:55.279> it<00:05:55.460> you

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
and of course if you want to add it you

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.189 
and of course if you want to add it you
can<00:05:55.759> just<00:05:55.789> go<00:05:56.029> to<00:05:56.089> your<00:05:56.240> run<00:05:56.479> or<00:05:56.810> you<00:05:56.839> could<00:05:57.110> go

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 
can just go to your run or you could go

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:59.079 
can just go to your run or you could go
to<00:05:57.229> your<00:05:57.469> search<00:05:57.680> bar<00:05:57.919> here<00:05:57.949> type<00:05:58.909> in

00:05:59.079 --> 00:05:59.089 
to your search bar here type in

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:02.800 
to your search bar here type in
percentage<00:05:59.719> appdata<00:06:00.349> percentage<00:06:01.599> go<00:06:02.599> into

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
percentage appdata percentage go into

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.200 
percentage appdata percentage go into
your<00:06:02.930> technic<00:06:03.529> launcher<00:06:03.560> folder<00:06:04.159> and<00:06:04.310> if<00:06:05.029> it's

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.210 
your technic launcher folder and if it's

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.790 
your technic launcher folder and if it's
for<00:06:05.360> Tekkit<00:06:05.689> which<00:06:05.810> this<00:06:05.960> one<00:06:06.020> is<00:06:06.319> go<00:06:06.710> into

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
for Tekkit which this one is go into

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.769 
for Tekkit which this one is go into
Tekkit<00:06:07.189> and<00:06:07.310> then<00:06:07.460> texture<00:06:07.759> packs<00:06:07.969> and<00:06:08.300> we'll

00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:08.779 
Tekkit and then texture packs and we'll

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:11.260 
Tekkit and then texture packs and we'll
just<00:06:09.020> throw<00:06:09.110> it<00:06:09.289> in<00:06:09.349> there<00:06:09.789> so<00:06:10.789> the<00:06:11.000> other<00:06:11.120> way

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
just throw it in there so the other way

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.579 
just throw it in there so the other way
you<00:06:11.330> could<00:06:11.449> add<00:06:11.599> it<00:06:11.750> is<00:06:11.870> just<00:06:12.110> once<00:06:12.289> you're<00:06:12.469> in

00:06:12.579 --> 00:06:12.589 
you could add it is just once you're in

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:14.409 
you could add it is just once you're in
the<00:06:12.710> actual<00:06:12.979> game<00:06:13.009> go<00:06:13.310> to<00:06:13.339> texture<00:06:13.699> packs<00:06:13.909> open

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419 
the actual game go to texture packs open

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:15.850 
the actual game go to texture packs open
texture<00:06:14.659> pack<00:06:14.870> folder<00:06:15.080> and<00:06:15.469> then<00:06:15.529> you<00:06:15.710> would

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
texture pack folder and then you would

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.939 
texture pack folder and then you would
just<00:06:15.979> drag<00:06:16.339> the<00:06:16.729> file<00:06:17.120> that<00:06:17.150> we<00:06:17.539> made<00:06:17.949> into

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:18.949 
just drag the file that we made into

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:21.700 
just drag the file that we made into
here<00:06:19.189> just<00:06:20.000> like<00:06:20.089> normal<00:06:20.270> and<00:06:20.569> then<00:06:21.469> you<00:06:21.589> could

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710 
here just like normal and then you could

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.219 
here just like normal and then you could
go<00:06:21.800> ahead<00:06:21.889> and<00:06:22.009> click<00:06:22.219> it<00:06:22.370> up<00:06:22.520> and<00:06:22.960> wait<00:06:23.960> for<00:06:24.139> it

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:28.570 
just as just like any other texture pack
now<00:06:27.349> keep<00:06:27.560> in<00:06:27.620> mind<00:06:27.680> this<00:06:27.949> may<00:06:28.130> take<00:06:28.279> a<00:06:28.339> little

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:28.580 
now keep in mind this may take a little

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.950 
now keep in mind this may take a little

speed of your computer 32 by 32 isn't

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:34.749 
speed of your computer 32 by 32 isn't
too<00:06:32.870> too<00:06:33.050> long<00:06:33.229> and<00:06:33.500> it<00:06:33.919> makes<00:06:34.460> it<00:06:34.610> run<00:06:34.729> a

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:34.759 
too too long and it makes it run a

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:36.279 
too too long and it makes it run a
little<00:06:34.850> bit<00:06:35.180> better<00:06:35.270> a<00:06:35.389> few<00:06:35.600> computers<00:06:35.810> not<00:06:36.110> so

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.289 
little bit better a few computers not so

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:38.110 
little bit better a few computers not so
great<00:06:36.500> otherwise<00:06:37.490> I'd<00:06:37.699> probably<00:06:37.880> recommend

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 
great otherwise I'd probably recommend

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.990 
great otherwise I'd probably recommend
just<00:06:38.479> the<00:06:38.569> 128<00:06:39.020> x<00:06:39.139> 128<00:06:39.590> so<00:06:40.400> if<00:06:40.669> you're<00:06:40.849> having

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000 
just the 128 x 128 so if you're having

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.790 
just the 128 x 128 so if you're having
issues<00:06:41.240> what<00:06:41.569> I<00:06:41.599> would<00:06:41.780> recommend<00:06:41.930> is<00:06:42.440> trying

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
issues what I would recommend is trying

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.070 
issues what I would recommend is trying
rather<00:06:43.340> for<00:06:44.120> the<00:06:44.180> texture<00:06:44.479> pack<00:06:44.630> try<00:06:44.870> rather

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 
rather for the texture pack try rather

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.140 
rather for the texture pack try rather
the<00:06:45.289> one<00:06:45.410> for<00:06:45.650> one<00:06:45.889> point<00:06:46.130> two<00:06:46.310> point<00:06:46.490> five<00:06:46.759> if

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.150 
the one for one point two point five if

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.450 
the one for one point two point five if
that's<00:06:47.660> giving<00:06:48.020> you<00:06:48.080> errors<00:06:48.560> or<00:06:48.889> lack<00:06:49.430> of

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460 
that's giving you errors or lack of

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.189 
that's giving you errors or lack of
textures<00:06:50.060> or<00:06:50.300> certain<00:06:50.509> things<00:06:50.660> that<00:06:50.840> aren't

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.330 
getting the proper bdcraft textures then

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.520

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:54.530 
try the one for one point three point

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.499 
try the one for one point three point
two<00:06:54.889> instead<00:06:55.220> even<00:06:55.639> if<00:06:55.759> it's<00:06:55.910> protect<00:06:56.240> at<00:06:56.389> one

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:56.509 
two instead even if it's protect at one

00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:59.290 
two instead even if it's protect at one
point<00:06:56.690> two<00:06:56.900> point<00:06:57.860> five<00:06:58.099> it<00:06:58.699> doesn't<00:06:59.180> matter

00:06:59.290 --> 00:06:59.300 
point two point five it doesn't matter

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.330 
point two point five it doesn't matter
and<00:06:59.539> by<00:07:00.110> one<00:07:00.289> point<00:07:00.500> two<00:07:00.590> point<00:07:00.740> five<00:07:00.949> I<00:07:01.009> mean

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:01.340 
and by one point two point five I mean

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.430 
and by one point two point five I mean
tecates<00:07:02.030> the<00:07:02.539> newest<00:07:02.780> version<00:07:03.080> of<00:07:03.169> Tekkit

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 
tecates the newest version of Tekkit

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.080 
tecates the newest version of Tekkit
that<00:07:03.560> runs<00:07:03.800> minecraft<00:07:04.430> one<00:07:04.610> point<00:07:04.820> two<00:07:04.940> point

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:05.090 
that runs minecraft one point two point

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.810 
that runs minecraft one point two point
five<00:07:05.650> so<00:07:06.650> there<00:07:06.770> you<00:07:06.860> have<00:07:06.919> it<00:07:07.039> guys<00:07:07.160> we<00:07:07.669> have

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:07.820 
five so there you have it guys we have

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.029 
five so there you have it guys we have
specs<00:07:08.180> installed<00:07:08.660> as<00:07:08.930> you<00:07:08.960> can<00:07:09.110> see<00:07:09.380> nice<00:07:09.740> and

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:10.039 
specs installed as you can see nice and

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:12.370 
specs installed as you can see nice and
pretty<00:07:10.310> I'll<00:07:11.270> have<00:07:11.419> this<00:07:11.539> texture<00:07:11.870> pack<00:07:12.050> it's

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:12.380 
pretty I'll have this texture pack it's

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.469 
pretty I'll have this texture pack it's
the<00:07:12.530> best<00:07:12.740> now<00:07:13.370> this<00:07:13.520> is<00:07:13.669> the<00:07:13.699> 32<00:07:14.060> bit<00:07:14.150> so<00:07:14.419> it

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:14.479 
the best now this is the 32 bit so it

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:16.960 
the best now this is the 32 bit so it
doesn't<00:07:14.750> look<00:07:14.810> quite<00:07:15.110> as<00:07:15.259> pretty<00:07:16.190> and<00:07:16.610> awesome

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:16.970 
doesn't look quite as pretty and awesome

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.050 
doesn't look quite as pretty and awesome
but<00:07:17.389> it<00:07:17.539> still<00:07:17.810> looks<00:07:18.259> awesome<00:07:18.800> nonetheless

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:19.060 
but it still looks awesome nonetheless

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.310 
but it still looks awesome nonetheless
so<00:07:20.060> let's<00:07:20.210> check<00:07:20.360> out<00:07:20.479> the<00:07:20.509> items<00:07:20.870> make<00:07:21.169> sure

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:21.320 
so let's check out the items make sure

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.420 
so let's check out the items make sure
they're<00:07:21.470> all<00:07:21.500> working<00:07:23.770> one<00:07:24.770> that<00:07:24.979> I<00:07:25.039> noticed

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:25.430 
they're all working one that I noticed

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.040 
they're all working one that I noticed
most<00:07:25.610> often<00:07:25.970> is<00:07:26.090> the<00:07:26.180> machines<00:07:26.539> and<00:07:26.840> stuff

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.050 
most often is the machines and stuff

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.570 
most often is the machines and stuff
like<00:07:27.380> usually<00:07:27.710> the<00:07:27.770> machines<00:07:28.099> won't<00:07:28.280> get<00:07:28.460> it

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:28.580 
like usually the machines won't get it

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.159 
like usually the machines won't get it
so<00:07:28.699> that<00:07:28.880> looks<00:07:29.030> good<00:07:29.210> that's<00:07:29.599> definitely<00:07:29.990> the

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:30.169 
so that looks good that's definitely the

00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:31.809 
so that looks good that's definitely the
new<00:07:30.500> one<00:07:30.650> let's<00:07:30.860> check<00:07:31.009> out<00:07:31.130> like<00:07:31.250> an<00:07:31.400> engine

00:07:31.809 --> 00:07:31.819 
new one let's check out like an engine

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:37.749 
new one let's check out like an engine
see<00:07:32.210> how<00:07:32.479> they<00:07:32.630> look<00:07:36.009> looks<00:07:37.009> good<00:07:37.159> to<00:07:37.310> me<00:07:37.340> it's

00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:37.759 
see how they look looks good to me it's

00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:40.029 
see how they look looks good to me it's
definitely<00:07:38.479> the<00:07:38.750> snacks<00:07:39.259> because<00:07:39.620> the<00:07:39.919> other

00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:40.039 
definitely the snacks because the other

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:41.260 
definitely the snacks because the other
ones<00:07:40.220> are<00:07:40.340> rather<00:07:40.580> ugly<00:07:40.729> let's<00:07:41.000> check<00:07:41.150> out<00:07:41.240> a

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:41.270 
ones are rather ugly let's check out a

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.399 
ones are rather ugly let's check out a
macerator<00:07:41.750> because<00:07:41.960> those<00:07:42.080> are<00:07:42.199> the<00:07:42.229> most

00:07:42.399 --> 00:07:42.409 
macerator because those are the most

00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:44.170 
macerator because those are the most
obvious<00:07:42.620> they're<00:07:43.039> just<00:07:43.159> big<00:07:43.310> white<00:07:43.550> blocks<00:07:43.909> if

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:44.180 
obvious they're just big white blocks if

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.610 
obvious they're just big white blocks if
they<00:07:44.270> don't<00:07:44.419> work<00:07:44.599> oh<00:07:44.810> yeah<00:07:45.320> that's

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:45.620 
they don't work oh yeah that's

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.529 
they don't work oh yeah that's
definitely<00:07:45.860> specs<00:07:46.280> so<00:07:46.729> it's<00:07:47.030> working<00:07:47.360> good

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:47.539 
definitely specs so it's working good

00:07:47.539 --> 00:07:49.360 
definitely specs so it's working good
once<00:07:48.199> again<00:07:48.289> I'll<00:07:48.469> leave<00:07:48.620> the<00:07:48.770> links<00:07:49.070> to<00:07:49.219> like

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:49.370 
once again I'll leave the links to like

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:50.920 
once again I'll leave the links to like
winrar<00:07:49.610> and<00:07:50.060> all<00:07:50.120> that<00:07:50.270> good<00:07:50.389> stuff<00:07:50.449> in<00:07:50.840> the
