00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
myself the drawback is of course that

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.229 
myself the drawback is of course that
black<00:02:50.170> has<00:02:50.350> weakened<00:02:50.739> to<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.070> b5<00:02:51.549> square<00:02:51.970> and

blockade<00:04:25.440> against<00:04:25.979> the<00:04:26.460> depot<00:04:28.610> okay<00:04:32.389> let's

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
blockade against the depot okay let's

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.430 
blockade against the depot okay let's
see<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:35.550> bishop<00:04:35.699> on<00:04:36.030> b6<00:04:36.510> is<00:04:36.750> also<00:04:37.169> played

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
see the bishop on b6 is also played

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.800 
see the bishop on b6 is also played
there<00:04:37.680> because<00:04:37.979> I<00:04:38.190> thought<00:04:38.400> that<00:04:38.550> maybe<00:04:38.729> 95<00:04:39.330> is

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
there because I thought that maybe 95 is

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.800 
there because I thought that maybe 95 is
one<00:04:40.020> of<00:04:40.169> the<00:04:40.320> ideas<00:04:40.380> and<00:04:40.860> then<00:04:41.610> i<00:04:41.729> can<00:04:42.150> probably

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
one of the ideas and then i can probably

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.379 
one of the ideas and then i can probably
take<00:04:43.050> a<00:04:43.500> five<00:04:43.860> but<00:04:44.250> even<00:04:44.580> that<00:04:44.760> is<00:04:44.909> not<00:04:44.940> so

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
take a five but even that is not so

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:51.589 
take a five but even that is not so
clear<00:04:47.479> 95<00:04:48.479> bishop<00:04:48.900> a<00:04:48.990> five-night<00:04:49.500> c4<00:04:50.360> it's<00:04:51.360> not

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599 
clear 95 bishop a five-night c4 it's not

00:04:51.599 --> 00:05:05.479 
clear 95 bishop a five-night c4 it's not
not<00:04:52.320> bad<00:04:54.169> okay

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:05.489 

00:05:05.489 --> 00:05:09.839 

yeah<00:05:06.489> I<00:05:06.789> don't<00:05:07.749> really<00:05:08.169> know<00:05:08.529> maybe<00:05:08.919> I<00:05:09.039> I<00:05:09.459> need

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:09.849

00:07:01.769 --> 00:07:01.779 
seems around here I also thought that

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:05.779 
seems around here I also thought that
what<00:07:02.169> should<00:07:02.409> have<00:07:02.559> little<00:07:02.769> something<00:07:04.289> and

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:05.789 
what should have little something and

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:10.339 
what should have little something and
yeah<00:07:06.789> maybe<00:07:06.999> 94<00:07:07.860> immediately<00:07:08.860> was<00:07:09.069> was<00:07:09.399> easier

00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:10.349 
yeah maybe 94 immediately was was easier

00:07:10.349 --> 00:07:13.700 
yeah maybe 94 immediately was was easier

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.800 
here the computer wants to do F
this<00:07:14.710> is<00:07:14.919> a<00:07:14.949> move<00:07:15.220> I<00:07:15.370> really<00:07:15.759> cannot<00:07:16.360> believe

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:16.810 
this is a move I really cannot believe

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.680 
this is a move I really cannot believe
in<00:07:17.080> it<00:07:17.440> seems<00:07:17.710> very<00:07:17.949> weakening<00:07:18.550> I'll<00:07:19.300> care

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:19.690 
in it seems very weakening I'll care

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:29.400 
in it seems very weakening I'll care
there's<00:07:19.930> d<00:07:20.169> for<00:07:20.530> maybe<00:07:27.690> the<00:07:28.690> a<00:07:28.720> black<00:07:29.020> is<00:07:29.169> far

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:29.410 
there's d for maybe the a black is far

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.189 
there's d for maybe the a black is far
too<00:07:29.440> active<00:07:29.979> here<00:07:30.190> with<00:07:31.000> whites<00:07:31.270> open<00:07:31.720> King<00:07:31.990> I

00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:32.199 
too active here with whites open King I

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:34.770 
too active here with whites open King I
don't<00:07:32.560> like<00:07:32.620> that<00:07:33.009> yeah<00:07:33.849> i<00:07:33.880> think<00:07:34.000> it<00:07:34.270> was<00:07:34.419> okay

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:34.780 
don't like that yeah i think it was okay

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.300 
don't like that yeah i think it was okay
i<00:07:34.810> played<00:07:35.259> this<00:07:35.440> at<00:07:35.650> least<00:07:35.889> it<00:07:36.099> should

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:36.310 
i played this at least it should

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:44.490 
i played this at least it should
preserve<00:07:36.910> a<00:07:37.150> little<00:07:37.419> little<00:07:38.410> edge<00:07:38.590> so<00:07:43.500> you

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:44.500 
preserve a little little edge so you

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.010 
preserve a little little edge so you
know<00:07:44.590> Peters<00:07:45.190> also<00:07:45.610> look<00:07:45.820> a<00:07:46.030> eight<00:07:46.360> just

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:47.020 
know Peters also look a eight just

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.170 
know Peters also look a eight just
covering<00:07:47.710> all<00:07:47.979> that<00:07:48.280> and<00:07:48.520> keeping<00:07:48.940> the

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:49.180 
covering all that and keeping the

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.260 
covering all that and keeping the
subject<00:07:49.599> does<00:07:50.470> not<00:07:50.680> seem<00:07:50.949> to<00:07:50.979> be<00:07:51.160> bad<00:07:51.520> yeah

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:52.270 
subject does not seem to be bad yeah

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.050 
subject does not seem to be bad yeah
black<00:07:52.570> has<00:07:52.750> enough<00:07:53.169> activity<00:07:53.440> problem<00:07:54.190> the

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:55.060 
black has enough activity problem the

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:59.129 
black has enough activity problem the
way<00:07:55.210> you<00:07:55.270> played<00:07:55.660> it<00:07:57.180> he<00:07:58.180> just<00:07:58.389> needs<00:07:58.630> to<00:07:58.840> avoid

00:07:59.129 --> 00:07:59.139 
way you played it he just needs to avoid
