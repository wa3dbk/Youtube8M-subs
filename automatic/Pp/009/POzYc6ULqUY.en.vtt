00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
which is this one here it pan into this

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.460 
which is this one here it pan into this
here<00:01:40.500> looking<00:01:41.009> at<00:01:41.329> mr.<00:01:42.329> Reiner<00:01:42.780> Brown<00:01:43.170> here

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
here looking at mr. Reiner Brown here

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.219 
here looking at mr. Reiner Brown here
who<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:43.979> suspect<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.670> armored<00:01:45.000> titan<00:01:45.229> very

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
who I suspect is the armored titan very

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.200 
who I suspect is the armored titan very
mind<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.560> haven't<00:01:46.829> read<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.040> manga<00:01:47.280> yet<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:47.700> I

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
mind I haven't read the manga yet so I

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.020 
mind I haven't read the manga yet so I
think<00:01:48.770> Ryan<00:01:49.770> around<00:01:49.920> here<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.820> armored

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
think Ryan around here is the armored

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.450 
think Ryan around here is the armored
titan<00:01:51.409> and<00:01:52.409> it's<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:53.549> drinking<00:01:53.939> away<00:01:54.799> so<00:01:55.799> one

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
titan and it's just drinking away so one

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.639 
titan and it's just drinking away so one
of<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.610> sequence<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.659> training<00:01:58.170> of

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
of the sequence in this training of

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.260 
of the sequence in this training of
irony<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.640> he<00:02:00.090> had<00:02:00.299> defective<00:02:01.020> equipment<00:02:01.259> and

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
irony is he had defective equipment and

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.630 
irony is he had defective equipment and
strangely<00:02:03.270> enough<00:02:03.860> they<00:02:04.860> have<00:02:05.040> never<00:02:05.280> had

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
strangely enough they have never had

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.990 
strangely enough they have never had
defective<00:02:06.390> equipment<00:02:06.600> before<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.220> is

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
defective equipment before so is it is

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.300 
defective equipment before so is it is
it<00:02:09.239> just<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.509> luck<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.869> draw<00:02:10.190> would<00:02:11.190> our

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
it just a luck of the draw would our

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.520 
it just a luck of the draw would our
main<00:02:11.760> hero<00:02:12.120> get<00:02:12.750> the

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
main hero get the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.390 
main hero get the
I<00:02:13.590> mean<00:02:14.100> out<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.640> million

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
I mean out of a million

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.070 
I mean out of a million
three-dimensional<00:02:17.400> equipment<00:02:18.360> he<00:02:18.840> would

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
three-dimensional equipment he would

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.230 
three-dimensional equipment he would
have<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.380> only<00:02:20.010> one<00:02:20.220> that<00:02:20.520> is<00:02:20.640> broken<00:02:21.120> and

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
have the only one that is broken and

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.720 
have the only one that is broken and
effective<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.319> think<00:02:22.860> there<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.220> some<00:02:23.459> kind<00:02:23.700> of

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
effective I think there is some kind of

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.210 
effective I think there is some kind of
plot<00:02:24.000> dad<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.569> actually<00:02:25.020> stop<00:02:25.380> him<00:02:25.620> from<00:02:25.830> being

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
plot dad to actually stop him from being

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.699 
plot dad to actually stop him from being
a<00:02:28.580> soldier<00:02:29.580> yeah<00:02:30.480> I<00:02:30.720> think<00:02:31.140> there's<00:02:31.380> a<00:02:31.440> plot

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
a soldier yeah I think there's a plot

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.850 
a soldier yeah I think there's a plot
maybe<00:02:32.220> it's<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.459> plot<00:02:32.970> by<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.180> tree<00:02:33.860> three

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
maybe it's a plot by the tree three

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.670 
maybe it's a plot by the tree three
other<00:02:35.700> people<00:02:35.819> who<00:02:36.480> are<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.810> Titans<00:02:37.200> which<00:02:37.470> is

hopes<00:03:00.950> this<00:03:01.950> tree<00:03:02.400> might<00:03:02.730> have<00:03:02.880> sabotages

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
hopes this tree might have sabotages

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.390 
hopes this tree might have sabotages
equipment<00:03:03.989> because<00:03:04.080> they<00:03:04.319> don't<00:03:04.500> want<00:03:04.650> their

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
fellow titan to food to die i guess

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.699 
fellow titan to food to die i guess
there's<00:03:11.430> something<00:03:12.090> there<00:03:12.420> i<00:03:12.750> think<00:03:12.900> i<00:03:13.440> think

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
though this is the first I've heard of

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.160 
though this is the first I've heard of
voltage<00:03:32.940> pictures<00:03:33.090> so<00:03:33.540> this<00:03:33.720> is<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.930> first

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
voltage pictures so this is the first

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.870 
voltage pictures so this is the first
time<00:03:34.380> that<00:03:34.440> they<00:03:35.040> have<00:03:35.160> encountered<00:03:35.670> such<00:03:35.850> a

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
time that they have encountered such a

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.900 
time that they have encountered such a
problem<00:03:36.450> it<00:03:37.380> seems<00:03:37.560> there's<00:03:37.920> a<00:03:38.040> need<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.430> start

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
problem it seems there's a need to start

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.259 
problem it seems there's a need to start
checking<00:03:39.239> them<00:03:39.420> during<00:03:39.660> maintenance<00:03:41.269> then

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
checking them during maintenance then

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.150 
checking them during maintenance then
that<00:03:42.510> means<00:03:42.690> he<00:03:43.049> managed<00:03:43.590> to<00:03:43.739> stay<00:03:43.950> upright

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
that means he managed to stay upright

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.580 
that means he managed to stay upright
with<00:03:44.579> faulty<00:03:44.970> equipment<00:03:45.060> for<00:03:45.570> a<00:03:45.600> bit<00:03:45.870> so<00:03:46.290> this

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
with faulty equipment for a bit so this

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.300 
with faulty equipment for a bit so this
display<00:03:47.010> display<00:03:48.380> this<00:03:49.380> place<00:03:49.590> that<00:03:49.829> every

the kettle was strangely excited and I
heard<00:04:32.759> unfamiliar<00:04:33.630> tremors<00:04:34.080> gradually

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
heard unfamiliar tremors gradually

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.379 
heard unfamiliar tremors gradually
growing<00:04:35.220> louder<00:04:38.000> eventually<00:04:39.000> I<00:04:39.030> realized
