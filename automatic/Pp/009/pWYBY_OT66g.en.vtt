going to do is we're going to go into
the<00:00:42.030> verse<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.420> then<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.690> chorus<00:00:43.020> I'll<00:00:43.140> just

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
the verse and then the chorus I'll just

play<00:00:43.440> little<00:00:43.680> snippets<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.100> both<00:00:44.250> will<00:00:44.940> zoom

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
play little snippets of both will zoom

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.700 
play little snippets of both will zoom
in<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.360> my<00:00:45.450> handshape<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.170> I'll<00:00:46.410> break<00:00:46.559> it

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
in to my handshape and I'll break it

00:00:46.710 --> 00:01:12.620 
in to my handshape and I'll break it
down<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.160> let's<00:00:47.280> get<00:00:47.399> started

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.780 

all<00:01:13.500> right<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:13.799> let's<00:01:13.979> break<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.310> down<00:01:14.369> we're

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
all right so let's break that down we're

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.090 
all right so let's break that down we're
going<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.000> start<00:01:15.329> on<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.990> string<00:01:16.079> on<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
going to start on the a string on the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.319 
going to start on the a string on the
fifth<00:01:17.310> fret<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.670> we're<00:01:17.880> going<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.060> hammer<00:01:18.210> on

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
fifth fret and we're going to hammer on

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:20.870 
fifth fret and we're going to hammer on
to<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.689> seventh<00:01:19.079> so<00:01:19.799> it'll<00:01:19.979> be<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.549> kind<00:01:20.850> of

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
to the seventh so it'll be that kind of

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.279 
to the seventh so it'll be that kind of
motion<00:01:21.060> then<00:01:21.659> we're<00:01:21.750> going<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.899> go<00:01:21.990> back<00:01:22.259> to

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
motion then we're going to go back to

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:25.310 
motion then we're going to go back to
the<00:01:22.680> fifth<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.280> then<00:01:24.090> we're<00:01:24.240> going<00:01:24.329> to<00:01:24.420> hit

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
the fifth and then we're going to hit

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.600 
the fifth and then we're going to hit
the<00:01:25.590> seventh<00:01:26.130> fret<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.820> low<00:01:27.750> E<00:01:28.250> back<00:01:29.250> again

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
the seventh fret on the low E back again

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.639 
the seventh fret on the low E back again
to<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.850> fifth<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.390> back<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
to the fifth on the a back to the

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.010 
to the fifth on the a back to the
seventh<00:01:32.039> on<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.280> E<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.090> then<00:01:33.750> we're<00:01:33.869> going<00:01:33.990> to

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
seventh on the E and then we're going to

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.109 
seventh on the E and then we're going to
go<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.470> third<00:01:34.710> fret<00:01:35.009> on<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.220> E<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.700> then

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
go to the third fret on the E and then

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.410 
go to the third fret on the E and then
open<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.560> there's<00:01:37.710> two<00:01:37.979> actual<00:01:38.789> parts<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.390> that

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
open so there's two actual parts to that

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.760 
open so there's two actual parts to that
so<00:01:39.750> we're<00:01:39.869> going<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.020> cover<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.380> first<00:01:40.590> one

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
so we're going to cover the first one

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.029 
so we're going to cover the first one
first<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.460> goes<00:01:45.560> so<00:01:46.560> let's<00:01:46.679> do<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:46.890> again

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
first so it goes so let's do that again

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:54.880 
first so it goes so let's do that again
it's

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:02.730 

so<00:01:55.580> let's<00:01:55.730> do<00:01:55.850> that<00:01:55.880> closers<00:01:56.570> in<00:01:56.600> real<00:01:56.870> time

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.429 

and<00:02:02.860> so<00:02:03.520> that's<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.909> first<00:02:04.180> portion<00:02:04.540> and<00:02:04.899> then

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
and so that's the first portion and then

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:10.020 
and so that's the first portion and then
the<00:02:05.530> second<00:02:05.920> one<00:02:06.100> he<00:02:06.520> goes<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:09.580> it's<00:02:09.729> just<00:02:09.849> a

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
the second one he goes so it's just a

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.300 
the second one he goes so it's just a
little<00:02:10.239> bit<00:02:10.450> shorter<00:02:10.780> it<00:02:10.899> goes<00:02:13.980> now<00:02:14.980> let's<00:02:15.130> put

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
little bit shorter it goes now let's put

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.890 
little bit shorter it goes now let's put
it<00:02:15.400> together

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:30.640 

and<00:02:22.519> try<00:02:23.519> it<00:02:23.579> again

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.760 

and<00:02:31.010> that's<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.370> for<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.940> verse<00:02:32.320> and<00:02:33.320> then<00:02:33.560> as

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
and that's it for the verse and then as

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.590 
and that's it for the verse and then as
he<00:02:33.890> goes<00:02:34.040> into<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.310> chorus<00:02:34.700> he's<00:02:35.210> on<00:02:35.450> the

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
he goes into the chorus he's on the

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.290 
he goes into the chorus he's on the
fifth<00:02:35.750> fret<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:36.380> he's<00:02:37.070> hittin<00:02:37.340> a<00:02:37.400> D<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:37.940> then

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
fifth fret and he's hittin a D and then

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.530 
fifth fret and he's hittin a D and then
he<00:02:38.360> slides<00:02:38.570> down<00:02:38.690> one<00:02:39.350> more<00:02:43.240> just<00:02:44.240> a<00:02:44.360> typical

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
he slides down one more just a typical

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.260 
he slides down one more just a typical
power<00:02:44.960> chord<00:02:45.380> shake<00:02:45.680> those<00:02:46.550> two<00:02:46.790> frets<00:02:47.030> right

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
power chord shake those two frets right

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.090 
power chord shake those two frets right
there<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:49.220> then<00:02:49.520> you<00:02:49.610> can<00:02:49.730> hit<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:50.090> e<00:02:50.120> twice

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
there and then you can hit the e twice

00:02:51.100 --> 00:03:00.820 
there and then you can hit the e twice
and<00:02:52.100> then<00:02:52.970> go<00:02:53.720> from<00:02:53.900> there<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.590> low<00:02:54.740> E<00:02:59.830> so

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
and then go from there to the low E so

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.600 
and then go from there to the low E so
it's<00:03:01.010> a<00:03:01.160> five<00:03:01.550> three<00:03:02.360> oh<00:03:02.630> three<00:03:03.370> five<00:03:04.370> and

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
it's a five three oh three five and

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.960 
it's a five three oh three five and
seven<00:03:04.880> and<00:03:05.270> then<00:03:05.950> click<00:03:06.950> one<00:03:07.130> on<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.400> a<00:03:07.430> live

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
seven and then click one on the a live

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:15.570 
seven and then click one on the a live
and<00:03:08.360> then<00:03:08.450> back<00:03:08.600> to<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.810> chord<00:03:09.020> shape

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:27.270 

we<00:03:16.580> do<00:03:16.670> a<00:03:16.700> little<00:03:16.940> slower

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.010 

so<00:03:27.520> that's<00:03:27.700> it<00:03:27.910> for<00:03:28.060> that<00:03:28.120> now<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.480> lead<00:03:28.720> break

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
so that's it for that now the lead break

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.010 
so that's it for that now the lead break
is<00:03:29.290> on<00:03:29.770> the<00:03:29.860> g<00:03:30.010> string<00:03:30.090> second<00:03:31.090> fret<00:03:31.240> and<00:03:31.570> he's

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
is on the g string second fret and he's

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.690 
is on the g string second fret and he's
doing<00:03:32.200> a<00:03:32.350> little<00:03:32.380> bend<00:03:32.890> and<00:03:33.220> he's<00:03:33.400> picking

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
doing a little bend and he's picking

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.400 
doing a little bend and he's picking
very<00:03:34.000> quickly<00:03:34.270> with<00:03:34.480> his<00:03:34.570> right<00:03:34.810> hand<00:03:35.070> and

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.320 

then<00:03:41.410> he<00:03:41.470> slides<00:03:41.920> up<00:03:42.250> on<00:03:42.460> the<00:03:42.550> g<00:03:42.700> string<00:03:42.730> again

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
then he slides up on the g string again

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:50.130 
then he slides up on the g string again
to<00:03:44.110> the<00:03:44.230> 14th<00:03:44.680> fret<00:03:48.600> so<00:03:49.600> play<00:03:49.780> around<00:03:49.990> with

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
to the 14th fret so play around with

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.660 
to the 14th fret so play around with
that<00:03:50.320> and<00:03:50.530> add<00:03:50.680> a<00:03:50.710> little<00:03:50.950> delay<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:51.460> it'll

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
that and add a little delay and it'll

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.930 
that and add a little delay and it'll
sound<00:03:51.820> just<00:03:52.090> like<00:03:52.210> the<00:03:52.300> record<00:03:52.570> now<00:03:53.290> also

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
sound just like the record now also

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.090 
sound just like the record now also
there's<00:03:54.940> an<00:03:55.150> octave<00:03:55.630> shape<00:03:55.960> in<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.410> bridge<00:03:56.710> so

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
there's an octave shape in the bridge so

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.180 
there's an octave shape in the bridge so
he's<00:03:57.340> got<00:03:57.580> the<00:03:58.150> 7th<00:03:58.870> fret<00:03:59.140> on<00:03:59.350> the<00:03:59.440> low<00:03:59.620> E<00:03:59.770> and

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
then 9 on the D so it's an octave shape

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.600 
then 9 on the D so it's an octave shape
and<00:04:04.450> then<00:04:05.350> he's<00:04:05.560> got<00:04:05.740> a<00:04:05.770> bit<00:04:05.920> of<00:04:06.010> a<00:04:06.070> phase<00:04:06.310> 90

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610

and then he's got a bit of a phase 90
during<00:04:07.180> that<00:04:07.300> break<00:04:07.570> and<00:04:07.780> then<00:04:08.140> you<00:04:08.260> just
