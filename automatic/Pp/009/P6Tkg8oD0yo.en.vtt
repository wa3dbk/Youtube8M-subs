 Alexey's journey on the map of 11 countries 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.119
 three months on the road and it’s almost a joke 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.710

 I had a backpack with three 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.100
 he is about 11 kilograms each time I 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.710

 hygiene like 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.690
 and a bicycle repair kit had to 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.520
 go and in the rain and even once 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.830
 spend the night on a bench every day on 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.720

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.860

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.810

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.000
 city ​​ledger to the highest in the country 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.190

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.500
 Amsterdam principle is the capital itself 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.500
 cyclists 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.860

 hefty parking by the river 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.420

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.820
 Bicycle for an amazing ride 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.070

 this way let's say well and a year and a half 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.760

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.350
