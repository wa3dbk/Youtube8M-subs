00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
through that cloud through that next gap

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.340 
through that cloud through that next gap
and<00:01:40.790> into<00:01:40.970> that<00:01:41.120> other<00:01:41.270> cloud<00:01:41.600> looks<00:01:42.260> like

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
and into that other cloud looks like

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.580 
and into that other cloud looks like
that's<00:01:42.650> what's<00:01:42.920> happening<00:01:43.250> anyhow<00:01:43.960> so<00:01:44.960> here's

quickly since this day we've seen them

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:00.550 
quickly since this day we've seen them
around

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
around

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.460 
around
we've<00:02:01.490> got<00:02:01.700> glimpses<00:02:02.240> of<00:02:02.270> them<00:02:02.659> all<00:02:03.290> right

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
this is at 50% speed he's zeroing in

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.100 
this is at 50% speed he's zeroing in
there's<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:07.790> shot<00:02:10.330> you<00:02:11.330> know<00:02:11.420> it<00:02:11.810> makes<00:02:11.959> you

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
there's the shot you know it makes you

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.960 
there's the shot you know it makes you
wonder<00:02:12.319> if<00:02:12.560> there's<00:02:12.739> more<00:02:12.799> than<00:02:13.220> one<00:02:13.459> kind<00:02:13.700> of

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.729 
wonder if there's more than one kind of
orb<00:02:14.209> here<00:02:14.680> these<00:02:15.680> just<00:02:16.840> seem<00:02:17.840> different<00:02:18.110> than

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
orb here these just seem different than

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.320 
orb here these just seem different than
the<00:02:18.950> other<00:02:19.099> ones<00:02:19.340> they<00:02:19.579> seem<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.969> move

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
the other ones they seem to move

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.300 
the other ones they seem to move
more<00:02:21.660> quickly<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.380> changed<00:02:22.980> direction

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
more quickly and changed direction

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.510 
more quickly and changed direction
there's<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:24.030> shot<00:02:24.270> a<00:02:25.020> lot<00:02:25.770> of<00:02:25.890> orbs<00:02:26.190> we<00:02:26.340> see

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
there's the shot a lot of orbs we see

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.860 
there's the shot a lot of orbs we see
don't<00:02:26.730> move<00:02:26.970> so<00:02:27.420> quickly<00:02:29.300> alright<00:02:30.300> so<00:02:30.600> here's

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
don't move so quickly alright so here's

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.220 
don't move so quickly alright so here's
a<00:02:30.930> slowed<00:02:31.230> version<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.950> clip<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:33.230> it'll

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
a slowed version of the clip and it'll

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.650 
a slowed version of the clip and it'll
run<00:02:34.410> at<00:02:34.590> full<00:02:34.770> speed<00:02:34.830> until<00:02:35.790> we<00:02:36.030> get<00:02:36.210> close<00:02:36.480> to

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
run at full speed until we get close to

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.090 
run at full speed until we get close to
the<00:02:36.780> shot<00:02:36.990> and<00:02:37.260> then<00:02:37.440> I'll<00:02:37.560> cut<00:02:37.770> it<00:02:37.890> down<00:02:38.040> to

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
the shot and then I'll cut it down to

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.140 
the shot and then I'll cut it down to
half<00:02:38.460> speed<00:02:38.820> when<00:02:39.060> i<00:02:39.090> zoom<00:02:39.390> in<00:02:40.820> he's<00:02:41.820> entering

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
half speed when i zoom in he's entering

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.910 
half speed when i zoom in he's entering
you<00:02:42.390> can<00:02:42.540> see<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.840> little<00:02:42.960> skyfish<00:02:43.380> thing

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
you can see the little skyfish thing

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.980 
you can see the little skyfish thing
buzzing<00:02:44.400> around<00:02:44.520> there<00:02:45.000> I'm<00:02:45.540> actually<00:02:45.690> have

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
buzzing around there I'm actually have

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.320 
buzzing around there I'm actually have
some<00:02:46.230> footage<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.830> may<00:02:47.610> edit<00:02:47.940> some<00:02:48.150> of<00:02:48.240> those

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
some footage I may edit some of those

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.290 
some footage I may edit some of those
just<00:02:48.630> to<00:02:48.720> put<00:02:48.930> them<00:02:49.020> up<00:02:49.490> and<00:02:50.490> some<00:02:51.090> of<00:02:51.210> those

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
just to put them up and some of those

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.820 
just to put them up and some of those
are<00:02:51.480> insects<00:02:51.870> but<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.230> other<00:02:52.350> thing<00:02:52.650> there's

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
are insects but the other thing there's

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.710 
are insects but the other thing there's
are<00:02:52.920> those<00:02:53.100> like<00:02:53.460> right<00:02:53.760> there<00:02:53.970> that's<00:02:54.210> one<00:02:54.630> of

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
are those like right there that's one of

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.840 
are those like right there that's one of
those<00:02:54.840> white<00:02:55.080> sky<00:02:55.410> fish<00:02:55.680> okay<00:02:56.160> here<00:02:56.310> he<00:02:56.370> comes

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
those white sky fish okay here he comes

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.580 
those white sky fish okay here he comes
half<00:02:57.330> speed<00:02:57.570> zoomed<00:02:58.200> in<00:02:58.470> and<00:03:00.320> there's<00:03:01.320> the

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
half speed zoomed in and there's the

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.080 
half speed zoomed in and there's the
shot<00:03:02.600> crazy<00:03:03.600> and<00:03:04.230> anyhow<00:03:05.130> right<00:03:05.160> there<00:03:05.760> he

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
shot crazy and anyhow right there he

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.760 
shot crazy and anyhow right there he
takes<00:03:06.120> another<00:03:06.600> shot<00:03:06.900> but<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.320> camera's

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
takes another shot but the camera's

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.340 
takes another shot but the camera's
quality<00:03:08.430> is<00:03:08.520> not<00:03:08.700> good<00:03:08.940> enough<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.450> allow<00:03:10.080> me

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
quality is not good enough to allow me

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.900 
quality is not good enough to allow me
to<00:03:10.470> do<00:03:10.620> much<00:03:10.800> with<00:03:11.010> that<00:03:11.040> other<00:03:11.250> shot<00:03:11.580> it<00:03:11.790> is

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
to do much with that other shot it is

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.930 
to do much with that other shot it is
just<00:03:12.150> so<00:03:12.330> fast<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:12.960> so<00:03:13.650> faint<00:03:13.980> that<00:03:14.400> I<00:03:14.430> don't

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
just so fast and so faint that I don't

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.720 
just so fast and so faint that I don't
think<00:03:15.150> I<00:03:15.240> could<00:03:15.420> do<00:03:15.540> much<00:03:15.720> with<00:03:15.960> it<00:03:16.460> he<00:03:17.460> kept

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
think I could do much with it he kept

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.280 
think I could do much with it he kept
going<00:03:17.910> underneath<00:03:18.300> the<00:03:18.570> trail<00:03:18.810> for<00:03:19.050> quite<00:03:19.260> a

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
going underneath the trail for quite a

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.160 
going underneath the trail for quite a
while<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:19.770> then<00:03:19.890> just<00:03:20.130> started<00:03:20.430> going<00:03:20.580> up<00:03:20.910> and

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
while and then just started going up and

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.660 
while and then just started going up and
quite<00:03:22.170> a<00:03:22.230> few<00:03:22.500> of<00:03:22.590> them<00:03:22.650> did<00:03:22.860> that<00:03:23.070> and<00:03:23.310> we<00:03:23.460> just

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
quite a few of them did that and we just

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.860 
quite a few of them did that and we just
couldn't<00:03:24.240> see<00:03:24.360> him<00:03:24.480> anymore

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
couldn't see him anymore

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.340 
couldn't see him anymore
at<00:03:25.230> one<00:03:25.500> point<00:03:26.120> so<00:03:27.120> I'm<00:03:27.600> gonna<00:03:27.750> be<00:03:27.900> doing<00:03:27.930> some

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
at one point so I'm gonna be doing some

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.160 
at one point so I'm gonna be doing some
work<00:03:28.380> on<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.940> interesting<00:03:30.420> objects<00:03:30.840> now<00:03:31.020> that

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
work on the interesting objects now that

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.790 
work on the interesting objects now that
I<00:03:31.200> have<00:03:31.440> a<00:03:31.770> relatively<00:03:32.490> good<00:03:32.850> zoom<00:03:33.120> method<00:03:33.570> and

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
I have a relatively good zoom method and

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.130 
I have a relatively good zoom method and
the<00:03:34.800> magnetic<00:03:35.310> halo<00:03:35.730> objects<00:03:36.270> are<00:03:36.570> some<00:03:36.990> of

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
the magnetic halo objects are some of

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.870 
the magnetic halo objects are some of
the<00:03:37.200> most<00:03:37.350> interesting<00:03:37.890> objects<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.430> me<00:03:38.550> with

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
the most interesting objects to me with

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.360 
the most interesting objects to me with
regard<00:03:39.060> to<00:03:39.300> the<00:03:39.450> moon<00:03:39.660> now<00:03:40.440> here's<00:03:40.800> one<00:03:41.190> of<00:03:41.220> the

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
regard to the moon now here's one of the

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.760 
regard to the moon now here's one of the
more<00:03:41.600> significant<00:03:42.600> ones<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.140> just<00:03:43.230> look<00:03:43.590> at

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
more significant ones and just look at

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.400 
more significant ones and just look at
all<00:03:43.860> that<00:03:44.070> halo<00:03:44.490> it<00:03:45.300> looks<00:03:45.660> like<00:03:45.870> energy

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
all that halo it looks like energy

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.250 
all that halo it looks like energy
surrounding<00:03:47.010> this<00:03:47.220> thing<00:03:47.459> and<00:03:48.080> I'll<00:03:49.080> be

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
surrounding this thing and I'll be

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.410 
surrounding this thing and I'll be
processing<00:03:49.980> these<00:03:50.100> and<00:03:50.400> I<00:03:50.430> may<00:03:50.640> animate<00:03:51.120> some

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
processing these and I may animate some

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.870 
processing these and I may animate some
in<00:03:51.750> this<00:03:52.110> kind<00:03:52.410> of<00:03:52.530> a<00:03:52.650> view<00:03:52.890> a<00:03:53.250> little<00:03:53.700> more

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
in this kind of a view a little more

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.060 
in this kind of a view a little more
processed<00:03:54.450> here<00:03:55.170> it<00:03:55.320> almost<00:03:55.440> looks<00:03:55.800> like<00:03:55.860> an

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
processed here it almost looks like an

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.920 
processed here it almost looks like an
iris<00:03:56.430> but<00:03:56.610> you<00:03:56.700> can<00:03:56.820> see<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.209> kind<00:03:57.420> of<00:03:57.510> triple

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
iris but you can see the kind of triple

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.710 
iris but you can see the kind of triple
halo<00:03:58.290> that<00:03:58.890> I<00:03:58.920> have<00:03:59.190> outlined<00:03:59.450> and<00:04:00.450> other

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
halo that I have outlined and other

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.530 
halo that I have outlined and other
stills

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
stills

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.670 
stills
these<00:04:03.540> don't<00:04:03.810> look<00:04:03.870> like<00:04:03.990> anything<00:04:04.530> we've

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
these don't look like anything we've

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.560 
these don't look like anything we've
ever<00:04:04.890> been<00:04:05.100> told<00:04:05.340> about<00:04:05.520> they<00:04:06.060> don't<00:04:06.390> look

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
ever been told about they don't look

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.630 
ever been told about they don't look
like<00:04:06.780> any<00:04:06.990> kind<00:04:07.260> of<00:04:07.350> a<00:04:07.440> satellite<00:04:07.830> any<00:04:08.250> kind<00:04:08.580> of

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640
