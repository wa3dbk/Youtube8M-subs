people can have an issue is this are we

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.980 
people can have an issue is this are we
constantly<00:01:17.460> getting<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.909> larger<00:01:18.270> devices<00:01:18.600> I

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
constantly getting to larger devices I

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.230 
constantly getting to larger devices I
rather<00:01:19.650> than<00:01:19.799> small<00:01:20.159> phones<00:01:20.430> but<00:01:20.759> this

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
rather than small phones but this

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.880 
rather than small phones but this
actually<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:22.049> far<00:01:22.259> has<00:01:22.439> been<00:01:22.470> pretty

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
actually so far has been pretty

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.030 
actually so far has been pretty
convenient<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:24.630> dimensions<00:01:25.259> as<00:01:25.560> far<00:01:25.740> as<00:01:25.830> with

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
convenient the dimensions as far as with

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.499 
convenient the dimensions as far as with
height<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.610> depth<00:01:26.939> it's<00:01:27.180> 5.5<00:01:27.900> inches<00:01:28.560> by<00:01:29.509> 3.56

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
height and depth it's 5.5 inches by 3.56

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.929 
height and depth it's 5.5 inches by 3.56
by<00:01:31.340> 3.33<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:33.030> really<00:01:33.659> pretty<00:01:34.049> flat<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.939> 5.9

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
by 3.33 so really pretty flat and 5.9

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.149 
by 3.33 so really pretty flat and 5.9
ounces<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.079> it's<00:01:37.229> actually<00:01:37.380> not<00:01:37.680> very<00:01:37.740> heavy

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
ounces so it's actually not very heavy

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
would say i do like what they've loaded

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.830 
would say i do like what they've loaded
preloaded<00:03:13.430> because<00:03:14.000> they<00:03:14.120> are<00:03:14.359> a<00:03:14.420> lot<00:03:14.599> of<00:03:14.629> apps

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840

that<00:03:14.930> makes<00:03:15.200> sense<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:15.680> me<00:03:15.859> the<00:03:16.849> amazon<00:03:17.329> and

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
that makes sense to me the amazon and

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.449 
that makes sense to me the amazon and
kindle<00:03:18.019> I<00:03:18.139> think<00:03:18.319> this<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.829> size<00:03:19.130> of<00:03:19.340> the

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
kindle I think this the size of the

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.580 
kindle I think this the size of the
screen<00:03:19.639> will<00:03:20.510> be<00:03:20.630> very<00:03:20.870> useful<00:03:20.930> for<00:03:21.440> people

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
screen will be very useful for people

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.580 
screen will be very useful for people

have<00:03:39.799> the<00:03:40.190> calendar<00:03:40.730> loaded<00:03:41.120> and<00:03:41.299> the<00:03:41.750> size<00:03:42.019> of

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
have the calendar loaded and the size of

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.720 
have the calendar loaded and the size of
the<00:03:42.349> calendar<00:03:42.769> i<00:03:42.799> think<00:03:42.980> it's<00:03:43.099> just<00:03:43.250> very<00:03:43.370> easy

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
the calendar i think it's just very easy

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.599 
the calendar i think it's just very easy
to<00:03:44.000> see<00:03:44.269> and<00:03:44.299> easy<00:03:44.720> to<00:03:44.989> use<00:03:45.099> so<00:03:46.099> so<00:03:46.370> far<00:03:46.549> i

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
to see and easy to use so so far i

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.849 
to see and easy to use so so far i
really<00:03:47.090> do<00:03:47.269> like<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.660> LG<00:03:47.989> intuition<00:03:48.260> I've

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
really do like the LG intuition I've

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:50.559 
really do like the LG intuition I've
actually<00:03:49.130> asked<00:03:49.639> a<00:03:49.669> couple<00:03:49.760> of<00:03:50.000> friends<00:03:50.239> when

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
actually asked a couple of friends when

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.089 
actually asked a couple of friends when
using<00:03:50.959> it<00:03:51.079> you<00:03:51.169> know<00:03:51.260> how<00:03:51.440> comfortable<00:03:52.010> would

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
using it you know how comfortable would

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.039 
using it you know how comfortable would
they<00:03:52.250> feel<00:03:52.489> with<00:03:52.700> it<00:03:52.849> so<00:03:53.450> we<00:03:53.569> were<00:03:53.630> all<00:03:53.750> just

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
they feel with it so we were all just

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:55.390 
they feel with it so we were all just
you<00:03:54.200> know<00:03:54.290> you<00:03:54.560> know<00:03:54.650> playing<00:03:54.919> around<00:03:55.160> with<00:03:55.340> it

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
you know you know playing around with it

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.159 
you know you know playing around with it
the<00:03:55.970> fact<00:03:56.209> that<00:03:56.359> it<00:03:56.510> does<00:03:56.690> have<00:03:56.720> the<00:03:57.019> rubber

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:57.169 
the fact that it does have the rubber

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:00.580 
the fact that it does have the rubber
back<00:03:57.470> makes<00:03:57.919> it<00:03:58.129> more<00:03:58.849> slip<00:03:59.269> proof<00:03:59.540> I'm<00:04:00.440> not

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
back makes it more slip proof I'm not

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.020 
back makes it more slip proof I'm not
sure<00:04:00.739> if<00:04:00.859> you<00:04:00.950> had<00:04:01.099> a<00:04:01.129> couple<00:04:01.340> phones<00:04:01.669> that<00:04:01.910> are

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
sure if you had a couple phones that are

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.879 
sure if you had a couple phones that are
that<00:04:02.239> sleep<00:04:02.629> material<00:04:03.169> but<00:04:03.290> i<00:04:03.349> actually<00:04:03.590> have

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:03.889 
that sleep material but i actually have

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.339 
that sleep material but i actually have
dropped<00:04:04.280> a<00:04:04.459> few<00:04:04.660> so<00:04:05.660> i<00:04:05.690> definitely<00:04:05.959> think<00:04:06.230> that

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
dropped a few so i definitely think that

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.430 
dropped a few so i definitely think that
detail<00:04:06.889> makes<00:04:07.370> a<00:04:07.579> lot<00:04:07.849> of<00:04:07.879> sense<00:04:08.290> aside<00:04:09.290> from

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
detail makes a lot of sense aside from

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.809 
detail makes a lot of sense aside from
that<00:04:09.530> the<00:04:09.799> rest<00:04:09.980> of<00:04:10.129> the<00:04:10.280> you<00:04:10.549> know<00:04:10.639> they<00:04:10.760> seem

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
that the rest of the you know they seem

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.720 
that the rest of the you know they seem
to<00:04:11.000> be<00:04:11.090> you<00:04:11.329> know<00:04:11.419> standard<00:04:11.900> Android<00:04:12.440> features

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
to be you know standard Android features

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.729 
to be you know standard Android features
you<00:04:13.730> can<00:04:13.760> customize<00:04:14.419> the<00:04:14.660> screens<00:04:15.019> as<00:04:15.349> much<00:04:15.560> as

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
you can customize the screens as much as

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.979 
you can customize the screens as much as
you<00:04:15.859> need<00:04:16.099> to<00:04:16.180> I've<00:04:17.180> obviously<00:04:17.359> played<00:04:17.810> with

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
you need to I've obviously played with

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.779 
you need to I've obviously played with
some<00:04:18.169> of<00:04:18.289> the<00:04:18.410> folders<00:04:18.949> so<00:04:19.280> create<00:04:19.609> your<00:04:19.729> own

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
some of the folders so create your own

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:21.280 
some of the folders so create your own
folders<00:04:20.419> and<00:04:20.599> name<00:04:20.840> them

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
folders and name them

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.740 
folders and name them
I<00:04:21.410> do<00:04:21.830> actually<00:04:22.370> I<00:04:22.640> actually<00:04:23.120> saw<00:04:23.420> a<00:04:23.450> quick

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
I do actually I actually saw a quick

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.090 
I do actually I actually saw a quick
blurb<00:04:24.020> that<00:04:24.140> they're<00:04:24.380> actually<00:04:24.770> going<00:04:24.950> to

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
blurb that they're actually going to

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.100 
blurb that they're actually going to
launch<00:04:25.310> a<00:04:25.610> company<00:04:26.300> is<00:04:26.540> going<00:04:26.630> to<00:04:26.750> launch<00:04:26.870> an

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
launch a company is going to launch an

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.040 
launch a company is going to launch an
outlook<00:04:27.440> sync<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:28.760> use<00:04:29.000> as<00:04:29.210> well<00:04:29.390> so<00:04:29.660> the<00:04:29.840> fact

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
outlook sync to use as well so the fact

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.840 
outlook sync to use as well so the fact
that<00:04:30.140> this<00:04:30.260> has<00:04:30.440> notes<00:04:30.830> and<00:04:31.190> be<00:04:31.430> interesting

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
that this has notes and be interesting

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.030 
that this has notes and be interesting
to<00:04:31.940> see<00:04:32.090> how<00:04:32.120> well<00:04:32.390> that<00:04:32.450> that<00:04:33.140> sinks<00:04:33.650> but

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
to see how well that that sinks but

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.730 
to see how well that that sinks but
again<00:04:34.400> this<00:04:34.640> is<00:04:34.700> the<00:04:34.910> LG<00:04:35.120> intuition<00:04:35.720> and<00:04:36.440> I<00:04:36.680> do

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
again this is the LG intuition and I do

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.110 
again this is the LG intuition and I do
actually<00:04:37.160> really<00:04:37.580> like<00:04:37.730> it<00:04:37.880> i've<00:04:37.970> been

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
actually really like it i've been

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.000 
actually really like it i've been
playing<00:04:38.330> with<00:04:38.540> it<00:04:38.720> some<00:04:38.870> more<00:04:38.960> and<00:04:39.290> if<00:04:39.800> i<00:04:39.860> have

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
playing with it some more and if i have

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.800 
playing with it some more and if i have
any<00:04:40.160> other<00:04:40.400> specifics<00:04:41.090> i<00:04:41.210> will<00:04:41.390> definitely
