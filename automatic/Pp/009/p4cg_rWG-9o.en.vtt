by<00:04:01.340> using<00:04:01.700> this<00:04:02.090> um<00:04:02.650> tool<00:04:03.650> which<00:04:03.980> is<00:04:04.159> by<00:04:04.310> Revlon

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
by using this um tool which is by Revlon

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.800 
by using this um tool which is by Revlon
it<00:04:05.180> is<00:04:05.389> fairly<00:04:06.199> inexpensive<00:04:07.069> and<00:04:07.280> it<00:04:07.969> works<00:04:08.209> so

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
it is fairly inexpensive and it works so

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.920 
it is fairly inexpensive and it works so
good<00:04:09.260> I<00:04:09.799> would<00:04:10.549> just<00:04:10.699> recommend<00:04:10.879> going<00:04:11.540> on<00:04:11.750> the

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
good I would just recommend going on the

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.959 
good I would just recommend going on the
low<00:04:12.109> setting<00:04:12.439> and<00:04:12.650> avoid<00:04:13.069> burning<00:04:13.459> your<00:04:13.730> hair

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:13.969 
low setting and avoid burning your hair

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:17.529 
low setting and avoid burning your hair
yeah<00:04:14.359> so<00:04:14.659> this<00:04:15.019> is<00:04:15.290> the<00:04:15.829> result<00:04:16.280> of<00:04:16.489> using<00:04:17.359> this

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
yeah so this is the result of using this

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.749 
yeah so this is the result of using this
I'm<00:04:17.900> using<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:18.590> technique<00:04:19.009> of<00:04:19.190> going<00:04:19.370> in<00:04:19.609> and

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:19.759 
I'm using the technique of going in and

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.230 
I'm using the technique of going in and
out<00:04:19.849> in<00:04:20.060> and<00:04:20.209> out<00:04:20.299> and<00:04:20.539> this<00:04:21.259> top<00:04:21.620> looks<00:04:21.859> like

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
out in and out and this top looks like

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.719
