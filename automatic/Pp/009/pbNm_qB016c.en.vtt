00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.939 
been looking for talents - I'll lead it
it's<00:00:55.140> been<00:00:55.289> really<00:00:55.440> really<00:00:55.980> worried<00:00:56.340> exactly

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.439 

the<00:01:01.949> only<00:01:02.219> gear<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.789> route<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> tiny

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
the only gear on the route is a tiny

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.540 
the only gear on the route is a tiny
sliding<00:01:04.080> nut<00:01:04.289> and<00:01:04.680> although<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.100> don't<00:01:05.309> think

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
sliding nut and although I don't think

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.100 
sliding nut and although I don't think
it<00:01:05.700> would<00:01:05.789> hold<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.180> fall<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.660> gave<00:01:06.930> me<00:01:07.050> a

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
it would hold the fall it gave me a

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.240 
it would hold the fall it gave me a
little<00:01:07.229> bit<00:01:07.350> more<00:01:07.530> confidence<00:01:09.890> the<00:01:10.890> promise

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
little bit more confidence the promise

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.760 
little bit more confidence the promise
was<00:01:11.399> the<00:01:11.550> fair<00:01:11.759> like<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.179> first<00:01:12.479> like<00:01:13.289> really

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
was the fair like the first like really

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.260 
was the fair like the first like really
hard<00:01:13.920> route<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.429> I've<00:01:14.490> seen<00:01:14.729> him<00:01:14.880> do<00:01:15.060> I
