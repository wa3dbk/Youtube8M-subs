00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.130
 but 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.410
 james with 2013 we are on the showfloor of 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.810
 in front of the call of duty ghost stand 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.000
 the new call of duty next genres 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.980
 infinity ward had already shown one 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.930
 week ago but thanks to the reveal of 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.359
 los angeles, however, here in colony is back 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.400
 with a couple more information from 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.360
 several new maps and a new mode 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.030
 blitz game 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.309
 but what is this new call of 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.129
 in short, duty cost infinity ward has 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.280
 tried to insert as many new features as possible 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.989
 more new things in this new edition 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.660
 customization has undergone a process 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.280
 of renewal 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.530
 first of all it is thanks to credit a 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.260
 soldier you can change every 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.149
 look like a soldier from his clothes 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.640
 but also to the face and above all they are 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.250
 the girls were inserted so not 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.770
 only beefy heroes and will be intent on 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.950
 shoot yourself point - blank in the maps of 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:10.830
 game of course infinity ward not 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.500
 he could go and see what had happened 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.470
 made by treyarch in black ops 2 the 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.320
 pitt ending system of black ops two is 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.350
 been rethought in a kind of spades 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:27.060
 in which not all where this system 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.590
 goes to how to tell to build all the 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.950
 burke system but not that of 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.740
 weapons no longer 10 points but 8 and only 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.330
 related to why the news does not 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.250
 end up here 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.400
 modern warfare 3 could not be 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.259
 an important influence for call of duty 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.930
 the coaster , moreover, the authors are 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.350
 themselves and then return to 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.750
 killstreak divided between paid support 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.299
 specialist and therefore killstreak of 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.759
 support killstreak attack then 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.220
 related to helping one's own 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.619
 fellow soldiers the specialist reveal 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.079
 but which will presumably be relative 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.850
 to a load out only because the news does not 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.160
 end up here 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.780
 we have dynamic maps of course 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.330
 to be understood not as maps in which it is 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.850
 possible to destroy 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.610
 everything but some portions of the map 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.680
 can be destroyed therefore rasa al 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.960
 soil to reveal new new passages 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.910
 new de finally we saw a 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.220
 wall that can be knocked down through 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.710
 c4 to have a ping location 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.900
 particularly advantageous is a pump of 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.150
 gasoline that falls and explodes and therefore 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.740
 creating an extra barrier or as in 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.780
 in the strike zone map where 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.260
 suddenly at the end of the game 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.730
 a missile destroys the area where we are 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.890
 fighting going to change 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.990
 completely the layout of the map 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.660
 other very important things 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:51.230
 there is a new substantial modality that 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.140
 let's hope it doesn't go completely to replace 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.260
 the spec ops and we have this mode 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.990
 shakes in which up to a maximum of 10 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.180
 players must fundamentally the 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.100
 player must field his own 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.310
 team team that expands as you go 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.880
 matches are won in a process of 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.520
 growth 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.830
 this team can also be formed 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.840
 from practically alone beat e 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.640
 clash against each other's teams 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.070
 human opponents can be 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.709
 quietly the player 9 bots 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.750
 against a managed team or against one 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.930
 team of human opponents 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:31.040
 all this going therefore to say 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:34.130
 to create a well composed team that 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.739
 have so many fast-paced people 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.800
 there are those who in short are looking for an alchemy that 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.390
 can get the 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.260
 team to victory 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:47.840
 in short, call of duty is presented 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.810
 to the next gen with several important ones 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.620
 new we also have new ways of 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.080
 game 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.200
 recently the announcement was announced 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.019
 blitz mode a singular mode is 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.120
 in which the two teams could we could 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:05.269
 say making goals in the opposing base 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.940
 you basically need to reach a 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:10.670
 point in the opposing base and take it 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.760
 automatically we will be teleported 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.970
 in its own base in this way 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.030
 coming and going until time runs out 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.109
 other news there is mode 31 but also 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.830
 this is a pretty modality 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.449
 particular where after making 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.180
 a kill we have thirty seconds to 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:30.139
 to make another 30 seconds in which yes 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.030
 it's faster 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.310
 if you can't do another one 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.270
 killing in these thirty seconds yes 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.650
 it explodes and then it starts over again 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.669
 one of the points everyone is asking is 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.840
 the technical aspect 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:47.000
 call of duty ghost finally to one 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.330
 visual component in step with the times not 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.660
 amazes like other shooters featured in 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.240
 fair 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.070
 but finally the detail is a lot 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.160
 high fluidity and one that everyone 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:00.620
 we know and the maps are bigger 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.110
 compared to the past we have seen for 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.760
 example the whiteout map set in 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.660
 a path in a fishing village 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.789
 in alaska very, very large and rich 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.900
 there are secondary passages of the filaments 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:17.360
 a port there are big there are mountains 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.940
 and the beauty is that the highest resolution 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.190
 the greater detail allows us to 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.370
 see the opponent better from the long 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:27.889
 distance so we can't say that 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.590
 that of goss and upsets the landscape 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:33.229
 contemporary shooter technician though 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.130
 finally it looks more appropriate for 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.500
 the next gen 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.780
 in short, there is still a lot to discover 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.789
 about call of duty ghost we have 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.010
 still seen very little about the 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:45.830
 campaign we want to know if there 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.740
 the spec ops will be the news for now 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.180
 they are quite important and substantial 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.070
 only with the next meetings 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:56.349
 from here to the exit we will be able to know 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.349
 all about the new work by infinity ward
