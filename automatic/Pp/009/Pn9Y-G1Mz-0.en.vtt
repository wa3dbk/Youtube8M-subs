so<00:00:07.620> here<00:00:07.830> we<00:00:07.950> are<00:00:07.980> we're<00:00:08.519> trying<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.849> determine

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
so here we are we're trying to determine

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.209 
so here we are we're trying to determine
the<00:00:09.570> number<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.260> types<00:00:10.559> of<00:00:10.769> solutions<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:12.059> a

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:13.219 
the number and types of solutions to a

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.330 
the number and types of solutions to a
quadratic<00:00:14.299> equation<00:00:15.560> before<00:00:16.560> we<00:00:17.100> actually

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
quadratic equation before we actually

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.760 
quadratic equation before we actually
crunch<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.180> numbers<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:19.230> order<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.590> do

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
crunch the numbers and in order to do

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.260 
crunch the numbers and in order to do
that<00:00:19.949> what<00:00:20.220> we<00:00:20.340> want<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.640> go<00:00:20.760> through<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.150> we

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
that what we want to go through is we

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.259 
that what we want to go through is we
want<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.539> check<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.020> discriminant<00:00:22.920> yes<00:00:23.609> I'll

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
want to check the discriminant yes I'll

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.790 
want to check the discriminant yes I'll
talk<00:00:24.420> about<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.779> discriminant<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.500> minute

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
talk about the discriminant in a minute

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.920 
talk about the discriminant in a minute
but<00:00:26.340> what<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:26.880> do<00:00:27.029> have<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.689> have<00:00:27.720> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
but what I do have is I have the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.620 
but what I do have is I have the
quadratic<00:00:28.439> formula<00:00:28.740> I've<00:00:29.429> rewritten<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.480> a

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
quadratic formula I've rewritten it in a

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.420 
quadratic formula I've rewritten it in a
form<00:00:30.960> that's<00:00:31.230> going<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.769> help<00:00:31.920> us<00:00:32.160> determine

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
form that's going to help us determine

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.569 
form that's going to help us determine
the<00:00:33.050> number<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.350> types<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.739> solutions<00:00:35.340> I

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
the number and types of solutions I

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.240 
the number and types of solutions I
broke<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.270> fraction<00:00:36.840> up<00:00:37.020> into<00:00:37.500> two<00:00:37.739> they

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
broke that fraction up into two they

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.729 
broke that fraction up into two they
have<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.640> same<00:00:39.120> denominator<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.260> would<00:00:40.590> be

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
have the same denominator so I would be

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.770 
have the same denominator so I would be
able<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.070> add<00:00:41.250> their<00:00:41.489> fractions<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.420> is

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
able to add their fractions so it is

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.720 
able to add their fractions so it is
conceivable<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:43.980> would<00:00:44.190> be<00:00:44.340> able<00:00:44.460> to

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
conceivable that I would be able to

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.090 
conceivable that I would be able to
rewrite<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.300> like<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:46.320> discriminant<00:00:46.950> is

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
rewrite it like this the discriminant is

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.549 
rewrite it like this the discriminant is
part<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.760> quadratic<00:00:48.210> formula<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:49.320> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
part of the quadratic formula it's the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.270 
part of the quadratic formula it's the
part<00:00:49.860> under<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.760> root<00:00:51.199> okay<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:52.829> let's<00:00:53.039> talk

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
part under the root okay so let's talk

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.369 
part under the root okay so let's talk
about<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.760> part<00:00:54.090> under<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.390> root<00:00:54.660> three

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
about that part under the root three

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.470 
about that part under the root three
things<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:56.010> happen<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.760> can<00:00:56.910> be<00:00:57.030> bigger<00:00:57.239> than

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
things can happen it can be bigger than

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.170 
things can happen it can be bigger than
zero<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.989> can<00:00:58.440> be<00:00:58.559> smaller<00:00:58.949> than<00:00:59.219> zero<00:00:59.280> or<00:00:59.969> it

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
zero it can be smaller than zero or it

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.229 
zero it can be smaller than zero or it
can<00:01:00.329> be<00:01:00.449> equal<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:01.050> zero<00:01:01.289> okay<00:01:02.059> let's<00:01:03.059> go

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
can be equal to zero okay let's go

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.090 
can be equal to zero okay let's go
through<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.750> take<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> look<00:01:04.500> at<00:01:04.650> these<00:01:04.799> things

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
through and take a look at these things

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.730 
through and take a look at these things
if<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.880> discriminant<00:01:06.659> b<00:01:06.900> squared<00:01:07.409> minus<00:01:07.500> 4ac

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
if the discriminant b squared minus 4ac

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.030 
if the discriminant b squared minus 4ac
is<00:01:08.460> bigger<00:01:08.939> than<00:01:09.180> zero<00:01:09.510> let's<00:01:10.140> look<00:01:10.380> at<00:01:10.650> that

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
is bigger than zero let's look at that

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.060 
is bigger than zero let's look at that
root<00:01:11.310> can<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.030> take<00:01:12.240> us<00:01:12.590> square<00:01:13.590> root<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.979> a

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
root can you take us square root of a

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.330 
root can you take us square root of a
real<00:01:14.580> positive<00:01:15.060> number<00:01:15.689> yes<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.710> can<00:01:17.040> and

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
real positive number yes you can and

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.039 
real positive number yes you can and
when<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.820> do<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.119> get<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.299> real<00:01:18.630> positive

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
when you do you get a real positive

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.609 
when you do you get a real positive
number<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.250> here<00:01:20.520> we're<00:01:20.729> gonna<00:01:20.820> get<00:01:21.119> two<00:01:21.630> real

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
number so here we're gonna get two real

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.899 
number so here we're gonna get two real
solutions<00:01:23.360> one<00:01:24.360> with<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:25.229> plus<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.400> real

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
solutions one with this plus that real

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.140 
solutions one with this plus that real
number<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:28.280> minus<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.490> real<00:01:29.759> number

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
number and this minus that real number

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.090 
number and this minus that real number
because<00:01:30.570> we're<00:01:30.840> taking<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.320> square<00:01:31.650> root<00:01:31.890> of

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
because we're taking the square root of

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.230 
because we're taking the square root of
a<00:01:32.340> positive<00:01:32.640> number<00:01:33.259> yeah<00:01:34.640> so<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:35.880> gonna

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
a positive number yeah so this is gonna

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:45.190 
a positive number yeah so this is gonna
get<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.720> two<00:01:37.470> real<00:01:38.220> solutions

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.440 

okay<00:01:46.230> the<00:01:46.770> second<00:01:47.160> part<00:01:47.370> in<00:01:47.490> our<00:01:47.610> trifecta

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
okay the second part in our trifecta

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.970 
okay the second part in our trifecta
yeah<00:01:49.020> um

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 
yeah um

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.000 
yeah um
the<00:01:50.460> trilogy<00:01:50.790> if<00:01:51.300> you<00:01:51.720> will<00:01:51.960> what<00:01:52.500> happens<00:01:52.890> if

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
the trilogy if you will what happens if

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.620 
the trilogy if you will what happens if
your<00:01:53.130> discriminant<00:01:53.760> is<00:01:53.850> smaller<00:01:54.330> than<00:01:54.660> 0<00:01:56.630> when

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
your discriminant is smaller than 0 when

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.750 
your discriminant is smaller than 0 when
I<00:01:57.660> go<00:01:57.870> and<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.080> plug<00:01:58.350> this<00:01:58.530> up<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.890> here<00:01:59.130> right

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
I go and I plug this up in here right

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.000 
I go and I plug this up in here right
this<00:02:00.270> number<00:02:00.510> is<00:02:00.690> going<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.900> be<00:02:01.020> negative<00:02:01.229> what

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
this number is going to be negative what

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.830 
this number is going to be negative what
happens<00:02:02.340> when<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.610> take<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.120> square<00:02:03.420> root<00:02:03.630> of

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
happens when you take the square root of

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.969 
happens when you take the square root of
a<00:02:03.960> negative<00:02:04.140> number

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
a negative number

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.590 
a negative number
yeah<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:06.450> get<00:02:06.600> an<00:02:06.720> imaginary<00:02:07.320> number<00:02:08.060> okay<00:02:09.060> so

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
yeah you get an imaginary number okay so

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.870 
yeah you get an imaginary number okay so
it's<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:09.959> plus<00:02:10.530> an<00:02:10.800> imaginary<00:02:11.400> part<00:02:11.760> and

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
it's this plus an imaginary part and

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.990 
it's this plus an imaginary part and
this<00:02:12.480> plus<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.320> real<00:02:13.650> part<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.310> we<00:02:14.700> know<00:02:14.850> if

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
this plus a real part and we know if

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.270 
this plus a real part and we know if
complex<00:02:15.600> numbers<00:02:16.020> have<00:02:16.200> real<00:02:16.709> parts<00:02:17.160> and

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
complex numbers have real parts and

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.720 
complex numbers have real parts and
imaginary<00:02:17.670> parts<00:02:18.570> so<00:02:19.380> here<00:02:19.770> you're<00:02:20.400> gonna<00:02:20.520> get

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
imaginary parts so here you're gonna get

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:34.880 
imaginary parts so here you're gonna get
two<00:02:23.510> non<00:02:24.510> real<00:02:24.989> solutions<00:02:33.380> and<00:02:34.380> when<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:34.590> say

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
two non real solutions and when I say

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:35.690 
two non real solutions and when I say
not<00:02:35.160> real

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
not real

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.229 
not real
I<00:02:35.730> mean<00:02:36.420> complex<00:02:37.140> with<00:02:37.650> an<00:02:38.100> imaginary<00:02:38.820> part

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
I mean complex with an imaginary part

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.449 
I mean complex with an imaginary part
because<00:02:39.780> some<00:02:39.989> real<00:02:40.380> numbers<00:02:40.770> all<00:02:41.040> real

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
because some real numbers all real

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.520 
because some real numbers all real
numbers<00:02:41.850> are<00:02:42.090> complex<00:02:42.300> numbers<00:02:42.750> just

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
numbers are complex numbers just

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.740 
numbers are complex numbers just
excluding<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.400> imaginary<00:02:44.940> part<00:02:45.180> make<00:02:45.600> it

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
excluding the imaginary part make it

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.170 
excluding the imaginary part make it
impurity<00:02:46.110> real<00:02:46.549> so<00:02:47.549> let's<00:02:47.730> look<00:02:47.910> at<00:02:48.060> our<00:02:48.120> third

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
impurity real so let's look at our third

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.570 
impurity real so let's look at our third
case<00:02:48.660> down<00:02:48.959> here<00:02:49.019> what<00:02:49.769> if<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:49.980> discriminate

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
case down here what if the discriminate

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.360 
case down here what if the discriminate
0<00:02:50.820> all<00:02:51.360> right<00:02:51.390> this<00:02:52.140> is<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.320> discriminant<00:02:52.980> if

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
0 all right this is the discriminant if

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.009 
0 all right this is the discriminant if
the<00:02:53.519> discriminant<00:02:53.970> is<00:02:54.090> 0<00:02:54.360> can<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:54.720> take<00:02:54.900> the

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
the discriminant is 0 can you take the

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.949 
the discriminant is 0 can you take the
square<00:02:55.170> root<00:02:55.380> of<00:02:55.470> 0<00:02:55.709> yeah<00:02:56.280> what<00:02:56.610> is<00:02:56.730> it

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
square root of 0 yeah what is it

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.570 
square root of 0 yeah what is it
0<00:02:57.959> what's<00:02:58.560> going<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:58.739> happen<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.100> this<00:02:59.250> entire

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
0 what's going to happen to this entire

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.570 
0 what's going to happen to this entire
term<00:02:59.880> gone<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.230> then<00:03:02.160> what<00:03:02.280> are<00:03:02.340> you<00:03:02.430> left

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
term gone and then what are you left

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.009 
term gone and then what are you left
with<00:03:02.780> only<00:03:04.040> one<00:03:05.040> real<00:03:05.880> number<00:03:06.390> see<00:03:06.720> it's<00:03:06.870> not

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
with only one real number see it's not

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.770 
with only one real number see it's not
gonna<00:03:07.170> have<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.440> plus<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.700> minus<00:03:08.940> from

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
gonna have the plus and the minus from

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.130 
gonna have the plus and the minus from
it<00:03:09.959> it's<00:03:10.440> going<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.709> be<00:03:10.860> one<00:03:11.250> real<00:03:12.000> number<00:03:12.570> so

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
it it's going to be one real number so

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:22.040 
it it's going to be one real number so
then<00:03:13.380> yeah<00:03:13.709> this<00:03:14.220> is<00:03:14.459> one<00:03:15.000> real<00:03:15.780> solution

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.800 

all<00:03:22.650> right<00:03:23.100> so<00:03:23.670> these<00:03:23.820> are<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.120> three<00:03:24.360> cases

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
all right so these are the three cases

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.420 
all right so these are the three cases
of<00:03:24.840> our<00:03:25.050> discriminant<00:03:25.440> why<00:03:26.100> don't<00:03:26.250> we<00:03:26.310> go

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
of our discriminant why don't we go

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.040 
of our discriminant why don't we go
through<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:26.820> do<00:03:26.880> a<00:03:26.910> couple<00:03:27.150> of<00:03:27.360> examples<00:03:27.480> with

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
through and do a couple of examples with

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.860 
through and do a couple of examples with
those<00:03:28.260> I'm<00:03:28.830> up<00:03:29.040> here<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.490> my<00:03:29.670> first<00:03:30.330> example

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
those I'm up here to my first example

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.780 
those I'm up here to my first example
until<00:03:31.620> you're<00:03:31.770> professional<00:03:32.400> I<00:03:32.490> strongly

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
until you're professional I strongly

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.470 
until you're professional I strongly
encourage<00:03:33.000> that<00:03:33.300> you<00:03:33.540> label<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:34.080> is<00:03:34.800> to<00:03:35.370> be<00:03:36.030> is

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
encourage that you label a is to be is

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.480 
encourage that you label a is to be is
minus<00:03:37.440> 3<00:03:37.830> and<00:03:38.100> C<00:03:38.640> is<00:03:39.000> minus<00:03:39.480> 1<00:03:39.990> fun<00:03:40.770> so<00:03:41.370> I'm

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
minus 3 and C is minus 1 fun so I'm

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.710 
minus 3 and C is minus 1 fun so I'm
gonna<00:03:41.610> take<00:03:41.820> him<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:42.150> I'm<00:03:42.270> gonna<00:03:42.390> plug<00:03:42.570> it

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
gonna take him and I'm gonna plug it

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.140 
gonna take him and I'm gonna plug it
here<00:03:42.750> no<00:03:43.470> I'm<00:03:43.920> gonna<00:03:44.040> plug<00:03:44.250> it<00:03:44.430> here<00:03:44.460> because

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
here no I'm gonna plug it here because

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.850 
here no I'm gonna plug it here because
it's<00:03:45.450> our<00:03:45.600> goal<00:03:45.810> in<00:03:45.990> our<00:03:46.110> intentions<00:03:46.500> to

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
it's our goal in our intentions to

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.440 
it's our goal in our intentions to
determine<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.520> number<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:48.030> type<00:03:48.270> of

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
determine the number and type of

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.310 
determine the number and type of
solutions<00:03:49.020> without<00:03:49.970> solving<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.780> equation

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
solutions without solving the equation

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.350 
solutions without solving the equation
ok<00:03:53.220> sure

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
ok sure

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.270 
ok sure
so<00:03:54.600> then<00:03:54.890> this<00:03:55.890> is<00:03:56.100> gonna<00:03:56.280> be<00:03:56.550> B<00:03:57.510> squared<00:03:58.350> minus

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
so then this is gonna be B squared minus

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:08.960 
so then this is gonna be B squared minus
4<00:03:59.850> h<00:04:00.630> c<00:04:02.780> finish<00:04:03.780> it<00:04:04.080> um<00:04:04.860> this<00:04:05.250> is<00:04:05.490> 9<00:04:06.230> plus<00:04:07.430> 8

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
4 h c finish it um this is 9 plus 8

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.660 
4 h c finish it um this is 9 plus 8
great<00:04:09.630> that<00:04:10.470> Nets<00:04:10.740> you<00:04:11.180> 17

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
great that Nets you 17

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.240 
great that Nets you 17
ok<00:04:14.670> now<00:04:15.390> is<00:04:15.780> that<00:04:16.049> bigger<00:04:16.290> than<00:04:16.500> 0<00:04:16.709> smaller

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
ok now is that bigger than 0 smaller

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.690 
ok now is that bigger than 0 smaller
than<00:04:17.549> 0<00:04:17.820> or<00:04:18.060> is<00:04:18.270> it<00:04:18.480> 0<00:04:18.920> that's<00:04:19.920> bigger<00:04:20.190> than<00:04:20.400> 0

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
than 0 or is it 0 that's bigger than 0

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.780 
than 0 or is it 0 that's bigger than 0
so<00:04:21.270> then<00:04:21.480> in<00:04:21.720> conclusion<00:04:22.020> you<00:04:22.950> can<00:04:23.160> state<00:04:23.460> by

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
so then in conclusion you can state by

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.290 
so then in conclusion you can state by
use<00:04:24.270> of<00:04:24.450> the<00:04:24.570> discriminant<00:04:25.230> that<00:04:25.800> this<00:04:26.040> is<00:04:26.400> two

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
use of the discriminant that this is two

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:35.280 
use of the discriminant that this is two
real<00:04:28.290> solutions

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:41.980 

okay<00:04:36.730> Wow<00:04:39.580> now<00:04:40.580> I'm<00:04:40.790> down<00:04:41.000> here<00:04:41.060> to<00:04:41.450> my<00:04:41.570> second

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
okay Wow now I'm down here to my second

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.270 
okay Wow now I'm down here to my second
example<00:04:42.380> here<00:04:42.740> I<00:04:43.070> see<00:04:43.400> my<00:04:43.580> a<00:04:43.850> is<00:04:44.180> one<00:04:44.540> my<00:04:45.169> B<00:04:45.470> is<00:04:45.800> 2

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
example here I see my a is one my B is 2

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.330 
example here I see my a is one my B is 2
and<00:04:46.310> my<00:04:46.970> C<00:04:47.270> is<00:04:47.570> 9<00:04:47.960> fine

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
and my C is 9 fine

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.950 
and my C is 9 fine
so<00:04:49.610> I<00:04:49.639> need<00:04:49.970> to<00:04:50.060> go<00:04:50.210> through<00:04:50.480> and<00:04:50.630> I<00:04:50.690> need<00:04:50.840> to

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
so I need to go through and I need to

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.960 
so I need to go through and I need to
plug<00:04:51.169> those<00:04:51.350> into<00:04:51.560> the<00:04:51.770> discriminant<00:04:52.430> so

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
plug those into the discriminant so

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.600 
plug those into the discriminant so
that's<00:04:53.180> gonna<00:04:53.419> give<00:04:53.660> me<00:04:54.280> B<00:04:55.280> squared<00:04:57.010> minus<00:04:58.010> 4

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
that's gonna give me B squared minus 4

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:05.370 
that's gonna give me B squared minus 4
hey<00:04:59.440> C<00:05:01.210> okay<00:05:02.210> so<00:05:02.540> I'm<00:05:02.930> looking<00:05:03.260> at<00:05:03.380> four<00:05:03.880> -<00:05:04.880> oh

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
hey C okay so I'm looking at four - oh

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.960 
hey C okay so I'm looking at four - oh
wait

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
wait

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:16.409 
wait
36<00:05:08.530> and<00:05:09.530> that's<00:05:10.220> gonna<00:05:10.580> net<00:05:10.850> you<00:05:11.090> a<00:05:12.820> -<00:05:14.050> 32<00:05:15.050> yes

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
36 and that's gonna net you a - 32 yes

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:20.680 
36 and that's gonna net you a - 32 yes
is<00:05:17.419> that<00:05:17.720> bigger<00:05:18.380> than<00:05:18.620> 0<00:05:18.860> smaller<00:05:19.729> than<00:05:20.000> 0<00:05:20.240> or

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
is that bigger than 0 smaller than 0 or

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.590 
is that bigger than 0 smaller than 0 or
is<00:05:20.990> it<00:05:21.200> 0<00:05:21.440> that's<00:05:22.100> smaller<00:05:22.460> than<00:05:22.610> 0<00:05:23.060> hence

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
is it 0 that's smaller than 0 hence

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.870 
is it 0 that's smaller than 0 hence
giving<00:05:24.020> you<00:05:24.169> two<00:05:24.850> non<00:05:25.850> real<00:05:26.210> solution
