00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.240 

wonderful<00:00:04.290> we<00:00:04.440> made<00:00:04.649> it<00:00:04.740> out<00:00:04.859> of<00:00:04.950> the<00:00:05.040> shower

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
wonderful we made it out of the shower

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.140 
wonderful we made it out of the shower
and<00:00:05.700> as<00:00:06.359> you<00:00:06.540> can<00:00:06.720> see<00:00:06.750> my<00:00:07.200> hair<00:00:07.500> is<00:00:07.770> very<00:00:08.160> very

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
and as you can see my hair is very very

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.109 
and as you can see my hair is very very
wet<00:00:09.510> like<00:00:10.139> dripping<00:00:10.860> down<00:00:10.980> my<00:00:11.039> face<00:00:11.190> wet<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:11.879> I

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:12.119 
wet like dripping down my face wet and I

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:14.029 
wet like dripping down my face wet and I
find<00:00:12.389> that<00:00:12.510> it's<00:00:12.719> best<00:00:13.139> that<00:00:13.350> way<00:00:13.559> when<00:00:13.770> using

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:14.039 
find that it's best that way when using

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:16.609 
find that it's best that way when using
a<00:00:14.129> cream<00:00:14.400> because<00:00:15.270> since<00:00:15.629> creams<00:00:16.020> latch<00:00:16.350> on

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
a cream because since creams latch on

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.370 
a cream because since creams latch on
better<00:00:17.100> or<00:00:17.640> betters<00:00:18.480> out<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.750> word<00:00:18.900> more<00:00:19.350> than

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
better or betters out the word more than

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.350 
better or betters out the word more than
a<00:00:19.650> gel<00:00:20.040> or<00:00:20.840> lotion<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:22.320> stays<00:00:23.190> in<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.120> more

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
a gel or lotion it stays in and the more
