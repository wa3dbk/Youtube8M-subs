00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.730
 Why 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.999
 Why 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:24.999
 by 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:28.899
 lopes 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:30.649
 what 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:33.660
 between 1969 and 1974 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.000
 I have stayed many times stable man 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.470
 a group also located 600 km south of Algiers 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.600
 I made two films and at the time the lights of a saab 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.140
 during my first stay July 24, 1969 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.460
 the day before Armstrong had landed on the moon 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.520
 that night 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.769
 but at redeye brahim ben ammar 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:56.559
 considered one of the greatest theologians in the world of Islam the 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.340
 great spiritual leader of the Mozabites 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.380
 explained on the roof of the mosque of queyras to 305 me gathered for 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.360
 opportunity 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.040
 that the moon was actually a planet 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.930
 and that the man had actually landed on it 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:09.950
 at the same time 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.350
 we knew the sides 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.810
 Mozabite traders circulate around the world to buy you and the 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.710
 resell goods with perfect knowledge of the world 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.070
 international 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.880
 perhaps this is 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.920
 the miserable 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.860
 the best demonstration 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.710
 of what the philosopher Pierre Bourdieu 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:27.810
 the dialogue 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.289
 between permanence 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:32.600
 and the federation 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.620
 taking a slight as a starting point 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.690
 and that makes a vertical straight to the south 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.390
 and after six hundred kilometers we are not an acquired daycare and the 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.160
 capitals what is commonly called the pentapole ie the five cities 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.080
 of a zad 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.790
 we are here at the northern edge of the Sahara, that is to say the region, the oases that 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.610
 has been for 15 years 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.480
 that of oil wells whose most famous is fascinated barely saoud 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.720
 250 km in axis we read one of his little ones 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.620
 over 15 km long there are five cities 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.460
 who are they that theo edge of the wadi m'zab in a palm forest 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.460
 date palms 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.269
 the men they are installed there in full desert 

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:19.219
 these are the descendants of these missionaries who came dorian 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:22.540
 and who but the eighth head after jesus christ convert tribes 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.509
 Berbers from Jebel Neffoussa in Libya 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:27.859
 then the cities to lift down and kairouan 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:31.169
 in Tunisia who become ibadite under the guidance of these ten words this volume that 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:33.659
 is then 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.659
 the state imposes tomite of tiaret 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.419
 after one hundred and thirty years of glory and light 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:43.479
 this was the first flight to the wilderness verlande 900 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:47.299
 the flight to sedrata ista athens Berber all predict alas 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.819
 after the destruction of the city of character 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.819
 by the qualifications 

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:57.459
 the state wants to turn to its borders that stretched since the 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.899
 morocco up to lybie what scene in tripoli 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:02.649
 and he was farted 

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:05.749
 under the blows of enemy armies 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:08.689
 his arms wear besides years we see the heroine who still emerges 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.969
 today sand dunes at the edge of the road 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:13.969
 that goes from ouargla so was born road 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:18.469
 in front of the incessant attacks carried out by the enemy armies but he quickly 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:22.239
 seeing messengers 200 km to the west of a museum 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.949
 where he was counting pastel and a back-up base 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:28.669
 and that's how it was that around the year 1000 the first AIDS that were 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:31.989
 installed in the pavement k how some booklets this long hard fight 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.479
 which still lasts today 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:36.499
 the message 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:38.050
 l ap 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.170
 Why 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.239
 Why 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.439
 relative 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:45.439
 by 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.319
 lopes 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.389
 see 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:56.059
 the mezab region is commonly called the class 40 chair coming 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:59.449
 fly to the network the most aircraft the firm this term besides attributed 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:03.859
 for several centuries since l aligned a soon launched board 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:06.969
 in August a kind of net including five games with a stone column 

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:15.319
 unless I could do it was necessary to survive and first practice 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.319
 found louis too late all the ways 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.489
 because here no source reacted 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.699
 ocado permanent runoff exist 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.699
 no support put forest 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.110
 only casting from time to time we still experience far from us 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.310
 stun run down I mean by that a massive mass muddy dome swept over 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.789
 on the valley following a sudden thunderstorm 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:55.789
 and that once or twice a year even a lot less 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.680
 because the bed of the wadi did not remain some lawsuits for years 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.659
 it is in this that the bases of the m'zab are original 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:03.860
 in general 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.659
 men settle down and especially in a desert environment 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:10.990
 where there is natural water and well so precisely this lack of natural water 

00:05:10.989 --> 00:05:13.809
 and easy that was one of the arguments of the installation of so-called states in the 

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:17.249
 chain because they were fleeing the persecutions of their enemy 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:20.449
 and do not just think it would be quieter in a place 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.449
 completely deserted measures already exist occupied 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.199
 first man's job
