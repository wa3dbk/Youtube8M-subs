rolling<00:01:19.090> them<00:01:19.210> out<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:20.560> want<00:01:20.740> to<00:01:20.800> start<00:01:21.160> with

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
rolling them out you want to start with

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:29.969 
rolling them out you want to start with
a<00:01:22.000> fistful<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:24.310> dough<00:01:25.170> without<00:01:26.170> a<00:01:26.350> much<00:01:28.979> flour

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
a fistful the dough without a much flour

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.580 
a fistful the dough without a much flour
your<00:01:30.310> workstation<00:01:31.030> just<00:01:31.390> a<00:01:31.750> little<00:01:31.990> bit<00:01:32.080> you

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
your workstation just a little bit you

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.140 
your workstation just a little bit you
put<00:01:32.800> too<00:01:32.979> much<00:01:33.010> flour<00:01:33.400> down<00:01:33.670> then<00:01:33.910> the<00:01:34.000> dough

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
put too much flour down then the dough

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.850 
put too much flour down then the dough
will<00:01:34.330> tend<00:01:34.540> to<00:01:34.600> break<00:01:34.840> apart<00:01:35.229> and<00:01:35.470> won't<00:01:35.619> hold

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
will tend to break apart and won't hold

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.700 
will tend to break apart and won't hold
together<00:01:36.840> but<00:01:37.840> you<00:01:37.930> don't<00:01:38.110> want<00:01:38.260> it<00:01:38.320> to<00:01:38.410> stick

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
together but you don't want it to stick

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.120 
together but you don't want it to stick
either

either

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.460 
either
and<00:01:39.570> then<00:01:40.570> you<00:01:40.690> roll<00:01:40.930> it<00:01:41.050> out<00:01:41.200> with<00:01:41.320> your

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
and then you roll it out with your

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.680 
and then you roll it out with your
fingers<00:01:41.860> you<00:01:42.100> want<00:01:42.340> to<00:01:42.460> roll<00:01:42.700> it<00:01:42.729> out<00:01:43.090> with

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
fingers you want to roll it out with

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.690 
fingers you want to roll it out with
your<00:01:43.810> fingers<00:01:44.200> spread<00:01:44.320> apart<00:01:44.740> like<00:01:44.950> this<00:01:47.700> into

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
your fingers spread apart like this into

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.560 
your fingers spread apart like this into
about<00:01:48.910> a<00:01:48.970> half<00:01:49.360> inch<00:01:49.630> to<00:01:49.990> an<00:01:50.110> inch<00:01:50.259> diameter<00:01:51.570> so

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
about a half inch to an inch diameter so

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.480 
about a half inch to an inch diameter so
you<00:01:52.660> just<00:01:52.869> keep<00:01:53.110> working<00:01:53.380> it<00:01:53.770> you<00:01:53.800> start<00:01:54.280> from

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
you just keep working it you start from

the middle and you roll out towards the
ends<00:01:56.979> the<00:01:57.550> ends<00:01:57.850> start<00:01:58.149> to<00:01:58.300> come<00:01:58.479> apart<00:01:58.840> you

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
ends the ends start to come apart you

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.719 
ends the ends start to come apart you
can<00:01:59.259> tap<00:01:59.500> them<00:01:59.680> together<00:01:59.800> or<00:02:00.280> pinch<00:02:00.550> them

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
can tap them together or pinch them

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.810 
can tap them together or pinch them
together<00:02:01.470> and<00:02:02.470> you<00:02:02.590> just<00:02:02.619> keep<00:02:03.040> rolling<00:02:03.490> them

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
together and you just keep rolling them

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.639 
together and you just keep rolling them
down<00:02:03.850> until<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:06.460> reach<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:08.170> correct

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
down until you reach the correct

trying to make it even all the way down

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.050 
trying to make it even all the way down
it's<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.320> hardest<00:02:16.830> part<00:02:19.070> and<00:02:20.070> then<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.760> tap

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
it's the hardest part and then you tap

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.590 
it's the hardest part and then you tap
it<00:02:21.300> with<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.750> tips<00:02:22.320> of<00:02:22.470> your<00:02:22.530> fingers<00:02:23.300> all<00:02:24.300> the

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
way down all the way back you don't want

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.190 
way down all the way back you don't want
it<00:02:28.080> too<00:02:28.290> flat<00:02:28.470> but<00:02:28.830> just<00:02:29.040> enough<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:30.170> then<00:02:31.170> you

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200
