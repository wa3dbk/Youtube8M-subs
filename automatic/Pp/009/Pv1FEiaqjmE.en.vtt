wiremod tutorial for Garry's Mod and in
this<00:00:18.600> tutorial<00:00:18.840> we're<00:00:19.320> going<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.590> be<00:00:19.680> looking

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
this tutorial we're going to be looking

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.010 
this tutorial we're going to be looking
at<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.279> wire<00:00:20.580> trap<00:00:20.939> we<00:00:21.119> originally<00:00:21.480> made<00:00:21.779> in

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
at the wire trap we originally made in

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.679 
at the wire trap we originally made in
the<00:00:22.199> first<00:00:22.529> tutorial<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.250> improving<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.480> in

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
the first tutorial and improving it in

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.040 
the first tutorial and improving it in
adding<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.490> second<00:00:26.490> turret<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.599> because

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
adding a second turret to it because

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.050 
adding a second turret to it because
well<00:00:28.800> there's<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.039> lot<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.340> reasons<00:00:29.730> you'd<00:00:29.910> add

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
well there's a lot of reasons you'd add

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.999 
well there's a lot of reasons you'd add
a<00:00:30.090> second<00:00:30.570> turret<00:00:30.840> but<00:00:31.050> our<00:00:31.140> main<00:00:31.380> reason<00:00:31.769> here

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
a second turret but our main reason here

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:43.040 
a second turret but our main reason here
is<00:00:39.590> so<00:00:40.590> that's<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.610> reason<00:00:41.910> why<00:00:42.149> we're<00:00:42.899> going

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
is so that's the reason why we're going

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.049 
is so that's the reason why we're going
to<00:00:43.140> be<00:00:43.230> putting<00:00:43.530> two<00:00:43.829> turrets<00:00:44.070> it's<00:00:44.850> also

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
to be putting two turrets it's also

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.930 
to be putting two turrets it's also
going<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.600> be<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.070> they<00:00:47.190> can't<00:00:47.430> jump<00:00:47.850> over

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
going to be so that they can't jump over

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.590 
going to be so that they can't jump over
the<00:00:48.149> wire<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:49.489> we're<00:00:50.489> just<00:00:50.520> going<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.940> make<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
the wire so we're just going to make the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.720 
the wire so we're just going to make the
original<00:00:53.750> turret<00:00:54.750> trap<00:00:55.079> laser<00:00:55.590> trip<00:00:56.489> wire

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
original turret trap laser trip wire

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.720 
original turret trap laser trip wire
whatever<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.510> want<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.780> call<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.920> again

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
whatever you want to call it so again

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.490 
whatever you want to call it so again
you're<00:01:00.210> just<00:01:00.239> gonna<00:01:00.420> put<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> ranger<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.379> if

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
you're just gonna put a ranger and if

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.290 
you're just gonna put a ranger and if
I'm<00:01:01.620> going<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.949> little<00:01:02.100> too<00:01:02.219> fast<00:01:02.579> feel<00:01:03.000> free<00:01:03.270> to

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
I'm going a little too fast feel free to

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.240 
I'm going a little too fast feel free to
go<00:01:03.510> back<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.989> first<00:01:04.260> tutorial<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:05.129> then

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
go back to the first tutorial and then

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.500 
go back to the first tutorial and then
come<00:01:05.610> back<00:01:05.810> when<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:07.020> have<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.409> built<00:01:08.330> but<00:01:09.330> I

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
come back when you have it built but I

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.320 
come back when you have it built but I
am<00:01:09.720> just<00:01:09.930> going<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.350> go<00:01:11.100> through<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.880> very

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
am just going to go through this very

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.410 
am just going to go through this very
quickly<00:01:14.450> and<00:01:16.159> so<00:01:17.159> it's<00:01:17.759> going<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.060> be<00:01:18.210> made

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
quickly and so it's going to be made

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.030 
quickly and so it's going to be made
exactly<00:01:19.140> how<00:01:19.409> we<00:01:19.470> made<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:21.140> one<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.680> first

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
exactly how we made the one in the first

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.100 
exactly how we made the one in the first
tutorial<00:01:23.250> there's<00:01:23.909> going<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.299> be<00:01:24.390> nothing

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
tutorial there's going to be nothing

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.210 
tutorial there's going to be nothing
different<00:01:25.619> at<00:01:25.979> all<00:01:26.009> it's<00:01:26.520> going<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.150> be<00:01:28.220> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
different at all it's going to be the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.830 
different at all it's going to be the
exact<00:01:29.729> same<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:31.430> one<00:01:32.430> last<00:01:32.729> thing<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.479> our

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
exact same and one last thing is our

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.780 
exact same and one last thing is our
turret<00:01:34.759> and<00:01:36.380> we<00:01:37.700> wire<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:39.119> up<00:01:40.040> so<00:01:41.040> once<00:01:41.549> you

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
turret and we wire it up so once you

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.370 
turret and we wire it up so once you
have<00:01:42.000> everything<00:01:42.780> wired<00:01:43.140> here<00:01:43.649> like<00:01:44.159> so

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
have everything wired here like so

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.240 
have everything wired here like so
you're<00:01:46.380> just<00:01:46.439> going<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.680> come<00:01:46.860> over<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.100> the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
you're just going to come over to the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.929 
you're just going to come over to the
opposite<00:01:47.759> wall<00:01:48.560> now<00:01:49.560> you're<00:01:50.100> going<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.549> find

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
opposite wall now you're going to find

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.770 
opposite wall now you're going to find
about<00:01:51.710> where<00:01:52.710> when<00:01:53.610> they<00:01:53.759> jump<00:01:54.149> your<00:01:54.509> middle

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
about where when they jump your middle

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.870 
about where when they jump your middle
their<00:01:55.170> middle<00:01:55.500> masses<00:01:56.009> which<00:01:56.310> I'd<00:01:56.549> say<00:01:56.820> is

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
their middle masses which I'd say is

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.539 
their middle masses which I'd say is
about<00:01:58.310> not<00:01:59.310> there<00:01:59.579> but<00:02:00.390> all<00:02:01.020> right<00:02:01.200> about<00:02:01.549> I'd

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
about not there but all right about I'd

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.030 
about not there but all right about I'd
say<00:02:02.869> yeah<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.170> blood<00:02:04.380> splatter<00:02:04.770> works

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
say yeah the blood splatter works

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.960 
say yeah the blood splatter works
perfectly<00:02:06.500> so<00:02:07.500> what<00:02:07.979> we're<00:02:08.129> going<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.399> do<00:02:08.670> is

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
perfectly so what we're going to do is

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.880 
perfectly so what we're going to do is
we're<00:02:09.209> going<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.590> put<00:02:10.590> another

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
we're going to put another

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.850 
we're going to put another
Ranger<00:02:12.890> right<00:02:13.700> in<00:02:14.300> my<00:02:14.720> case<00:02:14.959> on<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:15.530> blood

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
Ranger right in my case on that blood

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.710 
Ranger right in my case on that blood
splatter<00:02:16.280> maybe<00:02:16.580> a<00:02:16.670> little<00:02:17.090> bit<00:02:17.480> lower

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
splatter maybe a little bit lower

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.390 
splatter maybe a little bit lower
because<00:02:17.990> that<00:02:18.260> looks<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.530> little<00:02:18.740> high<00:02:19.100> I'm

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
because that looks a little high I'm

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.970 
because that looks a little high I'm
gonna<00:02:19.550> put<00:02:19.760> it<00:02:19.850> right<00:02:19.880> here

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
gonna put it right here

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.340 
gonna put it right here
flashlight<00:02:21.980> so<00:02:22.130> you<00:02:22.190> guys<00:02:22.370> can<00:02:22.550> see<00:02:22.760> that<00:02:22.970> and

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
flashlight so you guys can see that and

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.960 
flashlight so you guys can see that and
essentially<00:02:24.350> or<00:02:24.980> pretty<00:02:25.310> much<00:02:25.370> you're<00:02:25.760> just

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
essentially or pretty much you're just

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.820 
essentially or pretty much you're just
building<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.660> exact<00:02:27.020> same<00:02:27.260> thing<00:02:27.530> on<00:02:27.650> the

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
building the exact same thing on the

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.280 
building the exact same thing on the
side<00:02:28.150> so<00:02:29.150> you're<00:02:29.600> just<00:02:29.660> gonna<00:02:29.840> go<00:02:30.050> ahead<00:02:30.110> and

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
side so you're just gonna go ahead and

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.220 
side so you're just gonna go ahead and
pop<00:02:30.440> a<00:02:30.500> turret<00:02:31.209> about<00:02:32.209> where<00:02:32.450> he'd<00:02:32.630> be<00:02:32.810> jumping

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
pop a turret about where he'd be jumping

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.440 
pop a turret about where he'd be jumping
at<00:02:33.380> I<00:02:33.620> put<00:02:34.220> it<00:02:34.310> really<00:02:34.489> close<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:34.970> Ranger

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
at I put it really close to the Ranger

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.300 
at I put it really close to the Ranger
and<00:02:35.630> I<00:02:37.840> that's<00:02:38.840> just<00:02:38.989> because<00:02:39.500> when<00:02:39.770> they<00:02:39.920> jump

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
and I that's just because when they jump

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.059 
and I that's just because when they jump
you<00:02:40.640> know<00:02:41.540> you<00:02:41.930> you're<00:02:42.260> guaranteeing<00:02:42.800> that

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
you know you you're guaranteeing that

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.270 
you know you you're guaranteeing that
there<00:02:43.220> in<00:02:43.370> that<00:02:43.520> spot<00:02:43.850> by<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.120> wire<00:02:44.360> and<00:02:45.280> then

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
there in that spot by the wire and then

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.240 
there in that spot by the wire and then
you're<00:02:46.700> just<00:02:46.820> going<00:02:47.030> to<00:02:47.090> get<00:02:47.300> another<00:02:47.660> gate

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
you're just going to get another gate

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.949 
you're just going to get another gate
same<00:02:49.250> exact<00:02:49.610> thing<00:02:49.820> comparison<00:02:50.480> gate<00:02:50.690> less

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
same exact thing comparison gate less

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.050 
same exact thing comparison gate less
than<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.620> you're<00:02:52.280> gonna<00:02:52.430> pop<00:02:52.640> that<00:02:52.880> on<00:02:53.030> there

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
than and you're gonna pop that on there

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.170 
than and you're gonna pop that on there
and<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:54.860> same<00:02:56.739> constant<00:02:57.739> value<00:02:58.190> make<00:02:59.030> sure

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
and the same constant value make sure

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.290 
and the same constant value make sure
the<00:02:59.300> value<00:02:59.480> is<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.870> same<00:03:00.110> and<00:03:00.700> I<00:03:01.700> think<00:03:02.090> that's

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
the value is the same and I think that's

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.820 
the value is the same and I think that's
it<00:03:02.510> so<00:03:02.660> we're<00:03:03.050> just<00:03:03.080> gonna<00:03:03.260> get<00:03:03.500> our<00:03:03.620> wire

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
it so we're just gonna get our wire

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.180 
it so we're just gonna get our wire
advanced<00:03:04.340> tool<00:03:04.640> back<00:03:04.850> out<00:03:05.060> and<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:06.530> wire<00:03:06.769> this

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
advanced tool back out and to wire this

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.479 
advanced tool back out and to wire this
to<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.489> output<00:03:07.970> day<00:03:08.750> to<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:09.590> Ranger<00:03:10.010> distance

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
to the output day to the Ranger distance

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.699 
to the output day to the Ranger distance
and<00:03:10.880> the<00:03:11.300> new<00:03:11.780> D<00:03:13.180> constant<00:03:14.180> value<00:03:14.480> so<00:03:15.019> I<00:03:15.410> don't

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
and the new D constant value so I don't

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.110 
and the new D constant value so I don't
think<00:03:15.890> I<00:03:15.950> need<00:03:16.010> to<00:03:16.220> explain<00:03:16.579> it<00:03:16.790> but<00:03:16.910> I'm<00:03:17.030> gonna

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
think I need to explain it but I'm gonna

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.979 
think I need to explain it but I'm gonna
go<00:03:17.329> over<00:03:17.480> briefly<00:03:17.660> again<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:19.250> Ranger<00:03:19.730> is<00:03:19.989> the

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
go over briefly again the Ranger is the

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.500 
go over briefly again the Ranger is the
a<00:03:21.019> value<00:03:21.620> constant<00:03:22.100> values<00:03:22.519> the<00:03:22.640> B<00:03:22.820> value<00:03:23.299> as

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
a value constant values the B value as

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.690 
a value constant values the B value as
if<00:03:24.049> now<00:03:24.170> it's<00:03:24.380> not<00:03:24.560> true<00:03:24.890> but<00:03:25.130> when<00:03:25.310> it<00:03:25.430> turns

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
if now it's not true but when it turns

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.380 
if now it's not true but when it turns
on<00:03:25.940> and<00:03:26.209> sends<00:03:27.140> a<00:03:27.200> one<00:03:27.380> to<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:27.680> gun<00:03:27.890> it<00:03:28.390> pretty

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
on and sends a one to the gun it pretty

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.660 
on and sends a one to the gun it pretty
much<00:03:29.510> turns<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.870> gun<00:03:30.019> on<00:03:30.079> and<00:03:30.440> fires<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:31.040> if

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
much turns the gun on and fires and if

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.610 
much turns the gun on and fires and if
you<00:03:31.760> want<00:03:31.910> a<00:03:31.970> more<00:03:32.120> in-depth<00:03:32.570> explanation<00:03:32.840> on

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
you want a more in-depth explanation on

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.750 
you want a more in-depth explanation on
how<00:03:33.650> it<00:03:33.890> works<00:03:34.010> and<00:03:34.280> visit<00:03:34.489> the<00:03:34.579> first

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
how it works and visit the first

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.960 
how it works and visit the first
tutorial<00:03:34.940> again<00:03:35.329> but<00:03:36.110> the<00:03:36.230> reason<00:03:36.590> why<00:03:36.769> this

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
tutorial again but the reason why this

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.300 
tutorial again but the reason why this
pretty<00:03:37.970> much<00:03:38.209> stops<00:03:38.930> people<00:03:39.799> from<00:03:40.070> being<00:03:40.220> able

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
pretty much stops people from being able

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.949 
pretty much stops people from being able
to<00:03:40.459> jump<00:03:40.700> over<00:03:40.850> is<00:03:41.180> because<00:03:41.570> if<00:03:41.690> they<00:03:41.780> jump

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
to jump over is because if they jump

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.900 
to jump over is because if they jump
over<00:03:42.200> this<00:03:42.320> one<00:03:42.530> they<00:03:42.680> get<00:03:42.799> hit<00:03:42.980> by<00:03:43.459> this<00:03:43.519> one

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
over this one they get hit by this one

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.300 
over this one they get hit by this one
so<00:03:44.600> I'll<00:03:44.840> demonstrate<00:03:45.049> now<00:03:45.530> if<00:03:45.680> I<00:03:45.769> just<00:03:46.100> walk

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
so I'll demonstrate now if I just walk

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.020 
so I'll demonstrate now if I just walk
through<00:03:46.340> I<00:03:46.880> get<00:03:47.570> dropped<00:03:47.959> and<00:03:48.829> if<00:03:49.400> I<00:03:49.579> were<00:03:49.790> to

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
through I get dropped and if I were to

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.120 
through I get dropped and if I were to
attempt<00:03:50.989> to<00:03:51.079> jump<00:03:51.590> I<00:03:51.910> also<00:03:52.910> get<00:03:53.780> to<00:03:53.900> hit<00:03:54.130> so

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
attempt to jump I also get to hit so

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.900 
attempt to jump I also get to hit so
