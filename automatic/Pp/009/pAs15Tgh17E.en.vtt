director<00:01:18.030> mode<00:01:18.210> script<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.110> basically<00:01:19.470> what

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
director mode script so basically what

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.499 
director mode script so basically what
this<00:01:19.920> means<00:01:20.189> there<00:01:20.610> are<00:01:20.729> hidden<00:01:20.850> scripts<00:01:21.299> in

this means there are hidden scripts in

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.510 
this means there are hidden scripts in
the<00:01:21.540> game<00:01:21.810> files<00:01:22.140> under<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.890> Rockstar<00:01:23.400> editor

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
director mode to relate to the jetpack

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.920 
director mode to relate to the jetpack
which<00:01:26.189> would<00:01:26.460> suggest<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.150> jetpack<00:01:27.689> is

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
which would suggest that the jetpack is

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.380 
which would suggest that the jetpack is
a<00:01:27.960> useable<00:01:28.560> item<00:01:28.920> when<00:01:29.400> using<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.850> director

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
a useable item when using the director

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.899 
a useable item when using the director
mode<00:01:30.600> but<00:01:30.960> unfortunately<00:01:31.710> as<00:01:31.920> far<00:01:32.159> as<00:01:32.549> we<00:01:32.700> know

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
mode but unfortunately as far as we know

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.030 
mode but unfortunately as far as we know
there<00:01:33.479> are<00:01:33.509> no<00:01:33.720> options<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.409> director<00:01:34.860> mode

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
there are no options in a director mode

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.160 
there are no options in a director mode
which<00:01:35.460> allow<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.909> select<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.329> item<00:01:36.659> now

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
which allow you to select the item now

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.590 
which allow you to select the item now
this<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.500> my<00:01:37.619> opinion<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.189> huge<00:01:38.579> mystery<00:01:39.000> why

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
this in my opinion is a huge mystery why

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.149 
this in my opinion is a huge mystery why

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
would Rockstar at the jet pack the

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.160 
would Rockstar at the jet pack the
direct<00:01:41.549> mode<00:01:41.820> which<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.450> course<00:01:42.659> say<00:01:42.869> brand

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
direct mode which of course say brand

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.109 
direct mode which of course say brand

my opinion this option seems the most

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000 
my opinion this option seems the most
likely<00:02:15.270> I<00:02:15.600> feel<00:02:16.020> as<00:02:16.110> if<00:02:16.140> Rockstar<00:02:16.680> is<00:02:16.770> teasing

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
likely I feel as if Rockstar is teasing

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.920 
likely I feel as if Rockstar is teasing
us<00:02:17.220> with<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.430> jetpack<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:18.180> we<00:02:18.420> will<00:02:18.540> never<00:02:18.660> get

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
us with a jetpack and we will never get

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.900

it<00:02:19.140> in<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.440> game<00:02:19.650> but<00:02:20.130> then<00:02:20.250> again<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.730> doesn't

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
it in the game but then again it doesn't

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.340 
it in the game but then again it doesn't
quite<00:02:21.150> make<00:02:21.330> sense<00:02:21.390> why<00:02:21.810> rocks<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.260> would

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
quite make sense why rocks that would

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.140 
quite make sense why rocks that would
keep<00:02:22.560> adding<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:22.950> item<00:02:23.310> into<00:02:23.850> some<00:02:24.000> of<00:02:24.090> the
