00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
driver to go with it so with a little

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.229 
driver to go with it so with a little
bit<00:03:14.810> of<00:03:14.870> gain<00:03:15.249> it<00:03:16.249> really<00:03:16.549> sweetens<00:03:16.909> up<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:17.180> it

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
bit of gain it really sweetens up and it

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.959 
bit of gain it really sweetens up and it
takes<00:03:17.480> this<00:03:17.719> pedal<00:03:18.170> particularly<00:03:19.040> well<00:03:19.310> so<00:03:19.909> of

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:19.969 
takes this pedal particularly well so of

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:21.099

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
course that's one of the things I like

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.670 
course that's one of the things I like
about<00:03:21.170> it<00:03:21.439> is<00:03:22.569> you<00:03:23.569> know<00:03:23.719> how<00:03:23.900> it<00:03:24.109> works<00:03:24.349> with

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
about it is you know how it works with

00:03:24.680 --> 00:04:57.660

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
so that's what it sounds like with the

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.120
