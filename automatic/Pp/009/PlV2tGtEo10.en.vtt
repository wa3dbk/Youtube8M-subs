the<00:00:45.899> description<00:00:46.079> box<00:00:46.590> below<00:00:46.680> does<00:00:47.579> these

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
the description box below does these

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.439 
the description box below does these
wonderful<00:00:48.930> walking<00:00:49.920> doll<00:00:50.579> cakes<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.420> I

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
wonderful walking doll cakes and I

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.959 
wonderful walking doll cakes and I
really<00:00:51.690> wanted<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.079> try<00:00:52.800> my<00:00:53.129> hand<00:00:53.280> at<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.730> and

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
really wanted to try my hand at it and

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.090 
really wanted to try my hand at it and
see<00:00:54.120> if<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.359> could<00:00:54.600> create<00:00:54.899> something<00:00:55.320> similar

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
see if I could create something similar

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.180 
see if I could create something similar
so<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:57.359> a<00:00:57.449> bit<00:00:57.629> different<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.410> your<00:00:58.769> regular

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
so it's a bit different to your regular

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.889 
so it's a bit different to your regular
doll<00:00:59.399> cake<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.789> don't<00:00:59.820> cut<00:01:00.239> just<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> section

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
doll cake you don't cut just the section

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.150 
doll cake you don't cut just the section
out<00:01:01.019> the<00:01:01.140> middle<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.530> then<00:01:01.649> decorate<00:01:02.039> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
out the middle and then decorate the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.669 
out the middle and then decorate the
whole<00:01:02.309> dress<00:01:02.519> I<00:01:02.760> am<00:01:03.719> going<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.110> cut<00:01:04.259> a<00:01:04.410> section

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:07.070 
whole dress I am going to cut a section
out<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.039> the<00:01:05.309> cake<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.850> Elsa<00:01:06.690> is<00:01:06.840> actually

going<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.619> use<00:01:37.830> just<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.369> doll<00:01:38.550> cake<00:01:38.789> pan<00:01:39.060> and

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
going to use just the doll cake pan and

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.469 
going to use just the doll cake pan and
we're<00:01:40.440> going<00:01:40.649> to<00:01:40.739> fiddle<00:01:41.369> with<00:01:41.759> our<00:01:42.119> cake

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.999 
we're going to fiddle with our cake
until<00:01:42.840> we<00:01:42.959> have<00:01:43.080> the<00:01:43.200> shape<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.410> we<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:43.770> and

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
until we have the shape that we like and

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.719 
until we have the shape that we like and
then<00:01:44.099> it<00:01:44.250> simply<00:01:44.670> needs<00:01:44.849> some<00:01:45.539> crumb<00:01:46.170> coating

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729

to spend some time cutting strips of the
fondant<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:23.519> draping<00:03:23.849> it<00:03:24.030> around<00:03:24.299> where<00:03:24.510> we

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
fondant and draping it around where we

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:26.569 
fondant and draping it around where we
would<00:03:24.810> like<00:03:24.989> on<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.470> cake<00:03:25.650> so<00:03:26.160> this<00:03:26.340> takes

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
some time as you can imagine very it's

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.780 
some time as you can imagine very it's
quite<00:03:29.220> fiddly<00:03:29.459> but<00:03:30.829> it<00:03:31.829> is<00:03:32.160> worth<00:03:32.400> it<00:03:32.549> in<00:03:32.760> the

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
quite fiddly but it is worth it in the

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:33.379 
quite fiddly but it is worth it in the
end

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389

the cape on the back you don't need to

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.750 
the cape on the back you don't need to

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
put a lot of layers on the back I didn't

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.069
