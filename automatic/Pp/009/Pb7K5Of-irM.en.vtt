 occupational

 social psychologist 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.820
 I'm not crazy fax leader in supporting the 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.700
 this school that in which works with what now attends to all the children 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.820

 in special schools the condition of the student that includes other 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:14.549
 Limits 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.759
 not to mention that physical disability 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.719
 associated with the deficiencies that make it difficult for those who got married at the 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:25.819
 a regular school beyond physical disability business disability 

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:28.819
 communication deficiencies 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.830
 intellectuals also doctor Ana speaks of the difficulties found in schools 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:35.500
 regular 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.620
 as a child recommended patience 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.610
 it is a passion every home in são paulo of physical education she needs 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.940
 park that she will need the other environments 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.800
 it is necessary that the person is very afraid and it is that child stay 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.160
 7 occur in the bead chair 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.620
 and we know how 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.260
 this is harmful that year 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.100
 because shows or computer 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.740
 as support the inter est that only that child she will not have 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.230
 access to each conventional year it will not have access 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.300
 as the computer teaches, it becomes the electronic 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.510
 tricolor, but the fun and lack of teachers' knowledge in the use of 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.260
 this technology only received the equipment you do not guarantee 

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:23.849
 had almost 170 thousand spectators of education that do not have 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.290
 an occupational therapist 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.670
 force of truth is causing the 'teacher' elected to be of the actors given 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.460
 when using resources who does not know or use enem is to evaluate 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.879
 the purpose of using this resource so that this child has 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.090
 difficulties in adapting to school are cited as a challenge for the 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.050
 accessibility promotion today you have 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.290
 standards for quarreling at least for a bathroom, we 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.440
 indication is to find and 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.090
 It's not just for the child to stretch a towel because sometimes 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.800
 Do you have a classroom? 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.420
 for example a huge classroom is used for the 6-year-old child 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.650
 and nice evening of youth and adult education you have for example month or 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.450
 thousands being used a teenager of 15 and 16 years a child who is in the 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.700
 she does not have adequate pastoral guidance that 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.030
 disrupting the school's income, the important thing is access to what is the 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.939
 content 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:24.059
 is meant access to content that people who will think about all these 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.900
 materials 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.139
 which may facilitate access to the 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.329
 to the content that the teacher passes such stolen in the room of acts 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.709
 she thinks about it, she cites some interventions according to the activity 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.479
 it is necessary that a crisis that does not use paper 

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:48.839
 do not use conventional pencils so we'll have to think about all these 

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:51.650
 adaptations such as promoting what is 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.090
 student is as autonomous as possible in this race 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:59.209
 we can help the professional only 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.459
 the indication of a furniture adapted as an organization of the 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.179
 as the organization of recreation as an organization that 

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:11.319
 that explain to him that even the amount of materials exposed 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.579
 that he has in the classroom can divert attention from this year, I think today 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.129
 occupational therapist can greatly help within the Latin 

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:23.430
 the occupational therapist commented on how the 

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:28.509
 disabled students had millions of what these showed but my son already with the 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:32.490
 head beheaded he will suffer some kind of discrimination in the seven years 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.729
 that I'm here 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:34.860
 is weird 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.120
 It was not too quiet because the children are extremely 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.379
 welcoming this training with teachers also at the level of ' 

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:44.930
 three children of solidarity 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.900
 all this influences so that this does not happen 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.210
 doctor Claudia is optimistic about not only editing the 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.920
 deficient regular schools ten years ago 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.139
 he maintained that the conversation with people 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.400
 the first thing was perhaps to discuss where would that better child 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.520
 even in the attack 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.360
 do not have 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.050
 another space that I would serve is better than it does today when I arrive 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.949
 in the school class b class teacher you can do to help me 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:12.000
 stay with this year 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.960
 what he can learn and that was his point of view 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.760
 on the difficult road to be traversed historically we are still 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:21.070
 initiating this process 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.440
