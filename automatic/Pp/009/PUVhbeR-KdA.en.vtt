00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.790
 Hey guys, I've been four five seven and a year 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:05.910
 we see in the title 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.739
 Something new again and someone has brought me to the idea 

00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:13.559
 and the link to his place is now again thank you very much here in Holm 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.499
 Service I assume 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:19.320
 Year again I found the idea is not good and snowy 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.380
 now a few instructional videos 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.469
 but as here everything was continuation for the basic rules 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:29.339
 and 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.339
 "Maybe some of Colin's game is coming up 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.940
 to understand the game a bit better 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.390
 I have it and timetable videos here now 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.380
 in total in clashes 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.120
 I do not know four or five yet 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.140
 but ever 8 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.039
 Let's just start from the beginning 1 and the topic 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.120
 the hour 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.170
 and since this video is always here now Â»in the middle now 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.170
 Stuhr must stand 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.850
 against word 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.510
 and sprinkles is the topic KERS plans b6 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.130
 if that's too short with the basics hits then come DAX directly behind 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.710
 little is the next lesson 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.340
 and yes, what do I mean by Basic, my first thing you need from duels 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.370
 for a duel 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.650
 you need a playing field or to save in the underground 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.190
 So on the floor 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.870
 in Legend is not that normal doll was normal 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.520
 I have a black hour mat this moment is not available 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.530
 disposal 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.900
 Percent find it and therefore 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.950
 but to avoid it 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.080
 you should become a pad for 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.540
 Newbies, I recommend this paper and publisher you give them 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.990
 Stocker DAX 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.270
 gets 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.940
 I think that's pretty good because that's about the complete playing field on it 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.240
 Grandmas immediately what when and where to lie down 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.060
 and that's why it's a very good idea 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.060
 and also she replaces and novice drivers 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.740
 and yes there could immediately recognize what as where 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.260
 to lean back is here 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.050
 and as ever before completely start again the reference to 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.149
 the three principles videos 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:14.069
 If you really do not know the game, check it out 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.069
 purely 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.879
 Let's start here a word said a playing field 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:25.729
 it took a bit more to write down the health points 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:27.139
 I believe many 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:30.349
 a note so I think it's best 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.049
 many users are using a calculator 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.430
 I think calculators are not bad only to recalculate but to the dearest 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.659
 should write on it to write notes 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.509
 Presque Isle of Wight pull that out of percent 

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:43.319
 then clears the health points 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.759
 or the line goes off by itself or something and then here you have the salad 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.359
 So I recommend note Calculator course to calculate you can use 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:56.929
 but the health points should already be recorded on the slip 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:02:59.239
 here alone for 5 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.239
 you could also use it or a coin so both actually 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.939
 Percent for certain effects of cards 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.339
 Ochmann the unf 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:12.719
 so far fair that it is actually the most important natural way 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:15.369
 one of the biggest man 

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:16.479
 and yes 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:18.959
 then continue directly with DAX 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.529
 in fact 

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:22.269
 what is a good beginner deck 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.949
 I say already invited deck I find not suitable for beginners 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.259
 Pink ladies are very complicated 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:32.400
 Percent among other things also because of the merger decision above 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.910
 Kuntz yes wrestling by giving many special school wien to this DAX 

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:40.639
 and 'I find' location is actually not suitable for beginners that needs 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.589
 but of course everyone knows themselves 

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:44.009
 around 

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:45.059
 general 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:48.589
 I want to say if you are a beginner and get to know the game now 

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:52.219
 you do not want to make it too complicated 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:55.219
 that means fusion nonsense big 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.839
 I would let out 

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:01.529
 except from 

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:04.809
 the dec based on this big 

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:07.559
 like the WAZ chimeras 

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:10.459
 if you want to build yourself in the Vatican now to serve then you should 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.639
 of course dub the waddles 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:16.229
 The same applies to mergers if I want to build in La DEG now 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.030
 you can not do without the merger work i just recommend DAX too 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.719
 to take 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:25.310
 not relying on Sylt big or merger are the beginning 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.879
 because that's the easiest way I think 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:28.830
 and yes 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.770
 continue to the DEK 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.349
 as I said easily 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:33.389
 and 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.309
 it should 

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:38.240
 also very well structured and considered 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.400
 what you are doing in there 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.909
 Of course that's difficult at the beginning 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:44.159
 but 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:47.949
 In the bit of strategy should be in there but it should not be complete 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:52.229
 Strategy be fully rehearsed because afterwards you have to because he likes it 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.339
 think for five minutes before you can do something on what 

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:56.729
 I bake that now 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.309
 that certainly does not make a mistake 

00:04:58.309 --> 00:05:00.650
 So I should have experienced that at least in the beginning 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:01.610
 and 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.499
 therefore slightly structured DAX 

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:07.550
 and still strong can not recommend 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.919
 because of the battery pack thick because I think personally strongly structured and 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.809
 is not too complicated 

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:16.219
 So I can recommend that 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:20.039
 yes, I also made one here you have to click the Evo 

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:23.199
 and yes 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.419
 I think that as a state I say 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:29.779
 Not at all bad 

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:31.960
 yes what exactly 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.409
 You should be in Einbeck 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:37.129
 In no case install Kottan who does not hear the deck 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:41.559
 For example, in the magic garden that actually gets you in the way 

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:43.050
 nothing brings 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.449
 you have no binge GEK and play a test Heike 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:49.449
 a try puts that does not work 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:55.309
 i shout he lives i also often did that mhe 

00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:56.789
 So sooner 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:00.509
 because she found a card just super awesome and then they stick 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:02.949
 why should not it built in 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:04.720
 Mandac should go for it 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.210
 that works around deck too 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.289
 if we now rainbow gutter box now brings nothing to the municipal boundaries 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:13.089
 Federal no Christian has tremendously covers 

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:16.729
 So you should pay attention to it if you like a card important then 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:19.729
 even discovered to build that I can only say 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.090
 how can the capacity of the DAX should not be him 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.150
 If this is not the case then it should be between 50 and 60 CAD 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:29.529
 was in the camera 

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:32.580
 I always recommend 14 games but also around 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.789
 for beginners 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:36.960
 because now that attracts what you need 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.250
 "If we have 60 cards or the KAB then pull something and you 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.499
 they can not do anything with it at the moment 

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:43.509
 therefore 

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:47.650
 I try to keep TEXO working as well as possible 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:48.280
 much 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.589
 they once left from 

00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:51.919
 and therefore 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:53.310
 yes I really recommend you 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.310
 40 so the capacity and you do not 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:59.339
 after passing 

00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:02.379
 So I would have already said everything what you to DAX 

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:06.809
 Should still know in addition to the basic video 

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:10.749
 so that was the first basic video and in the next gates on with 

00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:12.379
 moves 

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:15.079
 and yet not easy his business makes you shudder
