00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.220
 and welcome to this new comment 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.560
 arié so I planned to do a 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.960
 number that you probably would have done 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.000
 pleasure but I'm going to reach them for 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.130
 talk about the latest phenomenon 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.060
 lou cariot in super smash bros wii u 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.460
 and 3ds 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.830
 so this is an opportunity to revisit the 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.350
 pokemon the most appreciated of the generations 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.300
 pearls and diamonds 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.589
 why is he so loved and his 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.589
 treatment in different media 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.510
 to start, you have to go back 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.549
 back end 2004 early 2005 the time when 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.559
 I received my first computer 

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:55.260
 could connect to the internet and that 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.210
 I was able to discover these wonders at this 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.580
 time pokemon france and time and 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.049
 challenge the missing site were the 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.239
 best poker news sites 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:05.159
 good hip hip pop was barely a year old and 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.229
 angers had just created the forum eternia 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.820
 without suspecting that shoeing as well as 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.799
 several years later 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.420
 at this time investigate the arrival of 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.750
 information about pearl pokemon and 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.790
 diamond 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.500
 yeah at the time ken fric had 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.150
 announced pearl pokemon titles and 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.009
 diamond earlier in the year without the 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.600
 China only info the only thing we 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.409
 knew that there would be a fee 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.060
 ksp revolution the reflex but then 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.859
 that we expected the eighth 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.729
 movie is centered on the legendary trio 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:32.219
 of on 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.499
 suddenly we are told that the title 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:35.450
 tentative was miou and the hero 

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:38.189
 leaving the waves 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.109
 we knew that better had been 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.539
 put there to promote pokemon 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:44.189
 red fire is green leaf but we do not 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:44.700
 did not know who was this hero who in 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.600
 waves 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.090
 it was Sasha a key character of the movie 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.880
 a new pokemon and the answer is 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.229
 appeared in March 2005 in a scan on 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.450
 only had the silhouette at the time 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.909
 but pokemon sunday that was still doing 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.310
 axles at the time had revealed the 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.380
 movie details with lou cariot center le 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.389
 month after the magazines announce it 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.950
 officially with dimo reynolds hay 

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:11.879
 junior enemies 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.610
 and finally on July 7, 2005, the movie 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.780
 in Japanese electric cinemas 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.120
 agree that it was 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.760
 excellent of course it took us 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.200
 wait for the release of the dvd in japan for 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.910
 see the movie on the internet 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.380
 and even worse at the time the movie 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.510
 pokémon did not even go out in France anymore 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.120
 we had to wait until 2008 to see the movie 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.580
 finally at home but in the end we were 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.590
 glad because we could really say that 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.920
 it was the best pokemon movie ever since 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.390
 the first movie but let's go back in 2005 the 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.580
 pokemon lou cariot had been very 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.950
 enjoyed in the movie and anecdotes of 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.750
 the time it was the first film whose 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.430
 pokemon star was not a pokemon 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.470
 legendary and the worst thing is that we 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.599
 did not even know we all thought that lou 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.280
 cariot was a legendary pokemon on 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.019
 even thought it was equivalent to 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.560
 mutu was also only the fourth 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.810
 generation 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.940
 but no lou cariot was not a 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.099
 legendary pokemon that means we have 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.569
 had to wait for pearl pokemon leaks 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.250
 and diamond that announced the prevost 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.560
 lution of lou cariot to know that this 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.849
 was not legendary the promotion of 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.010
 the fourth generation had been 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.180
 successful face pokemon certainly can not 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.260
 could not capture rusty wolf 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.209
 wild in pearls and diamonds 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.769
 the only way to have to lou cariot 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.750
 it was the appendage quest of lille de 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.790
 to do but in the end his rent is the 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.790
 pokemon more special and suddenly we are 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.650
 fuck and then we get to super smash 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.940
 bros brawl and as the fourth 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.160
 generation was topical 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.319
 we decided to put lou cariot in 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.400
 playable character 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.350
 a lot of fans were still in 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.750
 anger since it was said that lou cariot 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.739
 had stolen the place better everything but 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.900
 it's not really what happened 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.489
 we must restore the truth about it to 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.160
 the time of the development of super smash 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.900
 bros brawl 40 characters were planned 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.160
 but did not have the time that you 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.859
 developed 35 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.650
 among these characters put aside there 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:58.230
 had a character from the zelda universe 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:01.139
 tetra a character from the tanguay universe 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.989
 tic conch it's a character of 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:06.090
 universe fire emblem breuil and two 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.160
 characters from the pokemon universe and his 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.209
 characters are mewtwo and the pipe 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.700
 possible hincapie 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.410
 so, of course, they preferred you because 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.269
 you and you to but as I'm going to tell 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.039
 the time we were in the fourth 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.800
 generation of pokemon and lou cariot 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.450
 was already very popular 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.640
 so they continued to treat well 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.960
 the pokemon rio wolf had become a 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.310
 pokemon starter mystery dungeon 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.140
 sky explorers 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.610
 one might even wonder why he 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.280
 was not so much explorers of the 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.230
 time and shade then riolo was 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.670
 become wild pokemon for can 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.770
 capture at the beginning of pokemon version 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.950
 black of the salesgirls and he gets a 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.110
 mega evolution in x and y is finally 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:47.130
 we were offered 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:49.020
 outright in this game of the coup the only 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.090
 when fans have placed themselves a little 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.920
 his treatment in the cartoon 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.310
 after as good a movie as the eighth 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.390
 we hoped that each pure riolo 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:01.080
 he did not do it in the saga 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:03.870
 diamondine pearl dupont we were a little 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.570
 disappointed a moment of hope with pokemon ps 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.750
 close to them but their eyes look from the 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.790
 promo already had a sister trait yet 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.770
 after lou cariot has always been appreciated 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:17.730
 on the screen but we really wanted 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.800
 that sacha catch his last chance 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.630
 now is that the xy series works 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.270
 a bit like the game and that cornelia 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.800
 offer to sacha alucard you would not it 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.010
 that for Sasha is a mega 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.780
 evolution in are being watched and now 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.360
 he's back time super smash bros 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.520
 sports wii u and 3ds 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.260
 the fans are divided into two those who 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.490
 are happy and those who are not 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.440
 happy because they think mewtwo 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:44.010
 no longer has any chance is in casting 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.470
 that's what I think about it according to 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.990
 the fans have 1000 or cariou in super 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.190
 smash bros brawl for promotion to 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.200
 the fourth generation 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.030
 which is true but we also say that 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.460
 that's why we removed mewtwo this 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.050
 which is wrong and here we allocate cariou 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.680
 time super smash bros sports wii u and 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.420
 3ds 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.360
 while we are no longer in the fourth 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.980
 generation good certainly he may have been 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.530
 put there to promote the maca 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.870
 evolution but I want to say no 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.670
 because the pokémon who promoted the best 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.760
 lameca evolution is still better 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.620
 where everything is like cariou has never been 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.380
 planned in the universe super smash bros 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.450
 to be a substitute to bare all mewtwo 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.430
 totally chances to reappear 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.960
 especially since ksm fric to share 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.090
 his desire to make appear but that 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.980
 better everything in the game 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.530
 we could even have positioned capi 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.690
 in a playable character 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.550
 although if laziness it would be a 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.130
 good opportunity to make promo remake 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:40.550
 busting ruby even though I would prefer 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:42.860
 prat and callian pokemon 3g playable so 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.510
 we will have to conclude all that lou 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.100
 cariot is not only one of 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.590
 pokemon the most popular of the 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.419
 fourth generation but also one of 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:53.000
 pokemon the most popular of the 

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:55.430
 license so that we wish that sacha 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.560
 capture the only times he was 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.510
 really does and stc when we thought that 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.450
 lou cariot replace mewtwo time brawl 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:04.070
 but of course all of this will be forgiven if 

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.630
 mewtwo appears in smash bros 

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.729
 sports wii u and 3ds 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:12.169
 but few are the pokémon who have 

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:13.970
 so marked the fans is the end of 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:15.470
 this comment and I'll go back to 

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.930
