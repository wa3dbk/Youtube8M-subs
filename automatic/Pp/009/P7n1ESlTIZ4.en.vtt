hey guys today we're going to be working
with<00:00:02.760> a<00:00:04.009> texture<00:00:05.009> atlases<00:00:06.000> and<00:00:06.390> textures<00:00:07.010> it's

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
with a texture atlases and textures it's

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.190 
with a texture atlases and textures it's
kind<00:00:08.189> of<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.340> confusing<00:00:08.790> topic<00:00:09.179> or<00:00:09.570> not<00:00:09.990> so<00:00:10.139> much

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
kind of a confusing topic or not so much

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.169 
kind of a confusing topic or not so much
confusing<00:00:10.950> but<00:00:11.250> hard<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:11.969> remember<00:00:12.440> but<00:00:14.179> we're

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
confusing but hard to remember but we're

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.010 
confusing but hard to remember but we're
going<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.360> go<00:00:15.509> ahead<00:00:15.630> with<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:15.960> anyway

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
going to go ahead with it anyway

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.890 
going to go ahead with it anyway
basically<00:00:16.470> lets<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.100> create<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.580> an<00:00:18.029> animation

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
basically lets you create a an animation

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
basically lets you create a an animation
where<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.740> switches<00:00:20.070> out<00:00:20.400> images<00:00:20.939> on<00:00:21.150> interval

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
where it switches out images on interval

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.460 
where it switches out images on interval
and<00:00:23.090> then<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.180> can<00:00:24.359> run<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.720> continuously

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
and then you can run that continuously

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.589 
and then you can run that continuously
so<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.130> get<00:00:26.310> like<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.820> could<00:00:27.420> make

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
so that you get like you could make

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.779 
so that you get like you could make
somebody<00:00:27.840> walk<00:00:28.199> or<00:00:28.920> something<00:00:29.070> like<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.400> but

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
somebody walk or something like that but

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:30.679 
somebody walk or something like that but
in<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.000> case<00:00:30.179> we're<00:00:30.359> going<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.539> make<00:00:30.630> a

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
in this case we're going to make a

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.049 
in this case we're going to make a
parrot<00:00:31.050> that's<00:00:31.230> flying<00:00:31.550> I'll<00:00:32.550> put<00:00:32.759> these

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
parrot that's flying I'll put these

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.200 
parrot that's flying I'll put these
images<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.870> description<00:00:34.610> and<00:00:35.610> one<00:00:36.030> thing

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
images in the description and one thing

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.209 
images in the description and one thing
you<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.420> do<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.690> prepare<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.680> images<00:00:38.040> is

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
you have to do to prepare the images is

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.450 
you have to do to prepare the images is
put<00:00:38.550> them<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.000> folder<00:00:39.270> called<00:00:40.460> peridot

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
put them in a folder called peridot

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.880 
put them in a folder called peridot
Atlas<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.840> can<00:00:42.989> call<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.320> anything<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.680> want

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
Atlas you can call it anything you want

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.650 
Atlas you can call it anything you want
it<00:00:44.070> could<00:00:44.219> be<00:00:44.309> walked<00:00:44.640> out<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.300> for<00:00:45.510> somebody

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
it could be walked out this for somebody

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.350 
it could be walked out this for somebody
walking<00:00:46.050> or<00:00:46.320> whatever<00:00:46.640> but<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.760> have<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.030> make

walking or whatever but you have to make

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.080 
walking or whatever but you have to make
the<00:00:48.629> folder<00:00:49.289> say<00:00:49.620> dot<00:00:49.860> Atlas<00:00:50.370> at<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.969> end

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
the folder say dot Atlas at the end

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.830 
the folder say dot Atlas at the end
because<00:00:51.780> it's<00:00:52.110> going<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.320> be<00:00:52.440> reference<00:00:52.890> later

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
because it's going to be reference later

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
going to do is create three areas going

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.030 
going to do is create three areas going
to<00:02:00.540> raise<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.200> we're<00:02:01.320> going<00:02:01.410> to<00:02:01.500> create<00:02:01.740> an

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
to raise that we're going to create an

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.030 
to raise that we're going to create an
atlas<00:02:02.550> so<00:02:03.030> we're<00:02:03.210> going<00:02:03.300> to<00:02:03.390> make<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:04.040> texture

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
atlas so we're going to make a texture

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.380 
atlas so we're going to make a texture
atlas<00:02:05.160> sk<00:02:05.850> texture<00:02:06.240> Atlas<00:02:06.600> atlas<00:02:07.940> is<00:02:08.940> equal<00:02:09.390> to

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
atlas sk texture Atlas atlas is equal to

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:19.310 
atlas sk texture Atlas atlas is equal to
sk<00:02:12.390> texture<00:02:13.020> Atlas<00:02:13.550> atlas<00:02:14.630> named<00:02:16.700> that<00:02:18.320> parrot

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
sk texture Atlas atlas named that parrot

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.190 
sk texture Atlas atlas named that parrot
and<00:02:19.800> this<00:02:20.310> is<00:02:20.430> where<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.790> folder<00:02:21.720> name<00:02:21.900> comes

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
and this is where that folder name comes

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.910 
and this is where that folder name comes
in<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.560> has<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:23.040> be<00:02:23.070> the<00:02:23.430> same<00:02:23.670> name<00:02:23.970> parrot

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
in it has to be the same name parrot

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.670 
in it has to be the same name parrot
atlas<00:02:25.920> okay<00:02:26.910> this<00:02:27.900> was<00:02:28.080> different<00:02:28.440> it

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
atlas okay this was different it

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.280 
atlas okay this was different it
wouldn't<00:02:28.950> work<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:29.900> then<00:02:30.900> i'll<00:02:30.990> create<00:02:31.170> a

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
wouldn't work so then i'll create a

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.370 
wouldn't work so then i'll create a
texture<00:02:34.700> arrêt<00:02:35.700> one<00:02:35.850> texture<00:02:36.840> is<00:02:36.959> basically

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
texture arrêt one texture is basically

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.410 
texture arrêt one texture is basically
an<00:02:37.470> image<00:02:37.770> that<00:02:37.800> loads<00:02:38.720> efficiently<00:02:41.090> whoa<00:02:42.090> i

that frame that size I over to it and
then<00:04:14.360> we're<00:04:14.600> going<00:04:14.750> to<00:04:14.810> make<00:04:15.940> an<00:04:16.940> array<00:04:17.359> of<00:04:17.390> our

then we're going to make an array of our
textures

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:36.330

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
going to use that variable will create

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:55.129 
going to use that variable will create

an action called flight this K action

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.990 
an action called flight this K action
animate<00:04:56.139> with<00:04:56.590> textures<00:04:57.190> and<00:04:57.520> then<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:57.729> list

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
animate with textures and then the list

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.460 
animate with textures and then the list
of<00:04:58.120> textures<00:04:58.630> that<00:04:58.660> you<00:04:58.960> want<00:04:59.139> to<00:04:59.169> animate

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
of textures that you want to animate

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.650 
of textures that you want to animate
with<00:04:59.830> and<00:05:00.099> then<00:05:00.880> the<00:05:01.000> rate<00:05:01.210> that<00:05:01.449> you<00:05:01.539> want

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
with and then the rate that you want

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.680 
with and then the rate that you want
internet<00:05:02.380> and<00:05:02.590> we're<00:05:02.800> going<00:05:02.919> to<00:05:02.949> do<00:05:03.360> and<00:05:04.360> every

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
internet and we're going to do and every

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.770 
internet and we're going to do and every
twentieth<00:05:05.080> of<00:05:05.139> a<00:05:05.229> second<00:05:06.389> it'll<00:05:07.389> change<00:05:07.599> the

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
twentieth of a second it'll change the

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.480 
twentieth of a second it'll change the
frame<00:05:07.930> I<00:05:08.199> tested<00:05:08.710> it<00:05:08.770> beforehand<00:05:09.220> and<00:05:09.340> that

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
frame I tested it beforehand and that

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.749 
frame I tested it beforehand and that
was<00:05:09.610> like<00:05:09.880> a<00:05:09.910> rate<00:05:10.900> that<00:05:10.930> looks<00:05:11.259> good<00:05:11.759> sk

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:12.759 
was like a rate that looks good sk

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:16.740 
was like a rate that looks good sk
action<00:05:13.389> just<00:05:14.320> repeat<00:05:15.509> and<00:05:16.509> we're<00:05:16.599> going<00:05:16.720> to

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
action just repeat and we're going to

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.620 
action just repeat and we're going to
make<00:05:16.990> this<00:05:17.229> little<00:05:18.130> flight<00:05:18.520> thing<00:05:18.820> repeat

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
make this little flight thing repeat

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:28.439 
make this little flight thing repeat
infinitely<00:05:21.870> so<00:05:22.870> we<00:05:23.020> gotta<00:05:23.199> go<00:05:26.400> action<00:05:27.449> repeat

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 
infinitely so we gotta go action repeat

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:37.640 
infinitely so we gotta go action repeat
action<00:05:29.050> forever<00:05:30.330> light<00:05:31.330> and<00:05:32.169> now<00:05:32.919> we<00:05:32.979> need<00:05:33.430> to

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:44.879 

need<00:05:38.650> to<00:05:38.800> run<00:05:39.639> that<00:05:39.820> action<00:05:40.419> repeat<00:05:43.650> then<00:05:44.650> we

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
need to run that action repeat then we

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:47.790 
need to run that action repeat then we
need<00:05:45.009> to<00:05:45.070> add<00:05:45.460> the<00:05:45.849> atlases<00:05:46.840> you<00:05:47.139> need<00:05:47.560> to<00:05:47.680> add

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
need to add the atlases you need to add

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.459 
need to add the atlases you need to add
the<00:05:47.830> parrot<00:05:48.280> to<00:05:48.370> the<00:05:48.490> screen<00:05:48.780> so<00:05:49.780> i<00:05:50.280> pair<00:05:51.280> it<00:05:52.469> ok

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:53.469 
the parrot to the screen so i pair it ok

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:55.680 
the parrot to the screen so i pair it ok
so<00:05:53.530> what<00:05:54.099> we've<00:05:54.219> got<00:05:54.250> here<00:05:54.400> go<00:05:55.180> over<00:05:55.389> the<00:05:55.509> code

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
so what we've got here go over the code

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.939 
so what we've got here go over the code
once<00:05:55.900> is<00:05:56.110> an<00:05:57.009> atlas<00:05:57.490> which<00:05:57.789> is<00:05:58.620> basically<00:05:59.620> a

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949 
once is an atlas which is basically a

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:03.330 
once is an atlas which is basically a
set<00:06:00.820> of<00:06:01.000> images<00:06:01.180> and<00:06:01.680> then<00:06:02.680> we<00:06:02.949> create

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
set of images and then we create

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.520 
set of images and then we create
textures<00:06:03.880> within<00:06:04.180> the<00:06:04.270> atlas<00:06:07.199> this<00:06:08.199> is<00:06:08.380> our

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
textures within the atlas this is our

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:16.529 
textures within the atlas this is our
atlas<00:06:08.889> here<00:06:09.130> and<00:06:09.370> then<00:06:10.060> we<00:06:14.820> we<00:06:15.820> create<00:06:16.360> a

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:16.539 
atlas here and then we we create a

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:19.939 
atlas here and then we we create a
parent<00:06:17.110> node<00:06:17.320> from<00:06:17.830> that<00:06:18.610> first<00:06:18.909> texture<00:06:19.449> a

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:19.949 
parent node from that first texture a

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:23.459 
parent node from that first texture a
parrot<00:06:20.949> sprite<00:06:21.250> nut<00:06:21.750> and<00:06:22.750> then<00:06:22.870> we<00:06:22.990> set<00:06:23.199> it<00:06:23.229> to

00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:23.469 
parrot sprite nut and then we set it to

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:25.770 
parrot sprite nut and then we set it to
the<00:06:23.590> center<00:06:23.889> of<00:06:23.979> the<00:06:24.130> screen<00:06:24.310> and<00:06:24.610> then<00:06:25.389> we<00:06:25.509> put

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780 
the center of the screen and then we put

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.950 
the center of the screen and then we put
all<00:06:26.020> of<00:06:26.050> our<00:06:26.460> textures<00:06:27.460> in<00:06:27.759> an<00:06:28.240> array<00:06:28.539> we<00:06:28.780> can

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
all of our textures in an array we can

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.189 
all of our textures in an array we can
move<00:06:29.349> this<00:06:29.680> up<00:06:30.210> there<00:06:31.210> so<00:06:31.690> it<00:06:31.810> makes<00:06:31.960> a<00:06:32.110> little

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:32.199 
move this up there so it makes a little

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:37.379 
move this up there so it makes a little
bit<00:06:32.409> more<00:06:32.620> sense<00:06:33.900> then<00:06:35.400> we<00:06:36.400> create<00:06:36.969> a<00:06:37.060> flight

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:37.389 
bit more sense then we create a flight

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:39.360 
bit more sense then we create a flight
action<00:06:37.870> which<00:06:38.050> runs<00:06:38.409> which<00:06:38.830> loops<00:06:39.130> through

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370 
action which runs which loops through

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.959 
action which runs which loops through
the

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:39.969 
the

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:41.999 
the
textures<00:06:40.569> once<00:06:40.899> and<00:06:41.199> then<00:06:41.469> we<00:06:41.589> create<00:06:41.889> a

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:42.009 
textures once and then we create a

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:45.059 
textures once and then we create a
repeat<00:06:42.399> function<00:06:42.899> repeat<00:06:43.899> function<00:06:44.649> to<00:06:44.829> run

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:45.069 
repeat function repeat function to run

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:49.829 
repeat function repeat function to run
that<00:06:47.129> forever<00:06:48.129> and<00:06:48.429> then<00:06:48.999> we<00:06:49.089> run<00:06:49.299> the<00:06:49.449> action

00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:49.839 
that forever and then we run the action

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:53.029 
that forever and then we run the action
and<00:06:49.989> add<00:06:50.169> the<00:06:50.319> child<00:06:51.299> let's<00:06:52.299> give<00:06:52.449> that<00:06:52.689> a<00:06:52.719> go

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 
and add the child let's give that a go

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:57.899 
and add the child let's give that a go
submit<00:06:54.039> looks<00:06:54.309> like<00:06:55.979> hey<00:06:56.979> we<00:06:57.369> got<00:06:57.489> a<00:06:57.519> parrot

00:06:57.899 --> 00:06:57.909 
submit looks like hey we got a parrot

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:00.659 
submit looks like hey we got a parrot
flapping<00:06:58.439> and<00:06:59.439> you<00:06:59.769> can<00:06:59.919> mess<00:07:00.099> with<00:07:00.279> the<00:07:00.399> speed

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:00.669 
flapping and you can mess with the speed

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:08.189 
flapping and you can mess with the speed
if<00:07:00.849> you<00:07:00.939> want<00:07:01.349> slow<00:07:02.349> a<00:07:02.529> little<00:07:02.829> bit<00:07:06.269> alright<00:07:07.269> so

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:08.199 
if you want slow a little bit alright so

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:09.479 
if you want slow a little bit alright so

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:09.489 
that's how you make an animation and

00:07:09.489 --> 00:07:12.809 
that's how you make an animation and
sprite<00:07:09.789> node<00:07:10.059> pretty<00:07:10.749> simple<00:07:10.929> just<00:07:11.459> a<00:07:12.459> lot<00:07:12.669> of

00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:12.819 
sprite node pretty simple just a lot of

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:18.509 
sprite node pretty simple just a lot of
text<00:07:13.779> and<00:07:15.899> yeah<00:07:16.899> I<00:07:17.169> if<00:07:17.649> you<00:07:17.799> ever<00:07:17.949> forget<00:07:18.459> it
