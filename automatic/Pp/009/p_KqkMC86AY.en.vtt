00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
in fifa 12 as well but i thought to be

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.939 
in fifa 12 as well but i thought to be
too<00:00:20.609> much<00:00:20.820> in<00:00:21.090> one<00:00:21.119> video<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.350> basically<00:00:22.769> in

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
too much in one video so basically in

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.890 
too much in one video so basically in
these<00:00:23.160> in<00:00:23.400> my<00:00:23.609> opinion<00:00:23.910> these<00:00:24.420> are<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.660> best

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
these in my opinion these are the best

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.900 
these in my opinion these are the best
home<00:00:25.140> kits<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.529> 3<00:00:25.650> 4<00:00:25.830> 12<00:00:26.039> if<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.369> agree<00:00:26.730> with

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
home kits and 3 4 12 if you agree with

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.700 
home kits and 3 4 12 if you agree with
them<00:00:27.060> which<00:00:27.390> show<00:00:27.779> me<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:27.990> may<00:00:28.140> or<00:00:28.380> may<00:00:28.680> not

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
them which show me you may or may not

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.080 
them which show me you may or may not
but<00:00:29.039> i<00:00:29.130> think<00:00:29.340> they're<00:00:29.460> good<00:00:29.609> i<00:00:29.760> think<00:00:29.789> it's<00:00:30.029> a

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
but i think they're good i think it's a

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.999 
but i think they're good i think it's a
variety<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:30.539> all<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.199> i<00:00:31.500> think<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.890> best

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
variety of all and i think that the best

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.799 
variety of all and i think that the best
ones<00:00:32.279> he<00:00:32.550> use<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:32.969> my<00:00:33.090> opinion<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.570> i<00:00:33.600> run

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809
