of<00:05:36.289> articulation<00:05:36.919> and<00:05:37.430> what<00:05:37.580> I<00:05:37.610> like<00:05:37.819> about<00:05:37.849> it

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
of articulation and what I like about it

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.700 
of articulation and what I like about it
is<00:05:38.479> that<00:05:38.509> you<00:05:38.780> can<00:05:38.930> stand<00:05:39.169> this<00:05:39.380> one<00:05:39.530> up

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
is that you can stand this one up

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.589 
is that you can stand this one up
without<00:05:40.159> worrying<00:05:40.639> whether<00:05:40.969> he's<00:05:41.180> gonna<00:05:41.330> tip

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:41.599 
without worrying whether he's gonna tip

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:44.980 
without worrying whether he's gonna tip
over<00:05:41.949> then<00:05:42.949> unlike<00:05:43.580> the<00:05:43.880> Clone<00:05:44.360> Wars<00:05:44.389> version

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
over then unlike the Clone Wars version

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.980 
over then unlike the Clone Wars version
that<00:05:45.110> has<00:05:45.229> a<00:05:45.259> really<00:05:45.710> soft<00:05:46.099> legs<00:05:46.460> its<00:05:46.810> legs<00:05:47.810> and

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
that has a really soft legs its legs and

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.159 
that has a really soft legs its legs and
this<00:05:48.110> one<00:05:48.349> are<00:05:49.279> ok<00:05:49.699> and<00:05:50.449> you<00:05:50.599> can<00:05:50.630> peg<00:05:50.930> them

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
this one are ok and you can peg them

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:55.510 
this one are ok and you can peg them
onto<00:05:51.770> a<00:05:52.580> base<00:05:52.880> if<00:05:53.090> you<00:05:53.120> have<00:05:53.360> one<00:05:54.159> but<00:05:55.159> I<00:05:55.219> think

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
onto a base if you have one but I think

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.159 
onto a base if you have one but I think
this<00:05:55.849> one<00:05:56.029> will<00:05:56.180> stand<00:05:56.479> a<00:05:56.659> little<00:05:56.779> bit<00:05:56.930> better

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169 
this one will stand a little bit better

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:03.209 
this one will stand a little bit better
compared<00:05:57.979> to<00:05:58.039> the<00:05:58.190> Clone<00:05:58.460> Wars<00:05:59.110> version<00:06:01.150> so

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:03.219 
compared to the Clone Wars version so

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:08.170 
compared to the Clone Wars version so
just<00:06:05.289> give<00:06:06.289> him<00:06:06.319> his<00:06:06.529> accessories<00:06:07.190> so<00:06:07.849> a<00:06:07.880> very

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
just give him his accessories so a very

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.820 
just give him his accessories so a very
cool<00:06:08.389> set<00:06:08.750> if<00:06:08.990> you're<00:06:09.229> interested<00:06:09.590> in<00:06:09.710> this

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
cool set if you're interested in this

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.990 
cool set if you're interested in this
one<00:06:10.039> it's<00:06:10.310> worth<00:06:10.490> tracking<00:06:10.849> down<00:06:11.949> I<00:06:13.000> wouldn't

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
one it's worth tracking down I wouldn't

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.360 
one it's worth tracking down I wouldn't
you<00:06:14.719> know<00:06:14.779> twenty-five<00:06:15.380> dollars<00:06:15.830> is<00:06:16.039> probably

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
you know twenty-five dollars is probably

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.659 
you know twenty-five dollars is probably
the<00:06:16.520> limit<00:06:16.669> I'd<00:06:17.210> say<00:06:17.449> for<00:06:17.659> this<00:06:17.810> set<00:06:18.520> if<00:06:19.520> you

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:19.669 
the limit I'd say for this set if you

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:22.089 
the limit I'd say for this set if you
can<00:06:19.819> get<00:06:20.029> it<00:06:20.210> something<00:06:20.659> lower<00:06:20.960> like<00:06:21.139> $12<00:06:21.889> or

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:22.099 
can get it something lower like $12 or

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:25.450 
can get it something lower like $12 or
$15<00:06:22.849> that's<00:06:23.090> probably<00:06:23.539> a<00:06:23.630> better<00:06:23.870> price<00:06:24.460> it's

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
$15 that's probably a better price it's

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.760 
$15 that's probably a better price it's
a<00:06:25.490> great<00:06:25.699> set<00:06:25.909> for<00:06:25.940> collectors<00:06:26.500> but<00:06:27.500> if<00:06:27.650> you're

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
a great set for collectors but if you're

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.080 
a great set for collectors but if you're
the<00:06:27.830> casual<00:06:28.630> Star<00:06:29.630> Wars<00:06:29.930> fan<00:06:30.289> collector<00:06:31.090> not
