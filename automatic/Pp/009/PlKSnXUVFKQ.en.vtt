is what I got so far I'm just drawing
design<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.830> there<00:01:23.070> with<00:01:23.250> an<00:01:23.340> expo<00:01:23.729> marker

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
design on there with an expo marker

design on there with an expo marker
works<00:01:24.960> pretty<00:01:25.170> nice<00:01:25.439> because<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.100> just

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
works pretty nice because this is just

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.880 
works pretty nice because this is just
like<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.549> dry<00:01:26.850> erase<00:01:27.030> board<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.659> can<00:01:27.780> just<00:01:27.960> wipe

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
bit and then I got to get a scalpel as

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.910 
bit and then I got to get a scalpel as
you<00:03:35.580> can<00:03:35.670> see<00:03:35.910> just<00:03:36.450> goes<00:03:37.290> right<00:03:37.500> in<00:03:37.680> those

holes<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:38.720> was<00:03:39.720> going<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.200> do<00:03:40.940> these<00:03:41.940> screws<00:03:42.480> the

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
holes I was going to do these screws the

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.360 
holes I was going to do these screws the
front<00:03:42.989> screws<00:03:43.459> but<00:03:45.709> these<00:03:46.709> ones<00:03:46.950> I<00:03:47.070> think<00:03:47.250> will

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
front screws but these ones I think will

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.009 
front screws but these ones I think will
work<00:03:47.459> better<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:47.970> they're<00:03:48.269> easier<00:03:48.570> to<00:03:48.630> get<00:03:48.810> to

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
work better and they're easier to get to
