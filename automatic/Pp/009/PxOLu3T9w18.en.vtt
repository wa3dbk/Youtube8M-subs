00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:07.020
 day here in his the tev pro and 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.290
 Welcome to a new guide 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.620
 monster and it is an extreme mine 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.500
 God 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.160
 okay let's go Let's have minerva 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.000
 sorry of saint so sorry of saints 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.710
 or so saint I do not know 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.869
 yes, that was closer to me that was the level 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.789
 3 close monsters that of course everyone 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:33.600
 I know my hello light 2 ranked four 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:41.870
 needs 24 monsters so probably phillies 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.870
 graze janka roth has th at the end 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:50.460
 would go the two bands would 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.129
 so go the light and the dark 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.620
 would refuse level 4 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.690
 monster no matter what that is, the xs is 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.379
 generic but fossil best 32 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.860
 For this reason, you can do it 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.260
 can be hanging out with ralph lenkert 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.540
 or sex has the cemetery so perfect 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.610
 and whoever does that pulls a card 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.220
 for every monster or for each of 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.400
 card that was sent by this 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.450
 and that means that's this check 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.520
 check your effect for each one 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.130
 map that's your effect 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.689
 draw on resistance card is likely 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.220
 she reads monster and closes 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:36.930
 also possible train tickets with one 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.610
 that means sanctuary or just others 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.650
 lights from cards line barrier gives 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.350
 it, too, I think and that's 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.090
 pretty cool so first milling &amp; 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.869
 Of course, drop power is really cool 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.710
 is really cool what was that? 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.759
 and now the second effect 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.189
 These can be through or fight 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.560
 is destroyed cards or war-destroyed 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.610
 the opponent then you can again the 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.380
 it is also possible at the cemetery 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.750
 stick 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.159
 And if she does that you can do man on 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.619
 Select field and destroy 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.729
 are you the number of the light of cards 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.069
 you by this effect on the 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.270
 So, say, we have sent it 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.940
 I can destroy the card effect again 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.000
 by 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.760
 the opponent and then comes to the cemetery 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.610
 you can report three cards and say 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.050
 we include two , for example 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.470
 cards could be cards on the field two 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.230
 choose and destroy her and her 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.810
 You can only use each fact once 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.180
 So this xs is really really good 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.880
 if you can if you can say that 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.760
 So it's really good as well as light 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.980
 Frankly, too, goes and extra milling 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.990
 So she can be like a little one 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.980
 So dante not small but somehow 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:51.040
 So she can do it herself 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.930
 make up to nine cards and that 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.100
 is really cool that's really 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.770
 really cool and even if you 're looking for 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.450
 For example, now if you 're sorry about the game 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.880
 to play and plays both from 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.240
 filiz and maine face actually the 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.010
 complaints and effects with felice 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.280
 or wulff from then four environment 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.660
 then you could either go in and out 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.210
 Wulf, the other eight synchro 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.150
 do or you do with wulff and 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:19.920
 filiz or and and riding and so was theirs 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.540
 then make her a fix and now 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.150
 with minerva you can easily do that 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.220
 me once that is correct but cool thing 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.890
 it's really too bad I read 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:34.120
 on the wiki here so this card 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:37.870
 comes out in shear for berlins but 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.570
 it is an ucg exclusive again 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:44.890
 So cg gets everything cool and we 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.970
 get burning bit and right 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.700
 really cool 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.440
 Well, but still it will be on the 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.030
 problem it will be on july network 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.550
 So you can give it anyway 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.840
 play online or when i am with 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.970
 friends, you can not know boxing 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.160
 as you want, that's right 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.340
 really good and your opinion in the 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.100
 Comments are really nice 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.110
 arminia was really cool really cool 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.060
 the former gc over his friends 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:15.480
 all sorts of comments and or awo look forward 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.480
 I'm just huge huge 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:22.450
 rsg itself 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.450
