getting into your case I'm ruining your
crank<00:00:36.660> see<00:00:37.660> those<00:00:37.840> scores<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:39.309> kills<00:00:39.640> the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
crank see those scores that kills the

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.380 
crank see those scores that kills the
seal<00:00:40.290> between<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.640> crank<00:00:42.969> and<00:00:43.450> the<00:00:44.190> case

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
seal between the crank and the case

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.200 
seal between the crank and the case
which<00:00:46.390> will<00:00:46.510> cause<00:00:46.719> an<00:00:46.870> air<00:00:46.989> leak<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.969> give

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
which will cause an air leak and give

which will cause an air leak and give
you<00:00:49.270> trouble<00:00:49.510> tuning<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.840> today<00:00:53.110> we're<00:00:53.379> going

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469 
you trouble tuning so today we're going

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:56.310 
you trouble tuning so today we're going
to<00:00:53.559> put<00:00:53.710> some<00:00:53.860> of<00:00:53.949> these<00:00:54.010> caps<00:00:54.309> on<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.750> lrp

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
to put some of these caps on the lrp

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.910 
to put some of these caps on the lrp
three<00:00:56.680> -<00:00:56.949> it's<00:00:57.579> already<00:00:57.879> sealed<00:00:58.180> up<00:00:58.739> broken<00:00:59.739> in

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
three - it's already sealed up broken in

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:24.409 
accelerator this dries very fast so you

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:35.089 
accelerator this dries very fast so you
have<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:24.739> be<00:02:24.859> quick<00:02:25.159> you<00:02:26.469> apply

remember that if you're doing this to an

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.449 
remember that if you're doing this to an
older<00:03:09.540> engine<00:03:10.069> you're<00:03:11.069> gonna<00:03:11.220> want<00:03:11.430> to

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
older engine you're gonna want to

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.880 
older engine you're gonna want to
definitely<00:03:11.819> make<00:03:12.090> sure<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.450> clean<00:03:12.720> the

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
definitely make sure you clean the

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.070 
definitely make sure you clean the
bearing<00:03:13.890> inside<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:14.670> out<00:03:14.790> before<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:15.840> seal

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
bearing inside and out before you seal

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.630 
bearing inside and out before you seal
this<00:03:16.319> because<00:03:16.530> you<00:03:16.620> don't<00:03:16.830> want<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.190> seal<00:03:17.400> any

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
this because you don't want to seal any

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.470 
this because you don't want to seal any
contaminants<00:03:18.569> inside<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.650> motor<00:03:22.069> okay
