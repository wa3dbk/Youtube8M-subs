00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020

that<00:03:55.400> over<00:03:55.670> I<00:03:55.700> don't<00:03:55.819> want<00:03:56.090> to<00:03:56.180> reuse<00:03:56.569> any<00:03:56.810> of

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
that over I don't want to reuse any of

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:03.280 
that over I don't want to reuse any of
the<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:59.120> old<00:03:59.330> moss<00:04:01.750> so<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:02.900> mix<00:04:03.110> we're<00:04:03.230> gonna

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
the the old moss so the mix we're gonna

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.960 
the the old moss so the mix we're gonna
provide<00:04:03.709> is<00:04:03.890> going<00:04:04.040> to<00:04:04.099> be<00:04:04.190> much<00:04:04.370> area<00:04:04.730> and

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
provide is going to be much area and

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.149 
provide is going to be much area and
lighter<00:04:05.150> for<00:04:05.540> it<00:04:05.659> let<00:04:06.560> the<00:04:06.680> roots<00:04:06.860> breathe<00:04:07.129> a

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159 
lighter for it let the roots breathe a

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:09.759 
lighter for it let the roots breathe a
little<00:04:07.340> better<00:04:07.610> I<00:04:08.049> see<00:04:09.049> a<00:04:09.080> couple<00:04:09.319> little

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
little better I see a couple little

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.550 
little better I see a couple little
little<00:04:10.430> dead<00:04:10.610> roots<00:04:10.849> on<00:04:11.060> there<00:04:11.349> dead<00:04:12.349> roots

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
little dead roots on there dead roots

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.539 
little dead roots on there dead roots
are<00:04:12.739> worth<00:04:12.860> trimming<00:04:13.280> off<00:04:15.130> you<00:04:16.130> don't<00:04:16.310> have<00:04:16.430> to

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
are worth trimming off you don't have to

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.460 
are worth trimming off you don't have to
be<00:04:16.669> too<00:04:16.940> fanatical<00:04:17.660> about<00:04:17.840> getting<00:04:18.139> every

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
be too fanatical about getting every

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.140 
be too fanatical about getting every
little<00:04:18.709> bit<00:04:18.799> of<00:04:18.859> media<00:04:19.130> off<00:04:19.430> sometimes<00:04:19.970> it

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
little bit of media off sometimes it

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.159 
little bit of media off sometimes it
dumb<00:04:20.299> does<00:04:21.229> more<00:04:21.470> harm<00:04:21.500> to<00:04:22.190> try<00:04:23.090> to<00:04:23.150> remove<00:04:23.900> all

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
dumb does more harm to try to remove all

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.810 
dumb does more harm to try to remove all
the<00:04:24.410> media<00:04:24.680> because<00:04:25.070> the<00:04:25.310> roots<00:04:25.580> are<00:04:25.729> actually

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
the media because the roots are actually

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.360 
the media because the roots are actually
stuck<00:04:26.210> to<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.449> media<00:04:26.720> as<00:04:26.810> well<00:04:26.990> that<00:04:27.919> did<00:04:28.160> root

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
stuck to the media as well that did root

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.939 
stuck to the media as well that did root
there<00:04:28.840> now<00:04:29.840> you<00:04:29.900> can<00:04:30.020> tell<00:04:30.169> if<00:04:30.320> a<00:04:30.380> root<00:04:30.560> is<00:04:30.680> dead

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
there now you can tell if a root is dead

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:32.920 
there now you can tell if a root is dead
or<00:04:31.100> not<00:04:31.220> because<00:04:31.639> it's<00:04:31.820> gonna<00:04:31.910> feel<00:04:32.240> paper<00:04:32.660> U

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
or not because it's gonna feel paper U

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.290 
or not because it's gonna feel paper U
and<00:04:33.110> dry<00:04:33.380> like<00:04:34.310> this<00:04:34.520> end<00:04:34.699> here<00:04:34.970> you<00:04:35.150> knows

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
and dry like this end here you knows

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.750 
and dry like this end here you knows
here<00:04:35.720> it<00:04:35.840> is<00:04:35.990> it<00:04:36.169> it<00:04:36.710> sounds<00:04:37.190> like<00:04:37.280> paper<00:04:37.550> as

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
here it is it it sounds like paper as

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.730 
here it is it it sounds like paper as
well<00:04:37.940> so<00:04:38.840> I'll<00:04:38.900> just<00:04:39.020> cut<00:04:39.199> that<00:04:39.350> off<00:04:39.410> as<00:04:39.830> well

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
well so I'll just cut that off as well

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.950 
well so I'll just cut that off as well
and<00:04:42.740> you<00:04:43.520> can<00:04:43.699> clearly<00:04:44.180> see<00:04:44.300> the<00:04:44.570> kikiyaon

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
and you can clearly see the kikiyaon

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.279 
and you can clearly see the kikiyaon
here<00:04:45.350> now<00:04:46.300> you<00:04:47.300> focus<00:04:47.570> on<00:04:47.870> that<00:04:48.020> a<00:04:48.050> little

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 
here now you focus on that a little

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:50.290 
here now you focus on that a little
better<00:04:48.430> so<00:04:49.430> there's<00:04:49.669> a<00:04:49.729> key<00:04:49.880> key<00:04:50.060> we're<00:04:50.180> gonna

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
better so there's a key key we're gonna

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.330 
better so there's a key key we're gonna
leave<00:04:50.510> that<00:04:50.539> I<00:04:51.020> think<00:04:51.680> it<00:04:51.770> could<00:04:51.949> pop<00:04:52.160> off

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
leave that I think it could pop off

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.020 
leave that I think it could pop off
pretty<00:04:52.580> easily

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
pretty easily

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.689 
pretty easily
it<00:04:53.330> has<00:04:53.479> a<00:04:53.510> good<00:04:53.720> long<00:04:53.930> root<00:04:54.169> on<00:04:54.350> it<00:04:54.530> but<00:04:54.770> we'll

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
it has a good long root on it but we'll

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.860 
it has a good long root on it but we'll
leave<00:04:55.910> it<00:04:56.919> now<00:04:57.919> I<00:04:57.950> like<00:04:58.340> to<00:04:58.460> try<00:04:58.729> just<00:04:59.630> to<00:04:59.750> make

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
leave it now I like to try just to make

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.629 
leave it now I like to try just to make
sure<00:04:59.900> it's<00:05:00.139> going<00:05:00.229> to<00:05:00.289> fit<00:05:00.380> I'm<00:05:01.250> going<00:05:01.550> to

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 
sure it's going to fit I'm going to

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:03.870 
sure it's going to fit I'm going to
leave<00:05:01.760> the<00:05:01.910> air<00:05:02.030> roots<00:05:02.389> out<00:05:02.599> in<00:05:02.810> the<00:05:02.900> air<00:05:03.050> and

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
leave the air roots out in the air and

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.610 
leave the air roots out in the air and
put<00:05:04.880> the<00:05:05.120> roots<00:05:05.510> that<00:05:05.660> are<00:05:05.750> used<00:05:05.900> to<00:05:06.050> media<00:05:06.349> in

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
put the roots that are used to media in

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.400 
put the roots that are used to media in
the<00:05:06.770> media<00:05:07.240> sometimes<00:05:08.240> if<00:05:08.389> you<00:05:08.479> put<00:05:08.510> in<00:05:08.930> air

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
the media sometimes if you put in air

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.550 
the media sometimes if you put in air
root<00:05:09.849> into<00:05:10.849> media<00:05:11.150> being<00:05:12.139> it's<00:05:12.289> used<00:05:12.470> to

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
root into media being it's used to

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.290 
root into media being it's used to
growing<00:05:12.770> in<00:05:12.919> the<00:05:13.010> air<00:05:13.190> it's<00:05:13.430> actually<00:05:13.760> I'm<00:05:13.970> not

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
growing in the air it's actually I'm not

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.330 
growing in the air it's actually I'm not
gonna<00:05:14.479> do<00:05:14.720> as<00:05:14.870> well<00:05:15.020> in<00:05:15.229> the<00:05:15.320> media<00:05:15.620> and<00:05:16.160> it

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
gonna do as well in the media and it

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.240 
gonna do as well in the media and it
could<00:05:16.490> die<00:05:16.669> so<00:05:17.470> there's<00:05:18.470> enough<00:05:18.710> roots<00:05:19.010> that

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
could die so there's enough roots that

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.150 
could die so there's enough roots that
are<00:05:19.400> that<00:05:19.940> we're<00:05:20.150> in<00:05:20.270> the<00:05:20.389> old<00:05:20.570> pot<00:05:20.860> that<00:05:21.860> I<00:05:21.889> can

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
are that we're in the old pot that I can

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.560 
are that we're in the old pot that I can
just<00:05:22.340> keep<00:05:22.520> those<00:05:22.760> ones<00:05:23.710> those<00:05:24.710> ones<00:05:24.740> in<00:05:25.190> and

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
just keep those ones those ones in and

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:38.940 
just keep those ones those ones in and
leave<00:05:26.570> the<00:05:26.690> other<00:05:26.810> two<00:05:27.020> out

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.760 

there<00:05:39.950> we<00:05:40.130> go<00:05:40.630> give<00:05:41.630> it<00:05:41.660> a<00:05:41.810> bit<00:05:41.990> of<00:05:42.080> a<00:05:42.170> pack<00:05:42.440> down

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
there we go give it a bit of a pack down

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.410 
there we go give it a bit of a pack down
just<00:05:43.520> to<00:05:43.640> make<00:05:43.670> sure<00:05:43.790> it's<00:05:44.000> not<00:05:44.120> gonna<00:05:44.240> go

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:44.420 
just to make sure it's not gonna go

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.890 
just to make sure it's not gonna go
anywhere<00:05:44.690> and<00:05:45.350> then<00:05:46.390> give<00:05:47.390> it<00:05:47.420> a<00:05:47.540> good<00:05:47.690> water

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
anywhere and then give it a good water

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.960 
anywhere and then give it a good water
and<00:05:48.200> should<00:05:49.190> be<00:05:49.310> good<00:05:49.460> to<00:05:49.550> go<00:05:51.640> and<00:05:52.640> that<00:05:52.700> is<00:05:52.850> a

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
and should be good to go and that is a

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.050 
and should be good to go and that is a
quick<00:05:53.210> way<00:05:53.360> to<00:05:53.390> UM<00:05:54.310> transplant<00:05:55.310> and<00:05:55.640> repot<00:05:56.030> a
