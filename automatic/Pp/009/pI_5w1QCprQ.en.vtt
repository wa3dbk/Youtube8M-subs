00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
than the mountain core of the earth when

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.609 
than the mountain core of the earth when
the<00:00:26.670> game<00:00:26.820> kicked<00:00:27.090> off<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.439> was

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
the game kicked off and and I was

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:29.929 
the game kicked off and and I was
literally<00:00:28.920> maybe<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.460> was<00:00:29.550> just<00:00:29.580> cuz<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:29.849> was

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
literally maybe it was just cuz I was

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.099 
literally maybe it was just cuz I was
starving<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.420> was<00:00:30.510> waiting<00:00:30.750> for<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.960> but<00:00:31.080> I

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
starving I was waiting for the but I

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.990 
starving I was waiting for the but I
really<00:00:31.380> felt<00:00:31.529> like<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:31.800> after<00:00:32.130> act<00:00:32.309> until<00:00:32.969> I

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
really felt like that after act until I

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.150 
really felt like that after act until I
get<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.420> eat<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:34.350> be<00:00:34.469> fair<00:00:34.620> though<00:00:34.829> it

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
get to eat it and to be fair though it

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.470 
get to eat it and to be fair though it
was<00:00:35.280> probably<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.640> performance<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.149> we<00:00:36.239> put

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
was probably the performance that we put

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.740 
was probably the performance that we put
in<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:37.370> it<00:00:38.370> was<00:00:38.550> just<00:00:38.579> very<00:00:39.030> very<00:00:39.180> average

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
in and it was just very very average

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.690 
in and it was just very very average
very<00:00:40.170> very<00:00:40.440> average<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.980> fair<00:00:41.160> stuff<00:00:41.430> but

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
very very average in the fair stuff but

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.069 
very very average in the fair stuff but
I'm<00:00:41.790> pleased<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.090> say<00:00:42.210> we<00:00:42.360> did<00:00:42.540> out<00:00:42.690> for<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.870> few

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
I'm pleased to say we did out for a few

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.420 
I'm pleased to say we did out for a few
moments<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.500> excitements<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.129> second

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
moments of excitements in the second

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.190 
moments of excitements in the second
then<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.789> know<00:00:44.879> although<00:00:45.450> it's<00:00:45.750> ultimately

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
then you know although it's ultimately

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.959 
then you know although it's ultimately
the<00:00:46.320> tale<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.770> season<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.219> isolation

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
the tale this season in isolation

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.639 
the tale this season in isolation
let's<00:00:48.239> look<00:00:48.360> I'm<00:00:48.510> at<00:00:48.660> that's<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.930> best<00:00:49.140> way<00:00:49.289> I

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
let's look I'm at that's the best way I

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.100 
let's look I'm at that's the best way I
think<00:00:49.800> for<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:49.980> moment<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.550> we<00:00:51.180> had<00:00:51.300> far<00:00:51.629> and

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
think for the moment is we had far and

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.560 
think for the moment is we had far and
away<00:00:52.710> enough<00:00:53.219> chances<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.789> absolutely<00:00:54.329> put

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
away enough chances to absolutely put

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.569 
away enough chances to absolutely put
back<00:00:54.719> into<00:00:55.079> bed<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.440> smash<00:00:56.010> them<00:00:56.190> off<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> pot

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
back into bed and smash them off the pot

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.580 
back into bed and smash them off the pot
and<00:00:56.760> we<00:00:56.850> didn't<00:00:57.059> take<00:00:57.180> them<00:00:57.360> Adam<00:00:57.870> Lallana<00:00:58.020> got

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
and we didn't take them Adam Lallana got

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.290 
and we didn't take them Adam Lallana got
a<00:00:58.620> chance<00:00:58.859> one<00:00:59.039> on<00:00:59.160> one<00:00:59.280> with<00:00:59.399> Rob<00:00:59.550> Kadeem<00:00:59.850> all

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
a chance one on one with Rob Kadeem all
