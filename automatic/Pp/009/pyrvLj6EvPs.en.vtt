here are we have a couple of training
tires<00:00:27.330> well<00:00:27.990> we<00:00:28.470> could<00:00:28.619> say<00:00:28.710> training<00:00:29.010> tires

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
tires well we could say training tires

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.830 
tires well we could say training tires
but<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.429> Continental<00:00:30.210> Supersports<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.720> don't

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
but the Continental Supersports I don't

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.450 
but the Continental Supersports I don't
really<00:00:30.990> market<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.560> as<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> training<00:00:32.009> tire<00:00:32.309> they

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
really market it as a training tire they

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.700 
really market it as a training tire they
mark<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.759> as<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.940> city<00:00:33.270> tire<00:00:33.510> but<00:00:33.989> frankly<00:00:34.410> you

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
mark it as a city tire but frankly you

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.200 
mark it as a city tire but frankly you
could<00:00:34.829> use<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.160> as<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.309> training<00:00:35.790> tire<00:00:36.059> because

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
could use it as a training tire because

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.880 
could use it as a training tire because
it<00:00:36.420> has<00:00:36.540> full<00:00:36.870> puncture<00:00:37.320> protection<00:00:37.440> it's

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
it has full puncture protection it's

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.260 
it has full puncture protection it's
great<00:00:38.070> for<00:00:38.190> city<00:00:38.399> riding<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:39.000> won't<00:00:39.180> get

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
great for city riding you won't get

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.600 
great for city riding you won't get
flats<00:00:39.510> but<00:00:39.780> if<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.170> train<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.469> lot<00:00:40.739> then<00:00:41.219> you

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
flats but if you train a lot then you

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.100 
flats but if you train a lot then you
might<00:00:41.910> get<00:00:42.090> flats<00:00:42.390> in<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.600> winter<00:00:42.870> with<00:00:42.989> lots

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.240 
might get flats in the winter with lots
of<00:00:43.230> glass<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.800> road

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250

it's<00:01:06.119> got<00:01:06.360> 150<00:01:07.290> TPI<00:01:07.650> thread<00:01:07.799> bridge<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:08.790> a

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
it's got 150 TPI thread bridge so it's a

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.910 
it's got 150 TPI thread bridge so it's a
bit<00:01:08.909> more<00:01:09.090> supple<00:01:09.450> than<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.560> continental

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
bit more supple than the continental

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.880

which<00:01:11.460> has<00:01:11.610> only<00:01:11.760> 84<00:01:12.420> but<00:01:13.049> when<00:01:13.710> you're

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
which has only 84 but when you're

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.679 
which has only 84 but when you're
worried<00:01:14.340> about<00:01:14.430> miles<00:01:15.119> you're<00:01:15.420> worried<00:01:15.659> about

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
worried about miles you're worried about

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.060 
worried about miles you're worried about
traction<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.470> wet<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.830> worried<00:01:16.979> about

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
traction in the wet and worried about

traction in the wet and worried about
flat<00:01:17.340> protection<00:01:17.850> then<00:01:18.299> these<00:01:18.960> things<00:01:19.320> are

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
flat protection then these things are

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.010 
flat protection then these things are
less<00:01:19.979> important<00:01:20.520> anyway<00:01:20.790> if<00:01:21.180> you're<00:01:21.570> looking
