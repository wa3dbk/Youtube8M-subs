you how to turn a lever into a button

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.359 
you how to turn a lever into a button
BAM<00:00:18.380> alright<00:00:19.380> this<00:00:19.590> whole<00:00:19.859> thing<00:00:20.130> actually

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
came from a subscriber of mine I guess

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.900 
came from a subscriber of mine I guess
paying<00:00:22.590> attention<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.220> what<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.400> say<00:00:23.730> on<00:00:23.760> the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
paying attention to what I say on the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.540 
paying attention to what I say on the
videos<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.680> bringing<00:00:25.680> up<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:25.980> my<00:00:26.160> day<00:00:26.220> night

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
videos and bringing up that my day night

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.370 
videos and bringing up that my day night
sensor<00:00:26.970> can<00:00:27.119> be<00:00:27.150> plugged<00:00:27.480> into<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:28.289> know

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
sensor can be plugged into you know

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.189 
sensor can be plugged into you know
blocks<00:00:28.740> whopper<00:00:29.189> for<00:00:29.400> example<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.199> can

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
blocks whopper for example and you can

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.950 
blocks whopper for example and you can
have<00:00:31.349> like<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> floor<00:00:31.859> lighting<00:00:32.130> system<00:00:32.960> then

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
have like a floor lighting system then

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.299 
have like a floor lighting system then
he<00:00:34.050> asked<00:00:34.290> me<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.710> know<00:00:34.739> actually<00:00:34.980> do<00:00:35.280> a

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
he asked me to you know actually do a

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.729 
he asked me to you know actually do a
video<00:00:35.550> on<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.910> which<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.300> will<00:00:36.630> but<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.380> actually

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
video on it which I will but it actually

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.709 
video on it which I will but it actually
brought<00:00:38.129> up<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.430> fact<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.300> don't<00:00:39.480> know<00:00:39.540> why

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
brought up the fact and I don't know why

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.900 
brought up the fact and I don't know why
I<00:00:39.750> kind<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.020> spaced<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.469> out<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.790> know

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
I kind of spaced it out that you know

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.610 
I kind of spaced it out that you know
what<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.300> doing<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.809> sending<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.379> straight

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
what this is doing is sending a straight

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.650 
what this is doing is sending a straight
signal<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.340> blog<00:00:44.550> swapper<00:00:45.000> needs<00:00:45.210> like<00:00:45.510> an

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
signal in a blog swapper needs like an

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.100 
signal in a blog swapper needs like an
on-off<00:00:45.989> signal<00:00:47.210> so<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.239> kind<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.660> set<00:00:48.809> out<00:00:48.930> to

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
on-off signal so I kind of set out to

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.470 
on-off signal so I kind of set out to
make<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:50.010> know<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:51.079> lever<00:00:52.079> into<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.500> button<00:00:52.890> and

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
make you know a lever into a button and

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.540 
make you know a lever into a button and
I<00:00:54.480> was<00:00:54.870> making<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.289> monostable<00:00:55.620> circuit<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.460> I

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
I was making a monostable circuit and I

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.010 
I was making a monostable circuit and I
think<00:00:56.789> at<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.030> end<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> day<00:00:57.480> that's<00:00:57.629> kind

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
think at the end of the day that's kind

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.549 
think at the end of the day that's kind
of<00:00:58.140> what<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.500> comes<00:00:58.739> out<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.460> not<00:00:59.910> really

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
of what it comes out to it not really

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.460 
of what it comes out to it not really
but<00:01:01.910> once<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.030> slowed<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.480> down<00:01:03.510> i<00:01:03.690> was<00:01:03.989> able<00:01:04.170> to

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
but once I slowed it down i was able to

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.490 
but once I slowed it down i was able to
get<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.799> do<00:01:05.070> what<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.280> wanted<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.850> do<00:01:06.500> so

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
get it to do what I wanted it to do so

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.200 
get it to do what I wanted it to do so
basically<00:01:07.950> i<00:01:08.100> will<00:01:08.400> show<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.670> guys<00:01:08.790> how<00:01:08.939> to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
basically i will show you guys how to

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.320 
basically i will show you guys how to
make<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.750> lever<00:01:10.080> or<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> straight<00:01:10.830> line<00:01:11.299> into<00:01:12.299> a

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
make a lever or a straight line into a

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.350 
make a lever or a straight line into a
button<00:01:12.990> type<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.380> pulse<00:01:13.680> alright<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:15.240> will

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
button type of pulse alright that will

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.600 
button type of pulse alright that will
eventually<00:01:15.650> once<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.799> catches<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.189> fact<00:01:17.520> that

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
eventually once it catches the fact that

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.649 
eventually once it catches the fact that
it's<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.090> know<00:01:18.119> nighttime<00:01:20.299> you<00:01:21.299> know<00:01:21.420> it'll

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
it's you know nighttime you know it'll

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.200 
it's you know nighttime you know it'll
go<00:01:21.810> ahead<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.110> swap<00:01:22.920> out<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.280> block<00:01:23.490> but<00:01:24.090> this

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
go ahead and swap out the block but this

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.300 
go ahead and swap out the block but this
is<00:01:24.330> what<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.600> do<00:01:24.750> i<00:01:24.890> basically<00:01:25.890> just<00:01:26.009> put<00:01:26.280> a

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
is what you do i basically just put a

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.289 
is what you do i basically just put a
block<00:01:26.549> down<00:01:27.170> let<00:01:28.170> me<00:01:28.259> get<00:01:28.439> my<00:01:28.470> sticky<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.369> was

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
block down let me get my sticky I was

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.420 
block down let me get my sticky I was
actually<00:01:30.450> uh<00:01:30.659> rushing<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.710> get<00:01:31.829> this<00:01:32.040> i<00:01:32.280> don't

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
actually uh rushing to get this i don't

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.130 
actually uh rushing to get this i don't
want<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.640> night<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.820> kind<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.299> beat<00:01:33.630> me<00:01:33.810> out<00:01:33.990> of

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
want the night to kind of beat me out of

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.710 
want the night to kind of beat me out of
this<00:01:34.400> alright<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:35.610> what<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.240> would<00:01:36.360> do<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.689> you

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
this alright so what you would do is you

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.830 
this alright so what you would do is you
would<00:01:36.840> put<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.259> repeater<00:01:38.159> here<00:01:38.310> on<00:01:39.210> line<00:01:39.509> here

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
would put a repeater here on line here

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.289 
would put a repeater here on line here
and<00:01:41.270> that's<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.570> pretty<00:01:42.750> much<00:01:43.909> but<00:01:44.909> again<00:01:45.119> what

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
and that's it pretty much but again what

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.030 
and that's it pretty much but again what
i<00:01:45.329> ended<00:01:45.509> up<00:01:45.630> coming<00:01:46.049> out<00:01:46.259> with<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.590> seems<00:01:46.860> like

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
i ended up coming out with it seems like

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.389 
i ended up coming out with it seems like
it<00:01:47.189> was<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:48.710> monostable<00:01:49.710> circuit<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.369> know

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
it was a monostable circuit you know

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.730 
it was a monostable circuit you know
like<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.640> one<00:01:51.090> tick<00:01:51.270> pulse<00:01:51.590> because<00:01:52.590> it's

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
like a one tick pulse because it's

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.990 
like a one tick pulse because it's
releasing<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.369> block<00:01:54.710> so<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:56.310> wasn't

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
releasing the block so that wasn't

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.870 
releasing the block so that wasn't
really<00:01:57.060> working<00:01:57.479> out<00:01:57.750> too<00:01:58.079> well<00:01:58.610> with<00:01:59.610> what<00:01:59.850> i

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
really working out too well with what i

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.209 
really working out too well with what i
wanted<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.479> for<00:02:00.750> because<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.560> block<00:02:01.770> swapper

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
wanted it for because the block swapper

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.800 
wanted it for because the block swapper
doesn't<00:02:02.520> react<00:02:02.790> really<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.210> seems<00:02:03.479> like<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.780> a

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
doesn't react really it seems like to a

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.410 
doesn't react really it seems like to a
one<00:02:03.990> tickles<00:02:04.490> so<00:02:05.490> i<00:02:05.520> just<00:02:05.670> loaded<00:02:06.090> down

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
one tickles so i just loaded down

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.639 
one tickles so i just loaded down
considerably<00:02:08.450> just<00:02:09.450> added<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.989> repeater<00:02:10.379> then

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
considerably just added a repeater then

and now

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.660 
and now
it<00:02:13.000> goes<00:02:13.150> up<00:02:13.330> and<00:02:13.480> down<00:02:13.570> and<00:02:14.310> either<00:02:15.310> way<00:02:15.610> you

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670
