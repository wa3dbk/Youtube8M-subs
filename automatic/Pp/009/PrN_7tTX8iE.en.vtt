00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.490
 ah 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.459
 i am gem pérez ICU nurse 

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:11.320
 and the consultation of wounds and I'm going to 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:14.120
 talk about the recommendations for 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.309
 handling of the actions 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.260
 the extravasation is the fluid outlet 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.350
 intravenously into space but 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.360
 vascular caused by several factors the 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.090
 frequency of this complication is more 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.160
 high in children than in adults in units 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.220
 of neonatology care units 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.810
 intensive oncology unconscious or with 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.329
 injuries that prevent the notice to 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.040
 nursing staff much of the 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.140
 extravasation is would be avoided 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.850
 Raising staff awareness of the seriousness 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.030
 of this type of injuries and their 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.010
 sequels to reduce the risk that 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.989
 extravasation occurs the 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.030
 recommendations tell us to perform the 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.420
 Venipuncture or channeling technique 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.670
 adequate to have protocols and a 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.850
 medicine kit in each service 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.579
 to act immediately and choose 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.519
 the appropriate venous access as much as possible 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.130
 in upper extremities the order of 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.790
 preference would be forearm back of 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.430
 hand wrist and pit before cubital avoid 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.920
 small caliber veins inflamed or 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.050
 sclerosed veins where they have 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.470
 performed well previous functions or 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.230
 next 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.770
 dermal limbs with venous return and 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.920
 lymphatic compromised irritated areas and 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.990
 areas near the joints 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.340
 when extravasation occurs 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.220
 we have to stop immediately the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.890
 administration of the drug and try if 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.590
 It comes out extracting from 5 to 10 centimeters of 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.410
 blood dilute the extra drug based 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.680
 with physiological saline remove flick tena 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.680
 If they appear and apply hyaluronic accent 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.140
 blade cold heat raise or lower the 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.660
 limb depending on the drug that is 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.060
 have extra based we will start your 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.430
 Debridement in case of necrosis or 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.700
 Possible compartment syndrome and 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.840
 we will continue with cures in a humid environment 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.990
 these can be the drugs 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.520
 hyperosmolar these drugs that 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.120
 álex work can be produced 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.080
 ischemia drugs that produce toxicity 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.080
 direct cellular 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.480
 the measures that we are going to follow 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.780
 will depend on the characteristics of the 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.330
 drug that is extra based local heat 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.000
 that produces a vasodilation and a 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.260
 increase in capillary permeability 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.960
 allowing its rapid diffusion of 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.730
 extra fluid based on this should be 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.070
 take into account the substance involved 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.890
 for the possible side effects to the 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.860
 be diffused by cold circulation 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.000
 local that due to its properties 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.760
 vasoconstrictors is useful in case of 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.410
 Extrabases actions of alkaloids 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.600
 preventing its dissemination and 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.360
 decreasing its cellular toxicity by 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.100
 cold action can be dosed from 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.410
 different ways being the most 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.200
 used 15 minutes every six hours 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:05.070
 for three days and fifty minutes each 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.920
 hour for 48 hours hydrogel technique 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.230
 with sterile polyethylene wrap that 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.360
 consists of a sterile hydrogel applied 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.209
 over the affected area in a wrap 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.690
 sterile polyethylene dimethyl sulfone 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:21.450
 been 50% topical that is applied on 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.790
 the affected area every 6 hours for 15 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.819
 days and can be combined with ice 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.560
 one hour every eight hours the three 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.900
 first days in case of extravasation 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.739
 of antibiotics intercalan test and 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.750
 hyaluronic alkylating agents 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:39.659
 injected into the affected area the vial is 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.390
 of 150 units that is diluted in a 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:45.420
 centimeter of physiological serum of this 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.549
 mixture is taken 0.1 centimeters and it 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.310
 add 0.9 centimeters of serum 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.109
 Physiological volumes are injected 1 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.510
 centimeter in the affected area and it 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.310
 combined with local ice is employed as 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.530
 antidote in case of extravasation is from 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.049
 hyper tonic substances and agents with 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.659
 direct cell toxicity center blade 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:06.090
 injected into the affected area the blister 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:08.430
 is 5 milligrams and diluted in 9 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.989
 centimeters of physiological serum is 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.450
 they inject small amounts of 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.299
 whitening dilution of the area 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.070
 should improve immediately effective 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.680
 as an antidote in case of extravasation 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.259
 is from agents that produce ischemia in 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.000
 cytostatics there is a set in the plant 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:26.370
 of specific oncology for each 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.840
 substance once the 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.689
 treatment depending on the type of 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.489
 extravasation the cure of the injury 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:34.769
 will perform with a healing by 

00:04:32.489 --> 00:04:36.289
 second intention by healing in 

00:04:34.769 --> 00:04:38.659
 wet environment of the injury 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:41.610
 we will neglect the necrotic tissue or 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:43.979
 devitalized we will manage the exudate with 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.469
 dressings we will provide moisture in 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:48.629
 case of dry wounds and we will absorb the 

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:51.779
 excess moisture in case of very bad injuries 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:54.259
 extractive will control and manage 

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:56.759
 the possible infection and we will request 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:59.599
 interconsultation to plastic surgery if it is 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:01.949
 necessary for possible retraction is 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:04.679
 currently the hospital has a 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:07.259
 nurse consultation wounds where 

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:11.399
 can perform interconsultations via h cis 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:14.300
 or telephone to 800 87 in the case of 

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:14.300
 have an extravasation
