00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 how about brothers, sons of the mother 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.720
 nature today is fine in 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.090
 this video I come to explain how 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.490
 they can be better people both 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.210
 in your personal life like at school and 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.089
 at work 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.850
 I am André and he explained that the best 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.650
 way to make a better person leaves 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.750
 to be a better person not to do 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.600
 because really nothing more than a way 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.730
 of doing people is listening to this 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.460
 route that I will make today 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.769
 on my channel and it's looking for the definitive one 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.300
 but since he has 22 questions 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.600
 then better let's start at once 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.170
 who the hell creates a talde 22 question 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.239
 number 1 you get dizzy reading in the car 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.100
 I do not usually read in the car, not because 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.570
 I got dizzy but because I could not push 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.860
 because I have a defective view 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.289
 then he will have a lot to focus on 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.969
 to focus the letters then that's why 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.149
 he did not even try to read by car 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.640
 but name number 2 that has a style 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.829
 special and unique for you then follow a 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.090
 bunch of authors who have very styles 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.630
 only but 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.080
 I would say edgar allan poe 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.960
 tolkien and murakami it makes me have 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.810
 very very rich and arturo styles to use 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.490
 also very unique themes and styles that 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.110
 you can distinguish all the others 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.110
 Number 3 Harry Potter or Twilight 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.030
 what a difficult decision, gentlemen. 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.020
 I know what I'm going to do in this question I think 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.470
 what better is going to happen 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.750
 obviously I like the reporter more 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.450
 number 4 usually carry a backpack and if it is 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.550
 so set aside in your backpack some 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.560
 books are usually not load backpacks 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.229
 and knocked out like a briefcase as well as two 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.400
 for laptop and I precisely bring and almost 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:46.310
 always a book my laptop earphones a 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.100
 notebook and something to write and is in 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.289
 pencils pens number five books with or 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.240
 without illustrations good I think that 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.789
 it depends on the book because for example 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.520
 this book that I just reviewed that of the 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.649
 club dumas as it is about books 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.330
 they have illustrations they do very 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.700
 cool that the one you put the 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.380
 illustration of those of the prints that 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.360
 supposedly he had drawn the devil 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.729
 in those books that were written 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.950
 for the devil then in that case I was 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.989
 it does very well because they are as necessary 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.550
 for history not only for the 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.230
 made to illustrate to Latinos but 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.570
 so you can understand the story better 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.250
 and what is happening in it is a 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.780
 book that you loved with time you 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.400
 you realized that it was not worth it 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.170
 well I think that I really do not have 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.880
 none because all the books that I 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.580
 they have been talking about my life they follow me 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.490
 liking I say I do not know why really 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.290
 you would say that a book was no longer worth 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.230
 let's say I think that if a book 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.180
 like it's because it's worth it for you 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.880
 at least then if you have a story 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.890
 fun with a book of your childhood 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.660
 Well, in fact, if I have it, it's about 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.000
 a trilogy that I had I do not remember 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.480
 what is the name of 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.260
 of the books about us about a bear 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.150
 that he had adventures is to go around the world and 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.370
 was flying in hot air balloons in the end has 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.310
 been many costs but one day I 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.770
 I took a kitchen to kindergarten I think the 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.540
 kindle because if for elementary school 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.060
 I read that but I think I took her to 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.250
 kindergarten and a child stole it from me but I 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.590
 I realized that I stole it then I do not 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.959
 I was a friend of the boy but I told myself his friend 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.940
 to go to his house and that the day I went to 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.890
 your house is stealing 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.680
 so that 's the story of the 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.780
 childhood but recover books number 8 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.550
 what is the finest book bone thin 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.080
 from your shelf wait a moment 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.420
 because this I have to shrink 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.430
 between 2 and indeed if it is the one that I 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.530
 I thought of 120 days of sodoma from 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.810
 marqués de sade number 9 what is the 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.610
 fattest book on your shelf this 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.070
 It definitely has to be a storm 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.780
 of swords from the third cen of the saga of 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.180
 gay we show in the song areas in 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.980
 ice and fire and then you have 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.350
 seen are books in the bookstore will know 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.590
 that everyone is a beast number 10 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.599
 you write and if it is if you see yourself as a writer 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.830
 and I write but I do not see myself as a writer or 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.379
 at least more book writer 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.569
 because what I write mostly 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.819
 they are songs I almost do not write like 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.860
 stories and writing but they are stories 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.200
 short and small that I really do not 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.610
 they are very satisfying to me the same thing is 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.519
 write songs I have a lot 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.040
 number a favorite classic because you guys 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:17.479
 you know it's the miserable number 12 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.600
 At school, I have been treated in the 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:22.610
 art literature literature classes if 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.130
 fact is what was best given to me 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.690
 my weak point was mathematics but 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.729
 if I never beat with any of the 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.680
 classes let's say art or literature 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.840
 I do not think if someone gives you a gift 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.040
 book you hate what you would do because I believe 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.229
 that in this case the answer more 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.000
 civilized would be to rise from the book spit 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:40.130
 to the person who gave you and sell the 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.840
 book to the street or burn it what it is and from 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.060
 what your account is, nothing is not 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.460
 true the truth is that that would make 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.350
 simply as a complaint thank you and many 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.060
 thanks to less than that the person 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.970
 I knew that I do not like the joys of 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.310
 that today events number 14 that saga 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.930
 do you know similar to harry potter oa the 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.330
 hunger games that are not as well known 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.400
 they are very different between them because 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.650
 but good really the ones that I know 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.120
 they are similar are very well known not 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.770
 I know none that is fairly 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.069
 known if I only know that 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.800
 hunters of shadows or meis runner or if 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:14.120
 15 a bad habit when it comes to recording 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.370
 most of the time he recorded without 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.650
 number 16 pants what is your word 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:22.189
 preferred to linen brocka because I would 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.439
 I invented 17 you consider yourself network or droid 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:26.090
 the truth I consider myself a little pain 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:30.319
 because suddenly I get very simple and 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:32.569
 I put myself like that as not 18 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:35.659
 vampires or fairies definitely 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:37.669
 vampires number 19 ghost names what 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:39.889
 well this is a little more quarrelsome 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:42.110
 because both of them I really like the 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:43.520
 functional stressors werewolf but 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.870
 they call me a little more attention the one of 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.360
 omb of the werewolves 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.650
 again zombies or vampires this 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.990
 she is also a bit of a fighter but 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.940
 I prefer vampires because 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.099
 there is usually more variety in its type 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.659
 of stories when zombies are the 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:58.400
 truth is that most of the 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:59.810
 Zombie stories are the same 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.850
 are different 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:07.190
 in all the programs and triangles 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.720
 amorous or loves forbidden the truth 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.880
 is that I do not have the love ones they make me 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.730
 quite annoying I'm in charge I hate them 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.919
 much and the forbidden loves are born as 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.020
 that more interesting more exciting and 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:20.090
 I prefer a previous love despite 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.490
 that I am not much of reading stories 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.680
 romantic but 22 romantic books or 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.910
 of action with romantic background the 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.440
 truth is that I prefer action with 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.970
 romantic background because I'm sorry a 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.460
 little more real in that romantic aspect 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.440
 the romance books usually and it's 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.050
 so I do not read them I feel they are 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.900
 as a little forced or unreal or 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:41.240
 too cheesy and I feel like I do not know 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.490
 they feel real to me in most 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.380
 Romantic books do not feel 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.360
 real and that's why I'm not very 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.820
 addicted to that genre and well those were 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.260
 the 22 alternate questions of this attack 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.090
 definitive I hope you liked it 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.500
 you know that down here you can

 comment and I really like that I 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.950
 comment because I like to know 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.990
 much also their opinions and their 

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:02.660

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.500
