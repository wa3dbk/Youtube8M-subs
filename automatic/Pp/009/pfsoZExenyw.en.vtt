00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
of work best and I don't think these are

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.310 
of work best and I don't think these are
you<00:00:57.149> know<00:00:57.239> really<00:00:57.449> bad<00:00:57.660> choices<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:58.170> mean

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
you know really bad choices I mean

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.200 
you know really bad choices I mean
everyone<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:59.070> think<00:00:59.219> everyone<00:00:59.760> knew<00:00:59.879> from<00:01:00.030> the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
everyone I think everyone knew from the

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.119 
everyone I think everyone knew from the
get-go<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.600> blitz<00:01:01.079> will<00:01:01.289> probably<00:01:01.739> be<00:01:01.890> used

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
get-go that blitz will probably be used

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.390 
get-go that blitz will probably be used
cuz<00:01:02.340> it's<00:01:02.489> kind<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.699> like<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.850> CTF<00:01:03.390> variant<00:01:03.930> and

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
cuz it's kind of like a CTF variant and

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.830 
cuz it's kind of like a CTF variant and
domination<00:01:05.479> domination<00:01:06.479> certs<00:01:06.750> and
