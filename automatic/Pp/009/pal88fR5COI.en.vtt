00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.550 
bucket ok we're going to seal the top of
the<00:03:11.480> mylar<00:03:11.840> bag<00:03:12.050> now<00:03:13.780> because<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:14.930> mylar<00:03:15.350> bag

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
the mylar bag now because the mylar bag

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.630 
the mylar bag now because the mylar bag
is<00:03:15.830> actually<00:03:16.370> larger<00:03:16.610> than<00:03:16.970> my<00:03:17.840> food<00:03:18.080> saver

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
is actually larger than my food saver

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.310 
is actually larger than my food saver
heat<00:03:19.640> strip<00:03:20.090> I'm<00:03:20.300> going<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.570> do<00:03:20.660> this<00:03:20.810> in<00:03:20.870> three

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
heat strip I'm going to do this in three

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.729 
heat strip I'm going to do this in three
steps<00:03:24.310> take<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.489> corner<00:03:26.060> of<00:03:26.090> my<00:03:26.660> mylar<00:03:27.530> bag

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
steps take the corner of my mylar bag

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.280 
steps take the corner of my mylar bag
and<00:03:28.070> I<00:03:28.220> line<00:03:28.519> up<00:03:28.550> my<00:03:28.730> edges<00:03:29.630> as<00:03:29.810> straight<00:03:30.140> as

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
and I line up my edges as straight as

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.800 
and I line up my edges as straight as
possible<00:03:30.320> lay<00:03:31.160> it<00:03:31.310> down<00:03:31.459> flat<00:03:31.760> on<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.540> sealer

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
possible lay it down flat on the sealer

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:48.860 
possible lay it down flat on the sealer
and<00:03:32.959> then<00:03:33.200> I'll<00:03:33.380> poke<00:03:34.810> one<00:03:35.810> seal<00:03:36.200> on<00:03:36.410> the<00:03:36.530> back

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.080 

and<00:03:49.870> then<00:03:50.260> I<00:03:50.410> adjust<00:03:50.920> my<00:03:50.980> bucket<00:03:51.460> and<00:03:51.640> do<00:03:51.940> the

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
and then I adjust my bucket and do the

00:03:52.090 --> 00:04:04.500 
and then I adjust my bucket and do the
other<00:03:52.120> corner<00:04:02.610> I'm<00:04:03.610> going<00:04:03.820> to<00:04:03.940> take<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:04.330> air

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
other corner I'm going to take the air

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.420 
other corner I'm going to take the air
out<00:04:04.540> of<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:05.050> mylar<00:04:05.440> bag<00:04:05.620> as<00:04:05.830> much<00:04:06.010> as<00:04:06.220> possible

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
out of the mylar bag as much as possible

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.240 
out of the mylar bag as much as possible
when<00:04:07.000> I<00:04:07.030> do<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.450> last<00:04:07.690> seal<00:04:08.020> but<00:04:08.680> before<00:04:09.040> I<00:04:09.070> do

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
when I do the last seal but before I do

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.990 
when I do the last seal but before I do
that<00:04:09.960> take<00:04:10.960> my<00:04:11.140> scissors<00:04:11.380> and<00:04:11.890> cut<00:04:12.370> the<00:04:12.520> excess

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
that take my scissors and cut the excess

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:23.430 
that take my scissors and cut the excess
off<00:04:13.240> the<00:04:13.959> end<00:04:14.170> of<00:04:14.290> the<00:04:14.350> bag<00:04:22.020> this<00:04:23.020> allows<00:04:23.410> me

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
off the end of the bag this allows me

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.200 
off the end of the bag this allows me
that<00:04:23.980> to<00:04:24.760> be<00:04:24.910> able<00:04:25.000> to<00:04:25.270> fit<00:04:25.660> the<00:04:25.840> last<00:04:26.110> seal<00:04:26.470> on

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
that to be able to fit the last seal on

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.460 
that to be able to fit the last seal on
the<00:04:28.210> strip<00:04:29.250> and<00:04:30.250> at<00:04:30.760> this<00:04:30.940> point<00:04:31.300> I'm<00:04:32.230> going<00:04:32.380> to

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
the strip and at this point I'm going to

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.380 
the strip and at this point I'm going to
try<00:04:32.680> to<00:04:32.710> take<00:04:33.010> out<00:04:33.220> as<00:04:33.460> much<00:04:33.669> in<00:04:33.880> the<00:04:34.030> air<00:04:34.150> as

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
try to take out as much in the air as

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:41.340 
try to take out as much in the air as
possible<00:04:39.270> but<00:04:40.270> it's<00:04:40.480> important<00:04:41.020> for<00:04:41.200> me<00:04:41.260> to

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
possible but it's important for me to

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.890 
possible but it's important for me to
remember<00:04:41.680> to<00:04:42.040> keep<00:04:42.490> my<00:04:42.730> bag<00:04:42.970> straight<00:04:43.540> so<00:04:43.870> that

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
remember to keep my bag straight so that

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:54.230 
remember to keep my bag straight so that
I<00:04:44.080> get<00:04:44.230> a<00:04:44.380> good<00:04:44.680> seal

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.300
