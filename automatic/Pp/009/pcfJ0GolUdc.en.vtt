 from here in the place where we will capture 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.530

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.060
 animation not from when we're going or is it 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.440

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.570
 in the animation will be facing 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.220
 as if that we are reliving for 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.980
 be able to fight against him and just 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.100
 the right we can see an image of 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.200
 globe or is also the same not in the same 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.240

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.770
 what else calls me sincerely is like 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.360

 It looks like it's light I do not know the truth 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.660

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.220
 herbs so tall and area xiv of the 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.630
