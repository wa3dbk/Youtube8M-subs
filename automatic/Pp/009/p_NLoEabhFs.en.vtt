00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:07.670
 hello friends of motogp in spanish good 

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:11.180
 now to share 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:14.660
 a program that is installed both in the 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.630
 pc that I have here the screen in the 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.510
 front as in the motogp 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:24.199
 the program is called teamviewer and what 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:27.170
 let's use it as a remote control right now 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:30.880
 is already installed and previously asked me 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:34.960
 the password and the data then 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.989
 observe you as when moving me here 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.690
 here is also moving the mouse of 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:45.399
 according to where I am and what I am 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:48.989
 moving and then to show I'm going to 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.989
 find a one folder 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.690
 is 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.690
 no this 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:02.200
 Well, here you have already opened a folder and 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:06.930
 if I click on a 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.930
 here for example I'm going to click 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.560
 and now observe you as the order 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:21.360
 that I give to the motogp 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:25.840
 it is appreciated on the screen 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.710
 and then here is already opening this 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.710
 the tutorial 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:37.960
 and good finally what's left 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:40.479
 after we have done some 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.570
 of the demonstrations as we have 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:48.659
 I was observing then nothing more to 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.659
 end close by giving 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:57.840
 and they tell us that if we want to cancel or 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.640
 close then we say close and observe 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.820
 you as the screen comes back again 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.670
 to stay 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:08.840
 in its normality and thus with this 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:13.000
 We hopefully conclude and like this 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.000
 application until next time
