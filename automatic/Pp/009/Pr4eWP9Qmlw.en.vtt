primary<00:00:00.810> site<00:00:01.020> is<00:00:01.170> crucial<00:00:01.800> for<00:00:01.979> pcr<00:00:02.820> and

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:03.170 
primary site is crucial for pcr and

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.809 
primary site is crucial for pcr and
there<00:00:04.170> can<00:00:04.350> be<00:00:04.380> many<00:00:04.680> mistakes<00:00:05.130> being<00:00:05.400> made<00:00:05.490> or

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
there can be many mistakes being made or

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.110 
there can be many mistakes being made or
just<00:00:06.089> bad<00:00:06.480> luck<00:00:06.529> some<00:00:07.529> primers<00:00:08.069> just<00:00:08.580> don't

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
just bad luck some primers just don't

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.020 
just bad luck some primers just don't
work<00:00:09.480> so<00:00:10.110> what<00:00:10.320> do<00:00:11.160> you<00:00:11.309> need<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.820> pay

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
work so what do you need to pay

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.640 
work so what do you need to pay
attention<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.690> when<00:00:12.870> designing<00:00:13.320> primers<00:00:13.980> well

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
attention to when designing primers well

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.040 
attention to when designing primers well
primer<00:00:16.650> length<00:00:16.980> can<00:00:17.580> be<00:00:17.640> an<00:00:17.820> issue<00:00:17.970> so<00:00:18.690> the

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
primer length can be an issue so the

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.330 
primer length can be an issue so the
primers<00:00:20.480> normally<00:00:21.480> work<00:00:21.750> best<00:00:22.109> if<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.859> design

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
primers normally work best if you design

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.560 
primers normally work best if you design
them<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.789> have<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.449> contain<00:00:24.810> between<00:00:25.019> 18<00:00:25.890> and

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
them to have to contain between 18 and

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.900 
them to have to contain between 18 and
25<00:00:27.800> nucleotides<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:29.130> length<00:00:29.519> for<00:00:29.880> most

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
25 nucleotides in length for most

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.269 
25 nucleotides in length for most
purposes<00:00:30.330> that's<00:00:31.080> about<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.590> right<00:00:31.859> length

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
purposes that's about the right length

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.840 
purposes that's about the right length
that<00:00:32.759> makes<00:00:33.000> most<00:00:33.270> sense<00:00:34.520> however<00:00:35.520> it's<00:00:35.670> not

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
that makes most sense however it's not

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.850 
that makes most sense however it's not
just<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.329> length<00:00:36.960> it's<00:00:37.260> also<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
just the length it's also the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.160 
just the length it's also the
composition<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:38.760> makes<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.120> difference<00:00:39.360> so

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
composition that makes a difference so

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.100 
composition that makes a difference so
the<00:00:40.320> composition<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:43.370> the<00:00:44.370> primers<00:00:44.850> and

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
the composition of the primers and

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.200 
the composition of the primers and
should<00:00:46.110> they<00:00:46.649> should<00:00:46.680> contain<00:00:47.280> an<00:00:47.489> even

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
amount and even percentage of GC so the

is<00:01:19.710> not<00:01:19.890> enough<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.640> also<00:01:20.930> want<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.080> avoid

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
is not enough you also want to avoid

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.600 
is not enough you also want to avoid
secondary<00:01:24.119> structures<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.080> no<00:01:25.610> secondary

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
secondary structures so no secondary

designing<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.150> primers<00:03:08.610> okay<00:03:09.610> let's<00:03:10.239> assume

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
designing the primers okay let's assume

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.509 
designing the primers okay let's assume
that<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:11.230> have<00:03:11.380> been<00:03:11.560> paying<00:03:11.799> attention<00:03:11.920> to

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
that you have been paying attention to

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.360 
that you have been paying attention to
all<00:03:12.730> of<00:03:13.150> that<00:03:13.180> and<00:03:13.660> still<00:03:14.170> your<00:03:14.410> PCR<00:03:14.860> doesn't

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
all of that and still your PCR doesn't

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.229 
all of that and still your PCR doesn't
work<00:03:16.230> well<00:03:17.230> that<00:03:17.650> happens<00:03:18.070> some<00:03:18.400> promise<00:03:18.940> just

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
work well that happens some promise just

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.240 
work well that happens some promise just
don't<00:03:19.570> work<00:03:19.930> even<00:03:20.620> though<00:03:20.709> there's<00:03:20.950> no

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
obvious reason for that in such a case I

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.009 
obvious reason for that in such a case I
suggest<00:03:25.239> that<00:03:25.720> you<00:03:26.049> order<00:03:26.230> for<00:03:26.620> primers<00:03:27.130> to<00:03:28.019> in

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
suggest that you order for primers to in

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.360 
suggest that you order for primers to in
that<00:03:29.230> direction<00:03:29.650> and<00:03:30.060> two<00:03:31.060> in<00:03:31.180> that<00:03:31.329> direction

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
that direction and two in that direction

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.100 
that direction and two in that direction
covering<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.850> same<00:03:34.239> template<00:03:34.810> to<00:03:34.989> be

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
covering the same template to be

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.410 
covering the same template to be
amplified<00:03:35.709> because<00:03:36.340> what<00:03:36.610> you<00:03:36.730> can<00:03:36.910> do<00:03:37.120> then

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
amplified because what you can do then

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.990 
amplified because what you can do then
is<00:03:37.720> just<00:03:37.959> try<00:03:38.590> and<00:03:38.769> write<00:03:38.920> your<00:03:39.220> reaction<00:03:39.790> with

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
is just try and write your reaction with

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.750 
is just try and write your reaction with
all<00:03:40.239> possible<00:03:40.989> combinations<00:03:41.620> that<00:03:42.220> is<00:03:42.459> this

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
all possible combinations that is this

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.170 
all possible combinations that is this
primer<00:03:43.269> with<00:03:43.930> any<00:03:44.290> of<00:03:44.650> those<00:03:44.890> two<00:03:45.310> in<00:03:45.549> this

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
primer with any of those two in this

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.210

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
primer also with any of those two so

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.009 
primer also with any of those two so
you've<00:03:48.340> got<00:03:48.400> four<00:03:48.790> combinations<00:03:49.420> in<00:03:49.600> total

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
you've got four combinations in total

you've got four combinations in total
and<00:03:50.430> chances<00:03:51.430> are<00:03:51.459> pretty<00:03:51.700> good<00:03:51.820> that<00:03:51.970> at

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
and chances are pretty good that at

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.699

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
least one of them will work out and what

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.310

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
you can do on top of that is also use
