1<00:01:07.350> egg<00:01:08.180> 1<00:01:09.180> cup<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.600> milk<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.880> one<00:01:11.880> third<00:01:12.270> cup<00:01:12.600> of

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
1 egg 1 cup of milk and one third cup of

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.929 
1 egg 1 cup of milk and one third cup of
oil<00:01:13.229> actually<00:01:13.830> let<00:01:14.250> me<00:01:14.340> double<00:01:14.580> check<00:01:14.610> that

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
oil actually let me double check that

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.210 
oil actually let me double check that
oil<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.390> usually<00:01:16.259> use<00:01:16.439> one<00:01:16.650> third<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.040> think

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
oil I usually use one third but I think

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.800 
oil I usually use one third but I think
it<00:01:17.310> might<00:01:17.430> actually<00:01:17.580> be<00:01:17.820> one-fourth<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:18.659> let

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
it might actually be one-fourth so let

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.039 
it might actually be one-fourth so let
me<00:01:18.930> check<00:01:18.960> yes<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.369> one-fourth<00:01:21.360> cup<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.869> oil

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
me check yes it is one-fourth cup of oil

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.260 
me check yes it is one-fourth cup of oil
and<00:01:22.320> how<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:22.950> do<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.220> as<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.430> put<00:01:23.610> all<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:24.060> dry

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.300 
and how I do it as I put all the dry
ingredients<00:01:24.299> together<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.650> I've<00:01:25.860> already<00:01:26.009> put

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
helps the top brown better it'll bake

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.930 
helps the top brown better it'll bake
without<00:04:36.510> doing<00:04:37.110> that<00:04:37.139> but<00:04:37.979> you<00:04:38.580> know<00:04:38.699> like<00:04:38.820> I

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940

without doing that but you know like I
said<00:04:39.120> just<00:04:39.150> a<00:04:39.449> cold<00:04:39.660> or<00:04:39.840> to<00:04:39.990> kind<00:04:40.260> of<00:04:40.320> spread

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
said just a cold or to kind of spread

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.500 
said just a cold or to kind of spread
them<00:04:40.680> around<00:04:41.120> help<00:04:42.120> it<00:04:42.270> brown<00:04:42.449> better<00:04:43.760> and<00:04:44.760> I

got<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.110> coals<00:04:46.290> on<00:04:46.500> top<00:04:46.710> I<00:04:47.010> waited<00:04:47.820> about<00:04:47.910> five

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
got the coals on top I waited about five

minutes<00:04:48.419> let<00:04:48.660> them<00:04:48.780> bake<00:04:48.870> let<00:04:49.290> it<00:04:49.410> bake<00:04:49.530> about

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
minutes let them bake let it bake about

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.350 
minutes let them bake let it bake about
five<00:04:49.979> minutes<00:04:50.190> without<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:50.699> coals<00:04:50.910> on<00:04:51.120> top

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
five minutes without the coals on top

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.210 
five minutes without the coals on top
and<00:04:51.600> then<00:04:51.750> I<00:04:51.780> put<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.139> colds<00:04:52.440> on<00:04:52.560> top<00:04:52.770> just

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
and then I put the colds on top just

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.680 
and then I put the colds on top just
like<00:04:53.340> that<00:04:53.610> Jeff<00:04:53.789> and<00:04:53.940> cooking<00:04:54.210> basically

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
like that Jeff and cooking basically

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.580 
like that Jeff and cooking basically
except<00:04:55.050> you<00:04:55.139> doing<00:04:55.320> it<00:04:55.440> indoors<00:04:55.740> now<00:04:57.410> you<00:04:58.410> know

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
except you doing it indoors now you know

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.820 
except you doing it indoors now you know
the<00:04:59.190> coals<00:04:59.400> put<00:04:59.669> off<00:04:59.789> carbon<00:05:00.570> monoxide<00:05:01.139> so

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
the coals put off carbon monoxide so

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.100 
the coals put off carbon monoxide so
it's<00:05:02.520> not<00:05:02.699> something<00:05:03.150> you<00:05:03.180> want<00:05:03.510> to<00:05:03.600> do<00:05:03.780> for

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
it's not something you want to do for

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.170 
it's not something you want to do for
like<00:05:04.229> long<00:05:04.500> periods<00:05:04.949> of<00:05:05.010> time<00:05:05.070> but<00:05:05.460> this<00:05:05.940> only

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
like long periods of time but this only

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.159 
like long periods of time but this only
bakes<00:05:06.479> for<00:05:06.630> about<00:05:07.460> 15<00:05:08.460> minutes<00:05:08.669> at<00:05:08.940> the<00:05:09.060> most

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
bakes for about 15 minutes at the most

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.580 
bakes for about 15 minutes at the most
so<00:05:10.699> 15<00:05:11.699> to<00:05:11.820> 20<00:05:12.060> minutes<00:05:12.210> is<00:05:12.419> usually<00:05:12.870> about<00:05:12.990> 15

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
so 15 to 20 minutes is usually about 15

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.620 
so 15 to 20 minutes is usually about 15
minutes<00:05:13.770> it's<00:05:14.039> done<00:05:14.280> because<00:05:15.000> of<00:05:15.180> the<00:05:15.419> heat

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
minutes it's done because of the heat

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.710 
minutes it's done because of the heat
and<00:05:15.810> everything<00:05:16.229> so<00:05:16.500> anyway<00:05:17.510> just<00:05:18.510> so<00:05:18.660> you

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
and everything so anyway just so you

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.379 
and everything so anyway just so you
know<00:05:19.070> again<00:05:20.070> carbon<00:05:20.490> monoxide<00:05:20.520> keep<00:05:21.150> that<00:05:21.300> in

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
know again carbon monoxide keep that in

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:22.790 
know again carbon monoxide keep that in
mind<00:05:21.539> don't<00:05:21.810> do<00:05:21.930> it<00:05:22.050> for<00:05:22.229> long<00:05:22.350> periods<00:05:22.380> of

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
mind don't do it for long periods of

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.550 
mind don't do it for long periods of
time<00:05:22.860> and<00:05:23.190> make<00:05:23.310> sure<00:05:23.340> if<00:05:23.760> you'll<00:05:24.300> note<00:05:24.539> i<00:05:24.810> have

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:27.599 
my front door open because with the wood

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:29.870 
my front door open because with the wood
stove<00:05:27.840> keeps<00:05:28.680> the<00:05:28.830> house<00:05:28.950> really<00:05:29.490> really<00:05:29.639> warm
