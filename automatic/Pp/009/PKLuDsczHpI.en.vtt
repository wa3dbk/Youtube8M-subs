00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.800
 hey in this tutorial explains the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.630
 step by step as you do with yours 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.430
 own text bacon this text the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.040
 Approved minecraft comes when you 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.599
 launches I have now in bmp jpeg in it 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.500
 but you can see everything 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.570
 write or in whole 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.770
 different colours 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.149
 The prerequisite for this is that you like yourself 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.759
 your own texture pack somehow have 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:34.350
 what has been revised I have the first 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.870
 both share already explains how to do it 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.890
 These prerequisites for this is the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.630
 can be found here at the bottom left again 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.660
 accidentally , this is still the case 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.790
 own text bacon and not then yes 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.739
 It would not work that way either 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.089
 help a lot if you already have that 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.469
 hurry and have seen the days then 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.410
 Do you know that you are in your minecraft 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.780
 texture pack in there then you go up 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.940
 this assets folder in there and there on the 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.019
 minecraft folder and then here on the 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.940
 text folder 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.969
 Here 's the 1 and here's one 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.350
 detail of the specials point text yes the 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.670
 can now open normally and here 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.740
 All these are special in there 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.780
 that always come when minecraft say 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.400
 starts like this and now it can be all here 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.600
 make way or you can look like a little girl 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.560
 Write to it then is pretty 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.000
 unlikely that somehow 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.070
 come because they are all random 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.420
 selected you can all take away 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.350
 Do you want to do something yourself ? 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.090
 for example, texts per cultra super 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.610
 duper texture pack called so I say 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.810
 usd 6 pack for all our longer will 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.400
 Our little one will write later 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.740
 that is, if you make us usd then 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.000
 It is quite big and what has just been seen 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.710
 mainz also has color like I have here 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.100
 that's what makes everything yellow 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.710
 his 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.160
 there is this koller code the link 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.870
 to image of his description there 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.280
 can you look at what color the 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.400
 you know different courses 0 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.680
 black and zbfs white and there are 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.150
 here the whole in between 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.750
 now we can also introduce myself here 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.310
 make time 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.960
 So if now more towards doing 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.730
 then it always happens to me 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.870
 make time just for that when we see 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.010
 that will deny that to everyone 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.110
 case always displayed 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.310
 Now we can witness one another 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.629
 do what you see right away 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:12.480
 that's what i call usd now 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.400
 6 pack I leave it so not only so 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.989
 and exclamation marks now i want 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.500
 but usd all in different colors 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.660
 to have 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.160
 now you need the paragraph 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.379
 if you do not know how to do one 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.030
 I also write on the keyboard 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.400
 not he can do it for example wikipedia 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.079
 Articles go to the left 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.030
 the animals are such a topic in the 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:31.099
 Press text command to copy 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.290
 or press on windows control 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:37.489
 the whole thing was small again and then 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.170
 the front here eg stw made so have 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.700
 I sign the paragraph with behind 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.769
 the paragraph sign is coming now 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.769
 this 01 or something behind you 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.560
 Take the stands for the color say 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:51.260
 we're supposed to be from and ultra super duper 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.930
 should now have such a pinker then do 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.430
 I pee so dark here 5 do now 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.440
 I'll do it again like the clause 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.540
 sign and a number for example like that 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:04.099
 that it should be so good now because of it 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.010
 a bit but not a dark red 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:10.040
 and bright red and that's how it should be now 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.500
 be a helping so do that 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.680
 a text should now because of a 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.930
 so I say and pack 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.689
 but should be normal yellow so 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.239
 clause and and the back one should 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:25.849
 be dark red so paragraph and 4 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.950
 so now I have nice color there 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.629
 and now she can tell you all about it 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.449
 many are always making a new line 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:35.599
 then opened sequentially after 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:37.699
 others can be taken and can 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.769
 me or say this 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:42.650
 by chance I let it save it 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.120
 so and now can the here because of me 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.230
 credits and so on that come then 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.810
 we played the game that way and that 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.780
 continue to change all or the 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.459
 and stories and if you are there that is 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.340
 but I would be able to leave it that way 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.440
 also change after what you want and thank you 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.220
 I'm back to the very front 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.419
 marks everything and says compress 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.129
 make it out to say this zip 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:06.199
 file as I already in the tutorial 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:07.970
 told me about this compress 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:10.370
 on windows as well as mac compress 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.250
 on windows right click and back on 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.229
 and then with after 7 zip or winrar 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:20.120
 compress like that in this part 3 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:22.099
 have already done and then you can 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.900
 that's it back here somehow that 's it 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:25.970
 now at archive you go in 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.280
 minecraft folder should now 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.870
 already know where he is the tutorial 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.770
 I have linked often enough 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.849
 if I have it up here right or 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.729
 embarrassed if you do not know how 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:36.770
 minecraft 1 and there in the resource 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.120
 packs folder and here was the example 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.990
 what I had in it I can do that 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.970
 make now times 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.040
 and many other things we clean 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:47.390
 just changed then you can 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.010
 minecraft start like that and when 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.050
 has launched minecraft you see only 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.850
 nothing because you have to respect it yet 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.710
 select that means option respect 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.000
 texture what you just changed pack 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.940
 your text just stays around 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.380
 say then you go back to that 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.760
 It has still not changed anything in the menu 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.990
 you have to rebuild minecraft now 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.390
 start or you just go one 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.860
 small world pure and then go again 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.410
 out of the world the former you already 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.150
 flashing look so and out of here 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.230
 the world and it's in here and 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.970
 that always comes when you do the sixpack 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.800
 enabled hate and minecraft states 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.970
 is always this cost text in 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:22.340
 interviews in it I have this the 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.590
 colorful this paper and then that 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.150
 the red that harry potter sees that 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.780
 damn good if I'm so when it comes to 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.670
 in the contrast fits like so much 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.210
 in addition I hope the tutorial has her 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.580
 helped 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.480
 Have fun with a text 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.480
 pack and
