our back garden
so<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.609> practice<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:18.359> as<00:00:18.779> much<00:00:18.960> as<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.199> want<00:00:19.410> it

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
so I practice this as much as I want it

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.160 
so I practice this as much as I want it
however<00:00:20.699> they<00:00:20.789> don't<00:00:20.970> have<00:00:21.210> easy<00:00:21.359> access<00:00:21.570> or

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
however they don't have easy access or

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.810 
however they don't have easy access or
panel<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.680> use<00:00:22.800> it's<00:00:23.010> not<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.160> concrete<00:00:23.580> or

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
panel to use it's not a concrete or

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.080 
panel to use it's not a concrete or
asphalt<00:00:24.060> surface<00:00:24.890> so<00:00:25.890> biggest<00:00:26.820> thing<00:00:27.000> about

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
asphalt surface so biggest thing about

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.200 
asphalt surface so biggest thing about
hitting<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.840> ball<00:00:28.050> harder<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:29.220> two<00:00:29.460> parts<00:00:29.820> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
hitting a ball harder is two parts the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.910 
hitting a ball harder is two parts the
first<00:00:30.240> part<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.929> obviously<00:00:31.320> your<00:00:31.470> technique

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
first part is obviously your technique

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.380 
first part is obviously your technique
making<00:00:32.250> sure<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.700> turn<00:00:32.910> on<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.239> ball

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
making sure that you turn on the ball

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.360 
making sure that you turn on the ball
well<00:00:33.600> okay<00:00:34.320> sometimes<00:00:34.950> when<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.160> try<00:00:35.340> a

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
well okay sometimes when you try a

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.150 
well okay sometimes when you try a
typically<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.750> just<00:00:36.780> kind<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.170> lose<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.590> and

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
typically you just kind of lose it and

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.940 
typically you just kind of lose it and
it<00:00:38.430> bounces<00:00:38.850> if<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.809> goes<00:00:40.020> up<00:00:40.200> too<00:00:40.410> much<00:00:40.620> and

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
it bounces if it goes up too much and

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.240 
it bounces if it goes up too much and
you<00:00:41.280> know<00:00:41.399> nickel<00:00:42.329> atom<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:43.500> second<00:00:43.829> part<00:00:44.070> is

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
you know nickel atom the second part is

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.130 
you know nickel atom the second part is
obviously<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.760> particular<00:00:45.210> part<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.780> now

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
obviously the particular part of it now

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.319 
obviously the particular part of it now
yes<00:00:46.890> guys<00:00:47.280> will<00:00:47.550> be<00:00:47.640> able<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.910> get<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.149> ball

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
yes guys will be able to get the ball

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.049 
yes guys will be able to get the ball
part<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.050> girls<00:00:49.289> in<00:00:49.559> most<00:00:49.800> situations

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
part of the girls in most situations

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.760 
part of the girls in most situations
okay<00:00:51.059> because<00:00:51.420> naturally<00:00:52.050> they<00:00:52.079> are<00:00:52.320> stronger

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
okay because naturally they are stronger

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.020 
okay because naturally they are stronger
so<00:00:53.460> girls<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.329> guys<00:00:54.570> can<00:00:55.559> be<00:00:55.710> doing<00:00:56.030> specific

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
so girls and guys can be doing specific

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.310 
so girls and guys can be doing specific
strength<00:00:57.329> training<00:00:57.629> which<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:57.960> going<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.170> help

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
strength training which is going to help

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.569 
strength training which is going to help
you<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.739> get<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.010> ball

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
you to get the ball

you to get the ball
this<00:01:00.180> includes<00:01:00.690> not<00:01:00.750> only<00:01:01.700> within<00:01:02.700> the<00:01:03.239> pore

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
this includes not only within the pore

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.469 
this includes not only within the pore
of<00:01:03.780> your<00:01:04.110> body<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.580> combination<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:06.330> in

full body movements adding in the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.750 
full body movements adding in the
element<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.020> anti<00:01:10.440> rotation<00:01:10.770> which<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.580> going

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
element of anti rotation which is going

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.270 
element of anti rotation which is going
to<00:01:11.820> help<00:01:11.940> you<00:01:12.180> have<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> much<00:01:13.320> faster<00:01:13.830> swing

because you're using the right muscles
and<00:01:16.380> because<00:01:16.890> you're<00:01:17.009> generating<00:01:17.340> more<00:01:17.700> force

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
and because you're generating more force

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.170 
and because you're generating more force

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
gentle little buglets okay so slipping

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.059 
gentle little buglets okay so slipping
into<00:01:58.710> it

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069 
into it

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:02.029 
into it
keeping<00:01:59.789> up<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.780> make<00:02:01.319> sure<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.830> follow

quotient property is transferred from

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.910 
quotient property is transferred from
this<00:02:09.269> rightly<00:02:10.140> okay<00:02:10.920> slipping<00:02:11.370> into<00:02:11.519> it<00:02:11.730> and

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
way there's sometimes when people are

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.059 
way there's sometimes when people are
hitting<00:02:23.940> they're<00:02:24.660> falling<00:02:25.049> away<00:02:25.170> yeah

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
hitting they're falling away yeah

hitting they're falling away yeah
according<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:26.970> slide<00:02:27.709> very<00:02:28.709> wasting<00:02:29.400> energy

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
according to slide very wasting energy

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.569 
according to slide very wasting energy
okay<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.630> get<00:02:30.959> as<00:02:31.319> much<00:02:31.560> power<00:02:32.099> use<00:02:32.370> your

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
okay so to get as much power use your
