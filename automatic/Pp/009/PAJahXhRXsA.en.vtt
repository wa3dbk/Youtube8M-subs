00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
and the reason why that actually has

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.230 
and the reason why that actually has
something<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.309> do<00:00:14.429> with<00:00:14.549> this<00:00:14.639> gameplay<00:00:14.880> is

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
something to do with this gameplay is

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.150 
something to do with this gameplay is
because<00:00:15.780> this<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.260> same<00:00:16.500> map<00:00:16.740> against<00:00:17.010> the

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
because this the same map against the

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.500 
because this the same map against the
same<00:00:17.369> people<00:00:17.550> same<00:00:17.940> kill<00:00:18.150> streaks<00:00:18.390> and

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
everything the very next game so we

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.880

I<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.650> made<00:01:20.280> sure<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.729> made<00:01:21.000> sure<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.299> I

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
I I made sure that I made sure of it I

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.210 
I I made sure that I made sure of it I
don't<00:01:21.600> even<00:01:21.689> think<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.930> was<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.049> close<00:01:22.320> was<00:01:23.009> even

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
don't even think it was a close was even

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.190 
don't even think it was a close was even
a<00:01:23.310> close<00:01:23.610> game<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:24.960> where

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
a close game in this and this is where

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.300 
a close game in this and this is where
you<00:01:25.290> get<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.500> see<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.830> little<00:01:26.070> bit<00:01:26.159> more

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
you get to see that a little bit more

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.160 
you get to see that a little bit more
precision<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.939> accuracy<00:01:27.270> comes<00:01:27.659> involved

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
precision and accuracy comes involved

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.420 
precision and accuracy comes involved
this<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.409> where<00:01:28.560> I'm<00:01:28.650> actually<00:01:28.890> trying<00:01:29.310> to

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
this is where I'm actually trying to

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.940 
this is where I'm actually trying to
play<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.700> win<00:01:29.939> I'm<00:01:30.240> playing<00:01:30.869> smarter<00:01:31.409> my

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
play to win I'm playing smarter my

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.649 
play to win I'm playing smarter my
reactions<00:01:32.579> up<00:01:32.729> i'm<00:01:32.909> sitting<00:01:33.180> up<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.479> chair

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
reactions up i'm sitting up in the chair

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.940 
reactions up i'm sitting up in the chair
i'm<00:01:33.810> not<00:01:33.960> just<00:01:34.200> goofing<00:01:34.530> off<00:01:34.619> like<00:01:34.770> I

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
i'm not just goofing off like I

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.670 
i'm not just goofing off like I
typically<00:01:35.280> do<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.820> almost<00:01:36.570> every<00:01:37.170> other<00:01:37.200> game

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
typically do in almost every other game

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.010 
typically do in almost every other game
so<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.060> where<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.720> where<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.930> was

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
so this is where it this is where it was

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.200 
so this is where it this is where it was
a<00:01:40.049> little<00:01:40.259> bit<00:01:40.409> different<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.000> know<00:01:42.119> I

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
a little bit different and I you know I

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.300 
a little bit different and I you know I
tried<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.540> do<00:01:42.659> with<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.960> what<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.560> took<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.799> you

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
tried to do with it what it took to you

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.160 
tried to do with it what it took to you
know<00:01:44.430> help<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.729> team<00:01:44.880> win<00:01:44.909> again<00:01:45.119> there<00:01:46.079> were

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
know help the team win again there were

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.719 
know help the team win again there were
a<00:01:46.200> couple<00:01:46.259> moments<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.189> know<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.490> got

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
a couple moments that you know I got

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.819 
a couple moments that you know I got
outplayed<00:01:48.060> but<00:01:48.509> for<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.079> most<00:01:49.259> part<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.649> did

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
outplayed but for the most part I did

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.350 
outplayed but for the most part I did
what<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.100> took<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.280> actually<00:01:50.670> get<00:01:50.820> us<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.030> w

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
what it took to actually get us the w

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.999 
what it took to actually get us the w
this<00:01:51.540> time<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.110> was<00:01:52.259> just<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.530> pissed<00:01:52.560> off

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
this time and I was just so pissed off

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.080 
this time and I was just so pissed off
because<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.369> was<00:01:53.490> one<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.700> those<00:01:53.850> moments

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
because it was one of those moments

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.240 
because it was one of those moments
where<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.899> knew<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.350> last<00:01:55.649> game<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:56.130> we

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
where I knew in that last game that we

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.920 
where I knew in that last game that we
could<00:01:56.430> have<00:01:56.520> won<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.759> worked<00:01:57.210> my<00:01:57.420> ass<00:01:57.570> off<00:01:57.750> at

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
could have won I worked my ass off at

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.179 
could have won I worked my ass off at
the<00:01:58.020> end<00:01:58.140> but<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.380> couldn't<00:01:58.680> do<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:58.979> felt

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
the end but I couldn't do it so I felt

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.190 
the end but I couldn't do it so I felt
like<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.369> failed<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.729> team<00:02:00.020> even<00:02:01.020> though<00:02:01.049> it

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
like I failed the team even though it

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.289

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
should be on one guy's shoulder but I

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.490 
should be on one guy's shoulder but I
