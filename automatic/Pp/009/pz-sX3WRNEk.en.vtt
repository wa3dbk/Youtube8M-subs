to show off what's different on the

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.820 
to show off what's different on the
mouse<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.820> some<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.689> new<00:00:24.810> features<00:00:24.840> so

mouse and some of the new features so
I'm<00:00:26.099> going<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.310> go<00:00:26.460> ahead<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.699> open<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.060> up<00:00:27.180> and

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
I'm going to go ahead and open it up and

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.509 
I'm going to go ahead and open it up and
we'll<00:00:27.539> take<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.810> look<00:00:28.320> inside<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:29.369> now<00:00:29.490> that

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
we'll take a look inside so now that

I've been boxed the thorough and
infrared<00:00:31.410> we<00:00:31.650> can<00:00:31.830> see<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.489> same

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
infrared we can see that the same

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.819 
infrared we can see that the same
familiar<00:00:33.149> ergonomic<00:00:33.899> shape<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.559> theremin

familiar ergonomic shape of the theremin

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.790 
familiar ergonomic shape of the theremin
is<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.160> same<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.390> keeping<00:00:36.719> true<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.020> what

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
is the same this is keeping true to what

make it even better is we've added an

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.179 
make it even better is we've added an
infrared<00:01:05.700> optical<00:01:06.299> sensor<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.830> hybrid

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
infrared optical sensor this is a hybrid

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.300 
infrared optical sensor this is a hybrid
between<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:09.090> laser<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.960> optical<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.740> it's

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
between a laser and optical and it's

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.609 
between a laser and optical and it's
guaranteed<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.299> track<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:12.869> pretty<00:01:13.200> much<00:01:13.320> any

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
guaranteed to track on pretty much any

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.859 
guaranteed to track on pretty much any
surface<00:01:14.100> out<00:01:14.670> there<00:01:14.939> whether<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.450> be<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.570> hard

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
surface out there whether it be a hard

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.130 
surface out there whether it be a hard
pad<00:01:16.110> or<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.350> soft<00:01:16.590> pad<00:01:16.909> goes<00:01:17.909> up<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.180> 4,000<00:01:18.810> DPI

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.429 
pad or a soft pad goes up to 4,000 DPI
and<00:01:19.530> it's<00:01:19.950> very<00:01:20.189> very<00:01:20.490> good<00:01:20.700> tracking<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.479> even

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
and it's very very good tracking so even

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.230 
and it's very very good tracking so even
if<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.650> have<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.799> low<00:01:23.070> DPI<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:23.850> use<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> high

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
if you have a low DPI and you use a high

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.210 
if you have a low DPI and you use a high
sensitivity<00:01:24.780> it's<00:01:25.650> going<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.830> pick<00:01:26.040> up<00:01:26.189> your

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
sensitivity it's going to pick up your

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.310 
sensitivity it's going to pick up your
movements<00:01:26.759> pretty<00:01:26.970> curse<00:01:27.299> pretty<00:01:28.049> cleanly

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
movements pretty curse pretty cleanly

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.640 
movements pretty curse pretty cleanly
and<00:01:28.500> pretty<00:01:28.680> crisply<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.960> just<00:01:30.960> keeping<00:01:31.229> true

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
and pretty crisply and just keeping true

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.410 
and pretty crisply and just keeping true
with<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.829> Theron<00:01:32.549> design<00:01:32.880> we<00:01:33.119> have<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
with the Theron design we have the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.840 
with the Theron design we have the
weight<00:01:33.900> in<00:01:34.049> system<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.159> can<00:01:35.250> customize

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
weight in system so you can customize

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.170 
weight in system so you can customize
the<00:01:36.150> weight<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.810> mouse<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.860> way<00:01:38.040> if<00:01:39.030> you

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
the weight of the mouse that way if you

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.580 
the weight of the mouse that way if you
like<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.390> heavier<00:01:39.750> mouse<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.170> can<00:01:40.200> keep<00:01:40.470> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
like a heavier mouse you can keep the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.190 
like a heavier mouse you can keep the
weights<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:41.009> many<00:01:41.909> people<00:01:42.299> prefer<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.930> lighter

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
weights in many people prefer a lighter

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.130 
weights in many people prefer a lighter
mouse<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.710> they'll<00:01:43.829> take<00:01:44.040> them<00:01:44.189> out<00:01:44.960> now<00:01:45.960> that

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
mouse so they'll take them out now that

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.810 
mouse so they'll take them out now that
I've<00:01:46.229> plugged<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.799> mouse<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.460> can<00:01:47.490> see

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
I've plugged in the mouse you can see

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.160 
I've plugged in the mouse you can see
that<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:48.090> carries<00:01:48.390> over<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.720> same<00:01:48.899> lighting

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
that it carries over the same lighting
