here<00:00:01.770> is<00:00:02.010> another<00:00:02.340> nice<00:00:03.049> interesting<00:00:04.049> case<00:00:04.609> we

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
here is another nice interesting case we

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.360 
here is another nice interesting case we
can<00:00:05.819> see<00:00:06.000> a<00:00:06.029> really<00:00:06.660> nice<00:00:06.870> spleen<00:00:07.500> here<00:00:07.919> can't

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
can see a really nice spleen here can't

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:08.600 
can see a really nice spleen here can't
we

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
we

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.330 
we
we<00:00:08.849> can<00:00:09.000> see<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.210> smooth<00:00:09.750> surface<00:00:10.170> we<00:00:11.130> don't

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
we can see a smooth surface we don't

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.030 
we can see a smooth surface we don't
know<00:00:11.519> how<00:00:11.730> big<00:00:12.000> it<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.240> but<00:00:13.110> we<00:00:13.320> could<00:00:13.530> suspect

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
know how big it is but we could suspect

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.430 
know how big it is but we could suspect
it's<00:00:14.280> bigger<00:00:14.549> than<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:14.940> should<00:00:14.969> be<00:00:15.420> because<00:00:15.990> it

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
it's bigger than it should be because it

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.090 
it's bigger than it should be because it
appears<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.340> be<00:00:17.369> filled<00:00:17.850> with<00:00:18.180> something

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100

please<00:00:20.100> note<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:21.650> classical<00:00:22.650> spleen<00:00:23.220> is

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
please note that the classical spleen is

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.509 
please note that the classical spleen is
always<00:00:23.850> described<00:00:24.390> as<00:00:24.570> red<00:00:25.109> pulp<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.769> white

pulp and the redder areas represent

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.709 
pulp and the redder areas represent
areas<00:00:30.449> where<00:00:30.929> there<00:00:31.230> are<00:00:31.439> more<00:00:31.790> sinusoids<00:00:32.790> the

site of RBC destruction and the whiter
areas<00:00:37.980> generally<00:00:38.309> are<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.149> areas

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
areas generally are the areas

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
surrounding blood vessels which are more

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.950 
surrounding blood vessels which are more
likely<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.899> have<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.440> lymphoid<00:00:44.160> tissue<00:00:45.090> there

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
likely to have a lymphoid tissue there

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.959 
likely to have a lymphoid tissue there
are<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.140> lot<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.350> little<00:00:46.800> white<00:00:47.039> pulp<00:00:47.370> areas

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
are a lot of little white pulp areas

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.450 
are a lot of little white pulp areas
here<00:00:48.329> aren't<00:00:48.750> there<00:00:48.870> there<00:00:49.440> are<00:00:49.649> very<00:00:50.010> little

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
here aren't there there are very little

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.029 
here aren't there there are very little
here<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.090> not<00:00:52.020> only<00:00:52.170> are<00:00:52.500> there<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.739> lot<00:00:53.010> of

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
here and not only are there a lot of

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.069 
here and not only are there a lot of
white<00:00:53.340> pulp<00:00:53.610> areas<00:00:54.180> but<00:00:54.390> some<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.780> them<00:00:54.930> are

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
white pulp areas but some of them are

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.130 
white pulp areas but some of them are
very<00:00:55.110> big<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.460> might<00:00:56.760> suspect<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.719> this

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
very big so you might suspect that this

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.150 
very big so you might suspect that this
lean<00:00:58.730> should<00:00:59.730> have<00:00:59.940> more<00:01:00.270> lymphoid<00:01:01.140> tissue<00:01:01.829> in

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
lean should have more lymphoid tissue in

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.179 
lean should have more lymphoid tissue in
it<00:01:02.340> then<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.719> should<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.799> really<00:01:05.040> a

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
it then it should and this is really a

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.469 
it then it should and this is really a
terrific<00:01:05.930> way<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.260> telling<00:01:08.070> if<00:01:08.369> for<00:01:08.790> example<00:01:08.820> a

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
terrific way of telling if for example a

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.429 
terrific way of telling if for example a
spleen<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.939> involved<00:01:11.939> with<00:01:12.479> lymphoma<00:01:13.080> or

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
spleen is involved with lymphoma or

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.690 
spleen is involved with lymphoma or
leukemia<00:01:13.939> or<00:01:14.939> other<00:01:15.740> hematologic<00:01:16.740> malignancy

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
leukemia or other hematologic malignancy

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.219 
leukemia or other hematologic malignancy
like<00:01:18.390> they<00:01:19.290> often<00:01:19.680> are<00:01:20.390> let's<00:01:21.390> take<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.659> look<00:01:21.990> at

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
like they often are let's take a look at

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.520 
like they often are let's take a look at
the<00:01:22.890> peripheral<00:01:23.490> smear<00:01:23.670> on<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.210> patient<00:01:25.729> and

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
the peripheral smear on this patient and

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.490 
the peripheral smear on this patient and
let's<00:01:28.530> take<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.770> look<00:01:29.100> at<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.549> normal<00:01:30.060> purl<00:01:31.020> smear

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
let's take a look at a normal purl smear

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.069 
let's take a look at a normal purl smear
I'm<00:01:34.500> going<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.829> make<00:01:35.100> three<00:01:35.520> clicks<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.390> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
I'm going to make three clicks and the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.350 
I'm going to make three clicks and the
normal<00:01:37.590> peripheral<00:01:38.280> smear<00:01:38.460> one<00:01:39.150> two<00:01:40.140> three

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
normal peripheral smear one two three

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.060 
normal peripheral smear one two three
even<00:01:42.360> though<00:01:42.390> we<00:01:42.750> haven't<00:01:43.110> identified<00:01:43.290> all

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
even though we haven't identified all

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.789 
even though we haven't identified all
these<00:01:44.310> cells<00:01:44.610> precisely<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.659> want<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.619> get

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
these cells precisely I want you to get

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.310 
these cells precisely I want you to get
the<00:01:46.979> general<00:01:47.369> feel<00:01:47.759> for<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.270> ratio<00:01:48.780> between

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
the general feel for the ratio between

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.020 
the general feel for the ratio between
the<00:01:49.649> white<00:01:49.860> cells<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.490> red<00:01:50.670> cells

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
the white cells and the red cells

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.380 
the white cells and the red cells
there's<00:01:51.810> probably<00:01:52.229> 30<00:01:52.680> 40<00:01:53.070> at<00:01:53.460> most<00:01:53.850> white

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
there's probably 30 40 at most white

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.690 
there's probably 30 40 at most white
cells<00:01:54.659> in<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:54.990> area<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.619> all<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.340> rest<00:01:56.549> of

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
cells in this area and all the rest of

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.850 
cells in this area and all the rest of
my<00:01:56.850> red<00:01:57.090> cells<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.960> looks<00:01:58.170> like<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.500> might<00:01:58.680> be<00:01:58.829> a

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
my red cells it looks like it might be a

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.830 
my red cells it looks like it might be a
hundred<00:01:59.310> or<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.490> thousand<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.210> one<00:02:00.360> ratio

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
hundred or a thousand to one ratio

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.550 
hundred or a thousand to one ratio
however<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:03.000> peripheral<00:02:03.600> smear<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:04.229> the

however in the peripheral smear of the
patient<00:02:05.070> with<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.850> big<00:02:06.119> spleen<00:02:06.600> with<00:02:07.290> the

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
patient with that big spleen with the

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.889 
patient with that big spleen with the
prominence<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.220> white<00:02:08.700> pulp<00:02:09.060> I'm<00:02:09.420> going<00:02:09.810> to

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
prominence of white pulp I'm going to

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.570 
prominence of white pulp I'm going to
make<00:02:10.050> three<00:02:10.259> clicks<00:02:10.649> on<00:02:10.890> his<00:02:11.069> peripheral

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
make three clicks on his peripheral

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.360 
make three clicks on his peripheral
smear<00:02:11.819> also<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:12.890> notice

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
smear also and notice

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.910 
smear also and notice
how<00:02:14.489> there<00:02:14.819> is<00:02:15.060> perhaps<00:02:15.330> five<00:02:15.989> or<00:02:16.230> ten<00:02:16.620> times

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
how there is perhaps five or ten times

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.130 
how there is perhaps five or ten times
more<00:02:17.370> white<00:02:18.120> cells<00:02:19.010> than<00:02:20.010> red<00:02:20.340> cells<00:02:21.140> compared

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
more white cells than red cells compared

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.030 
more white cells than red cells compared
to<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.620> normal<00:02:22.950> control<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:24.120> why<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.319> that

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
to the normal control and why is that

to the normal control and why is that
or<00:02:26.840> perhaps<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:28.409> first<00:02:29.090> question<00:02:30.090> would<00:02:30.209> be

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
or perhaps the first question would be

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.670 
or perhaps the first question would be
what<00:02:31.019> are<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.920> increased<00:02:32.400> cells<00:02:33.260> well<00:02:34.260> if<00:02:34.530> you

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
what are the increased cells well if you

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.000 
what are the increased cells well if you
look<00:02:34.890> very<00:02:35.280> closely<00:02:35.730> I<00:02:36.329> think<00:02:37.170> I<00:02:37.290> can<00:02:37.530> convince

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
look very closely I think I can convince

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.619 
look very closely I think I can convince
you<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.579> here<00:02:39.239> here<00:02:40.019> here<00:02:40.709> here<00:02:41.579> here<00:02:41.790> here

you that here here here here here here
here<00:02:43.849> here<00:02:44.849> here<00:02:45.090> almost<00:02:45.930> all<00:02:46.769> of<00:02:46.829> these<00:02:47.310> cells

here here here almost all of these cells

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.130 
here here here almost all of these cells
are<00:02:48.530> fairly<00:02:49.530> mature<00:02:50.489> or<00:02:51.090> fairly<00:02:51.480> normal

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140

looking<00:02:52.410> lymphocytes<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:54.000> reason<00:02:54.420> for<00:02:54.660> this

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
looking lymphocytes the reason for this

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.170 
looking lymphocytes the reason for this
tremendous<00:02:55.319> increase<00:02:56.250> in<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.730> white<00:02:56.879> cell

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
tremendous increase in the white cell

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.309 
tremendous increase in the white cell
count<00:02:57.510> is<00:02:57.750> because<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:59.720> blood<00:03:00.720> is<00:03:00.959> filled

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
count is because the blood is filled

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.319 
count is because the blood is filled
with<00:03:01.470> lymphocytes<00:03:02.099> you<00:03:02.700> wouldn't<00:03:03.030> want<00:03:03.239> to
