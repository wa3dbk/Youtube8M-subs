00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
to clean windows professionally cleaning

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.900 
to clean windows professionally cleaning
with<00:00:34.230> pure<00:00:34.500> water<00:00:34.680> there<00:00:35.460> are<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.700> lot<00:00:35.880> of

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
with pure water there are a lot of

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.479 
with pure water there are a lot of
advantages<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.649> much<00:00:37.950> faster<00:00:37.980> than

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
advantages it is much faster than

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.369 
advantages it is much faster than
classic<00:00:39.059> cleaning<00:00:39.420> because<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.989> don't<00:00:40.200> have

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
classic cleaning because you don't have

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.010 
classic cleaning because you don't have
to<00:00:40.559> squeegee<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.040> windows<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.300> just<00:00:42.840> have

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
to squeegee the windows so you just have

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.260 
to squeegee the windows so you just have
one<00:00:43.379> instead<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:43.980> two<00:00:44.100> working<00:00:44.520> operations

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
one instead of two working operations

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.650 
one instead of two working operations
that<00:00:46.020> means<00:00:46.350> with<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.039> same<00:00:47.250> staff<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:48.360> cover

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
that means with the same staff you cover

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.229 
that means with the same staff you cover
more<00:00:49.079> space<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.680> less<00:00:50.039> time<00:00:50.340> at<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:51.000> higher

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
more space and less time at a higher

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.350 
more space and less time at a higher
turnover<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.399> you<00:00:53.399> have<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> wider<00:00:53.850> range<00:00:53.940> of

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
turnover and you have a wider range of

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.569 
turnover and you have a wider range of
application<00:00:55.020> because<00:00:55.620> with<00:00:55.800> water<00:00:56.039> fed<00:00:56.280> poles

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
application because with water fed poles

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.760 
application because with water fed poles
you<00:00:57.030> can<00:00:57.180> easily<00:00:57.390> reach<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.109> clean<00:00:58.350> windows

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
you can easily reach and clean windows

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.650 
you can easily reach and clean windows
at<00:00:59.010> higher<00:00:59.250> levels<00:00:59.670> or<00:00:59.879> at<00:00:59.940> just

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
at higher levels or at just

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.049 
at higher levels or at just
hard-to-reach<00:01:01.140> areas<00:01:01.590> therefore<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:03.030> a

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
hard-to-reach areas therefore it is a

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.179 
hard-to-reach areas therefore it is a
lot<00:01:03.270> safer<00:01:03.539> as<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.559> do<00:01:04.650> not<00:01:04.769> have<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.040> use

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
lot safer as you do not have to use

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.310 
lot safer as you do not have to use
ladders<00:01:05.460> or<00:01:05.820> expensive<00:01:06.299> lifting<00:01:06.659> platforms

more<00:01:18.390> jobs<00:01:18.720> but<00:01:19.290> what<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.710> with<00:01:20.130> pure<00:01:20.400> water

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
more jobs but what is with pure water

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.010 
more jobs but what is with pure water
and<00:01:20.909> how<00:01:21.270> does<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.509> work

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
and how does it work

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.800 
and how does it work
as<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:23.009> name<00:01:23.189> already<00:01:23.220> suggests<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:24.360> just

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
as the name already suggests it's just

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.649 
as the name already suggests it's just
pure<00:01:25.170> water<00:01:25.939> usually<00:01:26.939> water<00:01:27.180> contains

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
pure water usually water contains

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.980 
pure water usually water contains
minerals<00:01:28.200> same<00:01:28.979> as<00:01:29.220> mineral<00:01:29.759> water<00:01:29.990> invisible

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
minerals same as mineral water invisible

minerals same as mineral water invisible
for<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.259> human<00:01:31.560> eye<00:01:31.680> but<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:32.700> see<00:01:32.939> it

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
for the human eye but you can see it

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.060 
for the human eye but you can see it
when<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.479> water<00:01:33.689> dries<00:01:34.079> for<00:01:34.650> example

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
when the water dries for example

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.520 
when the water dries for example
limestone<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.939> shower<00:01:36.180> or<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.570> your<00:01:37.290> water

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
limestone in the shower or on your water

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.420 
limestone in the shower or on your water
tap<00:01:38.329> the<00:01:39.329> idea<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.810> quite<00:01:39.960> simple<00:01:40.500> all<00:01:40.650> mineral

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
tap the idea is quite simple all mineral

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.130 
tap the idea is quite simple all mineral
should<00:01:41.700> be<00:01:41.850> removed<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.810> won't<00:01:42.990> have

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
should be removed and you won't have

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.620 
should be removed and you won't have
remnants<00:01:43.439> on<00:01:43.829> your<00:01:43.979> windows<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.640> there's

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
remnants on your windows and there's

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.780 
remnants on your windows and there's
more<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.140> than<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:47.040> removal<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.640> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
more to it than that the removal of the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.940 
more to it than that the removal of the
minerals<00:01:48.180> gets<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.810> water<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.229> an<00:01:49.380> unnatural

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
minerals gets the water in an unnatural

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.330 
minerals gets the water in an unnatural
status<00:01:50.659> therefore<00:01:51.659> water<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.829> searching<00:01:53.310> for

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
status therefore water is searching for

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.660 
status therefore water is searching for
minerals<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.030> attracts<00:01:54.450> dirt<00:01:54.750> like<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.049> magnet

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
minerals and attracts dirt like a magnet

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.760 
minerals and attracts dirt like a magnet
for<00:01:56.670> example<00:01:57.210> on<00:01:57.390> dirty<00:01:57.719> windows<00:01:58.140> pure<00:01:58.560> water

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
for example on dirty windows pure water

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.569 
for example on dirty windows pure water
removes<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.579> flushes<00:02:00.149> very<00:02:00.540> fast<00:02:01.189> the<00:02:02.189> result
