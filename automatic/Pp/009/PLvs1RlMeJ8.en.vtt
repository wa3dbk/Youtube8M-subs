00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.980
 ah 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.500
 hello that such friends today I bring you a 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.990
 analysis of what happened in the payment for 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.060
 be royal rumble which was full of 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.970
 discomfort and disagreement on the part of 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.950
 the fans the first fight was given 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.220
 in the pre-show the Rodés against 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.290
 the new ways outlaws after 14 years of 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.600
 road of jesse james and badass billy 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.120
 wilson again tac tensións of the 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.980
 world one of the great couples of the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.170
 Era's attitude returned to the top of the 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.670
 Division beating the Rhodes brothers 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.670
 in a fight that took place in the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.010
 kickoff of the event this fight was good 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.799
 but it could have been better since it was missing 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.420
 of time the fight that opened the event 

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:58.140
 it was the one of brai wyatt against daniel 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.119
 bojan the big surprise of the night if 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.949
 well the presence of daniel bryan is a 

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:04.049
 guarantee that a good fight will be seen 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.030
 Brai Wyatt served as perfect 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.070
 partner and complement to provide a 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.930
 show that will surely be in 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.810
 the lists of the best fights of 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.180
 2014 with a good rivalry to his 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.220
 back this encounter was highlighted by the 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.260
 unusual combination of styles between 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.230
 technique and agility of bryant and the little 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.390
 orthodox brawl the wild 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.070
 they gave their best and showed a 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.710
 great intensity constantly looking 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.170
 not only defeat your rival but 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.940
 hurt the leg attack brai 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.010
 and the blows to the head of bryant 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.050
 they were the common denominator in a fight 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.850
 that lifted the audience from their seat with 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.550
 several near face and a great chemistry 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.290
 between rivals so something 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.390
 amazing danielle bojan fell 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.130
 defeated before sister abigail while 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.190
 that dai turned his gaze towards a 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.390
 dam greater the second fight was between 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.510
 big show against the most 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.990
 overrated of the ufc brock lesnar the 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:59.300
 fight lasted 1 minute and 54 seconds two 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.220
 old rivals were two former 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.290
 world champions two of the 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.060
 most dominant fighters in history 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.660
 of the web and that was the duration of 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.670
 I find 1 minute and 54 seconds if the 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.800
 objective of the meeting was to leave brock 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.660
 Lesnar in a position heading domain 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.330
 to goals lehman already then failed 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.490
 resoundingly after being humiliated in 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.650
 a couple of times for the giant what 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.570
 fair and correct was to drive to Lesnar to 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.270
 a meeting where he will demonstrate his 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.490
 physical power and will close with a f5 or a 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.350
 kimura what use 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.390
 weapons only served to indicate that 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.710
 Lesnar was unable to beat beat show 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.590
 with his own hands 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.510
 in my opinion left much to be desired 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.760
 who had good rivalry but sources 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.950
 close they say that big show selected 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.810
 the hand that's why the brief fights this 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.550
 leaves the biggest athlete sunk 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.160
 of the world and it shows that they do not know what 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.190
 make those on the web with him the fight more 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.620
 disgusting of all was the fight 15,700 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.720
 between the children's lover with dinner and 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.630
 the rudest most spoiled delaware randy 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.520
 orton hahaha xd xd a pair of fighters 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.950
 that they have faced in countless 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.410
 occasions they did not offer something new and that 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.690
 it was clear tonight the wrong call more 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.940
 expected rematch of the story turned out 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.830
 be most of the time a typical 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.800
 combat between dinner and orton as has 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.000
 seen already in all kinds of modalities 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.800
 although in the last moments 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.480
 they increased the pace of the struggle and the 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.370
 exchange of finishers gave him 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.930
 emotion to the encounter this was not 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.820
 enough to meet the 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.910
 expectations that he intended to raise 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.290
 regarding this fight the intervention of 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.600
 the wydad family was a tool 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.670
 useful to leave well to dinner and 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.590
 perpetuate orton's reign 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.590
 I leave the distaste of a champion who does not 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.599
 can win without fighting help 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.450
 stellar was the real battle of 30 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:46.000
 men as in each edition of the royal 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.220
 rumble the returns and the surprises are 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.440
 the main dish win made a 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.660
 appearance with his corporate persona 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.190
 to try to stop acm punk in your 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.470
 Search Main Event Wells 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.900
 germany the Bulgarian beast alexander 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.630
 rouseff txt made his debut by the way 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.790
 attentive to this great wake dolph ziggler and 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.470
 we are returned from their injuries 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.140
 kevin nash also had an appearance 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.930
 special and jbl and el torito offered the 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.819
 fun moments of the night 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.920
 pitifully check in snack roberts not 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.019
 he had the opportunity to realize his coveted 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.650
 return to the royal rumble and as I know 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.600
 commented 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.120
 neither daniel gollan was part of the 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.800
 fight another point the large number of 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.300
 surprises tickets had like 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.370
 consequence that participation 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.370
 announced of several stars out 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.410
 canceled without any warning we all went 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.389
 witnesses of what happened in the royal 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.070
 rumble match central event of the 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.960
 billboard pay to see the royal 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.880
 rumble where the fans do not 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.449
 they were satisfied first with 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.490
 remain 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.379
 no longer participate in combat and 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.719
 second that the winner was batista 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:48.900
 which generated boos from the 

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:51.370
 crowd that was in the sand 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.620
 batista was angry and had a 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.059
 altercation with the fans making them bad 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.949
 gestures and some insults 

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:58.930
 he also made fun of danielle bojan 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.849
 these facts would not have liked anything 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.039
 to the water managers and they would be 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.809
 seriously reconsidering the plan of 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.020
 give him a push no matter what this 

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:09.639
 can affect a lehman bears and 30 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.319
 well in my opinion the event was a 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.270
 bit bad because it was predictable and 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:15.339
 monotonous and more because we did not see the 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.339
 return of hacker snacks roberts 

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:20.710
 rv de evan bourne 6 I said or some 

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:23.099
 another legend the good thing is that román rings 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.080
 Imposed new brand with 12 eliminated 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:29.759
