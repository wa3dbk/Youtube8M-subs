and<00:00:26.460> there's<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.210> power<00:00:27.420> vacuum<00:00:27.570> there<00:00:28.230> now

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
and there's a power vacuum there now

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.970 
and there's a power vacuum there now
sirrah<00:00:29.250> dill<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:30.210> big<00:00:30.539> prize<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:31.349> fertile

sirrah dill is a big prize a fertile

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.639 
sirrah dill is a big prize a fertile
heartland<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.420> continent<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.260> it's<00:00:34.469> also

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
the symbol of power over Tamriel in the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.440 
the symbol of power over Tamriel in the
white<00:00:38.129> gold<00:00:38.399> tower<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:39.030> has<00:00:39.120> been<00:00:39.329> the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
white gold tower that has been the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.209 
white gold tower that has been the
center<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.899> Empire<00:00:40.200> for<00:00:40.620> millennia<00:00:41.190> now

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
center of the Empire for millennia now

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.150 
center of the Empire for millennia now
so<00:00:41.850> three<00:00:42.329> alliances<00:00:42.629> all<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.920> their<00:00:44.129> own

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
so three alliances all have their own

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.209 
so three alliances all have their own
reasons<00:00:44.780> why<00:00:45.780> they<00:00:46.200> feel<00:00:46.530> like<00:00:46.559> they<00:00:47.010> should

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
reasons why they feel like they should

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.850 
reasons why they feel like they should
be<00:00:47.329> ruling<00:00:48.329> cyrodiil<00:00:49.020> but<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.530> fundamental

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
be ruling cyrodiil but the fundamental

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.490 
be ruling cyrodiil but the fundamental
reason<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.329> Empire<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.989> Sarah<00:00:52.260> dill

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
reason is that the Empire and Sarah dill

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.369 
reason is that the Empire and Sarah dill
and<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.920> family<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.730> nobles<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.750> farnes<00:00:55.170> that

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
and the family of nobles the farnes that

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.529 
and the family of nobles the farnes that
are<00:00:55.469> ruling<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.890> our<00:00:56.039> week<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.539> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
are ruling it our week and the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:09.220 
are ruling it our week and the
Alliance's<00:00:58.109> are<00:00:58.140> strong

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.230 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.290 

so<00:01:10.230> the<00:01:10.350> Empire<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.770> weak<00:01:11.010> but<00:01:11.640> their<00:01:11.910> leaders

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
so the Empire is weak but their leaders

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.710 
so the Empire is weak but their leaders
are<00:01:12.540> cunning<00:01:13.220> the<00:01:14.220> current<00:01:14.970> occupant<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.630> the
