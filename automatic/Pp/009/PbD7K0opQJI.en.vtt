00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.600
 Today is Sunday, June 23 

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:12.180
 The time is half past 9 am 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:15.990
 Along you want to medical care a little there following the yesterday 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:20.420
 Fuji is like this 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.420
 Because it is big, go up to the second floor 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.130
 Corde ready 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.130
 I want to get in 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.020
 Then there is a rose boat 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.910
 Because it is over 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.910
 Hana grounds the 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.100
 I want to be careful 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.489
 No good has fallen 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.660
 If you have time, do it for a moment 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.410
 I want to make a bud 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.410
 Goods like this 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:28.480
 Hey it's a hydrangea cutting tree 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.390
 I think you know a little bit everyone who does it, but let's introduce it 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.980
 It is there I think you 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:38.230
 Not the tip of the Nekokoko 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:42.420
 After all, I just need to water 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:48.030
 Do not with the anti-clean Kittoka and without sputtering 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.270
 I'm from this press I guess with this calculation scissors 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.750
 It is- 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.590
 Is a leaf 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.450
 Because this is that carbon assimilation 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.210
 If it goes through 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:07.740
 Dont just eyes 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:09.250
 But it is not often votes remains is when moisture from the bottom of the large to ordinary leaves evaporates 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.400
 Because I 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.190
 In this way, about one third of the version 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.090
 And savings savings 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.090
 I'm cutting it 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.239
 To in 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.830
 Say this 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:30.240
 Well it's something like chopsticks or something 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.240
 Canaan goes out 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.460
 It this earlier is 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.360
 To become confused 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:47.630
 Pedigree 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:50.740
 It does not soak up the water, so it's like this I 'm going to open a hole with a chopstick 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:55.620
 And put in this middle and high 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.620
 And I dye the surroundings slowly 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:04.110
 I agree 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:07.700
 About 50 percent of this is probably cut with this. 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.700
 I think easily 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.340
 So here you are 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.400
 Hey do you say Begonia 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.280
 This is a device as well 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:23.590
 Please cut it 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.950
 I wish I was Well this degree of flowers in I taken the bait to the bulls with in the nose 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.580
 The problem is 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.180
 There will not be 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.830
 Same spot light 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.490
 I opened the split shop and inserted it 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.490
 It is this 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:41.270
 Almost 100% month trout This is a very that 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:45.890
 The continuation rate is high 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:50.319
 Hey we are doing now in such a thing 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.319
 One hour after starting work 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.900
 finished 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.490
 This is lily's information 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.150
 Freight car g 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:03.110
 Anyway 3 is fine 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.110
 The has been with 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.750
 hey 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.680
 In a row 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:25.590
 Working together that I want you to cut still a 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.590
 All the slopes ako 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.990
 Fujino 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:38.800
 It is cutting of a branch 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.800
 State Is the order you do not know whether the work has been completed 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.480
 In the days of below 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:47.560
 I'm cutting it 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:53.680
 I think it will wither soon 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:57.560
 This is a bit hard for fans of donation from the other side 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:00.639
 I think that there is a waist of Kaori Minamibo 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.689
 Well all in the range 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:03.689
 I am 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.440
 It is such a situation 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.789
 Oh was the base Kasashi 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:34.460
 Hydrangea Tobei is later say 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:37.310
 I have not been there for a while 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:42.230
 About my week 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:45.790
 I think it will work well with such things as half-shade return 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.790
 Today is the end
