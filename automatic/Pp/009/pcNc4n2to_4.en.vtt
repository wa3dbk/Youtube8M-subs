00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
feather but you can even still do it and

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.300 
feather but you can even still do it and
my<00:00:23.220> advice<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:24.019> using<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.170> big<00:00:25.470> rod<00:00:25.740> curling

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
my advice is using a big rod curling

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.599 
my advice is using a big rod curling
iron<00:00:26.490> such<00:00:27.060> as<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:27.420> one<00:00:28.340> now<00:00:29.340> I'm<00:00:29.429> going<00:00:29.550> to

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
iron such as this one now I'm going to

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.640 
iron such as this one now I'm going to
take<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.849> couple<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.300> pieces<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.439> want<00:00:31.590> to

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650

take a couple of pieces and you want to
take<00:00:31.800> larger<00:00:32.340> pieces<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.940> don't<00:00:33.149> want<00:00:33.270> to

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
take larger pieces you don't want to

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.470 
take larger pieces you don't want to
take<00:00:33.480> small<00:00:33.809> pieces<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:36.050> the<00:00:37.050> trick<00:00:37.469> is

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
take small pieces and the trick is

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.520 
take small pieces and the trick is
making<00:00:39.480> sure<00:00:40.370> you<00:00:41.370> roll<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.879> back<00:00:42.780> towards<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
making sure you roll it back towards the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.770 
making sure you roll it back towards the
back<00:00:43.739> your<00:00:44.010> head<00:00:44.250> never<00:00:44.579> forward<00:00:45.300> that's<00:00:45.629> how

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
back your head never forward that's how

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.459 
back your head never forward that's how
you<00:00:45.899> get<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.230> feather<00:00:47.930> you<00:00:48.930> can<00:00:49.079> use<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> bit<00:00:49.440> of

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
you get the feather you can use a bit of

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:59.830 
you get the feather you can use a bit of
spray<00:00:49.890> if<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.190> want<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.550> hold<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:55.879> again

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
some volume it's going to separate the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.550 
some volume it's going to separate the
curl<00:01:48.840> into<00:01:49.320> more<00:01:50.040> Larry<00:01:50.490> wave<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:55.200> we'd

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
curl into more Larry wave and we'd

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.190 
curl into more Larry wave and we'd
continue<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:56.159> do<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.460> with<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.759> whole<00:01:57.200> side

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
of her head and then just to set it

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.539 
of her head and then just to set it
you're<00:02:01.740> going<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.890> use<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.070> bit<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.369> hairspray

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
to keep that feathered look and that's

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.689 
to keep that feathered look and that's
how<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.119> feather<00:02:06.420> hair
