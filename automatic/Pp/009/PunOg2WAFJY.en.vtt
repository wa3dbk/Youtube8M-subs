00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:07.950
 whether the sounded body of this violin golden 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.349
 Cufflinks Finger implants off 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.090
 metal or this glasses frame 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.790
 they all have one thing in common: plastic 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.980
 they are layer by layer in 3d 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.020
 Printers were created on the internet 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.510
 the next technical revolution 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.760
 that's what they are 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.710
 Simply determine the future of production 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.449
 if you have something on the pc that is for me 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.279
 also so developed has modeled 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.660
 Send it to the printer two more three 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.210
 hours I can because the machine 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.980
 Open up and the component of 3d printing 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.170
 is becoming more and more in our areas of life 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.550
 move in 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.309
 the leipziger petra wallasch 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.870
 opened in 2006 the world's first 3d 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.550
 Print shop on the internet 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.550
 your customers include designers 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.739
 architects construction and industrial companies because 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.710
 the advantage of a printed 3d model 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.780
 it has it has in hand you can 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.300
 It really does not just show the customer 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.140
 in the computer model so you can do it on the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.270
 set the table 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.309
 everyone can be just model 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.250
 Personalized self create what he does 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.320
 ulf teller has also come up with a creative idea 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.540
 from the thuringian city of arnstadt 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.659
 this service around his at the computer 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.920
 designed city ​​and architectural models 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.840
 to print in three dimensions 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.689
 because they are compared to the classical ones 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.729
 Models always to scale and extreme 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.890
 Precisely, we are exactly the form 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.110
 roof shapes are exactly reproducing each sitting 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.790
 where she has to sit and we are 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.600
 we have one much faster 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.549
 digital dataset have the man 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.700
 The pressure can be there 3d 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.229
 pressure there is then a square meter 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.479
 big city model within one 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.909
 week finished the basic principle is at 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.500
 Almost all 3d printer the same 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.390
 different starting materials such as 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.530
 plaster or plastic becomes the model 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.049
 Layer by layer 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.140
 For that you need a printable 3d 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.600
 file therefore becomes our first 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.659
 two-dimensional mdr logo on the computer 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.479
 a 3d model designed that this color 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.690
 3d printer then in 0.1 millimeters thick 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.580
 layer by piece build up it 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.270
 together with a scanned 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.120
 people in plaster bed disappears 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.100
 result is impressive 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.940
 even the smallest details like pants fold 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.650
 and facial features are clearly visible 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.540
 Details especially for hendrik möckel 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.519
 Crucial for six years 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.830
 produces detected 3d pressure 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.500
 Complex training models for doctors 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.860
 There is something in the world that you can touch 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.600
 where sometimes something can say or one 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.580
 can plan certain cuts and the 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.340
 also can perform directly on the 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.980
 model of the patients and more 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.400
 together with the hno doctor matthias hofer 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.690
 Does he have this model for operations in the 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.120
 paranasal sinus area developed with 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.600
 practice and plan the intervention of the physician 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.450
 can 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.209
 the model is so that the 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.400
 mucous membrane very very realistic that 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.989
 means I really have the feeling that 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.090
 me with the instrument at the 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.769
 mucous membrane arrived and also 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.540
 can remove parts of the mucous membrane like 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.489
 it is also necessary at the operation 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.110
 and then I can too 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.970
 bones or everything together with 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.030
 remove without me another 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.120
 has to muster the strength as I used to 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.190
 am there ration for matthias petzold is 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.510
 the 3d print is another building block 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.760
 the way to a global one 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.950
 economic changes in 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.140
 He runs the first remaining one 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.299
 a kind of high tech laboratory workshop 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.400
 Everyone can build tools there and 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.770
 develop a concept that worldwide 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.070
 more and more followers finds 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.960
 the idea is actually countries like 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.950
 India countries like China 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.660
 countries like or continents like africa 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.100
 that there arises a structure the people 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.780
 that means they can solve their problems 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.460
 could develop tool that creates 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.160
 just a detachment from these 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.670
 countries to halt all produce 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.590
 to supply the whole world with it 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.720
 that this form of self-sufficiency 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.510
 can show works markus kaiser 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.400
 with its solar 3d printer has only with 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.890
 solar energy and the sand of the desert 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.260
 he leaves objects in the middle of the Sahara 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.670
 arise 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.400
 the dutch architecture office 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.440
 universe architecture even wants this 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.610
 house in the countryside print with a 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.530
 gigantic concrete 3d printer the 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.540
 Technology is on the rise 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.410
 no future music anymore 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.410
 it remains exciting
