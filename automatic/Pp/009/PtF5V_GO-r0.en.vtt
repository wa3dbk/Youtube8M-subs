00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
like the back of this chair was my

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.900 
like the back of this chair was my
template<00:02:39.680> I<00:02:39.800> just<00:02:40.040> wrapped<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.490> yarn<00:02:40.520> around

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
template I just wrapped the yarn around

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.570 
template I just wrapped the yarn around
and<00:02:41.360> then<00:02:41.540> cut<00:02:41.870> one<00:02:42.110> piece<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:42.830> that's<00:02:43.370> what<00:02:43.550> I

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
and then cut one piece and that's what I

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.550 
and then cut one piece and that's what I
used<00:02:43.880> for<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.240> back<00:02:44.450> of<00:02:44.630> my<00:02:44.750> head<00:02:44.990> like<00:02:45.020> most

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
used for the back of my head like most

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.290 
used for the back of my head like most
of<00:02:45.710> my<00:02:45.740> head<00:02:45.980> I<00:02:46.010> used<00:02:46.370> those<00:02:46.490> pieces<00:02:46.940> but<00:02:47.120> then

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
of my head I used those pieces but then

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.700 
of my head I used those pieces but then
I<00:02:47.480> started<00:02:47.750> noticing<00:02:47.870> that<00:02:48.380> they<00:02:48.530> were<00:02:48.590> a

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
I started noticing that they were a

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.250 
I started noticing that they were a
little<00:02:48.920> bit<00:02:49.100> getting<00:02:50.030> shorter<00:02:50.720> than<00:02:51.080> what<00:02:51.230> I

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
little bit getting shorter than what I

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.310 
little bit getting shorter than what I
wanted<00:02:51.500> so<00:02:51.950> I<00:02:52.790> used<00:02:53.180> a<00:02:53.300> smaller<00:02:53.630> bundle<00:02:54.080> and<00:02:54.260> I

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
wanted so I used a smaller bundle and I

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.380 
wanted so I used a smaller bundle and I
cut<00:02:54.590> pieces<00:02:54.860> using<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.610> legs<00:02:55.820> of<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.120> chair

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
cut pieces using the legs of the chair

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.960 
cut pieces using the legs of the chair
and<00:02:56.600> I<00:02:56.690> just<00:02:56.990> used<00:02:57.230> two<00:02:57.470> legs<00:02:57.800> diagonal<00:02:58.790> from

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
and I just used two legs diagonal from

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.760 
and I just used two legs diagonal from
each<00:02:59.120> other<00:02:59.330> so<00:02:59.900> they<00:03:00.020> would<00:03:00.230> be<00:03:00.380> a<00:03:00.410> little<00:03:00.650> bit

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
each other so they would be a little bit

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.980 
each other so they would be a little bit
longer<00:03:01.010> and<00:03:01.310> that's<00:03:01.460> how<00:03:01.640> I<00:03:01.670> got<00:03:01.820> this<00:03:02.060> like

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
longer and that's how I got this like

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.780 
longer and that's how I got this like
Bob<00:03:03.380> shape<00:03:04.810> it's<00:03:05.810> like<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.110> same<00:03:06.350> in<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.580> back

your real hair is gonna be shorter than
what<00:03:40.430> it<00:03:40.520> is<00:03:40.580> because<00:03:40.940> it's<00:03:41.090> looped<00:03:41.390> around

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
what it is because it's looped around

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.290 
what it is because it's looped around
all<00:03:42.050> the<00:03:42.260> yarn<00:03:42.560> so<00:03:42.950> that<00:03:43.160> helped<00:03:43.640> sar<00:03:44.090> just

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
all the yarn so that helped sar just

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.300 
all the yarn so that helped sar just
make<00:03:44.480> sure<00:03:44.660> to<00:03:44.870> braid<00:03:45.110> below<00:03:45.710> my<00:03:45.920> real<00:03:46.130> hair

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
make sure to braid below my real hair

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.420 
make sure to braid below my real hair
because<00:03:46.610> you<00:03:46.700> do<00:03:46.880> have<00:03:46.910> to<00:03:47.210> burn<00:03:47.420> the<00:03:47.630> ends<00:03:48.430> so

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
because you do have to burn the ends so

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.370 
because you do have to burn the ends so
you<00:03:49.460> literally<00:03:50.120> just<00:03:50.510> cut<00:03:50.750> your<00:03:50.930> pieces<00:03:51.110> oh
