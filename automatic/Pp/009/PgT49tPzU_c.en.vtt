00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.160
 Hello everyone today to talk about this 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:12.660
 turning fixture to bite in 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.920
 In general, this whole is not always necessary for me 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.779
 there was such an urgent need 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:23.730
 have it done I fast enough it 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.369
 for 2 pm with what I had under 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:32.990
 by hand 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:32.990
 its simple principle is three videos 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:41.879
 120 degrees apart each 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.870
 I have a friend 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.870
 independent 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.840
 we press a detail each roller 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.640
 himself they are not connected to each other 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.730
 that is, it finds its place 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:11.270
 pressed by the spring 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:13.790
 each clip is a verso system 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.500
 closet 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.360
 But the plates on which they are 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:26.600
 fasten this six I had a piece 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:34.050
 sanded plastic i'll cut they walk 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:36.500
 plates are fixed at one point as per 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.500
 radius 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:52.850
 initial position set as far as it will go 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:56.000
 everyone is free to insert a detail here 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:04.490
 insert this unit on the machine on the bed 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.490
 release and clamp 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.840
 I'll show now on the machine how it will be 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.840
 to look like 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:19.950
 so here I read flow 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:24.689
 pre- gang machined 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:36.799
 the most important thing for the center 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:39.500
 move the site there are no videos feed 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:44.930
 necks 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:52.129
 fasten the brunette move the center 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:52.129
 we press let the rollers 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.480
 delaying 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.510
 we can no longer need everything in the center 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:12.650
 process 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:12.650
 butt inside will be clamped and 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:31.110
 that's how it will look like housing 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.110
 man pressed 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.800
 turn on 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:56.230
 videos of course I will eat here 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:04:01.420
 groove here therefore from time to time 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:05.650
 you just need to let go of one clamp 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.160
 one roller if the spring is enough 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.040
 are strong 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:15.390
 you can not push it herself when to achieve and 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:15.390
 tighten again and work again 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.289
 a better option would probably be 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:30.120
 use bearings instead of rollers 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:32.599
 for this you need turning than 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.669
 good independent suspension system 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:38.690
 roller in the fact that there is no need 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:43.220
 great deliver people for sure 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:47.580
 significantly the central axis of the machine and 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:55.009
 videos themselves will find a place and press 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:55.009
 the detail is good on this all 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.430
 good luck to you all
