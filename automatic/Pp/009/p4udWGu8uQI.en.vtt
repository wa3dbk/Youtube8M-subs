design<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.570> as<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.350> can<00:02:04.469> see<00:02:04.649> compared<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.399> lot

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
design and as you can see compared a lot

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.219 
design and as you can see compared a lot
of<00:02:05.640> Boggy<00:02:05.850> cases<00:02:06.360> on<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.570> market<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.200> very

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
of Boggy cases on the market it is very

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.180 
of Boggy cases on the market it is very
slim<00:02:08.569> which<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.720> probably<00:02:10.110> why<00:02:10.379> there<00:02:10.979> isn't

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
slim which is probably why there isn't

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.130 
slim which is probably why there isn't
the<00:02:11.790> card<00:02:12.060> slot<00:02:12.239> in<00:02:12.540> there

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
the card slot in there

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.570 
the card slot in there
so<00:02:13.980> overall<00:02:14.370> for<00:02:14.520> functionality<00:02:16.250> it's<00:02:17.250> very

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
so overall for functionality it's very

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.230 
so overall for functionality it's very
good<00:02:17.880> quality<00:02:19.160> I<00:02:20.160> don't<00:02:20.490> suppose<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.150> would

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
good quality I don't suppose you would

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.060 
good quality I don't suppose you would
find<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.630> better<00:02:22.260> leather<00:02:22.530> case<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:22.950> the

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
find a better leather case and the

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.950 
find a better leather case and the
markets<00:02:23.430> really<00:02:23.790> really<00:02:24.030> nice<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.420> I

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
markets really really nice and I

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.840 
markets really really nice and I
particularly<00:02:25.320> like<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.830> design<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.610> Bulls

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
particularly like the design the Bulls

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.850 
particularly like the design the Bulls
had<00:02:27.090> in<00:02:27.210> the<00:02:27.270> Louisville<00:02:27.560> certainly<00:02:28.560> stands

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
had in the Louisville certainly stands

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.180 
had in the Louisville certainly stands
out<00:02:29.130> since<00:02:29.970> I've<00:02:30.120> had<00:02:30.240> this<00:02:30.420> case<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:31.500> lot<00:02:32.100> of
