00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
classic infrared color way we got the

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.779 
classic infrared color way we got the
white<00:00:27.119> mesh<00:00:27.420> right<00:00:27.720> here<00:00:28.310> and<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.400> runs<00:00:29.580> along

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
then we have some infrared on the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.479 
then we have some infrared on the
eyelets<00:00:48.320> around<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.440> air<00:00:49.590> pocket<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.280> right

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
eyelets around the air pocket and right

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.880 
eyelets around the air pocket and right
there<00:00:50.670> which<00:00:50.789> those<00:00:51.000> air<00:00:51.180> max<00:00:51.530> has<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.680> on<00:00:52.770> the
