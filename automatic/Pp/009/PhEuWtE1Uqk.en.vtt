00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.480
 I'm going to use these injection ampoules for 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.030
 To show you how it works is ours. 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.769
 respiratory system we have is the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.450
 lung you already know right? 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.619
 but we have a muscle down here 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.230
 some people also call it 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.920
 membrane that is called the diaphragm 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.260
 just below the external what is this 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.260
 another where the rib bones come together and 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.840
 The function of this since day of frag is to make 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.699
 with which the air is sent the warrant to 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.790
 inside the instrument with 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:38.540
 it works more or less like the plunger 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.950
 this happens as follows: 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.899
 when you are breathing properly 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.969
 Normal quiet without touching you're with 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.890
 all quiet respiratory system 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.629
 You 're not forcing anything ok. 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.000
 when you play you will need a 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.010
 little more air and you will need the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.030
 support the diaphragm to touch what 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.800
 happens 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.960
 the correct way to do it is as follows 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.270
 when you inhale or when you 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.930
 brings the air out into your 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.359
 body 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.240
 the diaphragm and needs to exit the 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.960
 rest and descend into your womb 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.790
 ok when it goes down it opens up more space 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.340
 in your chest and makes you 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.290
 absorb a greater amount of 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.420
 air and from there you will 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.530
 cause the air to be released to 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.750
 inside the instrument with more 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.450
 Tranquility It Works Exactly 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.869
 that way you're seeing well 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.080
 the diaphragm plunger for pushing air 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.659
 ok inside the instrument and the diaphragm 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.770
 It helps to cause the air to be sent 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.470
 a control 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.329
 you often pull the air or inspire 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.430
 in you watch that it is important 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.229
 you always do by the mouth when you 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.840
 is breathing normally in your life 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.899
 daily respect of the process is normal 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.520
 and breathe in through your nose and exhale through the 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.290
 mouth but when you 're playing it's 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.090
 It is important for you to do both 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.549
 by mouth due to the greater amount 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.280
 and because of the greater ease of 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.070
 A okay absorption and the diaphragm it goes 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.049
 function exactly as an instrument 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.540
 that will help you control the 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.750
 emission of air into your body is 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.910
 It is extremely important that you 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.870
 occupy in making the air out of shape 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.150
 controlled 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.730
 I'll give you an example already happened 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.450
 You climb a ladder and so you 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.849
 finished it 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.010
 Did you feel the calf hurt a 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.190
 little what happens 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.680
 You do not have the habit of going up the stairs and 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.840
 he had to saturate his muscle a bit and 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.030
 he felt then what I'm going to do with 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.980
 you to make you feel the force 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.380
 the diaphragm to work in a 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.599
 little harder and he will feel if 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.200
 You'll feel the diaphragm okay then it was 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:45.299
 do the following to inspire or 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.180
 bring air into your body with 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:51.150
 hand navel okay and pay attention to one 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.519
 detail your shoulders can not rise and 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.799
 your chest can not go up either 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.510
 many people think this is a sign that 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.010
 You 're breathing very well then. 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.829
 take a deep breath 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.319
 So you get all big, yes, but in the 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.150
 You did not really breathe 30% of your 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.040
 respiratory capacity when you 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.290
 absorb the air you need to send here 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.940
 down it a cup being full it 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.890
 on the middle shaft 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.319
 take a glass and put water on it 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.120
 begins to fill from bottom to top not 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.959
 It's true then you're going to put a 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.569
 little hand 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.180
 here at the height of your navel and will pull 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.190
 the air or breathe through the mouth 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.630
 possible to push your hand over the 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.630
 process is more or less that looks 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.420
 done this you will feel that your whole 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.819
 abdominal region is full of air you go 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.470
 feel that the wall hockey 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.829
 This is a sign that you are full of 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.569
 air 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:50.400
 You 're going to release this very slowly. 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:52.470
 You'll feel the wall 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.480
 decreases or is 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.100
 natural area is coming out 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.600
 if you repeat this exercise some 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.540
 times in a little bit 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.299
 You'll start to feel the diaphragm already. 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.230
 and inside if you feel the diaphragm is 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.760
 sign that you are working 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.410
 correctly ok 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.599
 another very cool tip is very 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.819
 simple is based on this same exercise 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.910
 only you will not let the air out 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.989
 You'll fill and hold for 15 10 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.510
 seconds ok 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:23.150
 the process is the same hand at the time of 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.150
 navel inspires by mouth and locks 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.270
 locked 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.010
 You'll let go of it a little. 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.110
 drop everything at once if you repeat 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.070
 a few more times you will feel the 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.200
 diaphragm 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.440
 if you did not feel anything at all 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.000
 diaphragm is a sign that you may not 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.290
 be doing it right 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.030
 I would like to give you a tip too. 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.010
 When are you studying this type? 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.490
 you may have a little bit of exercise. 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:53.490
 of headache or you can is feeling 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.560
 a little dizziness to take a 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.990
 Soda juice will take a spin on the 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.360
 square holds a little wave after 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.530
 You go back to work because it's a sign of 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.180
 that there is oxygen in the action of your body 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.610
 is changed and you need to establish 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.440
 a limit is healthy for this okay 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.970
 doing this you will return to 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.010
 normality until recently 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.510
 Just think about it and then we 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.430
 let's use this type of exercise in the 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.320
 saxophone and I have absolute conviction 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.590
 what will help you a lot? 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.590
 thanks
