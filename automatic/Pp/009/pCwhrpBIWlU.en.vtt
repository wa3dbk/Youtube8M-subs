00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.570
 hello everyone is steven and like you 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.490
 saw it in the title of this video 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.950
 today I give you five good 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.059
 reasons to buy the pelloche then 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.190
 as I told you in the test 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.330
 complete at the moment there is no 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.699
 really particular reason 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.740
 to buy a connected watch that this 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.500
 either that of samsung motorola or 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.789
 of apple we still do not really know too much 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.859
 what's the point and it's far from 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.390
 indispensable but if you hold when 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.009
 even really to buy one 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.410
 well i will give you five good 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.880
 reasons to choose that of apple 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.469
 firstly the finish as 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.020
 usually with a little long to a product 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.790
 Superb the crown to handle 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.950
 the interface reacts perfectly 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.260
 we can manipulate it by dragging 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.489
 the finger on it and not necessarily in pine 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.680
 are two fingers apart as we could have 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.750
 fear the touch seen also is 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.360
 really good and we also have a screen 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.090
 retina do not see pixels at all 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.770
 and I find it really pretty the model 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.289
 Mid-range is superb 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.510
 the gold edition polo even more 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.670
 obviously but it is by the model 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.950
 sport that I really was surprised even 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.150
 impressed is the one I wear 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.040
 it's the one I showed you in 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.540
 unpacking in the test all that 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.640
 the bracelet is really nice to 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.680
 wear and for an entry-level the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.299
 quality is the second good reason to 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.220
 choose the lawn that really has very 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.110
 well been thought unlike some 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.270
 show under android that are round 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.400
 apple has thought very well of hers with 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.439
 a shape more adapt the interface 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.939
 from android ware is not at all suitable for 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.509
 this form while on the apple ocz 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.490
 it's the ideal 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.630
 it may seem a little detail but I 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.920
 assure you that it can really be 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.320
 important depending on the applications 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.720
 we use third good reason 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.400
 it's his perfect connection with a bone 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.049
 and the iphone it's true that you can 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.759
 use other connected mode with 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.470
 your iphone and you will not have the same 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.329
 experience with loach skin that is 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.640
 a real extension of your iphone 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.189
 you will really have the same content in 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.200
 miniature on your fourth wrist 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.450
 good reason applications are already 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.430
 ready and many more are coming or 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.590
 applications only dedicated to the 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.880
 lawn thought for her 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.409
 remember when you leave the 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.170
 first iphone and the years that have 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.060
 followed the great richness of the app store 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.319
 was a big force of apple and well 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.970
 this year with the lawn one can 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.200
 expect the same thing 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.030
 we can bet that it will be the same thing 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.890
 with the lawn for which full 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.420
 applications are already available and 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.430
 have been specially thought for the 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.770
 new apple connected watch i 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.610
 find it really important look at me 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.740
 shows you some demonstrations 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.760
 of applications that already works with 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.800
 at the time of the release 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.390
 if you want to buy the lawn if 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.620
 you still have fears about 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.780
 the apps that will already be 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.370
 compatible I really reassure you on 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.190
 the subject there is already quite a lot 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.990
 number 5 I'll finish with the big 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.180
 possibility of customization 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.770
 we forget it often but it's really 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.490
 something very appreciable with 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.770
 the apple watch 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.750
 already there are three ranges available so 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.090
 the sport lawn the classic and the 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.680
 gold edition and whenever you 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.420
 have lots of different bracelet that 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.709
 are selectable adjustable to the 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.370
 shows according to those you 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.380
 will have chosen 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.810
 bracelets of different colors 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.610
 different materials so in the end the 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.770
 combinations are really very 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.600
 many in addition it is relatively 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.850
 simple to change oneself the brew of 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.410
 the pellet unlike the iphone where 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.480
 everyone has the same you can 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.680
 to have a truly personalized approach 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.080
 with all possible combinations 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.150
 which makes the watch connect the 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.320
 more customizable so far and that 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.150
 it's pretty cool 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.739
 so here are the 5 good reasons that 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.450
 I had to give you to give you 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.070
 finally want to buy the lawn if 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.650
 you hesitate between connected watch or 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.239
 another so you will have seen it really 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.560
 nothing grandiose nothing 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.340
 of impressive in all that I 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.900
 just told you here 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.150
 but hey it's a bit the same case for 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.040
 all connected worlds So here 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.170
 Give me your opinion on that what 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.489
 what do you think of the plush and 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.290
 if you are not convinced I 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.000
 also offers you another video five 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.830
 good reasons not to buy the 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.060
 stuffed or I will put you the link just 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.250

 want to look at this is the same type 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.700
