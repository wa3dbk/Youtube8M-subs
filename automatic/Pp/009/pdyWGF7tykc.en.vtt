00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:16.709
 chew on the next tube do not take into account 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:20.060
 relentlessly for hawai campos 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.400
 a little bit all the time 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.279
 and we open our arms to the accounts 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.909
 That day 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:29.999
 and in network and bravo 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:33.210
 here is the efficiency of an aunt slightly ahead 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.880
 I see myself all 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.420
 it's perfect hervÃ© 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.850
 it's perfect for 20 years when we open the sail we can take it back 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.850
 always succeeds 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.510
 run a little bit 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.680
 look good very well 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.680
 we open the way 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.780
 vl its own 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.920
 prot how then of solar storms 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.350
 and then we go back slightly, that's how we always look ahead 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.390
 to have everything here is hockey very well we open the way 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.390
 and how we may need to look in front of you 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.160
 in vain a little command 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.890
 look in front of you 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.990
 just right 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.880
 no more no 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.850
 look 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.970
 and very well to act out 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.979
 that's why so the public square 11 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.700
 brest has forced one goes back slightly 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.700
 the hand if necessary but comparing heroes to sailing 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.810
 and in fact I think the earth is not shaking 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:21.119
 it's very clean the penultimate for 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:25.869
 maybe a little bit of pending orders 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:28.909
 first to take because well the position harness 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.059
 in which case still had to make a U-turn before others 

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:34.179
 metals 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.729
 they should have put a few more orders rather than that 

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:39.729
 would open the shop rather the look of the celestial position 

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:44.779
 we would think that the risers with the elbow look well legs crossed to 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:47.779
 watch when you want 

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:52.829
 a little further to the euro not too much I watch wind turns 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.669
 for the time failed to order 

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:59.779
 here we find a role 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:04.650
 normally you always drove from cottage 1 half turn to three quarters of 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:07.699
 turn side open because your way little bit of too much then 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:10.859
 without a club on time because we can return the order when you die 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:16.959
 we see the sail shop 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.230
 at least when we get back in the direction of landing by the 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.119
 right 

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:22.729
 we will do with the command is not bad at all but does not move in your 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:24.129
 hot seat 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:26.419
 albert a control 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:29.419
 p bouderbala order maintenance 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:36.019
 that's where it always ends up stabilizing with a smile sailing 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.510
 in progress wait the resource was used to amplify wait wait 

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:48.519
 wait now I fill 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.519
 progressive and I release hookups you see the difference 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:54.739
 when you wait for the water resource 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.359
 and progressive 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.389
 here I leave you the wind to finish the tent where m 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.459
 who is she a chouÃ¯a will be to leave when you want 

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:15.249
 look ahead 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:19.349
 very well we let go a little bit 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.939
 for the victory a little bit 

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:23.610
 still we do 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.479
 internet 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.909
 for the closed roof 

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:29.779
 support a little 

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:32.809
 called closed side 

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:35.809
 fudged attention a little bit 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.740
 Thursday, Ouch, do not have a lot of speed 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.340
 and we now have to understand 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.050
 we loose a little control 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.439
 he warns the upper body to fight 

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:50.659
 this is just the basin very well 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:53.659
 in short, see their debt 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.550
 going 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:04.069
 the three occupants of the floor 

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:08.339
 do not go there 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.900
 go to class 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:16.699
 when we relax a little bit the basin we look in front 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.479
 perfect 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:21.879
 for apple 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:24.180
 for gliding 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.669
 carrefour jeunesse-emploi crs we add to that steven defour 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.490
 your global place 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.430
 m 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:49.349
 ok when she takes the turn we will show 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:00.169
 it's not bad at all we only have to sail in turns 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:02.879
 pre-orders the shareholders 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:04.009
 but beware 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:06.080
 the consob raplapla 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.210
 control 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.210
 light and starting soon 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:12.190
 okay 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.990
 very very deep 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.990
 so you had me 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:22.419
 we will know 

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:26.409
 it is a bit early 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:29.409
 you have a second opportunity now 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.879
 and let it flow 

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:35.879
 it's perfect 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.330
 this title a little outside the canvas 

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:53.189
 vedran runje keeps well armed he is rusty closing 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.819
 ok we are in autorotation 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:07:01.449
 the pair of flip-flops the camera allows 2-one meetings with local tony clubs 

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:05.749
 not yet very well 

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:10.429
 it's very good lille is that the hostage look of bordeaux monopolizes big 

00:07:10.429 --> 00:07:12.369
 names of the sail 

00:07:12.369 --> 00:07:15.369
 not at all 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:19.479
 chew on their size too late a little bit maybe to counter to 

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:21.979
 put in the harness I do not know 

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:24.979
 I believe that the key on the same side in some free time 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.830
 toc and let go right away his hold to lock allows him 

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:33.959
 stone locked the agreement enters into autorotation 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.110
 the land so be careful of tour we do not understand the canucks 

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.120
 we release the control of the balloon we look in front of it could open the 

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.490
 milky way in republic
