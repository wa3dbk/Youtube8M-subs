00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.629

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.640
 ship in season 2 and is called 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.230
 actually ship the love German 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.780
 and English combined sometimes 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.269
 a bit more difficult than works today 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:57.420
 again with me basic body strength cd 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:01:00.269
 Hanover with the baron your head the 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.670
 Jesus sees it from the head 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.409
 and I would say let pizza on 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.840
 best we speak at least you 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.210
 to begin 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.630
 no here to tell 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.580
 This ship has for what is the 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.470
 is the gaping wound that 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.900
 bleeding says to say I want 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.070
 First of all, anticipate that to me 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.290
 it is obvious that 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.290
 adolf hitler here his fingers in the game 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:50.340
 I think something went wrong here 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:55.590
 so far a VIP guest okay then back 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.440
 where is my day this is the fresh air 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.320
 that's where air meets paper 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.540
 what do we do then at monster waves 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.700
 Drown again in the cabin 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:11.430
 underwear times machine the ship 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:15.019
 I do not drive because yes so the 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.709
 Realism if I have such a one 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.709
 damn shit 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.360
 but expect the water at least 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.840
 streams in for an action-packed experience 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.850
 to have 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.770
 but no this 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:56.600
 then of course nothing on the 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:58.490
 what should i get there 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.080
 I, of course , make a comment 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.170
 I have to say this is here 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.330
 something went wrong with world hit 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.770
 and secondly, I think I am the best 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:13.040
 continue to have any comments 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.540
 So I mean, who starts here big of 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.040
 To praise heaven is I think so 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.580
 to make a channel of it anymore 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.980
 Robin must be serious now 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:29.390
 also did not let spend when we 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:30.430
 not our friends away from you 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.660
 with the fire 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.190
 but I wanted to notice a bit 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.750
 because it's about lightening up 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.910
 Campfires will still be empty 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.400
 that is always as much as getting up 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.890
 remain objective and fair and so 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.570
 factually there is a thing to me 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:59.150
 like the bridge 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:04:04.790
 Well, okay, but the rest is mine 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:06.620
 There's something to say or see you up 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.100

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.970
 even still tidy are fire 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.970
 I would say video then 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:26.490
 a psychiatric emergency services pizza oli 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.590
 the friend comes home 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.479

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.479
