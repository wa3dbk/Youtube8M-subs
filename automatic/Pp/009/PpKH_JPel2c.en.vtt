goo<00:04:36.990> I<00:04:37.409> guess<00:04:37.800> um<00:04:38.520> in<00:04:38.939> my<00:04:39.000> little<00:04:39.360> mixing<00:04:39.930> thing

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
goo I guess um in my little mixing thing

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.459 
goo I guess um in my little mixing thing
but<00:04:42.449> I<00:04:42.479> guess<00:04:42.780> it's<00:04:42.960> because<00:04:43.050> I<00:04:43.259> call

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:43.469 
but I guess it's because I call

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:45.860 
but I guess it's because I call
recursively<00:04:43.889> um<00:04:44.310> colour<00:04:44.819> toner<00:04:45.090> I<00:04:45.210> used<00:04:45.419> but

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
recursively um colour toner I used but

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.089 
recursively um colour toner I used but
anyways<00:04:46.229> I<00:04:46.500> put<00:04:46.919> my<00:04:47.009> gloves<00:04:47.250> on<00:04:47.460> and<00:04:47.699> honey

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099 
anyways I put my gloves on and honey
