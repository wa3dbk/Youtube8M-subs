00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.429 
racing blade it's designed out of Kevlar
and<00:00:27.490> carbon<00:00:28.000> it<00:00:28.210> has<00:00:28.630> different<00:00:28.869> flex

and carbon it has different flex
coefficients<00:00:30.279> in<00:00:30.400> it<00:00:30.550> that<00:00:30.730> we're<00:00:30.849> trying<00:00:31.150> to

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:31.269 
coefficients in it that we're trying to

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:32.580 
coefficients in it that we're trying to
accomplish<00:00:31.480> and<00:00:31.900> what<00:00:31.929> we're<00:00:32.140> trying<00:00:32.290> to<00:00:32.410> do

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
accomplish and what we're trying to do

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.950 
accomplish and what we're trying to do
is<00:00:32.770> that<00:00:32.980> what<00:00:33.430> we've<00:00:33.610> learned<00:00:33.940> from<00:00:34.270> our<00:00:34.720> team

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
is that what we've learned from our team

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.800 
is that what we've learned from our team
riders<00:00:35.500> and<00:00:35.770> people<00:00:36.070> that<00:00:36.190> race<00:00:36.430> a<00:00:36.460> lot<00:00:36.810> is

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:37.810 
riders and people that race a lot is

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.610 
riders and people that race a lot is
that<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:40.090> blade<00:00:40.390> is<00:00:40.600> very<00:00:40.930> very<00:00:41.140> important

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
that the blade is very very important

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.110 
that the blade is very very important
and<00:00:41.680> we<00:00:41.770> know<00:00:41.920> this<00:00:42.070> from<00:00:42.130> our<00:00:42.460> canoe<00:00:42.700> racing

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
and we know this from our canoe racing

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.390 
and we know this from our canoe racing
how<00:00:43.690> important<00:00:44.170> it<00:00:44.260> is<00:00:44.290> but<00:00:44.440> again<00:00:44.950> we're<00:00:45.190> at<00:00:45.370> a

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
how important it is but again we're at a

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.670 
how important it is but again we're at a
different<00:00:45.910> we're<00:00:46.540> standing<00:00:47.080> so<00:00:47.260> our<00:00:47.380> center

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
different we're standing so our center

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.530 
different we're standing so our center
of<00:00:47.740> gravity<00:00:48.130> is<00:00:48.160> much<00:00:48.430> higher<00:00:48.640> leverage<00:00:49.210> point

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
of gravity is much higher leverage point

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.410 
of gravity is much higher leverage point
is<00:00:49.690> much<00:00:49.870> higher<00:00:50.050> so<00:00:50.740> when<00:00:51.430> you<00:00:51.640> take<00:00:51.940> a<00:00:51.970> stroke

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
is much higher so when you take a stroke

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.290 
is much higher so when you take a stroke
with<00:00:52.840> a<00:00:52.870> blade<00:00:53.320> of<00:00:53.680> a<00:00:53.800> normal<00:00:54.460> blade<00:00:54.880> through

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
with a blade of a normal blade through

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.300 
with a blade of a normal blade through
the<00:00:55.450> water<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.980> catch<00:00:57.340> is<00:00:57.790> very<00:00:58.300> strong<00:00:59.310> stick

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.310 
the water the catch is very strong stick

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.950 
the water the catch is very strong stick
blades<00:01:00.670> even<00:01:01.180> are<00:01:01.300> very<00:01:01.960> step<00:01:02.320> thing<00:01:03.269> so<00:01:04.269> when

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
blades even are very step thing so when

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.499 
blades even are very step thing so when
you<00:01:05.110> catch<00:01:05.470> in<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:05.950> water<00:01:06.189> it<00:01:06.700> grabs<00:01:07.119> right

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
you catch in the water it grabs right

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:09.990 
you catch in the water it grabs right
away<00:01:07.840> what<00:01:08.710> happens<00:01:09.070> it<00:01:09.219> has<00:01:09.429> a<00:01:09.460> tendency<00:01:09.729> to

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
away what happens it has a tendency to

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.090 
away what happens it has a tendency to
pull<00:01:10.390> your<00:01:10.600> body<00:01:10.840> for<00:01:11.469> the<00:01:11.530> blade<00:01:11.829> because

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
pull your body for the blade because

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.419 
pull your body for the blade because
you're<00:01:12.340> forcing<00:01:12.759> the<00:01:13.450> catch<00:01:13.719> and<00:01:14.380> just<00:01:15.159> that

00:01:15.419 --> 00:01:15.429 
you're forcing the catch and just that

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:18.270 
you're forcing the catch and just that
pressure<00:01:16.020> as<00:01:17.020> you<00:01:17.259> know<00:01:17.439> trying<00:01:18.009> to<00:01:18.130> serve

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
pressure as you know trying to serve

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.919 
pressure as you know trying to serve
bumps<00:01:18.640> and<00:01:18.789> stuff<00:01:18.880> you<00:01:19.179> want<00:01:19.390> to<00:01:19.570> be<00:01:19.689> really

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
bumps and stuff you want to be really

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:22.200 
bumps and stuff you want to be really
smooth<00:01:20.350> and<00:01:20.740> technical<00:01:21.700> through<00:01:21.909> the<00:01:21.999> water

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
smooth and technical through the water

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.480 
smooth and technical through the water
so<00:01:22.539> if<00:01:22.960> you<00:01:23.170> have<00:01:23.350> to<00:01:23.469> pressure<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:23.979> front<00:01:24.280> too

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
so if you have to pressure the front too

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.550 
so if you have to pressure the front too
much<00:01:24.700> you'll<00:01:24.969> compress<00:01:25.600> so<00:01:26.259> what<00:01:26.380> we're

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
much you'll compress so what we're

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.770 
much you'll compress so what we're
trying<00:01:26.590> to<00:01:26.829> do<00:01:26.979> is<00:01:27.159> lighten<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:28.149> catch<00:01:28.450> it's

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
trying to do is lighten the catch it's

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.109 
trying to do is lighten the catch it's
called<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.140> catch<00:01:29.439> where<00:01:29.799> the<00:01:29.920> blade<00:01:30.159> enters

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
called the catch where the blade enters

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.209 
called the catch where the blade enters
the<00:01:31.329> water<00:01:31.539> but<00:01:32.109> as<00:01:32.289> it<00:01:32.469> comes<00:01:32.740> through<00:01:32.859> the

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:33.219 
the water but as it comes through the

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:35.550 
the water but as it comes through the
power<00:01:33.460> phase<00:01:33.909> you<00:01:34.509> want<00:01:34.689> the<00:01:34.840> blade<00:01:35.079> to<00:01:35.289> power

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
power phase you want the blade to power

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.679 
power phase you want the blade to power
up<00:01:35.859> even<00:01:36.219> stronger<00:01:36.609> as<00:01:36.939> you<00:01:37.060> get<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:37.450> point

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
up even stronger as you get to the point

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:40.139 
up even stronger as you get to the point
where<00:01:37.960> you're<00:01:38.109> more<00:01:38.609> balanced<00:01:39.609> and<00:01:39.759> coming

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
where you're more balanced and coming

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:42.209 
where you're more balanced and coming
through<00:01:40.420> the<00:01:40.600> stroke<00:01:40.929> you<00:01:41.530> want<00:01:41.740> to<00:01:41.859> be<00:01:41.979> more

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:42.219 
through the stroke you want to be more

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:44.760 
through the stroke you want to be more
balanced<00:01:42.789> as<00:01:43.630> you<00:01:43.899> come<00:01:44.140> through<00:01:44.170> right<00:01:44.710> here

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
balanced as you come through right here

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.520 
balanced as you come through right here
is<00:01:45.130> where<00:01:45.159> the<00:01:46.119> main<00:01:46.359> power<00:01:46.689> face<00:01:47.020> starts<00:01:47.469> to

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
is where the main power face starts to

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.099 
is where the main power face starts to
take<00:01:47.740> place<00:01:48.039> so<00:01:48.759> what<00:01:48.939> we've<00:01:49.119> done<00:01:49.149> is<00:01:49.659> we've

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:50.109 
take place so what we've done is we've

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:52.889 
take place so what we've done is we've
designed<00:01:50.319> F<00:01:50.770> actually<00:01:51.579> a<00:01:51.609> three-stage<00:01:52.299> paddle

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
designed F actually a three-stage paddle

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.050 
designed F actually a three-stage paddle
here<00:01:53.139> and<00:01:53.469> what<00:01:53.770> happens<00:01:54.159> is<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.460> first<00:01:54.759> stage

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
here and what happens is the first stage

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.219 
here and what happens is the first stage
is<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:55.600> catch<00:01:55.869> and<00:01:56.609> on<00:01:57.609> the<00:01:58.030> catch<00:01:58.329> you<00:01:58.990> want

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
is the catch and on the catch you want

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.190 
is the catch and on the catch you want
it<00:01:59.350> you<00:01:59.649> want<00:01:59.799> the<00:02:00.039> blade<00:02:00.340> to<00:02:00.789> to<00:02:01.600> feel<00:02:01.990> the

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
it you want the blade to to feel the

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.649 
it you want the blade to to feel the
water<00:02:02.409> and<00:02:02.829> take<00:02:03.310> hold<00:02:03.639> of<00:02:03.789> it<00:02:03.969> if<00:02:04.240> it's<00:02:04.420> too

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
water and take hold of it if it's too

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.270 
water and take hold of it if it's too
powerful<00:02:04.869> through<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.679> water<00:02:05.889> it<00:02:06.159> will

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
powerful through the water it will

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.150 
powerful through the water it will
create<00:02:06.579> a<00:02:06.670> hole<00:02:06.969> or<00:02:07.270> almost<00:02:08.080> like<00:02:08.380> burning<00:02:08.979> out

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
create a hole or almost like burning out

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.700 
create a hole or almost like burning out
on<00:02:09.399> a<00:02:09.459> car<00:02:09.880> and<00:02:10.330> what<00:02:10.990> we're<00:02:11.200> trying<00:02:11.380> to<00:02:11.470> do<00:02:11.620> is

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
on a car and what we're trying to do is

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:12.930 
on a car and what we're trying to do is
we're<00:02:11.830> trying<00:02:11.950> to<00:02:12.100> set<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.340> blade<00:02:12.640> and<00:02:12.670> pull

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
we're trying to set the blade and pull

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.860 
we're trying to set the blade and pull
it<00:02:12.970> through<00:02:13.210> so<00:02:13.750> but<00:02:14.410> we<00:02:14.530> just

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
it through so but we just

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.899 
it through so but we just
as<00:02:14.989> we<00:02:15.140> designed<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.590> blade<00:02:15.890> that<00:02:15.920> actually<00:02:16.640> the

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
as we designed a blade that actually the

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:21.750 
as we designed a blade that actually the
tip<00:02:17.019> flexes<00:02:18.019> okay<00:02:18.799> this<00:02:19.580> is<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.930> flexible<00:02:20.930> tip

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
tip flexes okay this is a flexible tip

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.420 
tip flexes okay this is a flexible tip
so<00:02:22.760> as<00:02:22.940> you<00:02:23.150> start<00:02:23.900> in<00:02:24.019> with<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.349> catch<00:02:25.099> of<00:02:25.340> the

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
so as you start in with the catch of the

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.850 
so as you start in with the catch of the
blade<00:02:25.670> it<00:02:25.940> forgives<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:27.019> on<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.590> on<00:02:27.799> the

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
blade it forgives you on the on the

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.520 
blade it forgives you on the on the
catch<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:29.030> but<00:02:29.629> as<00:02:29.780> you<00:02:29.930> come<00:02:30.200> through<00:02:30.230> the

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
catch and but as you come through the

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.000 
catch and but as you come through the
power<00:02:30.860> phase<00:02:31.360> through<00:02:32.360> here<00:02:32.750> stage<00:02:33.620> two<00:02:33.980> of

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
power phase through here stage two of

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.160 
power phase through here stage two of
the<00:02:34.250> thing<00:02:34.579> the<00:02:34.970> flex<00:02:35.360> starts<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:35.840> straighten

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
the thing the flex starts to straighten

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.100 
the thing the flex starts to straighten
out<00:02:36.349> and<00:02:36.620> you<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.430> adds<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:38.110> increasing

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
out and you and it adds to increasing

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.800 
out and you and it adds to increasing
the<00:02:39.230> power<00:02:39.440> of<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:39.799> tip<00:02:40.190> okay<00:02:40.659> the<00:02:41.659> other

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
the power of the tip okay the other

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.270 
the power of the tip okay the other
thing<00:02:42.049> it<00:02:42.140> does<00:02:42.170> is<00:02:42.349> as<00:02:42.590> you<00:02:42.739> increase<00:02:43.040> the

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
thing it does is as you increase the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.330 
thing it does is as you increase the
power<00:02:43.459> of<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.730> tip<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.390> third<00:02:44.659> stage<00:02:45.019> is

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
power of the tip the third stage is

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.770 
power of the tip the third stage is
because<00:02:46.340> you're<00:02:46.519> powered<00:02:46.910> up<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.299> blade<00:02:47.569> will

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
because you're powered up the blade will

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.640 
because you're powered up the blade will
release<00:02:48.109> easier<00:02:48.560> okay<00:02:49.430> so<00:02:50.060> it's<00:02:50.870> it's<00:02:51.410> the

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
release easier okay so it's it's the

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
release easier okay so it's it's the
only<00:02:52.040> blade<00:02:52.310> in<00:02:53.180> its<00:02:53.390> category<00:02:53.890> that<00:02:54.890> for

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
only blade in its category that for

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.180 
only blade in its category that for
exclusively<00:02:56.420> for<00:02:56.750> racing<00:02:57.200> that<00:02:57.590> actually<00:02:58.010> has

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
exclusively for racing that actually has

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.149 
exclusively for racing that actually has
a<00:02:58.220> three-stage<00:02:58.970> power<00:02:59.299> face<00:02:59.659> and<00:03:00.409> it's<00:03:00.590> very

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:01.159 
a three-stage power face and it's very

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:04.059 
a three-stage power face and it's very
comfortable<00:03:01.730> to<00:03:01.790> paddle<00:03:02.239> with<00:03:02.409> it's<00:03:03.409> super

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
comfortable to paddle with it's super

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.059 
comfortable to paddle with it's super
light<00:03:04.250> again<00:03:05.180> not<00:03:05.870> recommended<00:03:06.230> for<00:03:06.560> surfing

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
light again not recommended for surfing

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.890 
light again not recommended for surfing
recommended<00:03:08.030> for<00:03:08.180> racing<00:03:08.709> and<00:03:10.209> I<00:03:11.209> think

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
recommended for racing and I think

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.479 
recommended for racing and I think
you'll<00:03:12.049> be<00:03:12.170> really<00:03:12.409> impressed<00:03:12.799> by<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.159> feel

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
you'll be really impressed by the feel

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.039 
you'll be really impressed by the feel
of<00:03:13.519> it<00:03:13.819> the<00:03:14.090> way<00:03:14.239> it<00:03:14.359> goes<00:03:14.390> through<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:14.840> water

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
of it the way it goes through the water

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.500 
of it the way it goes through the water
it's<00:03:15.290> really<00:03:15.739> forgiving<00:03:16.340> but<00:03:16.790> yet<00:03:17.000> super

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
it's really forgiving but yet super

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.830 
it's really forgiving but yet super
powerful<00:03:18.190> is<00:03:19.190> there<00:03:19.549> a<00:03:19.579> difference<00:03:20.209> in<00:03:20.419> this

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
powerful is there a difference in this

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.379 
powerful is there a difference in this
because<00:03:21.680> of<00:03:21.799> the<00:03:21.859> thinness<00:03:22.160> in<00:03:22.549> the<00:03:23.180> blade

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
because of the thinness in the blade

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.839 
because of the thinness in the blade
versus<00:03:24.019> the<00:03:24.380> other<00:03:24.620> one<00:03:24.889> well<00:03:25.579> you<00:03:25.669> got<00:03:25.760> to

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
versus the other one well you got to

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:27.699 
versus the other one well you got to
remember<00:03:26.000> that<00:03:26.269> these<00:03:26.750> blades<00:03:27.079> are<00:03:27.230> made<00:03:27.290> for

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
remember that these blades are made for

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.309 
remember that these blades are made for
for<00:03:28.160> primarily<00:03:28.669> surfing<00:03:29.269> and<00:03:29.480> stuff<00:03:30.169> like

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
for primarily surfing and stuff like

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:31.839 
for primarily surfing and stuff like
that<00:03:30.379> so<00:03:30.709> they're<00:03:30.859> made<00:03:31.129> a<00:03:31.160> little<00:03:31.400> stouter

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849 
that so they're made a little stouter

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.240 
that so they're made a little stouter
all<00:03:32.180> our<00:03:32.660> new<00:03:32.840> models<00:03:33.260> are<00:03:33.410> much<00:03:33.620> stouter<00:03:33.889> they

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
all our new models are much stouter they

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.170 
all our new models are much stouter they
have<00:03:34.370> a<00:03:34.400> come<00:03:34.760> with<00:03:35.419> the<00:03:36.700> back<00:03:37.700> side<00:03:37.970> of<00:03:38.000> the

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
have a come with the back side of the

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.699 
have a come with the back side of the
blade<00:03:38.480> is<00:03:39.910> has<00:03:40.910> a<00:03:40.970> curve<00:03:41.870> in<00:03:42.109> it<00:03:42.200> so<00:03:42.410> that<00:03:42.560> when

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
blade is has a curve in it so that when

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.170 
blade is has a curve in it so that when
you<00:03:42.829> set<00:03:43.129> it<00:03:43.160> down<00:03:43.340> the<00:03:43.579> wave<00:03:43.790> and<00:03:44.090> you're

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
you set it down the wave and you're

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.089 
you set it down the wave and you're
trying<00:03:44.449> to<00:03:44.540> do<00:03:44.629> your<00:03:44.780> turns<00:03:45.019> off<00:03:45.290> of<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:45.799> pivot

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
trying to do your turns off of and pivot

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.939 
trying to do your turns off of and pivot
off<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:46.370> paddle<00:03:46.639> the<00:03:47.329> the<00:03:47.870> point<00:03:48.230> the

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:48.949 
off the paddle the the point the

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:50.800 
off the paddle the the point the
dihedral<00:03:49.310> is<00:03:49.669> really<00:03:49.970> strong<00:03:50.269> all<00:03:50.660> the<00:03:50.690> way

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
dihedral is really strong all the way

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.159 
dihedral is really strong all the way
through<00:03:51.230> so<00:03:51.440> the<00:03:52.250> power<00:03:52.430> faces<00:03:53.120> is<00:03:53.389> forgiving

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:54.169 
through so the power faces is forgiving

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:55.900 
through so the power faces is forgiving
but<00:03:54.349> yet<00:03:54.560> strong<00:03:54.919> now<00:03:55.430> when<00:03:55.579> you<00:03:55.669> get<00:03:55.790> into

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
but yet strong now when you get into

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.939 
but yet strong now when you get into
this<00:03:56.120> blade<00:03:56.449> what<00:03:57.019> happens<00:03:57.410> is<00:03:57.560> it's<00:03:57.739> much

00:03:57.939 --> 00:03:57.949 
this blade what happens is it's much

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:59.949 
this blade what happens is it's much
thinner<00:03:58.310> it's<00:03:58.579> much<00:03:58.849> lighter<00:03:59.150> it<00:03:59.449> releases

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
thinner it's much lighter it releases

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:01.509 
thinner it's much lighter it releases
quicker<00:04:00.230> but<00:04:00.440> what<00:04:00.620> we're<00:04:00.769> trying<00:04:00.980> to<00:04:01.129> do<00:04:01.310> is

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
quicker but what we're trying to do is

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.569 
quicker but what we're trying to do is
get<00:04:01.730> a<00:04:01.790> blade<00:04:02.209> that<00:04:02.239> actually<00:04:03.019> i'm<00:04:03.829> really

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
get a blade that actually i'm really

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:06.550 
get a blade that actually i'm really
looking<00:04:04.730> for<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.150> flex<00:04:05.449> here<00:04:05.660> a<00:04:05.780> three-stage

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
looking for the flex here a three-stage

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.819 
looking for the flex here a three-stage
flex<00:04:07.190> a<00:04:07.489> three-stage<00:04:07.970> power<00:04:08.329> and<00:04:08.829> we

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
flex a three-stage power and we

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.189 
flex a three-stage power and we
accomplish<00:04:10.370> this<00:04:10.549> by<00:04:10.609> setting<00:04:11.449> up<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:11.840> molds

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:12.199 
accomplish this by setting up the molds

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:14.110 
accomplish this by setting up the molds
in<00:04:12.319> such<00:04:12.500> a<00:04:12.530> way<00:04:12.829> that<00:04:12.859> the<00:04:13.370> carbons<00:04:13.879> are

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
in such a way that the carbons are

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.640 
in such a way that the carbons are
registered<00:04:14.690> and<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:15.019> kevlar<00:04:15.410> czar

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
registered and the kevlar czar

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.469 
registered and the kevlar czar
registered<00:04:16.039> in<00:04:16.160> certain<00:04:16.459> directions<00:04:16.579> we

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
registered in certain directions we

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.199 
registered in certain directions we
still<00:04:17.750> hold<00:04:17.989> a<00:04:18.169> very<00:04:18.410> strong<00:04:18.889> dihedral<00:04:19.370> so

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
still hold a very strong dihedral so

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.120 
still hold a very strong dihedral so
what<00:04:20.359> happens<00:04:20.750> is<00:04:20.959> you<00:04:21.349> have<00:04:21.440> a<00:04:21.500> very<00:04:21.769> strong

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
what happens is you have a very strong

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.060 
what happens is you have a very strong
power<00:04:22.490> face<00:04:22.849> with<00:04:23.360> a<00:04:23.390> dihedral<00:04:23.810> that<00:04:24.469> drives

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
power face with a dihedral that drives

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.790 
power face with a dihedral that drives
the<00:04:25.370> blade<00:04:25.610> smooth<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:26.360> steers<00:04:26.780> the<00:04:27.020> blade<00:04:27.289> so

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
the blade smooth and steers the blade so

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.700 
the blade smooth and steers the blade so
again<00:04:28.039> it's<00:04:28.219> a

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
again it's a

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.240 
again it's a
comfortable<00:04:29.430> three-stage<00:04:30.030> power<00:04:30.390> paddle<00:04:31.250> do

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
comfortable three-stage power paddle do

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.100 
comfortable three-stage power paddle do
you<00:04:32.340> find<00:04:32.490> that<00:04:32.640> on<00:04:32.820> this<00:04:33.000> paddle<00:04:33.450> that<00:04:33.870> you'll

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
you find that on this paddle that you'll

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.110 
you find that on this paddle that you'll
fatigue<00:04:34.560> less<00:04:34.860> over<00:04:35.220> a<00:04:35.250> long<00:04:35.520> distance<00:04:35.550> run

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
fatigue less over a long distance run

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.270 
fatigue less over a long distance run
then<00:04:36.390> on<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:36.540> other<00:04:36.660> half<00:04:36.990> yeah<00:04:37.590> I<00:04:37.620> do<00:04:37.740> because

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
then on the other half yeah I do because

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.880 
then on the other half yeah I do because
for<00:04:38.490> one<00:04:38.610> it's<00:04:38.640> lighter<00:04:39.000> and<00:04:39.300> two<00:04:40.290> you're

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
for one it's lighter and two you're

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.680 
for one it's lighter and two you're
setting<00:04:41.340> up<00:04:41.870> more<00:04:42.870> consistent<00:04:43.770> power<00:04:43.980> pants

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
setting up more consistent power pants

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.300 
setting up more consistent power pants
you<00:04:45.690> know<00:04:45.810> with<00:04:46.140> with<00:04:46.440> heavier<00:04:46.890> stiffer

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
you know with with heavier stiffer

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.450 
you know with with heavier stiffer
paddles<00:04:47.940> or<00:04:48.150> blades<00:04:48.900> that<00:04:49.200> that<00:04:49.620> don't<00:04:50.010> have<00:04:50.190> a

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
paddles or blades that that don't have a

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.390 
paddles or blades that that don't have a
three-stage<00:04:51.210> even<00:04:51.840> our<00:04:51.960> first<00:04:52.260> blades<00:04:52.590> I<00:04:52.830> find

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
three-stage even our first blades I find

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.160 
three-stage even our first blades I find
that<00:04:53.460> this<00:04:53.640> blade<00:04:53.940> I'm<00:04:54.180> less<00:04:54.540> fatigued<00:04:54.960> with

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
that this blade I'm less fatigued with

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.930 
that this blade I'm less fatigued with
it<00:04:55.380> because<00:04:55.740> it's<00:04:55.890> less<00:04:56.130> fatiguing<00:04:56.580> on<00:04:56.790> the

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
it because it's less fatiguing on the

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.540 
it because it's less fatiguing on the
muscle<00:04:57.300> that<00:04:57.420> catch<00:04:58.110> that<00:04:58.560> you<00:04:58.710> do<00:04:59.040> the

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
muscle that catch that you do the

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.550 
muscle that catch that you do the
original<00:05:00.060> catch<00:05:00.330> when<00:05:00.570> you<00:05:00.690> drive<00:05:01.080> on<00:05:01.380> that

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
original catch when you drive on that

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.380 
original catch when you drive on that
first<00:05:01.800> stroke<00:05:02.190> you<00:05:02.670> know<00:05:02.760> that's<00:05:03.000> a<00:05:03.120> lot<00:05:03.330> of

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
first stroke you know that's a lot of

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.260 
first stroke you know that's a lot of
strengths<00:05:04.130> it's<00:05:05.130> real<00:05:05.340> strenuous<00:05:05.910> I<00:05:06.090> should

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
strengths it's real strenuous I should

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.240 
strengths it's real strenuous I should
say<00:05:06.450> on<00:05:06.600> your<00:05:06.630> joints<00:05:07.080> and<00:05:07.410> stuff<00:05:07.650> so<00:05:08.220> that

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
say on your joints and stuff so that

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.780 
say on your joints and stuff so that
first<00:05:08.700> catch<00:05:09.240> is<00:05:09.930> real<00:05:10.290> powerful<00:05:10.770> now<00:05:11.310> this

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
first catch is real powerful now this

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.790 
first catch is real powerful now this
it's<00:05:12.210> still<00:05:12.570> powerful<00:05:12.990> but<00:05:13.320> it's<00:05:13.680> a

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
it's still powerful but it's a

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.270 
it's still powerful but it's a
consistent<00:05:14.640> staged<00:05:15.450> power<00:05:15.960> so<00:05:16.590> it<00:05:16.710> makes<00:05:16.920> it<00:05:17.130> a

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
consistent staged power so it makes it a

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.770 
consistent staged power so it makes it a
lot<00:05:17.640> more<00:05:17.700> fluid<00:05:18.330> it'd<00:05:18.840> be<00:05:19.050> like<00:05:19.260> it'd<00:05:20.220> be<00:05:20.460> like

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
lot more fluid it'd be like it'd be like

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.530 
lot more fluid it'd be like it'd be like
running<00:05:21.780> a<00:05:21.900> steady<00:05:22.200> jog<00:05:22.650> as<00:05:23.010> opposed<00:05:23.640> to<00:05:24.000> you

kind of kind of you know you're going to
get<00:05:29.220> tired<00:05:29.460> quicker<00:05:29.910> because<00:05:30.210> all<00:05:30.600> of<00:05:30.660> a

sudden you know there's a jolt to your

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.640 
sudden you know there's a jolt to your
muscles<00:05:32.460> so<00:05:33.240> so<00:05:33.300> much<00:05:33.540> smoother<00:05:33.960> how<00:05:34.470> much

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650

going<00:05:41.610> to<00:05:41.670> be<00:05:41.790> versus<00:05:42.240> when<00:05:42.390> you<00:05:42.480> sure<00:05:42.690> that

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
going to be versus when you sure that

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.650 
going to be versus when you sure that
you'd<00:05:43.110> roll<00:05:43.290> Oh<00:05:43.470> on<00:05:44.460> that<00:05:44.640> side<00:05:44.850> yeah<00:05:45.060> oh<00:05:45.210> well

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
you'd roll Oh on that side yeah oh well

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.900 
you'd roll Oh on that side yeah oh well
I<00:05:45.930> think<00:05:46.170> what<00:05:46.530> it<00:05:46.650> does<00:05:46.830> is<00:05:47.100> what<00:05:47.340> happens<00:05:47.700> is

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
I think what it does is what happens is

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.870 
I think what it does is what happens is
with<00:05:48.300> a<00:05:48.330> really<00:05:48.690> thin<00:05:48.990> blade<00:05:49.350> like<00:05:49.620> this<00:05:49.880> I'm

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
with a really thin blade like this I'm

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.240 
with a really thin blade like this I'm
I'm<00:05:51.330> I<00:05:51.780> really<00:05:52.260> use<00:05:52.440> the<00:05:52.620> back<00:05:52.800> side<00:05:53.070> of<00:05:53.100> the

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
I'm I really use the back side of the

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.840 
I'm I really use the back side of the
blade<00:05:53.430> when<00:05:53.670> I<00:05:53.700> turned<00:05:54.060> and<00:05:54.380> so<00:05:55.490> the<00:05:56.490> blade

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
blade when I turned and so the blade

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.570 
blade when I turned and so the blade
will<00:05:57.570> skin<00:05:58.050> smoother<00:05:58.950> over<00:05:59.250> the<00:05:59.370> water

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
will skin smoother over the water

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.290 
will skin smoother over the water
because<00:06:00.060> it's<00:06:00.740> curved<00:06:01.740> like<00:06:02.700> the<00:06:02.880> hull<00:06:03.030> of<00:06:03.060> a

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
because it's curved like the hull of a

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.940 
because it's curved like the hull of a
boat<00:06:03.330> it<00:06:03.690> will<00:06:03.780> curve<00:06:03.990> across<00:06:04.350> the<00:06:04.560> water<00:06:04.800> if

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950 
boat it will curve across the water if

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.110 
boat it will curve across the water if
you<00:06:05.100> look<00:06:06.770> it's<00:06:07.770> got<00:06:07.920> a<00:06:07.950> curve<00:06:08.250> in<00:06:08.490> it<00:06:08.610> this

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
you look it's got a curve in it this

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.960 
you look it's got a curve in it this
one's<00:06:10.010> somewhat<00:06:11.010> curve<00:06:11.250> but<00:06:11.460> it's<00:06:11.610> got<00:06:11.730> a<00:06:11.760> real

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:11.970 
one's somewhat curve but it's got a real

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.970 
one's somewhat curve but it's got a real
hard<00:06:12.240> edge<00:06:12.420> on<00:06:12.690> it<00:06:12.720> and<00:06:13.260> what<00:06:13.410> happens<00:06:13.770> with

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:13.980 
hard edge on it and what happens with

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.460 
hard edge on it and what happens with
the<00:06:14.010> edges<00:06:14.580> that<00:06:14.880> it<00:06:15.360> can<00:06:15.630> for<00:06:15.930> me<00:06:16.080> intense

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
the edges that it can for me intense

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.740 
the edges that it can for me intense
them<00:06:16.680> catch<00:06:16.980> and<00:06:17.640> hook<00:06:17.970> it<00:06:18.180> doesn't<00:06:18.540> want<00:06:18.660> to

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
them catch and hook it doesn't want to

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.340 
them catch and hook it doesn't want to
slide<00:06:19.020> real<00:06:19.350> smooth<00:06:19.760> so<00:06:21.080> again<00:06:22.080> we're<00:06:22.320> looking

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:22.350 
slide real smooth so again we're looking

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.850 
slide real smooth so again we're looking
at<00:06:22.740> a<00:06:22.770> paddle<00:06:23.280> that<00:06:23.520> is<00:06:24.200> set<00:06:25.200> up<00:06:25.350> for<00:06:25.650> your
