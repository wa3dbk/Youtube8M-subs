publish<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:27.350> basically<00:01:28.350> it's<00:01:28.500> running

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
publish this basically it's running

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.999 
publish this basically it's running
through<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.189> entire<00:01:29.549> image<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.829> when<00:01:31.829> you

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
through the entire image and when you

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.170 
through the entire image and when you
see<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.520> about<00:01:32.939> right<00:01:33.270> here<00:01:34.310> is<00:01:35.310> where<00:01:35.880> it

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
see it about right here is where it

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.630 
see it about right here is where it
actually<00:01:36.329> switches<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.380> flips<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.950> rotate

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
actually switches and it flips to rotate

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.030 
actually switches and it flips to rotate
it<00:01:38.759> again<00:01:39.000> now<00:01:39.299> we<00:01:39.360> do<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.049> based<00:01:40.350> on<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.710> time

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
it again now we do that based on a time

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.280 
it again now we do that based on a time
control<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.850> what<00:01:42.479> i<00:01:42.509> did<00:01:42.780> i<00:01:42.810> just<00:01:43.079> kind<00:01:43.229> of

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
control and what i did i just kind of

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.440 
control and what i did i just kind of
waited<00:01:43.560> for<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.770> screen<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.100> clear<00:01:44.340> all<00:01:45.270> right

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
waited for the screen to clear all right

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.569 
waited for the screen to clear all right
and<00:01:45.689> then<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.590> brings<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.950> back<00:01:46.979> around<00:01:47.369> again

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
and then it brings it back around again

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.090 
and then it brings it back around again
now<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.479> can<00:01:48.750> set<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.500> whatever<00:01:49.770> with

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.530 
now you can set this to whatever with
you<00:01:50.250> want<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.790> then<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:51.090> course<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
you want and then of course in the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.450 
you want and then of course in the
equations<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.200> we<00:01:52.439> create<00:01:52.799> inside<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.399> the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
equations that we create inside of the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.679 
equations that we create inside of the
action<00:01:53.790> script<00:01:54.000> i'll<00:01:54.149> show<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.420> how<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.570> do

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
action script i'll show you how to do

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.590 
action script i'll show you how to do
this<00:01:55.520> you<00:01:56.520> can<00:01:56.640> basically<00:01:56.790> time<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.509> how

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
this you can basically time it to how

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.420 
this you can basically time it to how
you<00:01:57.659> want<00:01:57.930> now<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.380> course<00:01:58.560> if<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.860> put<00:01:59.219> you

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
you want now of course if you put you

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.060 
you want now of course if you put you
know<00:01:59.460> some<00:01:59.969> textures<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.600> here<00:02:00.899> all<00:02:01.829> right

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
know some textures in here all right

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.130 
know some textures in here all right
like<00:02:02.399> for<00:02:02.579> example<00:02:02.610> if<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.450> wanted<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.899> put

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
like for example if you wanted to put

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.150 
like for example if you wanted to put
like<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.560> flat<00:02:04.979> scale<00:02:06.020> of<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.200> earth<00:02:07.500> where<00:02:07.979> all

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
like a flat scale of the earth where all

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.619 
like a flat scale of the earth where all
the<00:02:08.280> continents<00:02:08.550> are<00:02:08.789> showing<00:02:09.060> like<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.390> but

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
the continents are showing like this but

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.340 
the continents are showing like this but
more<00:02:09.840> on<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:10.129> wider<00:02:11.129> scale

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
more on a wider scale

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.740 
more on a wider scale
and<00:02:12.470> you<00:02:13.250> create<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.670> texture<00:02:14.150> for<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.510> time

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
and you create the texture for the time

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.530 
and you create the texture for the time
for<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.110> image<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.590> change<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:16.160> same<00:02:16.600> then

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
for the image to change the same then

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.580 
for the image to change the same then
what<00:02:20.540> you'll<00:02:20.720> get<00:02:20.870> is<00:02:21.110> basically<00:02:21.560> a

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
what you'll get is basically a

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.670 
what you'll get is basically a
free-flowing<00:02:22.070> earth<00:02:22.400> that<00:02:22.670> just<00:02:22.880> kind<00:02:23.030> of

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
free-flowing earth that just kind of

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.500 
free-flowing earth that just kind of
rotates<00:02:24.680> around<00:02:24.800> all<00:02:25.580> right<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:26.210> nothing

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
rotates around all right so nothing

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.020 
rotates around all right so nothing
special<00:02:26.720> here<00:02:26.990> just<00:02:27.350> going<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:27.530> X<00:02:28.040> out<00:02:28.220> of<00:02:28.310> this

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.970 

all<00:02:32.030> right<00:02:32.240> and<00:02:32.540> what<00:02:33.380> I'm<00:02:33.470> going<00:02:33.590> to<00:02:33.620> do<00:02:33.800> is

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
all right and what I'm going to do is

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:34.900 
all right and what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:02:34.040> just<00:02:34.070> going<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.310> go<00:02:34.400> ahead<00:02:34.580> and<00:02:34.670> delete

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
I'm just going to go ahead and delete

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.290 
I'm just going to go ahead and delete
all<00:02:35.210> of<00:02:35.480> my<00:02:35.990> action<00:02:36.410> script<00:02:36.680> here<00:02:37.150> it's<00:02:38.150> going

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
all of my action script here it's going

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.170 
all of my action script here it's going
to<00:02:38.330> get<00:02:38.420> rid<00:02:38.540> of<00:02:38.600> this<00:02:39.730> all<00:02:40.730> right<00:02:40.880> I'm<00:02:41.060> going

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
we're actually going to program it into

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.810 
we're actually going to program it into
our<00:02:55.820> action<00:02:56.270> script<00:02:56.540> so<00:02:57.460> I'm<00:02:58.460> going<00:02:58.520> to<00:02:58.640> bring

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
where I have my action script file then

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.570 
where I have my action script file then
I'm<00:03:12.200> going<00:03:12.320> to<00:03:12.410> be<00:03:12.470> working<00:03:12.590> with<00:03:12.800> of<00:03:13.400> course

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
I'm going to be working with of course

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.920 
I'm going to be working with of course
don't<00:03:13.760> pay<00:03:13.880> any<00:03:14.030> attention<00:03:14.060> to<00:03:14.360> this<00:03:14.510> this<00:03:14.810> is

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
don't pay any attention to this this is

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.660 
don't pay any attention to this this is
just<00:03:15.200> one<00:03:15.650> of<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.800> testing<00:03:16.190> things<00:03:16.400> that<00:03:16.610> I

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
just one of the testing things that I

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.360 
just one of the testing things that I
have<00:03:16.790> some<00:03:16.940> notes<00:03:17.090> on<00:03:17.770> that<00:03:18.770> i'll<00:03:19.190> probably

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
have some notes on that i'll probably

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.130 
have some notes on that i'll probably
end<00:03:19.520> up<00:03:19.700> applying<00:03:19.940> to<00:03:20.270> the<00:03:20.360> file<00:03:20.570> later<00:03:20.930> on

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
end up applying to the file later on

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.160 
end up applying to the file later on
when<00:03:21.470> we're<00:03:21.620> finished<00:03:22.450> so<00:03:23.450> just<00:03:24.020> remember

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
when we're finished so just remember

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.470 
when we're finished so just remember
this<00:03:24.500> all<00:03:24.800> right<00:03:25.010> I've<00:03:25.220> got<00:03:25.610> my<00:03:25.910> action<00:03:26.270> script

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
this all right I've got my action script

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.600 
this all right I've got my action script
file<00:03:26.660> and<00:03:26.990> the<00:03:27.110> doc<00:03:27.320> underscore<00:03:27.980> class<00:03:28.310> folder

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
file and the doc underscore class folder

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.510 
file and the doc underscore class folder
okay<00:03:29.600> and<00:03:29.870> there<00:03:30.380> it<00:03:30.470> is<00:03:31.480> so<00:03:32.480> when<00:03:32.930> we<00:03:33.110> go<00:03:33.290> to

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
okay and there it is so when we go to

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.010 
okay and there it is so when we go to
write<00:03:34.520> our<00:03:34.790> action<00:03:35.180> script<00:03:35.510> on<00:03:35.660> our<00:03:35.810> main

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
write our action script on our main

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.960 
write our action script on our main
timeline<00:03:36.320> here<00:03:36.770> we<00:03:36.950> basically<00:03:37.310> have<00:03:37.610> to<00:03:37.760> set

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
timeline here we basically have to set

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.150 
timeline here we basically have to set
it<00:03:38.090> up<00:03:38.210> to<00:03:38.990> call<00:03:39.200> this<00:03:39.350> action<00:03:39.740> script<00:03:39.980> file

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
it up to call this action script file

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.160 
it up to call this action script file
right<00:03:40.430> here<00:03:40.460> all<00:03:41.360> right<00:03:42.370> okay<00:03:43.840> so<00:03:44.840> of<00:03:44.990> course

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
right here all right okay so of course

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.960 
right here all right okay so of course
you<00:03:45.350> know<00:03:45.440> if<00:03:45.590> you<00:03:45.680> haven't<00:03:45.980> done<00:03:46.070> this<00:03:46.130> I'd<00:03:46.760> go

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
here in order for us to do this we

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.250 
here in order for us to do this we
basically<00:04:13.370> have<00:04:13.940> to<00:04:14.180> import<00:04:14.690> it<00:04:14.840> so<00:04:15.080> we're

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
basically have to import it so we're

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.970 
basically have to import it so we're
going<00:04:15.320> to<00:04:15.440> say<00:04:15.620> import<00:04:17.020> doc<00:04:18.020> underscore<00:04:18.710> class

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
going to say import doc underscore class

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.470 
going to say import doc underscore class
dot<00:04:19.910> logo<00:04:20.630> underscore<00:04:21.320> rotation<00:04:22.180> semicolon

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
right so we're basically saying import I

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
right so we're basically saying import I
go<00:04:26.180> to<00:04:26.240> this<00:04:26.390> directory<00:04:27.130> okay<00:04:28.130> and<00:04:28.570> then<00:04:29.570> what

to one dot 4 to 24 23 all right just

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.180 
to one dot 4 to 24 23 all right just
that's<00:04:50.570> how<00:04:50.690> you<00:04:50.750> set<00:04:51.080> it<00:04:51.200> up<00:04:51.320> for<00:04:51.530> going<00:04:51.770> down

that's how you set it up for going down
into<00:04:52.760> your<00:04:53.390> directories<00:04:54.290> okay<00:04:54.860> but<00:04:55.160> we<00:04:55.280> don't

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
into your directories okay but we don't

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.590 
into your directories okay but we don't
need<00:04:55.520> to<00:04:55.610> do<00:04:55.700> that<00:04:55.730> so<00:04:56.030> I'm<00:04:56.120> going<00:04:56.240> to<00:04:56.270> back<00:04:56.420> out

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
need to do that so I'm going to back out

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.070 
need to do that so I'm going to back out
of<00:04:56.630> this<00:04:58.750> alright<00:04:59.750> so<00:05:00.680> once<00:05:00.890> we<00:05:01.010> set<00:05:01.250> that<00:05:01.280> up

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
of this alright so once we set that up

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.980 
of this alright so once we set that up
we<00:05:03.080> need<00:05:03.650> to<00:05:03.770> create<00:05:03.980> a<00:05:04.460> variable<00:05:05.270> that<00:05:05.750> will

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
we need to create a variable that will

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.430 
we need to create a variable that will
actually<00:05:06.200> throw<00:05:07.900> basically<00:05:08.900> the<00:05:09.020> movie<00:05:09.260> clip

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
actually throw basically the movie clip

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.170 
actually throw basically the movie clip
that<00:05:09.620> we<00:05:09.740> create<00:05:10.100> out<00:05:10.340> onto<00:05:10.610> the<00:05:10.700> stage<00:05:10.910> now

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
that we create out onto the stage now

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.090 
that we create out onto the stage now
it's<00:05:11.330> not<00:05:11.390> a<00:05:11.450> necessary<00:05:12.020> movie<00:05:12.260> clip<00:05:12.470> well<00:05:13.010> I

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
it's not a necessary movie clip well I

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.040 
it's not a necessary movie clip well I
guess<00:05:13.250> it<00:05:13.400> sort<00:05:13.580> of<00:05:13.610> is<00:05:13.790> but<00:05:14.510> I<00:05:14.540> we<00:05:14.810> basically

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
guess it sort of is but I we basically

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.600 
guess it sort of is but I we basically
have<00:05:15.260> to<00:05:15.320> create<00:05:15.500> a<00:05:15.560> variable<00:05:15.800> name<00:05:16.100> that<00:05:16.430> we

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
have to create a variable name that we

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.250 
have to create a variable name that we
can<00:05:16.760> throw<00:05:16.970> it<00:05:17.120> inside<00:05:17.240> of<00:05:17.570> so<00:05:17.870> let's<00:05:18.110> go<00:05:18.230> ahead

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
can throw it inside of so let's go ahead

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.040 
can throw it inside of so let's go ahead
and<00:05:18.410> do<00:05:18.560> that<00:05:18.590> by<00:05:19.040> saying<00:05:19.340> bar<00:05:20.050> logo

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
and do that by saying bar logo

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.610 
and do that by saying bar logo

closing parenthesis semicolon alright
and<00:05:48.700> what<00:05:49.700> we're<00:05:49.790> going<00:05:49.820> to<00:05:49.970> do<00:05:50.150> is<00:05:50.360> we're

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
and what we're going to do is we're

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.520 
and what we're going to do is we're
going<00:05:50.540> to<00:05:50.630> create<00:05:50.780> a<00:05:50.870> function<00:05:51.320> that<00:05:51.350> will

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
going to create a function that will

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.500 
going to create a function that will
actually<00:05:51.740> throw<00:05:52.310> this<00:05:52.550> out<00:05:52.760> onto<00:05:53.210> the<00:05:53.300> stage

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
actually throw this out onto the stage

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.160 
actually throw this out onto the stage
so<00:05:53.840> let's<00:05:54.020> say<00:05:54.140> function<00:05:55.540> show<00:05:56.540> underscore

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.170 
so let's say function show underscore

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.090 
so let's say function show underscore
the<00:05:57.950> underscore<00:05:58.250> image<00:05:59.350> underscore<00:06:00.350> on<00:06:00.650> our

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100 
the underscore image underscore on our

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.010 
the underscore image underscore on our
score<00:06:01.400> stage<00:06:01.700> and<00:06:02.030> I<00:06:02.540> know<00:06:02.600> that's<00:06:02.750> a<00:06:02.900> long

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
score stage and I know that's a long

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.510 
score stage and I know that's a long
variable<00:06:03.470> name<00:06:03.590> we<00:06:03.740> only<00:06:03.860> have<00:06:04.040> to<00:06:04.130> use<00:06:04.250> it<00:06:04.280> one

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520

that<00:07:25.460> we<00:07:25.550> set<00:07:25.759> up<00:07:25.909> so<00:07:26.409> this<00:07:27.409> isn't<00:07:27.770> going<00:07:27.889> to<00:07:27.949> be

00:07:27.999 --> 00:07:28.009 
that we set up so this isn't going to be

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:31.480 
that we set up so this isn't going to be
exactly<00:07:28.669> at<00:07:28.909> 100<00:07:29.449> and<00:07:29.570> 100<00:07:30.020> but<00:07:30.919> you'll<00:07:31.310> see
