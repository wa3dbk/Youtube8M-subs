condensed relay which all you have to do

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.430 
condensed relay which all you have to do
is<00:00:34.950> plug<00:00:35.160> in<00:00:35.399> up<00:00:35.430> two<00:00:35.820> wires<00:00:36.059> now<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:37.290> vehicle

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
is plug in up two wires now this vehicle

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.560 
is plug in up two wires now this vehicle
do<00:00:37.739> not<00:00:37.860> have<00:00:38.070> factory<00:00:38.430> keyless<00:00:38.730> entry<00:00:38.969> then

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
do not have factory keyless entry then

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.470 
do not have factory keyless entry then
even<00:00:40.559> have<00:00:40.770> what's<00:00:41.489> called<00:00:41.640> reversal<00:00:42.239> rest

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
even have what's called reversal rest

interrupt the door lock wires have got
power<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.950> them<00:00:47.070> look<00:00:47.219> up<00:00:47.309> ground<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.239> then

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
power to them look up ground and then

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.990 
power to them look up ground and then
interface<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:49.050> relays<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:50.309> relay<00:00:50.550> socket

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000
