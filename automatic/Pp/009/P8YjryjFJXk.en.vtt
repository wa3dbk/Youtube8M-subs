00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
interest for it by playing the old beta

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.330 
interest for it by playing the old beta
version<00:01:42.420> but<00:01:42.600> uh<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:43.320> don't<00:01:43.560> know<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.890> just<00:01:43.920> I

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
version but uh I don't know I just I

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.490 
version but uh I don't know I just I
didn't<00:01:44.939> like<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.479> wasn't<00:01:45.869> getting<00:01:46.170> very

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
didn't like it I wasn't getting very

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.639 
didn't like it I wasn't getting very
good<00:01:46.649> quality<00:01:46.860> videos<00:01:47.759> out<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.530> kind<00:01:49.530> of

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
good quality videos out of it so kind of

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.100 
good quality videos out of it so kind of
scrap<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.520> then<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.210> got<00:01:51.360> rust<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.990> I

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
scrap that and then I got rust and I

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.510 
scrap that and then I got rust and I
started<00:01:52.619> doing<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:52.890> really<00:01:53.340> like<00:01:53.490> that

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
started doing that I really like that

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.270 
started doing that I really like that
for<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.000> while<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.990> also<00:01:55.470> slowed<00:01:55.799> down<00:01:55.950> with<00:01:56.130> that

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
for a while I also slowed down with that

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.620 
for a while I also slowed down with that
mainly<00:01:56.549> because<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.880> started<00:01:57.180> playing<00:01:57.390> with<00:01:57.570> a

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
mainly because I started playing with a

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.840 
mainly because I started playing with a
team<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.290> once<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.340> play<00:01:59.490> with<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.670> team<00:01:59.820> in

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
team and once you play with the team in

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.060 
team and once you play with the team in
that<00:02:00.030> game<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.540> gets<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.990> little<00:02:01.259> boring<00:02:01.560> for

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
that game it gets a little boring for

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.770 
that game it gets a little boring for
videos<00:02:02.399> because<00:02:02.880> it's<00:02:03.270> all<00:02:03.390> about<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.750> know

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
videos because it's all about you know

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.899 
videos because it's all about you know
the<00:02:03.869> tents<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.649> tension<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.159> playing<00:02:05.430> solo

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
the tents the tension of playing solo

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.639 
the tents the tension of playing solo
you<00:02:06.240> know<00:02:06.299> it's<00:02:06.840> really<00:02:06.960> fun<00:02:07.229> it's<00:02:07.439> really

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
you know it's really fun it's really

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.559 
you know it's really fun it's really
awesome<00:02:07.770> nerve-wracking<00:02:08.700> but<00:02:09.239> once<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.479> play

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
awesome nerve-wracking but once you play

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.270 
awesome nerve-wracking but once you play
with<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.750> team<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.110> takes<00:02:10.289> away<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.530> aspect

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
with the team it takes away that aspect

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.800 
with the team it takes away that aspect
so<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.400> kind<00:02:11.850> of<00:02:11.880> stopped<00:02:12.090> make<00:02:12.240> videos<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.540> that

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
so I kind of stopped make videos of that

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.030

reminds<00:04:49.460> me<00:04:49.580> of<00:04:49.640> in<00:04:49.760> the<00:04:49.820> comments<00:04:51.490> but<00:04:52.490> you

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
reminds me of in the comments but you

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.460 
reminds me of in the comments but you
know<00:04:53.270> so<00:04:53.480> my<00:04:53.660> channel<00:04:53.930> didn't<00:04:54.080> grow<00:04:54.170> all<00:04:54.320> too

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
know so my channel didn't grow all too

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.890 
know so my channel didn't grow all too
fast<00:04:54.740> but<00:04:55.010> I<00:04:55.040> think<00:04:55.310> with<00:04:55.880> you<00:04:56.660> know<00:04:56.720> an

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
fast but I think with you know an

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.220 
fast but I think with you know an
upgraded<00:04:57.440> quality<00:04:57.860> that<00:04:57.950> i<00:04:58.010> have<00:04:58.190> now<00:04:58.810> if<00:04:59.810> i

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
upgraded quality that i have now if i

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.870 
upgraded quality that i have now if i
put<00:05:00.590> in<00:05:00.710> the<00:05:00.800> same<00:05:00.980> effort<00:05:01.190> that<00:05:01.490> I<00:05:01.550> used<00:05:01.790> to

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
put in the same effort that I used to

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.380
