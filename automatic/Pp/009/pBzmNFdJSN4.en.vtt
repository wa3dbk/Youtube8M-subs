00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.140
 encompass the offered games and friendship 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:11.129
 the observation is the same 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:14.869
 so bring its fair value no text is paying 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.110
 does not it start making this video and it turns out that I 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.310
 full full full full full full full job and that I have not the 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.700
 time so we made it known at all times and it comes out very very 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.960
 Soon on the blog 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.960

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.500

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:51.930
 here 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.400
 unpacking this loss is extremely proud to have the turn of the 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.680
 box at the top m 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.000
 max + pc 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.750
 to fear as usual 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.670
 the pictures of the reports 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.020
 orlov 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.020
 we do not take care of the gods that we understand nothing 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.020
 behind 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.410
 in quebec a pro mac 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.410
 the human balance sheet with backgrounds that tells you everything you can do 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.280
 with 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.340
 the couple searched by the hard drive on the usb port your side be sure 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.810
 All that you want 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.810
 but here is this unpacking 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.040
 as usual I always see him standing up 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.310
 it did not suck the day when we will find people who do that 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.460
 packaging like that 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.910
 they understood everything 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.910
 so it's a box that's blowing 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.130
 with directly above 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.130
 the small when the two leading teams 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.580
 so it's still a little 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.680
 this price actually allows 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.300
 see this tours in savoie 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.600

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.850
 to avoid it coming back and the sector 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.410
 e the cables 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.410
 10:45 the theft a site 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:12.969
 but we did not ask ourselves before 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:16.059
 then 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:19.209
 so the consequences of the dumpling 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.209
 Californian palm dilemma 

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:26.539
 a lot 3 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.009
 from here on is it possible 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:34.109
 with this collective clifford installation is expired 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:38.589
 so installed the defibrillator before being connected 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:42.019
 ortec Saturday 6 ten of these so-called type of configuration therapies 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.159
 do not share the bronchi for orange legs small parliament as contacts 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:48.209
 for example 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.209
 and the apple software for example the door 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.219
 so this is the last door the world agreed 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:56.999
 we are attacked 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:02:57.880
 then we have it 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:58.680
 a little 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.249
 icra slamming 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:03.099
 the mains charger 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.409
 he runs without fear 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.789
 all that is more banal you will plug the afp 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:10.799
 messi spices rebounds 7 8 me 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.249
 and your door of officials in principle 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:18.189
 So here it is there to replace the storm on Reuters 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.629
 but say 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:26.620
 not to name it the wrb there is little and to house especially caught this loss 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.489
 door 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.759
 something that's great with that 

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:34.879
 is that scene power of media trust and say that never its price 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:36.509
 should be expanded 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:41.249
 and so I go on the blood tan blood picture if the agent will see a collection of 

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:42.599
 dates throughout the house 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.889
 in any case I hope it's a little the goal of 7 am
