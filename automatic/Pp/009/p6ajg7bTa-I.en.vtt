00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:02.610
 the car is offered to direct attention 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.060
 video 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:05.700
 then about how to handle 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.700
 three-dimensional models of father rights salad 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:11.059
 in two directions 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.059
 changing clothes 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:17.689
 getting perfect patterns will erase dimensional 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.669
 form object 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:22.029
 police pieces of furniture 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:23.779
 which have been scanned with 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:25.270
 using three-dimensional 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.310
 scanner 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.859
 3d times 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:29.849
 you can scan any items 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.029
 sizes 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.029
 people 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.480
 furniture interiors 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.810
 can scan mannequins can 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.580
 scan miniature 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.660
 image furniture made of 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.450
 plasticine for example 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.370
 for the reaction of years 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.690
 the creation of new models as we see 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.600
 armchair 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.470
 if the scanned model is closed 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.910
 prohibited in a three-dimensional editor 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.070
 programs and your design 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.080
 where special tools 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.470
 directly by actresses not measures 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.100
 surface of the model we chart 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.100
 name compound 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.770
 you see that part and not need and not the whole 1 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.770
 fairly simple tool 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.910
 flexible mouse 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.940
 three-dimensional chair 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.130
 so that we were comfortable to see 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.420
 where to put the next point 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.120
 we schedule 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.150
 line of caracas 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.550
 in this case, we are or not and she came from 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.690
 surfaces therefore one of the points we 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.640
 translate 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.250
 corner point 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.960
 so what was 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.560
 the first line segment lay 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.820
 directly on the surface 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.800
 and after you mapped out Lenin 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.340
 we create 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.470
 surface stretched find lines 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.540
 the surfaces crash 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.050
 and the percentage of our scan 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.020
 furniture surfaces so they absolutely 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.180
 fits perfectly 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.250
 in that form 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.020
 which you have 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.109
 in the reality 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:12.109
 after the ship surface 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.049
 but do not overlap the fabric 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.029
 which can rotate the candidate drawing when 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:21.029
 This overlay is done with 100 percent 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.469
 pairing scales 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:25.189
 since the scan also 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:26.889
 Alps are under investigation 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:28.439
 sizes 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.439
 you do not need to specifically indicate 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.059
 the size of her vector 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:35.589
 tissue effects can be set 

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:38.589
 change lighting 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.799
 You can also combine parts of an object in 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.769
 group n 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.519
 and apply as well as on a flat 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.949
 Images 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:53.279
 on group day color 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:56.099
 those lines that were drawn 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.219
 apparently we can separate 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.219
 surface when browsing 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:05.969
 and overlay fabric video 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.549
 three-dimensional surface shape 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.549
 can be applied fabric mode 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:16.199
 without additional constructions 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:20.779
 while scania overlap 

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:23.169
 Vita's volume is the same fabric pattern 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.540
 but more substantial without defect volumes 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.639
 In this case, the reverse volume 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.639
 calf stripes suppressed 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:33.939
 such technology will allow to achieve 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:35.529
 one hundred percent 

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:37.729
 shake carry your 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:40.259
 picture 

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:41.369
 other 

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:44.539
 the sofa is rather simple 

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:47.419
 still specially simplified 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.499
 for programs 

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:52.079
 mass design 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.079
 we also apply textures in the same way 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.649
 mouse click apparently 

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:59.659
 volume texture at the same time 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:00.969
 having arrived 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:03.909
 we can change fabrics we can make it 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:05.459
 percent 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.459
 more pronounced or less pronounced 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.410
 the same fabrics are used which 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.800
 we impose on flat photos 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.800
 sofas from for comparison 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.449
 again 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.610
 peel effect volume of my skin ran those 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.080
 who gives volume 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.319
 and again by volume effect 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:44.090
 can be tinted in another color
