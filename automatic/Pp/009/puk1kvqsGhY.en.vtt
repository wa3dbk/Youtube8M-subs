when we get out to the degree of what

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.830 
when we get out to the degree of what
that<00:02:44.569> is<00:02:44.780> but<00:02:45.050> inside<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.069> car<00:02:46.280> I<00:02:46.550> mean<00:02:46.840> you

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
that is but inside the car I mean you

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.330 
that is but inside the car I mean you
know<00:02:47.930> that<00:02:48.140> rate<00:02:48.380> of<00:02:48.530> speed<00:02:48.739> hitting<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.190> wall

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.090 
know that rate of speed hitting the wall
yeah<00:02:50.120> it's<00:02:50.959> not<00:02:51.170> a<00:02:51.230> situation<00:02:51.470> you<00:02:51.800> want<00:02:51.920> to<00:02:52.010> be

in an overtaking position and I felt

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.130 
in an overtaking position and I felt
like<00:04:11.209> I<00:04:11.329> had<00:04:11.480> it<00:04:11.510> was<00:04:11.780> gonna<00:04:11.900> have<00:04:12.049> his

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
drafting help on the straights which I

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.490 
drafting help on the straights which I
did<00:04:13.700> coming<00:04:14.450> down<00:04:14.570> the<00:04:14.690> front<00:04:14.810> straight<00:04:15.140> into

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
did coming down the front straight into

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.650 
did coming down the front straight into
that<00:04:15.620> corner<00:04:15.980> so<00:04:16.459> I<00:04:16.489> really<00:04:16.760> felt<00:04:16.910> like<00:04:17.030> things

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
that corner so I really felt like things

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.020 
that corner so I really felt like things
were<00:04:18.039> going<00:04:19.039> in<00:04:19.130> the<00:04:19.190> right<00:04:19.340> direction<00:04:19.489> for<00:04:19.910> me

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
were going in the right direction for me

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.060

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
to roll around the bottom and pass the

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.440 
to roll around the bottom and pass the
39<00:04:22.460> and<00:04:22.760> clearly<00:04:23.360> that<00:04:23.450> didn't<00:04:23.750> happen<00:04:24.020> so<00:04:25.450> you

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
39 and clearly that didn't happen so you

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.850
