I'd<00:00:23.010> purchased<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:23.490> unit<00:00:23.869> the<00:00:24.869> turbo<00:00:25.230> was

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
I'd purchased this unit the turbo was

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.500 
I'd purchased this unit the turbo was
blown<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:27.210> intercooler<00:00:28.170> was<00:00:29.240> full<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.359> oil

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
blown so the intercooler was full of oil

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.240 
blown so the intercooler was full of oil
and<00:00:30.750> water<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.109> everything<00:00:31.470> else<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:31.949> tried

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
and water and everything else so I tried

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.670 
and water and everything else so I tried
my<00:00:32.369> best<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.899> clean<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.050> out<00:00:34.170> but<00:00:34.410> now<00:00:34.530> that

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
my best to clean it out but now that

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.420 
my best to clean it out but now that
I've<00:00:34.770> been<00:00:34.829> out<00:00:34.980> running<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:36.320> after<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.559> after

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
I've been out running it after the after

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.970 
I've been out running it after the after
we<00:00:38.579> put<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.090> brand<00:00:39.300> new<00:00:39.329> turbo<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.899> every<00:00:40.860> now

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
we put a brand new turbo on it every now

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.560 
we put a brand new turbo on it every now
and<00:00:41.129> then<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.430> map<00:00:41.670> sensors<00:00:42.059> get<00:00:42.210> dirty<00:00:42.480> so

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
and then the map sensors get dirty so

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.180 
and then the map sensors get dirty so
I'm<00:00:42.629> going<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.780> go<00:00:42.930> Bo<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.260> show<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.440> how<00:00:44.129> to

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
I'm going to go Bo and show you how to

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.060 
I'm going to go Bo and show you how to
go<00:00:44.340> out<00:00:44.370> take<00:00:44.670> them<00:00:44.820> up<00:00:44.940> sensors<00:00:45.300> out<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.719> then

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
go out take them up sensors out and then

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.139 
go out take them up sensors out and then
cleaning<00:00:47.070> them<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.309> putting<00:00:47.760> them<00:00:47.850> back<00:00:47.879> in

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
cleaning them and putting them back in

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.479 
cleaning them and putting them back in
and<00:00:48.300> testing<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.800> four-stroke<00:00:50.190> turbo

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
and testing so in the four-stroke turbo

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.830 
and testing so in the four-stroke turbo
charge<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.820> actually<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.210> map<00:00:51.360> since<00:00:51.570> there's

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
charge is actually to map since there's

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.869 
charge is actually to map since there's
one<00:00:51.989> map<00:00:52.170> sensor<00:00:52.410> right<00:00:52.680> there<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.100> then

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
one map sensor right there and then

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.340 
one map sensor right there and then
there's<00:00:54.059> another<00:00:54.149> map<00:00:54.510> sensor<00:00:54.780> down<00:00:55.050> below

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
there's another map sensor down below

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.799 
there's another map sensor down below
and<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.649> got<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.920> take<00:00:56.129> off<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:57.000> intake<00:00:57.570> tube

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
and you got to take off the intake tube

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.290 
and you got to take off the intake tube
order<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.440> get<00:00:58.559> at<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.670> want<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.120> piece<00:01:00.270> of

order to get at it I want a piece of

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.510 
order to get at it I want a piece of
advice<00:01:00.480> you're<00:01:01.230> feeling<00:01:01.559> ejected<00:01:01.920> hoses

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
advice you're feeling ejected hoses

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.100 
advice you're feeling ejected hoses
remove<00:01:03.480> them<00:01:03.930> as<00:01:04.199> well<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:05.630> made<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.659> mistake<00:01:06.810> of

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
remove them as well I made a mistake of

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:15.109 
remove them as well I made a mistake of
not<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:09.890> accidentally<00:01:13.520> broke<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.700> tit

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
not and I accidentally broke that tit

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.789 
not and I accidentally broke that tit
off<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.570> one<00:01:15.750> when<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.170> was<00:01:16.350> wrecked<00:01:16.590> on<00:01:16.680> the

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
off of the one when I was wrecked on the

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.310 
off of the one when I was wrecked on the
map<00:01:16.979> sensors<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.360> fuel<00:01:18.630> rail<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.869> sourced

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
map sensors and the fuel rail I sourced

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.920 
map sensors and the fuel rail I sourced
went<00:01:19.530> out<00:01:19.650> for<00:01:19.890> like<00:01:20.070> 60<00:01:20.520> bucks<00:01:20.750> otherwise<00:01:21.750> if

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
went out for like 60 bucks otherwise if

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.620 
went out for like 60 bucks otherwise if
you<00:01:22.020> get<00:01:22.200> one<00:01:22.350> from<00:01:22.560> players<00:01:22.890> from<00:01:23.400> FST<00:01:24.360> sled

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
you get one from players from FST sled

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.690 
you get one from players from FST sled
they're<00:01:24.900> actually<00:01:25.350> about<00:01:26.159> two<00:01:26.369> hundred<00:01:26.430> bucks

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
they're actually about two hundred bucks

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.569 
they're actually about two hundred bucks
for<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.939> fuel<00:01:27.180> rail<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:28.070> be<00:01:29.070> careful<00:01:29.400> not<00:01:29.460> to

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
for a fuel rail so be careful not to

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.850 
for a fuel rail so be careful not to
break<00:01:29.729> it

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
break it

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.350 
break it
so<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.950> first<00:01:32.189> map<00:01:32.369> sensors<00:01:32.790> pulled<00:01:33.030> out<00:01:33.180> and

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
so the first map sensors pulled out and

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.789 
so the first map sensors pulled out and
there's<00:01:33.540> some<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.710> would

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
there's some on it so that would

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.770 
there's some on it so that would
definitely<00:01:35.130> cause<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.310> problem<00:01:35.579> because<00:01:36.570> your

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
definitely cause a problem because your

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.569 
definitely cause a problem because your
map<00:01:36.900> sensors<00:01:37.350> top<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.710> blow<00:01:37.860> have<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.340> match

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
map sensors top and blow have to match

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.600 
map sensors top and blow have to match
in<00:01:39.030> order<00:01:39.420> for<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.770> engine<00:01:41.040> not<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.280> single<00:01:41.579> it

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
in order for the engine not to single it

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.190 
in order for the engine not to single it
code<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.060> over<00:01:42.299> boost<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.750> put<00:01:42.899> in<00:01:42.990> safety

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
code to over boost and put in safety

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.289 
code to over boost and put in safety
mode<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:44.310> I'm<00:01:44.490> going<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.670> clean<00:01:44.850> out<00:01:45.000> one<00:01:45.149> in<00:01:45.240> a

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.340 
mode so I'm going to clean out one in a
bit<00:01:45.450> I'm<00:01:45.600> going<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.780> pull<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.020> other<00:01:46.140> one<00:01:46.320> out

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
bit I'm going to pull the other one out

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.420 
bit I'm going to pull the other one out
to<00:01:46.829> now<00:01:48.049> and<00:01:49.049> there<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.040> see<00:01:50.220> where<00:01:50.340> the

tube

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:13.310 

that's<00:02:06.660> all<00:02:06.870> got<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.080> be<00:02:07.140> cleaned<00:02:07.410> out<00:02:12.230> here<00:02:13.230> we

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
that's all got to be cleaned out here we

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.560 
that's all got to be cleaned out here we
go<00:02:13.440> over<00:02:13.680> with<00:02:13.740> map<00:02:14.010> sensors<00:02:14.400> there's<00:02:15.300> lower

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
go over with map sensors there's lower

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.360 
go over with map sensors there's lower
one<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:16.470> is<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.770> upper<00:02:17.040> one

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
one this is the upper one

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.660 
one this is the upper one
they<00:02:18.030> are<00:02:18.330> both<00:02:18.630> covered<00:02:18.990> in<00:02:19.080> crap<00:02:19.590> so<00:02:20.520> that's

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
they are both covered in crap so that's

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.330 
they are both covered in crap so that's
going<00:02:20.820> to<00:02:20.910> be<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.030> big<00:02:21.210> reason<00:02:21.410> why<00:02:22.410> my<00:02:22.830> rpm<00:02:23.220> is

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
going to be a big reason why my rpm is

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.930 
going to be a big reason why my rpm is
limited<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.730> 6600<00:02:25.040> they'll<00:02:26.040> go<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.190> players<00:02:26.520> to

the intercooler suction is right down

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.650 
the intercooler suction is right down
there<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.370> actually<00:02:59.730> points<00:03:00.060> down<00:03:00.209> towards

there and actually points down towards

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.820 
there and actually points down towards
the<00:03:00.989> hall<00:03:01.680> or<00:03:01.890> belly<00:03:02.070> of<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.489> boat<00:03:03.320> so<00:03:04.320> if<00:03:04.590> your

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
the hall or belly of the boat so if your

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.800 
the hall or belly of the boat so if your
hull<00:03:05.190> starts<00:03:05.520> taking<00:03:05.820> on<00:03:05.940> water<00:03:06.180> well<00:03:06.510> your

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
hull starts taking on water well your

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.030 
turbo is going to suck the water up put
it<00:03:08.520> through<00:03:08.640> your<00:03:08.700> cooler<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:10.170> then<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:10.950> air

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
it through your cooler and then the air

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.020 
it through your cooler and then the air
pressure<00:03:11.250> is<00:03:11.400> going<00:03:11.519> to<00:03:11.580> push<00:03:11.730> it<00:03:11.880> through

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
pressure is going to push it through

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.970 
pressure is going to push it through
into<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.810> engine<00:03:13.080> where<00:03:13.230> your<00:03:13.350> map<00:03:13.500> sensors

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
into the engine where your map sensors

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.280 
into the engine where your map sensors
going<00:03:14.130> to<00:03:14.190> get<00:03:14.310> plugged<00:03:14.489> up<00:03:15.110> another<00:03:16.110> thing

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
going to get plugged up another thing

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.080 
going to get plugged up another thing
too<00:03:17.090> I'll<00:03:18.090> go<00:03:18.269> over<00:03:18.330> the<00:03:18.450> other<00:03:18.540> side<00:03:20.090> this

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
too I'll go over the other side this

hose right here can't really tell but it

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.210 
hose right here can't really tell but it
goes<00:03:24.510> down<00:03:24.690> to<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.930> suction<00:03:25.320> manifold<00:03:26.040> right

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
goes down to the suction manifold right

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.240 
goes down to the suction manifold right

problems<00:03:53.040> like<00:03:53.250> if<00:03:54.090> you're<00:03:54.269> limited<00:03:54.660> to<00:03:54.860> 5,500

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
problems like if you're limited to 5,500

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.569 
problems like if you're limited to 5,500
or<00:03:56.489> if<00:03:57.209> you're<00:03:57.390> if<00:03:57.870> you're<00:03:57.930> running<00:03:58.320> and<00:03:58.680> he

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
or if you're if you're running and he

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.220 
or if you're if you're running and he
pins<00:03:59.820> at<00:03:59.910> the<00:03:59.940> bottle<00:04:00.390> and<00:04:00.570> it<00:04:00.750> just<00:04:00.959> kind<00:04:01.170> of

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
pins at the bottle and it just kind of

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.949 
pins at the bottle and it just kind of
stalls<00:04:01.530> or<00:04:01.739> jerks<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:02.280> then<00:04:03.120> kind<00:04:03.570> of<00:04:03.630> goes

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
stalls or jerks and then kind of goes

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.640 
stalls or jerks and then kind of goes
into<00:04:04.320> like<00:04:04.530> a<00:04:04.590> warning<00:04:05.190> safe<00:04:05.430> mode<00:04:06.440> it's<00:04:07.440> going

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
into like a warning safe mode it's going

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.650 
into like a warning safe mode it's going
to<00:04:07.709> be<00:04:07.860> the<00:04:08.220> map<00:04:08.459> sensors<00:04:08.910> it<00:04:09.060> takes<00:04:09.239> about<00:04:09.329> 20

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
to be the map sensors it takes about 20

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.090 
to be the map sensors it takes about 20
minutes<00:04:09.930> to<00:04:09.959> pull<00:04:10.170> them<00:04:10.320> out<00:04:10.440> clean<00:04:10.680> them<00:04:10.920> put

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
minutes to pull them out clean them put

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.920 
minutes to pull them out clean them put
them<00:04:11.190> back<00:04:11.310> in

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
them back in

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.960 
them back in
I<00:04:12.980> wish<00:04:13.980> there<00:04:14.159> was<00:04:14.220> something<00:04:14.489> a<00:04:14.640> little<00:04:14.879> bit

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
I wish there was something a little bit

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.289 
I wish there was something a little bit
easier<00:04:15.269> to<00:04:15.540> get<00:04:15.900> around<00:04:16.049> this<00:04:16.290> work<00:04:16.530> on<00:04:16.739> it<00:04:16.889> but

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
easier to get around this work on it but

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.909 
easier to get around this work on it but
for<00:04:18.299> right<00:04:18.419> now<00:04:18.479> that's<00:04:19.079> where<00:04:19.829> these

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
for right now that's where these

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:25.520 
for right now that's where these
machines<00:04:20.310> stand<00:04:21.120> with<00:04:21.389> that<00:04:24.169> so<00:04:25.169> now<00:04:25.260> there<00:04:25.440> it

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
machines stand with that so now there it

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.629 
machines stand with that so now there it
is<00:04:25.620> all<00:04:25.800> back<00:04:25.949> together<00:04:26.100> we're<00:04:26.370> just<00:04:26.490> going<00:04:26.610> to

is all back together we're just going to

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.010 
is all back together we're just going to
start<00:04:26.880> it<00:04:26.970> up<00:04:27.090> now<00:04:27.300> and<00:04:27.330> check<00:04:27.600> for<00:04:27.810> warning

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
start it up now and check for warning

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:55.230 
start it up now and check for warning
lights

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.260

I am just going to show you the whole
unit<00:04:58.600> right<00:04:58.780> here<00:04:59.080> I<00:04:59.259> picked<00:04:59.650> it<00:04:59.830> up<00:04:59.889> at<00:05:00.069> the

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
unit right here I picked it up at the

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.520 
unit right here I picked it up at the
blown<00:05:00.340> turbo<00:05:00.759> you<00:05:01.630> place<00:05:01.870> the<00:05:01.990> turbo<00:05:02.350> but
