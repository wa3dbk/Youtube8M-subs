hey everybody it's cute if I'm gonna
make<00:00:04.290> this<00:00:04.439> video<00:00:04.770> I<00:00:05.420> hesitated<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.569> make<00:00:06.720> this

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
make this video I hesitated to make this

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.960 
make this video I hesitated to make this
video<00:00:07.470> just<00:00:07.529> because<00:00:07.920> it's<00:00:08.370> incredibly

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
video just because it's incredibly

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.199 
video just because it's incredibly
advanced<00:00:09.900> poker<00:00:10.230> strategy<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:11.249> almost

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:12.209 
advanced poker strategy and almost

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:13.640 
advanced poker strategy and almost
didn't<00:00:12.419> want<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.690> give<00:00:12.809> all<00:00:12.959> this<00:00:13.110> gold<00:00:13.379> away

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
didn't want to give all this gold away

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.190 
didn't want to give all this gold away
but<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.419> figure<00:00:15.419> people<00:00:15.690> probably<00:00:15.870> want<00:00:16.170> to

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.200 
but I figure people probably want to

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.570 
but I figure people probably want to
apply<00:00:16.379> it<00:00:16.440> correctly<00:00:16.650> anyway<00:00:17.190> so<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.520> don't

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
apply it correctly anyway so I don't

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.190 
apply it correctly anyway so I don't
have<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:17.970> worry<00:00:18.180> about<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.600> impact<00:00:19.020> on<00:00:19.170> my

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:19.200 
have to worry about the impact on my

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
have to worry about the impact on my
game<00:00:19.590> so<00:00:20.130> much<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:21.590> let's<00:00:22.590> go<00:00:22.770> ahead<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.100> get

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
game so much so let's go ahead and get

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.270 
game so much so let's go ahead and get
started<00:00:23.690> the<00:00:24.690> first<00:00:24.720> situation<00:00:25.140> arises<00:00:26.130> we

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:26.280 
started the first situation arises we

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.490 
started the first situation arises we
face<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.610> raise<00:00:26.970> preflop<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.630> we<00:00:27.960> have<00:00:28.080> ace<00:00:28.260> ace

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
face a raise preflop and we have ace ace

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.119 
face a raise preflop and we have ace ace
and<00:00:28.880> here<00:00:29.880> comes<00:00:30.260> the<00:00:31.260> advanced<00:00:31.530> strategy<00:00:31.980> now

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.129 
and here comes the advanced strategy now

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:34.069 
and here comes the advanced strategy now
I<00:00:32.160> again<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.239> just<00:00:33.390> want<00:00:33.539> to<00:00:33.600> preface<00:00:33.749> this<00:00:34.019> by

I again I just want to preface this by

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.520 
I again I just want to preface this by
saying<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:35.660> stumbled<00:00:36.660> across<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.960> lot<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.350> these

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
saying I stumbled across a lot of these

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.180 
saying I stumbled across a lot of these
strategies<00:00:37.859> playing<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.210> know<00:00:39.409> 45<00:00:40.409> tables<00:00:41.039> at

strategies playing you know 45 tables at

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.959 
strategies playing you know 45 tables at
the<00:00:41.309> Beast<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.809> here<00:00:43.109> it<00:00:43.170> comes<00:00:43.409> ready

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
there it is the fold and a lot of people

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:48.529 
there it is the fold and a lot of people
would<00:00:47.699> go<00:00:47.879> wow

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
would go wow

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.610 
would go wow
you<00:00:48.659> know<00:00:48.780> what's<00:00:49.769> going<00:00:49.949> on<00:00:50.190> here<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.699> I

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
you know what's going on here and I

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.700 
you know what's going on here and I
wouldn't<00:00:52.620> even<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.339> much<00:00:53.550> call<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.300> play<00:00:54.780> so

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
wouldn't even so much call this play so

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.380 
wouldn't even so much call this play so
err<00:00:55.979> and<00:00:56.339> we<00:00:56.550> can<00:00:56.699> see<00:00:56.850> another<00:00:57.030> one<00:00:57.149> here<00:00:57.239> just

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
err and we can see another one here just

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.739 
err and we can see another one here just
even<00:00:58.050> without<00:00:58.199> facing<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.829> raise<00:00:59.129> just<00:00:59.749> open

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:00.749 
even without facing a raise just open

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:05.329 
even without facing a raise just open
fold<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:03.470> you<00:01:04.470> know<00:01:04.559> we<00:01:04.769> could<00:01:04.890> look<00:01:05.040> at<00:01:05.190> some

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
fold and you know we could look at some

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.840 
fold and you know we could look at some
different<00:01:05.489> ones<00:01:05.820> again<00:01:06.270> just<00:01:06.479> open<00:01:06.780> fold<00:01:07.079> I

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
different ones again just open fold I

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.999 
different ones again just open fold I
wouldn't<00:01:08.850> call<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.149> a<00:01:09.210> slow<00:01:09.719> place<00:01:10.079> as<00:01:10.500> much

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
wouldn't call this a slow place as much

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.609 
wouldn't call this a slow place as much
as<00:01:11.250> maybe<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.640> just<00:01:11.850> call<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.240> reverse<00:01:12.659> fast

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
as maybe I just call it a reverse fast

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.190 
as maybe I just call it a reverse fast
play<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:17.060> plenty<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.149> these<00:01:18.240> we<00:01:18.479> can<00:01:18.689> look<00:01:18.899> at

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
play and plenty of these we can look at

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.289 
play and plenty of these we can look at
open<00:01:19.890> fold<00:01:20.250> as<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> matter<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.850> fact<00:01:21.119> if<00:01:21.270> you

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
open fold as a matter of fact if you

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.910 
open fold as a matter of fact if you
look<00:01:21.570> at<00:01:21.689> my<00:01:21.899> database<00:01:23.240> folded<00:01:24.469> preflop<00:01:25.469> and

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
look at my database folded preflop and

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.850 
look at my database folded preflop and
you<00:01:26.369> know<00:01:26.460> how<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.759> ace<00:01:27.000> ace<00:01:27.329> you'll<00:01:28.259> see<00:01:28.439> I've

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
you know how to ace ace you'll see I've

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.240 
you know how to ace ace you'll see I've
done<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.280> 88<00:01:29.939> times<00:01:30.329> as<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:31.079> matter<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.710> fact

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
done this 88 times as a matter of fact

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.889 
done this 88 times as a matter of fact
there's<00:01:32.820> probably<00:01:33.539> some<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.109> here<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.789> I

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
there's probably some in here that I

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:39.499 
there's probably some in here that I
would<00:01:36.899> consider<00:01:37.229> extremely<00:01:38.039> advanced<00:01:38.670> let's

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509

plenty of these here we go again oh look
at<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.020> three<00:01:55.409> bet<00:01:55.649> into<00:01:56.549> the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.669 
at this this is the three bet into the
fold<00:01:58.369> so<00:01:59.479> again<00:02:00.479> incredibly<00:02:01.020> advanced<00:02:01.560> as<00:02:01.649> a

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.530 
but I would say you know if your VP IP
is<00:02:10.319> over<00:02:10.890> 95<00:02:11.550> where<00:02:11.730> they<00:02:11.849> say<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.120> probably

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
is over 95 where they say you probably

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.880 
is over 95 where they say you probably
have<00:02:12.840> some<00:02:13.080> major<00:02:13.290> leaks

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
have some major leaks

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.450 
have some major leaks
okay<00:02:15.670> now<00:02:15.820> on<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.060> flip<00:02:16.360> side<00:02:16.860> we<00:02:17.860> have<00:02:18.040> a<00:02:18.070> play

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
okay now on the flip side we have a play

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.630 
okay now on the flip side we have a play
like<00:02:18.760> this<00:02:19.150> you<00:02:20.020> can<00:02:20.140> see<00:02:20.320> we're<00:02:20.470> at<00:02:20.590> an<00:02:20.770> NL<00:02:21.160> 50

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
like this you can see we're at an NL 50

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.410 
like this you can see we're at an NL 50
game<00:02:21.880> I'm<00:02:22.810> starting<00:02:23.500> you<00:02:23.770> know<00:02:24.040> close<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.610> 300

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
game I'm starting you know close to 300

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.930 
game I'm starting you know close to 300
times<00:02:25.630> here<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:26.380> what<00:02:26.860> makes<00:02:27.160> this<00:02:27.430> extra

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
times here and what makes this extra

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.940 
times here and what makes this extra
tricky<00:02:28.240> and<00:02:28.630> since<00:02:28.960> I'm<00:02:29.110> in<00:02:29.290> playing<00:02:29.710> so<00:02:29.860> many

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
tricky and since I'm in playing so many

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.280 
tricky and since I'm in playing so many
tables<00:02:30.450> probably<00:02:31.450> didn't<00:02:31.660> recognize<00:02:32.080> the

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
tables probably didn't recognize the

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.410 
tables probably didn't recognize the
fact<00:02:32.590> that<00:02:32.770> you<00:02:33.100> know<00:02:33.190> I<00:02:33.220> was<00:02:33.430> 300<00:02:33.910> times<00:02:34.120> deep

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
fact that you know I was 300 times deep

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.690 
fact that you know I was 300 times deep
but<00:02:34.690> despite<00:02:35.320> that<00:02:35.530> fact<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:36.190> this<00:02:36.340> is<00:02:36.520> where

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
but despite that fact and this is where

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.420 
but despite that fact and this is where
you<00:02:36.760> develop<00:02:37.180> an<00:02:37.300> intuition<00:02:38.160> you<00:02:39.160> know<00:02:39.280> the

you develop an intuition you know the

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.760 
you develop an intuition you know the
more<00:02:39.610> you<00:02:39.700> study<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.060> game<00:02:40.540> I<00:02:40.900> take<00:02:41.350> a<00:02:41.380> play

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
more you study the game I take a play

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.100 
more you study the game I take a play
here<00:02:42.100> that<00:02:42.280> I<00:02:42.310> would<00:02:42.610> call<00:02:43.000> maybe<00:02:43.630> not<00:02:43.840> so<00:02:43.990> much

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
here that I would call maybe not so much

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.420 
here that I would call maybe not so much
a<00:02:44.170> fast<00:02:44.650> play<00:02:45.060> but<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.090> reverse<00:02:46.740> slow<00:02:47.740> play<00:02:48.100> and

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
a fast play but a reverse slow play and

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
a fast play but a reverse slow play and
that<00:02:49.000> is<00:02:49.240> just<00:02:49.570> an<00:02:50.170> open<00:02:50.530> ship<00:02:50.920> with<00:02:51.790> a<00:02:51.820> 7-9

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
that is just an open ship with a 7-9

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.140 
that is just an open ship with a 7-9
suited<00:02:52.959> now<00:02:53.110> again<00:02:53.709> people<00:02:54.670> might<00:02:54.850> look<00:02:55.030> at

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
suited now again people might look at

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.900 
suited now again people might look at
this<00:02:55.360> and<00:02:55.570> go<00:02:55.690> whoa<00:02:56.230> what<00:02:57.070> is<00:02:57.190> going<00:02:57.520> on<00:02:57.700> but

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
this and go whoa what is going on but

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.910 
this and go whoa what is going on but
let's<00:02:58.090> keep<00:02:58.209> in<00:02:58.360> mind<00:02:58.390> I<00:02:58.930> do<00:02:59.230> have<00:02:59.740> the

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
let's keep in mind I do have the

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.540 
let's keep in mind I do have the
opportunity<00:03:00.580> to<00:03:00.760> win<00:03:00.910> 75<00:03:01.390> cents<00:03:02.050> and<00:03:02.610> I<00:03:04.140> have

opportunity to win 75 cents and I have

opportunity to win 75 cents and I have
probably<00:03:06.550> you<00:03:07.209> know<00:03:07.330> a<00:03:07.360> really<00:03:07.630> large<00:03:08.080> amount

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
probably you know a really large amount

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.140 
probably you know a really large amount
of<00:03:08.530> fold<00:03:08.830> equity<00:03:11.490> unless<00:03:12.490> you're<00:03:13.000> dealing

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
of fold equity unless you're dealing

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.750 
of fold equity unless you're dealing
with<00:03:13.360> times<00:03:13.810> you<00:03:14.440> know<00:03:14.560> when<00:03:16.050> someone<00:03:17.700> ends<00:03:18.700> up

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
with times you know when someone ends up

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.570 
with times you know when someone ends up
with<00:03:18.970> a<00:03:19.000> hand<00:03:19.300> like<00:03:19.480> King<00:03:19.750> King<00:03:19.989> now<00:03:20.489> you<00:03:21.489> know

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
with a hand like King King now you know

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.040 
with a hand like King King now you know
you<00:03:21.640> see<00:03:22.030> that<00:03:22.300> you<00:03:22.690> know<00:03:22.780> when<00:03:22.930> you're

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
you see that you know when you're

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.890 
you see that you know when you're
playing<00:03:23.080> you<00:03:23.500> go<00:03:23.650> WOW<00:03:24.160> you<00:03:24.820> know<00:03:25.060> this<00:03:25.660> is

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
playing you go WOW you know this is

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.229 
playing you go WOW you know this is
major<00:03:26.230> run<00:03:26.680> bad<00:03:26.980> when<00:03:27.310> I<00:03:27.340> just<00:03:27.730> pulled<00:03:28.060> off

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
major run bad when I just pulled off

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.720 
major run bad when I just pulled off
what<00:03:29.080> I<00:03:29.110> would<00:03:29.470> call<00:03:29.769> you<00:03:30.519> know<00:03:30.610> an

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
what I would call you know an

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.890 
what I would call you know an
exceptional<00:03:31.450> move<00:03:31.750> but<00:03:32.430> sure<00:03:33.430> it<00:03:34.239> didn't<00:03:34.720> work

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
exceptional move but sure it didn't work

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.820 
exceptional move but sure it didn't work
this<00:03:35.170> time

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
this time

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.300 
this time
but<00:03:36.459> I<00:03:36.910> did<00:03:37.209> have<00:03:37.360> equity<00:03:37.870> and<00:03:38.140> the<00:03:38.230> times<00:03:38.500> you

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
but I did have equity and the times you

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.380 
but I did have equity and the times you
know<00:03:39.400> sometimes<00:03:39.760> I'm<00:03:39.880> going<00:03:40.000> to<00:03:40.060> win<00:03:40.180> a<00:03:40.209> huge

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
know sometimes I'm going to win a huge

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.690 
know sometimes I'm going to win a huge
pot<00:03:40.720> so<00:03:41.470> that<00:03:41.500> that<00:03:41.980> works<00:03:42.190> out<00:03:42.400> really<00:03:42.580> well

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
pot so that that works out really well

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.259 
pot so that that works out really well
now<00:03:43.630> as<00:03:43.989> you<00:03:44.200> can<00:03:44.350> see<00:03:44.890> we<00:03:45.790> look<00:03:45.940> at<00:03:46.120> my

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
now as you can see we look at my

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.590 
now as you can see we look at my
database<00:03:46.930> here<00:03:47.850> these<00:03:48.850> are<00:03:49.090> you<00:03:49.330> know<00:03:49.450> I've

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
database here these are you know I've

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.380 
database here these are you know I've
done<00:03:49.840> a<00:03:49.900> play<00:03:50.320> like<00:03:50.560> this<00:03:50.800> 15<00:03:51.489> times<00:03:51.519> in<00:03:52.269> my

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
done a play like this 15 times in my

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.630 
done a play like this 15 times in my
database<00:03:52.780> you<00:03:53.350> know<00:03:53.500> here's<00:03:54.070> another<00:03:54.310> fine

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
database you know here's another fine

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.370 
database you know here's another fine
example<00:03:54.670> in<00:03:55.630> this<00:03:55.810> case<00:03:56.019> we're<00:03:56.200> only<00:03:56.230> a

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
example in this case we're only a

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.990 
example in this case we're only a
hundred<00:03:56.860> times<00:03:57.130> so<00:03:57.340> I<00:03:57.370> think<00:03:57.670> this<00:03:57.820> is

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
hundred times so I think this is

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.810 
hundred times so I think this is
probably<00:03:58.180> more<00:03:59.110> marginal<00:03:59.890> although<00:04:00.489> this<00:04:00.640> guy

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
probably more marginal although this guy

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.810 
probably more marginal although this guy
does<00:04:01.060> open<00:04:01.330> to<00:04:01.450> 80<00:04:01.630> cents<00:04:02.019> and<00:04:02.400> we<00:04:03.400> can<00:04:03.550> just<00:04:03.730> go

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
does open to 80 cents and we can just go

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.229 
does open to 80 cents and we can just go
ahead<00:04:03.940> and<00:04:04.180> ship<00:04:04.390> it<00:04:04.510> in<00:04:04.660> here<00:04:04.930> I<00:04:05.190> think<00:04:06.239> again

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
ahead and ship it in here I think again

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.270 
ahead and ship it in here I think again
an<00:04:07.630> exceptional<00:04:08.110> play<00:04:08.260> and<00:04:08.380> you<00:04:08.440> see<00:04:08.620> there<00:04:09.040> I

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
an exceptional play and you see there I

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.190 
an exceptional play and you see there I
actually<00:04:09.550> end<00:04:09.850> up<00:04:09.880> with<00:04:09.940> a<00:04:10.060> great<00:04:10.390> result<00:04:10.810> now

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
actually end up with a great result now

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.320 
actually end up with a great result now
what<00:04:11.350> I<00:04:11.380> normally<00:04:11.500> try<00:04:11.980> to<00:04:12.040> do<00:04:12.280> is<00:04:12.459> time<00:04:12.940> this

ahead and flat

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.880 
ahead and flat
we<00:05:57.680> flop<00:05:58.070> the<00:05:58.250> top<00:05:58.490> set<00:05:58.850> check<00:05:59.360> and<00:06:00.490> fold<00:06:01.490> and

we flop the top set check and fold and

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.560 
we flop the top set check and fold and
that's<00:06:03.890> especially<00:06:04.250> advanced<00:06:05.030> because<00:06:05.360> this

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:05.570 
that's especially advanced because this

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.770 
that's especially advanced because this
guy's<00:06:05.810> not<00:06:06.080> very<00:06:06.440> deep<00:06:06.860> and<00:06:07.540> there's<00:06:08.540> plenty

guy's not very deep and there's plenty

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.350 
guy's not very deep and there's plenty
of<00:06:08.930> these<00:06:09.110> we<00:06:09.320> could<00:06:09.440> look<00:06:09.680> at<00:06:09.950> again<00:06:10.880> middle

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
of these we could look at again middle

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.200 
of these we could look at again middle
set<00:06:11.660> here<00:06:12.200> we<00:06:12.290> actually<00:06:12.500> have<00:06:12.590> a<00:06:12.620> caller<00:06:13.210> and

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
set here we actually have a caller and

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.370 
set here we actually have a caller and
we<00:06:14.300> just<00:06:14.510> throw<00:06:14.750> it<00:06:14.840> away

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
we just throw it away

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.440 
we just throw it away
I<00:06:15.470> think<00:06:16.130> that<00:06:16.250> one<00:06:16.370> might<00:06:16.490> be<00:06:16.550> a<00:06:16.700> little<00:06:16.790> bit

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:17.450 
I think that one might be a little bit

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.690 
I think that one might be a little bit
more<00:06:17.750> obvious<00:06:17.900> than<00:06:18.350> the<00:06:18.470> other<00:06:18.650> ones<00:06:18.920> no<00:06:19.340> if

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.700 
more obvious than the other ones no if

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.450 
more obvious than the other ones no if
we<00:06:20.270> look<00:06:20.780> at<00:06:20.930> our<00:06:21.080> database<00:06:21.290> here<00:06:21.920> we<00:06:22.070> can<00:06:22.220> see

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
we look at our database here we can see

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.870 
we look at our database here we can see
that<00:06:22.870> you<00:06:23.870> know<00:06:23.990> we<00:06:24.140> folded<00:06:24.980> the<00:06:25.100> flop<00:06:25.460> made

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
that you know we folded the flop made

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.690 
that you know we folded the flop made
three<00:06:26.180> of<00:06:26.300> a<00:06:26.360> kind<00:06:26.390> with<00:06:27.080> with<00:06:27.560> two<00:06:28.070> cards

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:28.700 
three of a kind with with two cards

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.840 
three of a kind with with two cards
we've<00:06:29.330> done<00:06:29.540> this<00:06:29.660> 37<00:06:30.410> times<00:06:30.650> so<00:06:31.550> it's

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:31.850 
we've done this 37 times so it's

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.010 
we've done this 37 times so it's
actually<00:06:32.090> you<00:06:32.390> know<00:06:32.480> I<00:06:32.510> could<00:06:32.750> look<00:06:32.870> at

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020 
actually you know I could look at

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.530 
actually you know I could look at
percentages<00:06:33.680> here<00:06:34.010> to<00:06:34.130> see<00:06:34.370> you<00:06:35.120> know<00:06:35.240> how

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:35.540 
percentages here to see you know how

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.190 
percentages here to see you know how
often<00:06:35.780> we<00:06:35.990> should<00:06:36.140> do<00:06:36.380> it<00:06:36.530> but<00:06:37.520> I<00:06:37.550> think<00:06:37.930> 10<00:06:38.930> to

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.200 
often we should do it but I think 10 to

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.710 
often we should do it but I think 10 to
11%<00:06:39.590> of<00:06:39.980> the<00:06:40.040> time<00:06:40.310> is<00:06:40.490> probably

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 
11% of the time is probably

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.900 
11% of the time is probably
a<00:06:41.780> good<00:06:42.170> balancing<00:06:42.800> range<00:06:43.070> for<00:06:43.430> your<00:06:43.520> folding

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:43.910 
a good balancing range for your folding

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.060 
a good balancing range for your folding
range<00:06:44.150> royal<00:06:44.840> straight<00:06:45.050> flushes<00:06:45.380> are<00:06:45.680> another

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.070 
range royal straight flushes are another

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.600 
range royal straight flushes are another
great<00:06:46.790> hand<00:06:47.120> to<00:06:47.890> balance<00:06:48.890> your<00:06:48.980> folding<00:06:49.370> range

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
great hand to balance your folding range

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.690 
great hand to balance your folding range
we<00:06:49.850> could<00:06:50.000> just<00:06:50.270> call<00:06:50.480> this<00:06:50.510> having<00:06:51.200> a

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:51.700 
we could just call this having a

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.790 
we could just call this having a
uncapped<00:06:52.700> folding<00:06:53.480> range<00:06:53.750> but<00:06:54.500> I've<00:06:54.590> had<00:06:54.770> a

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
uncapped folding range but I've had a

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.470 
uncapped folding range but I've had a
lot<00:06:55.040> of<00:06:55.070> royal<00:06:55.430> straight<00:06:55.670> flushes<00:06:56.000> on<00:06:56.360> the

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:56.480 
lot of royal straight flushes on the

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.750 
lot of royal straight flushes on the
river<00:06:56.720> in<00:06:57.020> my<00:06:57.770> career<00:06:58.160> but<00:06:58.370> I've<00:06:58.490> only<00:06:58.610> shown

00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:58.760 
river in my career but I've only shown

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.340 
river in my career but I've only shown
down<00:06:59.240> to<00:07:00.040> one<00:07:01.040> of<00:07:01.130> them<00:07:01.250> was<00:07:01.430> live<00:07:01.760> and<00:07:02.360> player

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:03.350 
down to one of them was live and player

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.290 
down to one of them was live and player
made<00:07:03.560> a<00:07:03.590> big<00:07:03.830> bet<00:07:04.010> on<00:07:04.040> the<00:07:04.190> river<00:07:04.430> and<00:07:04.850> I<00:07:05.090> had

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300 
made a big bet on the river and I had

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.520 
made a big bet on the river and I had
that<00:07:05.510> royal<00:07:05.780> straight<00:07:05.960> flush<00:07:06.020> I<00:07:06.350> knew<00:07:06.500> I

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:06.530 
that royal straight flush I knew I

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.740 
that royal straight flush I knew I
should<00:07:06.800> throw<00:07:06.920> it<00:07:07.070> away<00:07:07.160> and<00:07:07.550> it<00:07:08.420> took<00:07:08.570> me

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:08.750 
should throw it away and it took me

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.920 
should throw it away and it took me
about<00:07:08.960> three<00:07:09.710> minutes<00:07:09.920> to<00:07:10.190> make<00:07:10.430> my<00:07:10.930> decision

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:11.930 
about three minutes to make my decision

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.330 
about three minutes to make my decision
I<00:07:12.020> actually<00:07:12.110> ended<00:07:12.350> up<00:07:12.410> calling<00:07:12.740> just<00:07:13.130> because

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:13.340 
I actually ended up calling just because

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.720 
I actually ended up calling just because
I<00:07:13.460> was<00:07:13.670> so<00:07:13.850> tilted<00:07:14.710> before<00:07:15.710> the<00:07:15.830> hand<00:07:16.100> happened

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:16.730 
I was so tilted before the hand happened

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.490 
I was so tilted before the hand happened
the<00:07:17.150> guy<00:07:17.360> called<00:07:17.660> the<00:07:17.780> time<00:07:18.050> around<00:07:18.290> me

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:18.500 
the guy called the time around me

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.560 
the guy called the time around me

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:20.570 
finally I called and I turned over my

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.180 
finally I called and I turned over my
