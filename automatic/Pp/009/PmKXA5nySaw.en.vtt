00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:56.430 
but yeah decided though when I

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.760 
but yeah decided though when I
customized<00:06:57.120> the<00:06:57.300> back<00:06:57.510> where<00:06:58.139> the<00:06:58.260> exhaust<00:06:58.590> is

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
customized the back where the exhaust is

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.230 
customized the back where the exhaust is
gonna<00:06:58.919> go<00:06:59.100> I<00:06:59.130> moved<00:06:59.460> to<00:06:59.580> me<00:06:59.730> in<00:06:59.850> a<00:06:59.880> little<00:07:00.090> bit

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 
gonna go I moved to me in a little bit

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.170 
gonna go I moved to me in a little bit
and<00:07:00.630> one<00:07:00.840> of<00:07:00.960> them<00:07:01.050> closer<00:07:01.320> together<00:07:01.560> so<00:07:02.130> I<00:07:02.790> was

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 
and one of them closer together so I was

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.120 
and one of them closer together so I was
gonna<00:07:03.540> put<00:07:03.750> a<00:07:03.780> window<00:07:04.169> in<00:07:04.380> the<00:07:04.470> back<00:07:04.710> but

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.130

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050 
decided not to do that because I wanted

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.090 
decided not to do that because I wanted
to<00:07:07.110> move<00:07:07.260> the<00:07:07.470> exhaust<00:07:07.830> and<00:07:08.070> stuff<00:07:08.280> like<00:07:08.460> that

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:12.419 
but I've got some other pieces that I

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:15.620 
but I've got some other pieces that I
made<00:07:12.630> up<00:07:12.810> so<00:07:13.020> far<00:07:13.260> a<00:07:13.400> custom-made<00:07:14.400> visor<00:07:14.910> and
