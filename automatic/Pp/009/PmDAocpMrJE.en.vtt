00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.800
 hello today i will you 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.750
 learn something practical so 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.439
 for example I do not know I'm saying anything 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.820
 what you finished a chord vest and 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.449
 you have no button that goes with 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.150
 all this I will teach you how 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.740
 make a fair with the hook and 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.179
 wool 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.980
 so it's very easy and very cute 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.349
 go it can go anywhere we can 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.960
 do a lot of things with and I will 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:38.100
 will also show a flower tutorial 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:42.060
 of a flower made with this base so 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.280
 we're going to start we're going to take mike 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:50.190
 in the air so a chain of 3 miles 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.870
 a two and three so I also specify 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.570
 that there is no moreover for the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.300
 hook of the wool appointed plus the 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.950
 wool on a big one and the hook too 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.790
 the more you will have big buttons it's 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:05.880
 everything so you make a chain of 3 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:09.859
 my you unite to the first with a 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.649
 mesh flowed so simply 

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:16.020
 so here is in fact you have a small 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:18.749
 donkey or a small ring that has formed 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:24.749
 so already you're going to make a stitch in 

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:25.789
 the air and inside this ring this 

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:28.439
 that you will do 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:30.689
 you're looking inside it's there 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.170
 inside you will do some 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:38.359
 tight meshes 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:42.889
 so there are no two numbers 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:42.889
 it's unlimited you'll see 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.910
 so now you're going to hold this son 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.830
 like that when we go around 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:57.660
 he will be hiding little by little so you 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.160
 continue you continue until 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.550
 you can not go past the hook to 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.550
 interior 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:34.329
 so there you see my hook is not happening 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.799
 more passes over it and many 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.989
 so that means it's the end 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.439
 what you will do now is 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.450
 just 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:47.980
 we can watch cut the thread you 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:51.189
 shoot ok that son there you go 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.870
 of course pass your needles 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:54.459
 allen in to sew it next 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.250
 took advantage of this son for blow of the 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.019
 button on your book 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.590
 so the button stays like these it's 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.590
 very cute 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:09.939
 Here it remains anything but dron 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:11.319
 I wanted to clarify if you do 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.840
 several buttons for your work 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.400
 count the number of tight hands that 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.849
 you are doing so that all are of the 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.840
 same time of the same size remember 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:24.939
 not here it was a little tutorial but 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.909
 super u of figure I find so I 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:30.689
 wanted to share it with you 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:30.689
 see you soon
