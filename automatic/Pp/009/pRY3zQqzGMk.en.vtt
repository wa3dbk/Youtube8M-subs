hey<00:00:09.420> guys<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.750> smarts<00:00:10.019> were<00:00:10.139> still<00:00:10.380> at

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
hey guys the smarts were still at

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.150 
hey guys the smarts were still at
computex<00:00:11.160> 2012<00:00:12.000> at<00:00:12.540> EVGA<00:00:13.320> with<00:00:13.620> me<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.799> Jacob

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
computex 2012 at EVGA with me is Jacob

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
computex 2012 at EVGA with me is Jacob
and<00:00:14.400> he's<00:00:14.969> holding<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.809> new<00:00:16.289> evj<00:00:16.770> card<00:00:17.039> which<00:00:17.940> is

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
and he's holding a new evj card which is

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.529 
and he's holding a new evj card which is
the<00:00:18.390> geforce<00:00:18.750> gtx<00:00:19.230> 690<00:00:19.800> hydro<00:00:20.279> copper<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:21.420> as

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
the geforce gtx 690 hydro copper and as

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.000 
the geforce gtx 690 hydro copper and as
you<00:00:21.630> can<00:00:21.779> see<00:00:21.810> it's<00:00:22.080> water<00:00:22.320> cold<00:00:22.619> which<00:00:22.890> is

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
you can see it's water cold which is

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.560 
you can see it's water cold which is
really<00:00:23.189> like<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.519> main<00:00:23.699> feature<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.390> this

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
really like the main feature of this

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.390 
really like the main feature of this
product<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:25.050> has<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.199> huge<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.980> really<00:00:26.070> heavy

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
product it has a huge and really heavy

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.550 
product it has a huge and really heavy
water<00:00:27.359> cooler<00:00:27.660> checkup<00:00:28.199> can<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.410> tell

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
water cooler checkup can you tell

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.200 
water cooler checkup can you tell
something<00:00:28.920> more<00:00:29.099> about<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.400> product<00:00:29.640> sure

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
something more about this product sure

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.410 
something more about this product sure
so<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:30.660> uses<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.230> gtx<00:00:31.769> 690<00:00:32.189> graphics<00:00:33.180> card

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
so this uses the gtx 690 graphics card

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.780 
so this uses the gtx 690 graphics card
from<00:00:33.600> EVGA<00:00:33.809> okay<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:34.980> preinstall<00:00:35.520> water

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
from EVGA okay and we preinstall water

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.540 
from EVGA okay and we preinstall water
block<00:00:36.000> on<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.800> you<00:00:37.800> know<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:38.070> essentially

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
block on it and you know it essentially

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.040 
block on it and you know it essentially
this<00:00:38.730> water<00:00:38.940> block<00:00:39.210> helps<00:00:39.660> reduce<00:00:39.930> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
this water block helps reduce the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.630 
this water block helps reduce the
temperatures<00:00:40.440> okay<00:00:40.920> it's<00:00:41.100> also<00:00:41.190> obviously

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
temperatures okay it's also obviously

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.850 
temperatures okay it's also obviously
quieter<00:00:42.030> since<00:00:42.239> there's<00:00:42.390> no<00:00:42.510> fan<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.020> when

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
quieter since there's no fan and when

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.020 
quieter since there's no fan and when
we're<00:00:44.010> talking<00:00:44.100> about<00:00:44.340> temperatures<00:00:44.640> it

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
we're talking about temperatures it

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.790 
we're talking about temperatures it
pretty<00:00:45.210> much<00:00:45.329> cuts<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.780> GPU<00:00:46.170> operating

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
pretty much cuts the GPU operating

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.470 
pretty much cuts the GPU operating
temperature<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.340> about<00:00:47.520> half<00:00:47.700> oh<00:00:47.969> wow<00:00:48.210> that's

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
temperature in about half oh wow that's

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.490 
temperature in about half oh wow that's
impressive<00:00:48.600> visit<00:00:49.050> like<00:00:49.230> your<00:00:49.440> own

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
impressive visit like your own

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.680 
impressive visit like your own
development<00:00:49.789> so<00:00:50.789> we<00:00:50.910> co-developed<00:00:51.510> this

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
development so we co-developed this

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.420 
development so we co-developed this
water<00:00:51.899> block<00:00:52.110> with<00:00:52.260> swiftech<00:00:52.710> mm-hmm<00:00:53.219> so

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
water block with swiftech mm-hmm so

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.490 
water block with swiftech mm-hmm so
swiftech<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.090> we've<00:00:54.719> worked<00:00:54.930> with<00:00:55.050> Swift<00:00:55.289> text

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
swiftech is we've worked with Swift text

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.529 
swiftech is we've worked with Swift text

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
speeds on this card we haven't finalized

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.800 
speeds on this card we haven't finalized
the<00:01:04.979> final<00:01:05.460> shipping<00:01:05.760> clock<00:01:06.060> speeds<00:01:06.390> but<00:01:06.659> we

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
the final shipping clock speeds but we

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.240 
the final shipping clock speeds but we
expect<00:01:06.900> users<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.619> be<00:01:07.740> able<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.979> overclock
