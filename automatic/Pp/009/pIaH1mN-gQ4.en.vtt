won't<00:00:52.110> get<00:00:52.289> my<00:00:52.410> papers<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.660> think<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.809> it's

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
won't get my papers I think that it's

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.870 
won't get my papers I think that it's
important<00:00:55.590> for<00:00:55.800> them<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.940> a

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
important for them to have a

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.290 
important for them to have a
seat<00:00:59.570> 11<00:01:00.050> physics<00:01:00.650> wells<00:01:00.920> when<00:01:01.850> it<00:01:01.940> is<00:01:02.090> burning

July<00:01:02.990> 19<00:01:03.560> the<00:01:03.980> day<00:01:04.130> after<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:04.580> Joker<00:01:04.820> book<00:01:05.120> is

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
July 19 the day after the Joker book is

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.730 
July 19 the day after the Joker book is
released<00:01:05.600> which<00:01:05.900> I<00:01:06.020> think<00:01:06.290> it's<00:01:06.440> kind<00:01:06.680> of

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
released which I think it's kind of

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:28.910 
released which I think it's kind of
ironic<00:01:06.890> step<00:01:07.730> the<00:01:08.030> he<00:01:08.180> later<00:01:08.510> died

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.440 

well<00:02:34.069> I<00:02:34.099> think<00:02:34.280> this<00:02:34.520> is<00:02:34.580> a<00:02:34.730> sporting<00:02:35.150> village

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
well I think this is a sporting village

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.120 
well I think this is a sporting village
if<00:02:35.599> they<00:02:35.780> do<00:02:35.840> not<00:02:36.170> talk<00:02:36.470> to<00:02:36.739> your<00:02:36.770> son<00:02:37.069> about

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
if they do not talk to your son about

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:57.450 
if they do not talk to your son about
anything<00:02:37.610> useful

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.250 

so<00:04:14.310> it's<00:04:14.610> just<00:04:14.790> a<00:04:14.910> very<00:04:15.150> terrible<00:04:15.900> or

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
so it's just a very terrible or

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.259 
so it's just a very terrible or
inappropriate<00:04:17.010> in<00:04:17.070> some<00:04:17.280> ways<00:04:17.489> to<00:04:17.910> keep<00:04:18.090> the

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
inappropriate in some ways to keep the

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:40.590 
inappropriate in some ways to keep the
attention

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600
