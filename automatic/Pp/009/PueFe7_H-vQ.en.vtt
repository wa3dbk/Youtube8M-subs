better<00:00:38.210> this<00:00:39.210> one<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.750> have<00:00:40.079> already<00:00:40.469> filled

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
better this one I have already filled

better this one I have already filled
for<00:00:41.969> 27<00:00:42.570> 5<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:44.070> like<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.550> actually<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.329> think

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
for 27 5 and I like it actually I think

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.450 
for 27 5 and I like it actually I think
I'm<00:00:46.530> just<00:00:46.559> going<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.920> keep<00:00:47.100> him<00:00:47.570> at<00:00:48.570> 27<00:00:48.870> 5<00:00:49.559> do

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
I'm just going to keep him at 27 5 do

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.229 
I'm just going to keep him at 27 5 do
all<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.670> them<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.000> 27<00:00:51.600> 5<00:00:52.730> sets<00:00:53.730> seems<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.120> be

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
all of them the 27 5 sets seems to be

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:08.050 
all of them the 27 5 sets seems to be
quiet<00:00:54.989> enough<00:01:04.580> nothing<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.790> package<00:01:06.030> but

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
quiet enough nothing in the package but

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.710 
quiet enough nothing in the package but

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.450 

of<00:01:19.049> course<00:01:19.350> I'm<00:01:19.500> gonna<00:01:19.650> be<00:01:19.770> tearing<00:01:20.250> them

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
of course I'm gonna be tearing them

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.390 
of course I'm gonna be tearing them
apart<00:01:21.170> but<00:01:23.240> how<00:01:24.240> will<00:01:24.509> be<00:01:24.750> changing<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
apart but how will be changing the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.740 
apart but how will be changing the
springs<00:01:27.409> to<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.860> soft<00:01:29.159> springs<00:01:29.610> also<00:01:30.240> by<00:01:30.420> Lucy

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
springs to the soft springs also by Lucy

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.490 
springs to the soft springs also by Lucy
have<00:01:33.750> one<00:01:34.020> here<00:01:34.790> and<00:01:35.810> these<00:01:36.810> are<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.170> springs

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
have one here and these are the springs

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:46.490 
have one here and these are the springs
they<00:01:37.740> came<00:01:39.409> this<00:01:41.630> is<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:43.080> stop<00:01:43.649> shock<00:01:45.500> which

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
they came this is the stop shock which

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.940 
they came this is the stop shock which
is<00:01:46.680> garbage<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.810> doesn't<00:01:48.810> cold<00:01:49.080> oil<00:01:49.320> at<00:01:49.740> all

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
is garbage and doesn't cold oil at all

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.740 
is garbage and doesn't cold oil at all
don't<00:01:50.940> know<00:01:51.060> if<00:01:51.149> it's<00:01:51.300> because<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.630> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
don't know if it's because of the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.820 
don't know if it's because of the
plastic<00:01:52.170> cap<00:01:52.409> or<00:01:53.240> just<00:01:54.240> just<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.319> poor<00:01:55.590> design

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
plastic cap or just just a poor design

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.609 
plastic cap or just just a poor design
in<00:01:56.310> general<00:01:58.159> that<00:01:59.159> being<00:01:59.429> said<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.909> micro<00:02:00.210> SCT

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
in general that being said the micro SCT

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.600 
in general that being said the micro SCT
it's<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.800> small<00:02:02.159> thing<00:02:04.069> there's<00:02:05.069> not<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.340> whole

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
it's a small thing there's not a whole

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.650 
it's a small thing there's not a whole
lot<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.890> but<00:02:07.890> just<00:02:08.489> for<00:02:08.729> better<00:02:09.300> shot

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
lot to it but just for better shot

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.030 
lot to it but just for better shot
performance<00:02:10.790> we're<00:02:11.790> gonna<00:02:12.000> go<00:02:12.510> ahead<00:02:12.600> and

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
performance we're gonna go ahead and

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:26.710 
performance we're gonna go ahead and
upgrade

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.450 

it's<00:02:27.200> a<00:02:27.260> pretty<00:02:27.560> standard<00:02:29.590> shot<00:02:30.590> set<00:02:30.950> up<00:02:31.750> so

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
it's a pretty standard shot set up so

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:42.970 
it's a pretty standard shot set up so
I'm<00:02:34.460> going<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.510> go<00:02:35.780> ahead<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:39.310> put<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:41.980> into

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
I'm going to go ahead and put the into

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.140 
I'm going to go ahead and put the into
high<00:02:43.370> speed

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:55.250 

so<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:51.920> we<00:02:52.920> can<00:02:53.069> get<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.370> process<00:02:54.019> going<00:02:55.019> a

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
so that we can get the process going a

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:09.220 
so that we can get the process going a
little<00:02:55.439> quicker

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:32.399 

you

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:32.409 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:35.199 

so<00:03:33.409> there<00:03:33.590> does<00:03:33.890> actually<00:03:34.190> seem<00:03:34.640> to<00:03:34.790> be<00:03:34.909> a<00:03:34.940> fair

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
so there does actually seem to be a fair

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.530 
so there does actually seem to be a fair
amount<00:03:35.330> of<00:03:35.569> oil<00:03:35.980> inside<00:03:37.120> but<00:03:38.120> we're<00:03:38.299> still

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
amount of oil inside but we're still

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.460 
amount of oil inside but we're still
going<00:03:38.659> to<00:03:38.750> change<00:03:39.590> them<00:03:39.769> out<00:03:41.290> I'm<00:03:42.290> actually

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
going to change them out I'm actually

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.830 
going to change them out I'm actually
gonna<00:03:42.709> go<00:03:42.920> ahead<00:03:43.010> and<00:03:43.159> try<00:03:43.489> the<00:03:43.610> 35<00:03:44.360> weight<00:03:44.629> in

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
gonna go ahead and try the 35 weight in

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:54.570 
gonna go ahead and try the 35 weight in
one<00:03:45.049> see<00:03:45.470> how<00:03:45.620> it<00:03:45.799> good

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:11.280 

you

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:18.909 

this<00:04:12.290> is<00:04:12.410> the<00:04:12.530> 35<00:04:16.209> the<00:04:17.410> 27.5<00:04:18.410> feels<00:04:18.709> much

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
this is the 35 the 27.5 feels much

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:24.220 
this is the 35 the 27.5 feels much
better<00:04:19.359> for<00:04:20.359> me<00:04:20.450> for<00:04:20.900> my<00:04:21.049> application<00:04:23.230> so

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
better for me for my application so

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:31.930 
better for me for my application so
we're<00:04:24.380> going<00:04:24.500> to<00:04:24.620> go

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.000 

I'm<00:04:32.540> gonna<00:04:32.750> try<00:04:32.990> 35<00:04:33.710> in<00:04:33.920> the<00:04:34.040> back<00:04:35.800> 27<00:04:36.800> in<00:04:36.920> the

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
I'm gonna try 35 in the back 27 in the

00:04:37.010 --> 00:07:12.610 
I'm gonna try 35 in the back 27 in the
front<00:04:45.670> so<00:04:46.670> we'll<00:04:46.820> go<00:04:47.000> 35<00:04:47.840> rear<00:04:48.200> 27<00:04:49.040> front

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:12.620 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:19.059 

okay<00:07:13.620> so<00:07:13.680> here<00:07:13.949> we<00:07:14.069> have<00:07:17.150> front<00:07:18.150> and<00:07:18.330> rear

00:07:19.059 --> 00:07:19.069 
okay so here we have front and rear

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:25.580 
okay so here we have front and rear
micro<00:07:20.069> SCT<00:07:20.280> shock<00:07:21.090> springs<00:07:24.319> these<00:07:25.319> are<00:07:25.530> the

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:25.590
