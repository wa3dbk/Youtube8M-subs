00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
where I let this dry you can also speed

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.030 
where I let this dry you can also speed
it<00:05:29.290> up<00:05:29.380> with<00:05:29.740> a<00:05:29.979> hedge<00:05:30.190> hair<00:05:30.580> dryer<00:05:30.790> on<00:05:32.040> warm

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
setting you want to hold it a decent

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.390 
setting you want to hold it a decent
distance<00:05:40.840> away<00:05:41.139> because<00:05:41.560> even<00:05:42.010> i'm<00:05:42.100> the<00:05:42.220> one

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
distance away because even i'm the one

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:53.070 
distance away because even i'm the one
setting<00:05:42.699> with<00:05:43.360> the<00:05:43.510> school<00:05:43.690> setting

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.350

so add as many layers as you see fit add

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.290 
so add as many layers as you see fit add
one<00:06:07.250> more<00:06:07.430> layer<00:06:07.490> just<00:06:07.730> for<00:06:08.300> security<00:06:10.300> this

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
one more layer just for security this
