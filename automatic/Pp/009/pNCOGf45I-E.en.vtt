00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:46.510 
pinhole for the mic now around the back
here<00:04:44.930> we've<00:04:45.169> got<00:04:45.289> the<00:04:45.409> battery<00:04:45.800> cover<00:04:46.009> and

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
here we've got the battery cover and

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.159 
here we've got the battery cover and
it's<00:04:46.639> got<00:04:46.789> a<00:04:46.819> sort<00:04:47.029> of<00:04:47.089> setting<00:04:47.509> Sheen<00:04:47.869> to<00:04:48.110> it

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
it's got a sort of setting Sheen to it

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:49.989 
it's got a sort of setting Sheen to it
so<00:04:48.439> the<00:04:48.529> fact<00:04:48.649> that<00:04:48.800> it's<00:04:49.039> not<00:04:49.189> a<00:04:49.249> glossy<00:04:49.819> back

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:49.999 
so the fact that it's not a glossy back

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:51.730 
so the fact that it's not a glossy back
and<00:04:50.360> that<00:04:50.689> it's<00:04:50.809> white<00:04:51.110> means<00:04:51.409> it<00:04:51.559> doesn't

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
and that it's white means it doesn't

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.189 
and that it's white means it doesn't
show<00:04:51.979> fingerprints<00:04:52.550> too<00:04:52.819> much<00:04:53.199> underneath

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 
show fingerprints too much underneath

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:57.459

00:04:59.619 --> 00:04:59.629 
milliamp hours which might not sound

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:01.450 
milliamp hours which might not sound
like<00:04:59.809> a<00:04:59.930> lot<00:05:00.050> but<00:05:00.469> this<00:05:00.830> is<00:05:00.919> quite<00:05:01.159> a<00:05:01.189> low

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460

00:05:43.179 --> 00:05:43.189 
specification but coming in at just over

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:45.100 
specification but coming in at just over
a<00:05:43.430> hundred<00:05:43.819> pounds<00:05:43.999> I<00:05:44.419> think<00:05:44.899> this<00:05:44.990> is<00:05:45.080> a

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
a hundred pounds I think this is a

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.320 
a hundred pounds I think this is a
brilliant<00:05:45.409> choice<00:05:45.979> for<00:05:46.279> a<00:05:46.309> first<00:05:46.550> handset<00:05:47.059> for

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
brilliant choice for a first handset for

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.509 
brilliant choice for a first handset for
somebody<00:05:47.719> the<00:05:48.169> fact<00:05:48.379> we've<00:05:48.529> got<00:05:48.649> bbm<00:05:49.129> on<00:05:49.279> here

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:49.519 
somebody the fact we've got bbm on here

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:51.369 
somebody the fact we've got bbm on here
would<00:05:49.639> also<00:05:49.789> appeal<00:05:50.300> to<00:05:50.479> the<00:05:50.599> younger<00:05:50.839> user<00:05:51.169> as

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:51.379 
would also appeal to the younger user as

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:54.279 
would also appeal to the younger user as
well<00:05:51.819> so<00:05:52.819> this<00:05:52.939> wasn't<00:05:53.209> my<00:05:53.419> full<00:05:53.659> review<00:05:53.809> this

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:54.289 
well so this wasn't my full review this

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:57.219 
well so this wasn't my full review this
was<00:05:54.469> just<00:05:54.649> a<00:05:54.830> unboxing<00:05:55.610> and<00:05:55.849> first<00:05:56.149> look<00:05:56.599> so
