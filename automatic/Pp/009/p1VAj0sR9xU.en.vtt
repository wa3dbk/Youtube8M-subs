00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.140
 although not simulation because all 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.339
 they started as the joke to laugh and 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.720

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.810
 at first it was thought that it was in 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.750
 occasion of theft but then it was confirmed 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:39.690
 that was a labor claim with him was 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.150

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.950
 the intervention of his parents for another 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:49.290
 part there are two serious people was 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.780

 the row against the owner of the place 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.260

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.739

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.030
 aggressive with the hostages left them 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.500
 leave because a problem of a 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.750
 fire extinguisher drive that triggered 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.000
 an amplifier of Africa among several and 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.109
 that person let her out after they were 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.060
 assisted by ambulance but 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.040
 simply as a precaution when 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.440
 there were only four hostages left to free 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.480
 came the father of the young man who collaborated 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.710
 with the ether negotiation so that your 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.380
 son deposed his attitude 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.570
 so an ambulance came out to all 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.210
 speed carrying the wounded on the 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:40.480
 leg and another with a stress attack 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:43.780
 a father of the former employee said that everything 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.760

 there is nothing he would not speak sought 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.970
 I wanted to want his companions 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.440
 be more worthy at work than 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:20.220

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:24.370
 6 and turned 20 more 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:27.850
