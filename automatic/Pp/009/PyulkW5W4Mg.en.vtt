00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.859
 v people and welcome to one 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.630
 new minecraft video 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.509
 Today I want to give you a dead one 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.940
 show little recent time built 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.400
 he in the last live stream that is on 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.180
 I started last saturday 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.250
 to build 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.109
 and now have completed 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.240
 and I just want to show it 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.369
 and that is the whole thing like that 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.210
 I just think I'm up so far 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.250
 I have come so far 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.960
 everything in the doubt built with however 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.969
 a bit of support a few mods 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.860
 I have installed, among other things 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.989
 one by I can use a jetpack 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.480
 That's why I have something easier 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.440
 got as in the normal standard 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.480
 was weibel with lars 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.730
 That would have been a bit more difficult 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.340
 that's what I do with the jetpack 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.450
 relatively quickly get it on 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.840
 every case is the tour is such a 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.370
 bit of magic become atom because I 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.440
 installed here so a few maggi mods 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.320
 have among other things the magic a2 and 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.820
 recently also plates magic have that 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.260
 I have not really started because 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.049
 we also lack the resources so 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.510
 stay magic but with magic I have 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.799
 already played for around and I'll show you 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.430
 Just a moment the level I here 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.409
 so built in the tower down here 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.420
 you can first go in the tower 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.430
 very easy small room I have one 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.049
 small sleeping place and first only 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.549
 my machines set up so I have 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.000
 yes synonymous so a few technology mods in it 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.820
 under a mechanism that is therefore therefore 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.970
 all these machines come here 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.280
 electric yards and such stories 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.570
 i've installed this down here 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.280
 I also just let me do it 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.799
 who did not want all the rearranging have 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.189
 I let you in and me down 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.250
 then simply we just go upstairs 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.390
 made for all the magic mods i 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.260
 I 'll just find the second one 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.440
 floor 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.790
 I just saw them here 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.230
 someday also no purpose that it 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.420
 rather such a platform because the 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.310
 also relatively small is there you come too 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.160
 only if you fly in from the inside 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.220
 here is the window though two high or 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.140
 that here such a commission would be 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.050
 one can practically cover diana type blocks 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.680
 because not feel so not synonymous 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.140
 fail 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.070
 and here on the next level one 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.760
 But you can do that again now 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.080
 insert 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.700
 and here i have my asthma 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.030
 smajic table built here you can 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.150
 make clean with the ars medica 2 j 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.160
 that's pretty cool, too 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.020
 already played properly and here next to 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.210
 You can do that so-called oculus there 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.920
 select talents 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.610
 and yes that's just this level we 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.440
 will probably be a few more 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.820
 other things are so far I am 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.140
 but not in the magic but one 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.270
 few other devices because yes too 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.120
 I get so much ars medica 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.750
 need then it is still a floor 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.930
 higher 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.720
 here this floor has to be built with 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.970
 a construct from america with this 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.680
 That's what you're doing magic 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.720
 below you put the quasi together what 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.370
 you want to have and up here in this 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.220
 age you can then finally 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.690
 build together 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.900
 that is a multi structure that is 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.420
 this whole structure becomes one 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.220
 object in which one then here that one 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.620
 throw things or objects into it 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.390
 can then made a magic 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.060
 become 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.340
 this is this floor and on top of it 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.930
 on the roof so to speak so hereby 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.640
 a few spikes separated upwards 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.560
 or end up 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.820
 Of course, only one thing can come of it 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.050
 that is not quite finished because of me 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.930
 here as I said again on it 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.310
 comes and that the altar of blackmagic 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.060
 I want to put it at the top 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.340
 because then I really sacrifice up here 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.160
 can sacrifice animals can sacrifice cheaper 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.660
 can summon lightning can do all that 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.100
 you do it with blood magic for me 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.550
 me this beautiful big platform here 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.320
 the daily routine of blood built up 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.060
 magic can also be expanded 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.769
 and can be quite big, I hope 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.700
 that space is enough here i know it 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.739
 not as I said, I have 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.870
 not started with plan magic around 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.530
 but I think that should work 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.270
 first so for the smaller beginners 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.000
 and maybe later you have to 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.640
 I have to look like I do 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.590
 that makes a beautiful in any case 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.080
 view from up here if you have the 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.880
 Villa can still be kidnapped 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.470
 look around for the last time 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.359
 a view of the beautiful world 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.480
 before they are sacrificed then 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:23.310
 the blood god and the death scott with it 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:27.900
 I get the life energy from them 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.560
 yes and can do bad things with it 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.760
 Judas was already too 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.950
 The tower I only wanted once very briefly 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.390
 because I think it's pretty cool 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.640
 Overall, I believe that mine 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.950
 quite well done something different 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.390
 as for example in the purchase must 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.460
 although he looks similar again when 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.669
 Being completely honest has certain 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.190
 similarities with something slimmer above 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.180
 again a little wider 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.550
 certain similarities exist 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.620
 but I think it's something 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.820
 Another flair something dangerous from 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:01.360
 with this pointy spike on top of it 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:02.229
 and overall a bit more open here 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.090
 I must also hope so 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.950
 I do not know can you also hold 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.940
 what you want I wanted to simply 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.800
 show only very briefly 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.600
 maybe I'll do it tutorial me 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.550
 I do not know, I'll just ask 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.110
 even if I already know the answer 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.270
 do you want to have tutorial describes 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.130
 Just put it in the comments 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.810
 If so, I think that I believe 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.520
 It is not too difficult to build 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:25.510
 that would have to be done in one or 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.919
 two tutorials and otherwise I say 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.330
 just for watching 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:33.160
 I hope to see you in the next one 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:36.300
 video video and it makes a good job 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.300
 your pants kowski
