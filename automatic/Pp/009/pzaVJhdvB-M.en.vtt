00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
and and approximating to members we've

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.670

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
few years ago and now the problem is

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.820 
few years ago and now the problem is
with<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.119> casting<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.660> didn't<00:00:30.900> fit<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.710> what

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
with the casting it didn't fit so what

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.049 
with the casting it didn't fit so what
we're<00:00:31.949> going<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.099> do<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.640> we're<00:00:32.850> going<00:00:32.880> to

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.080 
we're going to do is we're going to
place<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:34.070> cover<00:00:35.070> screw<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.579> for<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.820> throat

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
place a cover screw so for the throat

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.790 
place a cover screw so for the throat
back<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:36.480> there

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.100 

and<00:00:42.340> replace<00:00:42.970> our<00:00:43.090> crevice<00:00:43.450> screw<00:00:43.690> because

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
and replace our crevice screw because

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.450 
and replace our crevice screw because
we're<00:00:44.230> not<00:00:44.350> engaging<00:00:44.680> that<00:00:44.860> implant<00:00:45.250> so<00:00:45.370> we're

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
we're not engaging that implant so we're

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.830 
we're not engaging that implant so we're
just<00:00:45.490> going<00:00:45.700> to<00:00:45.760> use<00:00:45.880> this

and<00:01:14.290> torque<00:01:14.620> it<00:01:14.710> down<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:16.240> see<00:01:16.450> that<00:01:16.480> so<00:01:16.930> we're

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
and torque it down and see that so we're

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.720 
and torque it down and see that so we're
just<00:01:17.170> gonna<00:01:17.260> place<00:01:17.500> the<00:01:17.770> cover<00:01:18.370> screw<00:01:18.610> and

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.730 
just gonna place the cover screw and

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.220 
just gonna place the cover screw and
then<00:01:18.820> we're<00:01:19.030> going<00:01:19.120> to<00:01:19.180> use<00:01:19.240> is<00:01:19.720> you're<00:01:20.020> going

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.230 
then we're going to use is you're going

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.720 
then we're going to use is you're going
to<00:01:22.230> take<00:01:23.230> his<00:01:23.440> denture<00:01:24.220> which<00:01:24.340> he's<00:01:24.520> already

to take his denture which he's already

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.220 
to take his denture which he's already
worn<00:01:25.000> around<00:01:25.240> for<00:01:25.420> a<00:01:25.450> bit<00:01:25.570> and<00:01:25.720> then<00:01:25.840> place<00:01:26.050> it

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
worn around for a bit and then place it

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:32.640 
worn around for a bit and then place it
on<00:01:29.520> okay<00:01:30.520> so<00:01:30.580> here<00:01:31.090> we<00:01:31.180> are<00:01:31.210> and<00:01:31.590> we're<00:01:32.590> just

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
on okay so here we are and we're just

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.080 
on okay so here we are and we're just
trying<00:01:32.950> on<00:01:33.040> the<00:01:33.130> screws<00:01:33.460> now<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:33.700> problem

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
trying on the screws now the problem

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.210 
trying on the screws now the problem
we've<00:01:34.210> experienced<00:01:34.810> with<00:01:34.840> going<00:01:35.710> switching

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
we've experienced with going switching

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.760 
we've experienced with going switching
from<00:01:36.630> external<00:01:37.630> hex<00:01:37.960> to<00:01:38.080> internal<00:01:38.410> hex<00:01:38.620> is

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
from external hex to internal hex is

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:39.990 
from external hex to internal hex is
trying<00:01:39.040> to<00:01:39.100> find<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.370> proper<00:01:39.820> clinical

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
trying to find the proper clinical

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.480 
trying to find the proper clinical
screws<00:01:40.570> so<00:01:41.410> we've<00:01:41.590> determined<00:01:41.890> that<00:01:42.310> these

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
screws so we've determined that these

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.760 
screws so we've determined that these
are<00:01:42.760> the<00:01:42.880> good<00:01:43.030> ones<00:01:43.090> to<00:01:43.420> go<00:01:43.570> so<00:01:44.230> just<00:01:44.260> try<00:01:44.620> them

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
are the good ones to go so just try them

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.590 
are the good ones to go so just try them
in<00:01:44.920> and<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.610> way<00:01:45.790> the<00:01:46.000> series<00:01:46.360> are<00:01:46.510> we're

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
in and the way the series are we're

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.240 
in and the way the series are we're
going<00:01:46.780> to<00:01:49.170> hand<00:01:50.170> torque<00:01:50.410> them<00:01:50.530> down<00:01:50.560> Dobby<00:01:50.979> and

with the with the denture on and then

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.250 
with the with the denture on and then
hand<00:01:58.060> torque<00:01:58.300> down<00:01:58.479> the<00:01:58.600> middle<00:01:58.780> one<00:01:58.990> and<00:01:59.200> it

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
hand torque down the middle one and it

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.410 
hand torque down the middle one and it
will<00:01:59.380> also<00:01:59.710> torque<00:02:00.310> with<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.670> torque<00:02:01.180> wrench

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
will also torque with the torque wrench

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.020 
will also torque with the torque wrench
the<00:02:01.900> outside<00:02:02.320> screws<00:02:02.619> in<00:02:02.830> any<00:02:03.010> internal<00:02:03.430> one
