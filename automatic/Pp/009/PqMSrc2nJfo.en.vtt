00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
right so after updating your origin and

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.080 
right so after updating your origin and
Welty<00:02:45.960> you<00:02:46.110> are<00:02:46.440> at<00:02:46.650> this<00:02:46.830> step<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.490> actually

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
Welty you are at this step and actually

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.380 
Welty you are at this step and actually
to<00:02:48.210> login<00:02:49.040> login<00:02:50.210> normally<00:02:52.100> with<00:02:53.100> your

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
to login login normally with your

regular username and password or
whatever<00:02:57.330> and<00:02:57.660> then<00:02:58.410> our<00:02:58.620> origin<00:02:59.130> should<00:02:59.370> be
