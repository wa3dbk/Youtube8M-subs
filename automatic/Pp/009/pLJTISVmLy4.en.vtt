00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
time it really doesn't make sense but

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.880 
time it really doesn't make sense but
it's<00:02:55.820> kind<00:02:56.030> of<00:02:56.060> just<00:02:56.180> what<00:02:56.330> I<00:02:56.420> say<00:02:56.570> well<00:02:57.470> let's

video<00:03:01.070> is<00:03:01.390> I<00:03:02.410> have<00:03:03.410> a<00:03:03.440> huge<00:03:03.709> window<00:03:04.250> above<00:03:05.209> my

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
video is I have a huge window above my

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.720 
video is I have a huge window above my
garden<00:03:05.840> tub<00:03:06.050> and<00:03:06.470> I<00:03:06.680> thought<00:03:07.010> that<00:03:07.400> that<00:03:07.550> would

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
garden tub and I thought that that would

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.670 
garden tub and I thought that that would
add<00:03:08.000> to<00:03:08.209> the<00:03:08.330> lighting<00:03:08.690> but<00:03:08.840> i<00:03:08.870> think<00:03:09.200> the

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
add to the lighting but i think the

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.140 
add to the lighting but i think the
camera<00:03:10.010> is<00:03:10.070> focusing<00:03:10.459> on<00:03:10.550> that<00:03:10.700> light<00:03:10.880> totes

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
camera is focusing on that light totes

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.570 
camera is focusing on that light totes
making<00:03:11.420> it<00:03:11.510> darker<00:03:11.600> and<00:03:12.320> you<00:03:12.470> now<00:03:12.860> know<00:03:12.890> next

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
making it darker and you now know next

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.150 
making it darker and you now know next

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
something thicker on this side of my

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.530 
something thicker on this side of my
hair<00:04:06.620> my<00:04:07.130> hair<00:04:07.160> doesn't<00:04:07.610> feel<00:04:07.910> as<00:04:08.090> wet<00:04:08.299> and<00:04:08.480> it

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
hair my hair doesn't feel as wet and it

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.150

confused<00:04:10.250> this<00:04:11.239> one<00:04:11.510> I<00:04:11.540> think<00:04:11.630> is<00:04:11.870> just

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
confused this one I think is just

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.350 
confused this one I think is just
juicier<00:04:12.650> again<00:04:13.489> you<00:04:13.700> can<00:04:13.850> see<00:04:13.880> that<00:04:14.030> of<00:04:14.299> a

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
juicier again you can see that of a

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.620 
juicier again you can see that of a
texture<00:04:14.780> of<00:04:15.140> the<00:04:15.350> conditioners<00:04:15.860> um<00:04:16.419> my<00:04:17.419> hair

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
texture of the conditioners um my hair

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.190 
texture of the conditioners um my hair
still<00:04:17.870> feels<00:04:18.169> crazy<00:04:18.470> moisturized<00:04:19.370> and<00:04:20.200> let's

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
still feels crazy moisturized and let's

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.200 
still feels crazy moisturized and let's
see<00:04:21.410> yeah<00:04:21.859> it's

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
see yeah it's

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.480 
see yeah it's
detangled<00:04:22.960> I<00:04:23.169> can<00:04:23.530> still<00:04:23.770> get<00:04:23.949> my<00:04:24.100> hands

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
detangled I can still get my hands

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.689 
detangled I can still get my hands
through<00:04:25.470> so<00:04:26.470> the<00:04:26.650> resistance<00:04:27.190> feels<00:04:27.460> about

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:27.699 
through so the resistance feels about

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.360 
through so the resistance feels about
the<00:04:27.910> same<00:04:28.120> as<00:04:28.419> far<00:04:28.690> as<00:04:28.840> well<00:04:29.710> maybe<00:04:29.919> there's

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
the same as far as well maybe there's

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.210 
the same as far as well maybe there's
one<00:04:30.520> low<00:04:30.669> spot<00:04:30.910> but<00:04:31.569> it<00:04:31.870> feels<00:04:32.440> about<00:04:32.830> the<00:04:33.039> same

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
one low spot but it feels about the same

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.809 
one low spot but it feels about the same
as<00:04:33.490> far<00:04:33.729> as<00:04:33.849> how<00:04:34.000> it<00:04:34.180> kept<00:04:34.419> my<00:04:34.569> hair<00:04:34.810> detangled

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:35.819 
as far as how it kept my hair detangled

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:39.450 
as far as how it kept my hair detangled
I<00:04:36.819> like<00:04:37.810> them<00:04:38.020> both<00:04:38.050> I<00:04:38.560> can't<00:04:38.919> really<00:04:39.160> say

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
I like them both I can't really say

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.029 
I like them both I can't really say
whether<00:04:39.729> one<00:04:40.150> is<00:04:40.560> better<00:04:41.560> than<00:04:41.710> the<00:04:41.889> other

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
my hair absorbed them both very very

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.980 
my hair absorbed them both very very
well<00:06:16.860> but<00:06:17.860> and<00:06:18.159> I<00:06:18.820> could<00:06:19.000> still<00:06:19.270> detangle<00:06:19.840> with

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
well but and I could still detangle with

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.959 
well but and I could still detangle with
this<00:06:20.169> one<00:06:20.409> but<00:06:21.039> this<00:06:21.219> one<00:06:21.280> was<00:06:21.550> easier<00:06:21.909> to

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:21.969 
this one but this one was easier to

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:24.029 
this one but this one was easier to
detangle<00:06:22.449> so<00:06:22.780> I<00:06:22.810> like<00:06:23.080> the<00:06:23.259> old<00:06:23.409> formulation

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:24.039 
detangle so I like the old formulation

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:26.370
