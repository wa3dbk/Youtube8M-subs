00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.899 
condemn them into the wall and then have
your<00:01:31.290> Thresh<00:01:31.920> hit<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> cue<00:01:33.619> afterward<00:01:34.619> that

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
your Thresh hit the cue afterward that

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.069 
your Thresh hit the cue afterward that
way<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:35.970> get<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.270> kill<00:01:36.450> that's<00:01:36.689> how<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.960> does

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
way you get the kill that's how it does

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.530 
way you get the kill that's how it does
every<00:01:37.350> time<00:01:37.530> if<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.770> don't<00:01:37.920> do<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.220> way

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
every time if you don't do that way

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.730 
every time if you don't do that way
probably<00:01:39.540> should<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:39.900> stop<00:01:40.079> playing<00:01:40.350> cuz

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
probably should just stop playing cuz

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.649 
probably should just stop playing cuz
you<00:01:41.430> always<00:01:41.579> want<00:01:41.790> your<00:01:41.850> support<00:01:42.000> get<00:01:42.390> feds

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659
