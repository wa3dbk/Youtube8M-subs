00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
just go into this hole right here and

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.899 
just go into this hole right here and
you<00:01:45.899> will<00:01:46.049> find<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.619> skeleton<00:01:47.070> spawner<00:01:47.610> right

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
you will find a skeleton spawner right

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.219 
you will find a skeleton spawner right
here<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.329> that's<00:01:48.509> pretty<00:01:48.689> awesome<00:01:49.079> if<00:01:49.200> you

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
here so that's pretty awesome if you

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.080 
here so that's pretty awesome if you
want<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.500> make<00:01:49.590> an<00:01:49.710> XP<00:01:50.070> farm<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.610> you've<00:01:50.939> also

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
want to make an XP farm and you've also

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.969 
want to make an XP farm and you've also
got<00:01:51.240> some<00:01:51.390> iron<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.020> bread<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.500> string<00:01:52.829> and

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
got some iron and bread and string and

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.410 
got some iron and bread and string and
redstone<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.460> stuff<00:01:53.880> like<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.329> that's

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
redstone and stuff like that so that's

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.719 
redstone and stuff like that so that's
also<00:01:54.689> pretty<00:01:54.960> epic<00:01:55.170> but<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.130> main<00:01:56.310> thing<00:01:56.549> I

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
also pretty epic but the main thing I

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.670 
also pretty epic but the main thing I
want<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.030> show<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.270> guys<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.810> all<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.469> cave

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
want to show you guys is all of the cave

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.590 
want to show you guys is all of the cave
systems<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.460> are<00:01:59.549> found<00:01:59.820> within<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.329> seed

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
systems that are found within the seed

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.179 
systems that are found within the seed
now<00:02:01.110> I'm<00:02:01.320> not<00:02:01.500> going<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.649> be<00:02:01.770> showing<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.159> all

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
now I'm not going to be showing you all

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.740 
now I'm not going to be showing you all
of<00:02:02.520> them<00:02:02.700> as<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.090> would<00:02:03.240> take<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.390> very<00:02:03.479> long

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
of them as that would take a very long

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.749 
of them as that would take a very long
time<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.380> do<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.680> video<00:02:04.799> but<00:02:05.399> I'm<00:02:05.549> going<00:02:05.729> to

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
time to do in the video but I'm going to

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.700 
time to do in the video but I'm going to
show<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.000> some<00:02:06.270> examples<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:07.140> some<00:02:07.320> epic

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
show you some examples of some epic

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.130 
show you some examples of some epic
caves<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.580> ravines<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.330> stuff<00:02:09.539> like<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.929> so

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
caves and ravines and stuff like that so

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.350 
caves and ravines and stuff like that so
let's<00:02:10.770> go<00:02:10.890> ahead<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.580> check<00:02:12.030> out<00:02:12.150> all<00:02:12.330> of

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
let's go ahead and check out all of

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.180 
let's go ahead and check out all of
these<00:02:12.540> caves<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.140> diamonds

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
these caves and diamonds

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.390 
these caves and diamonds
so<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.580> first<00:02:14.850> cave<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.890> loaded<00:02:16.890> diamonds

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
so the first cave and loaded diamonds

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.130 
so the first cave and loaded diamonds
are<00:02:17.580> found<00:02:17.760> at<00:02:18.090> these<00:02:18.360> coordinates<00:02:18.660> right

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
are found at these coordinates right

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.230 
are found at these coordinates right
here<00:02:19.410> so<00:02:19.620> just<00:02:19.650> dig<00:02:20.160> down<00:02:20.190> at<00:02:20.790> these

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
here so just dig down at these

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.600 
here so just dig down at these
coordinates<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.990> you<00:02:22.410> will<00:02:22.590> eventually<00:02:23.280> find

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
coordinates and you will eventually find

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.930 
coordinates and you will eventually find
a<00:02:24.180> cave<00:02:24.780> system<00:02:25.040> with<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.130> bunch<00:02:26.310> of<00:02:26.460> diamonds

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
a cave system with a bunch of diamonds

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.030 
a cave system with a bunch of diamonds
right<00:02:27.060> here<00:02:27.330> as<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.570> can<00:02:27.600> see<00:02:27.780> we<00:02:28.680> basically

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
right here as you can see we basically

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.720 
right here as you can see we basically
have<00:02:29.370> one<00:02:29.820> two<00:02:30.480> three<00:02:31.260> four<00:02:31.710> five<00:02:32.190> diamonds

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
have one two three four five diamonds

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.550 
have one two three four five diamonds
right<00:02:32.850> here<00:02:33.240> but<00:02:33.720> that's<00:02:33.810> not<00:02:34.110> all<00:02:34.260> because

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
right here but that's not all because

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.990 
right here but that's not all because
you<00:02:34.800> have<00:02:34.920> some<00:02:35.130> more<00:02:35.280> over<00:02:35.430> here<00:02:35.580> as<00:02:35.850> you<00:02:35.880> can

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
you have some more over here as you can

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.240 
you have some more over here as you can
see<00:02:36.270> have<00:02:36.570> you<00:02:37.560> know<00:02:37.680> you've<00:02:37.830> got<00:02:37.980> some<00:02:38.130> more

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
see have you know you've got some more

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.800 
see have you know you've got some more
over<00:02:38.490> here<00:02:38.640> you've<00:02:38.760> got<00:02:38.790> one<00:02:39.090> two<00:02:39.360> three<00:02:39.390> four

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
over here you've got one two three four

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.780 
over here you've got one two three four
I<00:02:40.080> believe<00:02:40.440> we<00:02:40.530> found<00:02:40.590> five<00:02:41.010> over<00:02:41.430> there<00:02:41.580> so

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
I believe we found five over there so

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.880 
I believe we found five over there so
let's<00:02:41.970> go<00:02:42.030> ahead<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:42.450> spawn<00:02:42.690> in<00:02:42.930> nine

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
let's go ahead and spawn in nine

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.790 
let's go ahead and spawn in nine
diamonds<00:02:44.250> there<00:02:44.880> we<00:02:45.000> go<00:02:45.500> we've<00:02:46.500> got<00:02:46.530> nine

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
diamonds there we go we've got nine

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.170 
diamonds there we go we've got nine
diamonds<00:02:47.070> right<00:02:47.400> there<00:02:47.610> so<00:02:47.790> that's<00:02:47.970> pretty

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
diamonds right there so that's pretty

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.530 
diamonds right there so that's pretty
epic<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:49.760> yeah<00:02:50.760> we're<00:02:51.000> basically<00:02:51.120> gonna<00:02:51.450> be

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
epic and yeah we're basically gonna be

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.090 
epic and yeah we're basically gonna be
we're<00:02:51.930> basically<00:02:52.170> gonna<00:02:52.410> leave<00:02:52.650> this<00:02:52.830> cave

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
we're basically gonna leave this cave

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.920 
we're basically gonna leave this cave
we're<00:02:53.820> now<00:02:53.910> going<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.090> check<00:02:54.300> out<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.600> next

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
we're now going to check out the next

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.710 
we're now going to check out the next
cave<00:02:55.340> which<00:02:56.340> is<00:02:56.489> basically<00:02:56.880> a<00:02:57.000> ravine<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.630> it

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
cave which is basically a ravine and it

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.120 
cave which is basically a ravine and it
has<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:57.870> bunch<00:02:58.050> of<00:02:58.200> stuff<00:02:58.440> in<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:58.680> so<00:02:58.830> let's<00:02:59.010> go

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
has a bunch of stuff in it so let's go

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.979 
has a bunch of stuff in it so let's go
ahead<00:02:59.220> and<00:02:59.459> check<00:02:59.580> this<00:02:59.790> out<00:03:00.030> so<00:03:00.300> to<00:03:00.360> find<00:03:00.840> that

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
ahead and check this out so to find that

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.750 
ahead and check this out so to find that
this<00:03:01.200> epic<00:03:01.680> ravine<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.190> just<00:03:02.370> want<00:03:02.520> to<00:03:02.610> go<00:03:02.700> to

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
this epic ravine you just want to go to

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.090 
this epic ravine you just want to go to
these<00:03:03.090> coordinates<00:03:03.390> right<00:03:03.900> here<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.410> pretty

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
these coordinates right here and pretty

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.400 
these coordinates right here and pretty
much<00:03:05.250> just<00:03:05.489> dig<00:03:05.700> down<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:06.290> you<00:03:07.290> will

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
much just dig down and you will

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.530 
much just dig down and you will
basically<00:03:07.590> drop<00:03:08.070> into<00:03:08.459> a<00:03:08.489> massive<00:03:09.090> ravine<00:03:09.390> now

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
basically drop into a massive ravine now

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.000 
basically drop into a massive ravine now
I<00:03:09.570> wouldn't<00:03:09.900> really<00:03:10.080> advise<00:03:10.410> digging<00:03:10.830> down

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
I wouldn't really advise digging down

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.199 
I wouldn't really advise digging down
where<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.310> did<00:03:11.700> because<00:03:11.940> you<00:03:12.060> will<00:03:12.180> probably

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
where I did because you will probably

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.180 
where I did because you will probably
fall<00:03:12.780> into<00:03:12.989> lava<00:03:13.230> right<00:03:13.590> here<00:03:13.770> as<00:03:13.860> you<00:03:13.890> can<00:03:14.010> see

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
fall into lava right here as you can see
