00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.670

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.159
 of people there and besides the server there 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.900
 did not in any case for the moment come 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.060
 to start so we will be pretty much 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.680
 all at the same hotel what exactly good 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.330
 So here we have two small three 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.400
 things to say to you so say go 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.990
 start directly via one recruits 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.210

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.400
 drove in the addition mounts hollow 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.970
 because what is already there is four 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.460
 wireless boccara china the clown myself 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.689
 and adam tutoriel here it is here so 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.799
 we are not bad so we already have 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.360
 two architects so that's going to be 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:41.189
 really cool saber at the base fight 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:43.409
 it's actually very exactly 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.399
 and then and so that's why so 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.869
 do not hesitate to leave your conduit 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.149

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.970
 so I hope especially so nene 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.740
 it's you skype in the 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.880
 description in the comments what 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.290
 it's true what you say screens that 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.840
 are going to live that's important and also we 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:05.969
 will you ask what would be 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.200
 and then that's it normally puts the 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.200
 most of the time we will be on teamspeak 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.720
 one so 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.629
 in print for mission rating 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.760
 spitfires are all zips every 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:18.730
 ip on the description i think yeah 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.860
 exactly here and that's so it will be 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.500
 all for that and then yeah so let 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.269
 well to us web so if that's it's a 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.319
 small bonus trick to sorting but here it 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.819
 would be cool if you have a little guy 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.630
 on the web server because that's 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.830
 really not bad 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.540
 yeah that's it but it's not really 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.989
 that's not important so if you 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.610
 have but here we presented a little 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.110
 our hunger who finally the just the name 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.670
 since the base we do not really have 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.860
 found crows in the moment yes 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.640
 madam so look well so yeah 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.900
 so it's dynasty dynasty so here you go 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.970
 we decided to call it that so 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.670
 get on with finding our and then here we go 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.930
 so I think it will be all for report 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.450
 to that so there actually for the first 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.250
 episode will decide our range and 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.329
 to present you quickly a few 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.769
 small sequences in quotation marks that 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.959
 will build the Basque have to see on 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.769
 the base it was and then I think for 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.049
 the next episodes 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:08.549

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.079
 directly there to do there so a 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.790
 started at mines etc 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.950

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.709
 next episodes we show you the 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.859
 building the bases and where exactly 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:29.069
 there will be looting here is that 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:31.690

 it's normal here and then 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.239
