00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:07.890
 ok let's go to 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.890
 focus on what is the new 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:15.160
 this is a knot of a structure 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.830
 articulated and this knot 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.010
 the bars they reach are 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:24.430
 submitted are the armpit efforts 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.570
 as you see in this case and depending on 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.520
 how they dress the other tutorial 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.920
 how is the effort of the bar would be 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.610
 this and the opposite this so that they are 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.790
 all this one and this one like this one are 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.610
 positive peppers 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.220
 and what we are going to do is take out 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.470
 the bars of that knot to see what is 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.350
 happening in the knot and after 12 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.630
 focuses on the knots what we do is 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.310
 remove the bars and cause the 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.630
 balance in each and every one of the 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.020
 nodes of the structure 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:01.510
 Well, we started with bar number 1 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.519
 this bar has a positive 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.979
 so what are we doing with 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:09.159
 the bar in this knot that is what we 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.530
 interesting since that is the point is the 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.360
 end that is attached to the knot of 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.550
 calculation 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.730
 in this extreme we are pulling the 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.530
 bar 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:22.970
 and the effort you are putting into 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:26.420
 the bar in the knot is this way 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:30.740
 If we continue with the knots with the 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.280
 second bar equals the effort in 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.320
 this point 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.110
 what we are doing on the bar is 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.400
 towards pulling the bar and the bar 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.770
 is pulling the knot as you see has its 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.470
 logical if I throw from this extreme 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.120
 at the other end I am receiving the 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.020
 same strength 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.580
 so that if we only win the knot and 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.520
 we remove the bars we can find 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.490
 something of this kind we have a center in 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.260
 which we have axis 2 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.490
 the axis 1 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.870
 and axis 3 from now on always 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.420
 let's calculate the nodes in a way 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.250
 separated by removing the bars 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.920
 and let's consider the criteria 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.470
 positive they will always have this 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.510
 look the knots 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.890
 so that we can find a knot 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:26.640
 to which a bar arrives in this direction 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:29.100
 in this and this one and you'll say good 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.560
 as this already means that we have removed 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.290
 the bars 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.670
 and always this alpha angle is 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.110
 corresponds to the angle of the bar 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.780
 these bars only work in the 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.140
 direction of the axis 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.750
 and you will say if we leave these 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.030
 these sachs and vile efforts in a knot 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.190
 how can we compensate for how they can 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.920
 get jealousy there is the 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:57.900
 question of the method we will always know 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.010
 for example in this case we will know 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.880
 this agile effort and we will have to 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.760
 calculate 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.760
 this 12 and in back 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.590
 and those efforts we assume positive 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.110
 and with him with the method he will tell us if 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.970
 we are right or on the contrary 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:25.910
 they are positive if you take a look 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.270
 we have an effort that would be n 1 by 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.050
 example 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.050
 has 2 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.150
 is positive as we have imagined in a 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:40.299
 The first moment may be the case 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.620
 cadenatres be negative to the assumption and 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.540
 always forming the same angle as 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.560
 should form the bar so 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.810
 this knot would be in balance 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.520
 and now we would have been right in the 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.680
 hypothesis that he is the taxi 2 is 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:58.709
 attractive attraction is an effort of 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.430
 traction and the 3 would be a compression in 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.560
 place of an attraction 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.860
 another factor that we should have in 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.930
 account are the efforts in 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:13.420
 in the supports for example we have a 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:17.260
 structure that could be something like that 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.970
 we have loads that we see that we 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.609
 have given and we have calculated the 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.550
 reactions imagine that we have something like that 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:27.010
 in this knot, well, if we dismantle 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.130
 the bars on that knot we have the 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:33.470
 axil of a bar that would be this we have 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:36.680
 the other axis of the other bar 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:39.050
 the reactions are always introduced in 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.570
 the same direction and sense that we have 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:45.920
 calculated so that this reaction 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:47.870
 would be this and this region if of this and already 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.330
 all we have to do is calculate 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.960
 the sum of efforts so that 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:56.750
 free the knot must always be fulfilled 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.810
 that the efforts 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:03.280
 in any direction be 0 is true 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.280
 it's a simple static balance
