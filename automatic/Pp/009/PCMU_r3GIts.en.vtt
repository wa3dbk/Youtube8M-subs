project<00:01:45.079> so<00:01:46.079> that's<00:01:46.349> how<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.469> can<00:01:46.649> load<00:01:46.979> up<00:01:47.009> a

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:47.249 
project so that's how you can load up a

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:49.370 
project so that's how you can load up a
new<00:01:47.429> project<00:01:47.700> anytime<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.419> want<00:01:48.599> to<00:01:48.719> from<00:01:49.289> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
new project anytime you want to from the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.690 
new project anytime you want to from the
machine<00:01:49.649> controller<00:01:50.069> all<00:01:50.279> you<00:01:50.340> gotta<00:01:50.489> do<00:01:50.669> is

machine controller all you gotta do is

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.089 
machine controller all you gotta do is
save<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> template<00:01:51.630> project<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.289> name<00:01:52.709> it<00:01:52.919> so

00:01:53.089 --> 00:01:53.099 
save a template project and name it so

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:55.129 
save a template project and name it so
that<00:01:53.249> it<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.700> lists<00:01:54.060> itself<00:01:54.359> at<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.630> top<00:01:54.869> of

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:55.139 
that it it lists itself at the top of

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:57.109 
that it it lists itself at the top of
your<00:01:55.439> project<00:01:56.039> list<00:01:56.219> as<00:01:56.639> long<00:01:56.700> as<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:56.939> put<00:01:57.090> a

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
your project list as long as you put a

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.120 
your project list as long as you put a
zero<00:01:57.479> before<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.229> should<00:01:58.619> show<00:01:58.799> up<00:01:58.829> at<00:01:59.009> the

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
zero before it it should show up at the

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.999 
but this is how you start a brand new
blank<00:02:08.580> template<00:02:09.110> project<00:02:10.110> from<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.709> machine

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
blank template project from the machine

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.130 
blank template project from the machine
controller<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:11.939> again<00:02:12.209> all<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.689> gonna<00:02:12.840> do<00:02:13.019> is
