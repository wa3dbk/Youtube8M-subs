Gorilla Tape so that actually put some

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.380 
Gorilla Tape so that actually put some
weight<00:02:22.810> on<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:23.049> and<00:02:23.380> then<00:02:24.100> after<00:02:24.760> that<00:02:25.000> from

to use Crayola model magic so I have

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.590 
to use Crayola model magic so I have
about<00:02:29.920> probably<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.640> pound<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.120> a<00:02:31.180> half<00:02:31.209> of

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
about probably a pound and a half of

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.479 
about probably a pound and a half of
Crayola<00:02:32.019> model<00:02:32.320> magic<00:02:32.650> that<00:02:32.799> I<00:02:32.829> used<00:02:33.070> on<00:02:33.250> here

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
Crayola model magic that I used on here

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.490 
Crayola model magic that I used on here
but<00:02:34.120> what<00:02:34.239> I<00:02:34.269> ended<00:02:34.510> up<00:02:34.630> finding<00:02:34.870> was<00:02:35.170> once<00:02:35.350> it

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
but what I ended up finding was once it

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.380 
but what I ended up finding was once it
completely<00:02:35.920> dried<00:02:36.190> it<00:02:36.400> cracked<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:36.970> lot<00:02:37.150> so<00:02:37.329> it

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
completely dried it cracked a lot so it

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.780 
completely dried it cracked a lot so it
was<00:02:37.480> cracked<00:02:37.750> and<00:02:37.959> it<00:02:38.019> was<00:02:38.110> lumpy<00:02:38.459> so<00:02:39.459> I<00:02:39.489> tried

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
was cracked and it was lumpy so I tried

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.130 
was cracked and it was lumpy so I tried
to<00:02:39.820> find<00:02:40.090> another<00:02:40.269> way<00:02:41.549> for<00:02:42.549> it<00:02:42.610> to<00:02:42.670> work<00:02:42.910> and<00:02:43.269> I

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
to find another way for it to work and I

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.979 
to find another way for it to work and I
ended<00:02:44.410> up<00:02:44.500> using<00:02:44.709> a<00:02:45.160> combination<00:02:45.880> of<00:02:46.269> model

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
ended up using a combination of model

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.560 
ended up using a combination of model
magic<00:02:47.350> that<00:02:47.500> was<00:02:47.590> melted<00:02:48.010> in<00:02:48.190> hot<00:02:48.430> water<00:02:48.610> mixed

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
magic that was melted in hot water mixed

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.720 
magic that was melted in hot water mixed
with<00:02:49.600> Elmer's<00:02:50.170> glue<00:02:50.350> to<00:02:50.950> sort<00:02:51.160> try<00:02:51.310> to<00:02:51.370> fill<00:02:51.579> in

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
with Elmer's glue to sort try to fill in

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.160 
with Elmer's glue to sort try to fill in
some<00:02:51.880> of<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.090> cracks<00:02:52.329> but<00:02:52.570> it<00:02:52.690> didn't<00:02:52.930> really

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
some of the cracks but it didn't really

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.190 
some of the cracks but it didn't really
fill<00:02:53.530> in<00:02:53.650> as<00:02:53.770> much<00:02:53.890> as<00:02:53.950> I<00:02:54.129> wanted<00:02:54.489> to<00:02:54.670> so<00:02:55.450> I<00:02:55.750> did

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
fill in as much as I wanted to so I did

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.990 
fill in as much as I wanted to so I did
some<00:02:56.349> more<00:02:56.379> googling<00:02:56.800> and<00:02:57.190> I<00:02:57.310> decided<00:02:57.700> I<00:02:57.879> was

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
some more googling and I decided I was

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.100 
some more googling and I decided I was
going<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.300> use<00:02:58.420> spackle<00:02:58.900> so

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
going to use spackle so

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.600 
going to use spackle so
that's<00:02:59.230> what<00:02:59.380> I'm<00:02:59.440> doing<00:02:59.680> right<00:02:59.830> now<00:02:59.890> I<00:03:00.040> am<00:03:00.370> in

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
that's what I'm doing right now I am in

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.050 
that's what I'm doing right now I am in
the<00:03:00.670> process<00:03:00.940> of<00:03:01.360> spackling<00:03:02.020> this<00:03:02.500> headpiece

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
the process of spackling this headpiece

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.520 
the process of spackling this headpiece
which<00:03:04.060> I<00:03:04.180> really<00:03:04.420> free-formed<00:03:05.080> so<00:03:05.350> it's

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
which I really free-formed so it's

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.110 
which I really free-formed so it's
pretty<00:03:05.680> good<00:03:05.950> I'll<00:03:06.070> show<00:03:06.100> you<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.400> back<00:03:06.580> it

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
pretty good I'll show you the back it

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.000 
pretty good I'll show you the back it
looks<00:03:07.390> like<00:03:07.540> this<00:03:07.780> go<00:03:08.620> all<00:03:08.710> the<00:03:08.800> way<00:03:08.830> around

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
looks like this go all the way around

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.610 
looks like this go all the way around
that's<00:03:09.430> what<00:03:09.580> the<00:03:09.670> back<00:03:09.820> looks<00:03:09.850> like<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:11.500> it

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
that's what the back looks like and it

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.540 
that's what the back looks like and it
fits<00:03:11.800> right<00:03:11.950> on<00:03:12.100> my<00:03:12.220> head<00:03:14.160> it'll<00:03:15.160> probably<00:03:15.370> be

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
fits right on my head it'll probably be

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.450 
fits right on my head it'll probably be
about<00:03:15.640> 3<00:03:16.420> or<00:03:16.540> 4<00:03:16.750> pounds<00:03:16.960> to<00:03:17.440> wear<00:03:17.620> it<00:03:17.770> so

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
about 3 or 4 pounds to wear it so

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.890 
about 3 or 4 pounds to wear it so
hopefully<00:03:18.850> it<00:03:18.910> doesn't<00:03:19.150> bother<00:03:19.270> my<00:03:19.540> head<00:03:19.720> too

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
hopefully it doesn't bother my head too

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.210 
hopefully it doesn't bother my head too
much<00:03:20.050> since<00:03:20.350> I'll<00:03:20.470> be<00:03:20.620> wearing<00:03:20.830> it<00:03:21.070> around

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
much since I'll be wearing it around

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.720 
much since I'll be wearing it around
comic-con<00:03:21.820> all<00:03:22.120> day<00:03:22.300> long<00:03:23.340> but<00:03:24.340> you<00:03:24.400> know<00:03:24.520> it's

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
comic-con all day long but you know it's

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.400 
comic-con all day long but you know it's
kind<00:03:24.910> of<00:03:24.970> kind<00:03:25.209> of<00:03:25.240> cool<00:03:25.510> i'm<00:03:25.660> like<00:03:25.780> hat<00:03:26.020> so<00:03:26.350> it

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
kind of kind of cool i'm like hat so it

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.780 
kind of kind of cool i'm like hat so it
doesn't<00:03:26.590> matter<00:03:26.709> so<00:03:26.920> what<00:03:27.070> I<00:03:27.100> ended<00:03:27.310> up<00:03:27.400> buying

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
doesn't matter so what I ended up buying

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.290 
doesn't matter so what I ended up buying
was<00:03:28.690> paint<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:29.740> patch<00:03:29.950> lightweight<00:03:30.730> spackle

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
was paint and patch lightweight spackle

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.660 
was paint and patch lightweight spackle
lightweight<00:03:32.290> spackling<00:03:32.560> comparison<00:03:33.400> to<00:03:33.490> all

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
lightweight spackling comparison to all

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.640 
lightweight spackling comparison to all
the<00:03:33.700> other<00:03:33.910> ones<00:03:34.300> this<00:03:34.930> barely<00:03:35.470> weighs<00:03:35.620> a

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
the other ones this barely weighs a

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.890 
the other ones this barely weighs a
thing<00:03:36.070> where<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:37.060> other<00:03:37.209> bottle<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:37.780> other

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
thing where the other bottle the other

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.560 
thing where the other bottle the other
little<00:03:38.430> buckets<00:03:39.430> probably<00:03:40.180> weigh<00:03:40.239> a<00:03:40.270> couple

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
little buckets probably weigh a couple

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.660 
little buckets probably weigh a couple
pounds<00:03:40.720> each<00:03:41.050> so<00:03:41.080> this<00:03:41.860> is<00:03:42.040> your<00:03:42.190> best<00:03:42.370> bet<00:03:42.459> if

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
pounds each so this is your best bet if

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:43.860 
pounds each so this is your best bet if
you're<00:03:42.820> ever<00:03:42.880> doing<00:03:43.090> something<00:03:43.480> you<00:03:43.540> have<00:03:43.720> to

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
you're ever doing something you have to

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.170 
you're ever doing something you have to
wear<00:03:44.080> so<00:03:44.709> and<00:03:44.920> I'm<00:03:45.040> I<00:03:45.340> actually<00:03:45.700> tried<00:03:46.150> to

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
wear so and I'm I actually tried to

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.270 
wear so and I'm I actually tried to
start<00:03:46.510> doing<00:03:46.780> it<00:03:46.870> with<00:03:46.989> a<00:03:47.020> spackle<00:03:47.410> knife<00:03:47.530> but

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
start doing it with a spackle knife but

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.190 
start doing it with a spackle knife but
it's<00:03:48.489> such<00:03:48.730> a<00:03:48.760> weird<00:03:49.030> shape<00:03:49.390> that<00:03:49.959> I<00:03:49.989> just

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
it's such a weird shape that I just

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.140 
it's such a weird shape that I just
ended<00:03:50.410> up<00:03:50.470> doing<00:03:50.709> it<00:03:50.800> by<00:03:50.920> hand<00:03:51.160> I'm<00:03:51.880> just<00:03:52.000> so

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
ended up doing it by hand I'm just so

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.020 
ended up doing it by hand I'm just so
much<00:03:52.239> easier<00:03:52.300> so<00:03:53.550> let's<00:03:54.550> get<00:03:54.610> our<00:03:54.730> fingers

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
much easier so let's get our fingers

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.550 
much easier so let's get our fingers
dirty<00:03:55.300> I'm<00:03:55.600> not<00:03:55.720> afraid<00:03:55.930> to<00:03:56.050> get<00:03:56.170> dirty<00:03:56.320> with

dirty I'm not afraid to get dirty with

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.460 
dirty I'm not afraid to get dirty with
these<00:03:56.739> kind<00:03:56.950> of<00:03:57.010> things<00:03:57.250> so<00:03:57.970> all<00:03:58.150> I'm<00:03:58.239> doing<00:03:58.470> on

these kind of things so all I'm doing on

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.880 
these kind of things so all I'm doing on
this<00:04:00.400> tentacle<00:04:00.730> it<00:04:01.209> is<00:04:01.810> I<00:04:01.989> just<00:04:02.140> find<00:04:02.770> the
