00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.830
 Millennium Development Goals 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.179
 Uruguay signed a declaration of the millennium 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:12.619
 and committed to achieve these goals 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:16.079
 for 2015 

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.869
 the objectives are a commitment to build a better Uruguay 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.039
 eradicate extreme poverty and reduce poverty by half 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.239
 poverty reach the entire country to more than 800 thousand Uruguayans 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.180
 those under six are by far the ones who suffer the greatest proportion 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.180
 poverty and indigence 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.030
 today in Uruguay there are thousands of children in street situation 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.560
 education inclusion for all and more secondary education 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.340
 six out of ten children do not receive initial education 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.790
 in secondary education 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.240
 Uruguay is one of the countries of Latin America 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.240
 with higher rates 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.400
 half the field 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.400
 he manages to complete the baccalaureate 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.740
 between 17 and 24 years old 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.740
 more than 20% of young people study 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.450
 promote gender equality 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.450
 and greater participation of 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.740
 women receive on average 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.220
 29 percent less salary than men for the same task 

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:13.819
 being more than half of the electorate 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.819
 they only occupy 12% of the seats in parliament 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:20.399
 every nine days 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:23.399
 a woman dies because of domestic violence 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:31.689
 reduce child mortality 

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:38.129
 child mortality has been reduced sharply but it is still very 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.859
 unequal 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:44.309
 in the whole country 10 points die five children per thousand before fulfilling a 

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:49.419
 year but in some parts of Uruguay die up to 15 and more children per 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.659
 thousand that are born alive 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:55.939
 the main cause of death among children under one year 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.939
 is acute respiratory infection 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:04.159
 5 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.219
 to improve maternal health 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:12.199
 the number of deaths per pregnancy puerperium childbirth abortion was halved 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:14.519
 However 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.879
 non-governmental organizations estimate that the actual figure could be 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.849
 greater than the one notified 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.809
 maternal deaths are almost all 

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:26.809
 avoidable deaths 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:28.569
 and it happens mostly 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.709
 in pregnant women living in poverty and extreme poverty 

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:39.459
 6 as to want to come would like 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.199
 I read other diseases 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:43.649
 far from diminishing 

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:46.649
 the number of people with belloch and AIDS increased sharply 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.360
 the epidemic hit now masc to women and young people 

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:58.559
 new cases of infection are concentrated between 25 and 34 years 

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:01.039
 70% 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:04.039
 is spread sexually 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.239
 7 conserve the environment 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.269
 expand the signaling and reduce precarious housing 

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:18.079
 some two hundred thousand people live in cantegriles and precarious settlements 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.849
 with problems of sanitation and drinking water supply 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:34.460
 natural resources 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.460
 face pressures associated with productive activities 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:40.969
 the natural protected areas 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:46.429
 occupy less than 2% of the territory are not representative of biodiversity 

00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:49.429
 from the country 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.150
 Promote a world association for development 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:03.909
 in order to achieve the objectives 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:07.109
 official development assistance should double 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:10.629
 and reach 100 billion dollars per year 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.789
 this is just one third 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.069
 of what developed countries spend every year 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:29.069
 only in agricultural subsidies 

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:36.809
 Millennium Development Goals 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.569
 ambitious goals 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:41.550
 but achievable 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.649
 we can achieve them
