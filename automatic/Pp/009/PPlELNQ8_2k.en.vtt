because<00:02:02.820> it's<00:02:03.060> pretty<00:02:03.270> much<00:02:03.450> like<00:02:03.510> a<00:02:03.690> case<00:02:05.390> he

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
because it's pretty much like a case he

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.590 
because it's pretty much like a case he
just<00:02:06.600> wrapping<00:02:06.960> around<00:02:07.080> simple<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:07.800> it<00:02:08.600> and

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
just wrapping around simple is it and

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:19.840 
just wrapping around simple is it and
