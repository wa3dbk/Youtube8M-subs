00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
 there will be buyers so this agreement does support the code and shell 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.570
 all possible test for 5 percent discount on your fever there are also people 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:10.819
 today we will not go through a million per buyer 

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:15.109
 hunts that gouda on exeo bridge would be I do you want we have to look 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:18.719
 the good that I feel squeaked on optics I have never had 14 half a million 

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:24.439
 coens and I hope that this is the last episode of the c7 show 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.279
 bare asses otherwise I already have a bit tense that well on the track I got it 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.070
 now that it is over but 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.250
 In any case, all the devices sold have 14 11 million fever 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.770
 and that's certainly not wrong so let's open this price of 115 km 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.010
 open it for the first time and then we'll see 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.030
 yes then we have to go to seven thousands desperate that were and sick 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.440
 play in that get a million 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.950
 I doubt it 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.480
 about 130 packs I calculated after discart also some 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.470
 so i think the archer on ex of opening and clarity i have on purpose 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.600
 of course goes a bit faster the bronze I ever are but at least let it 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.530
 first openly see if a good can start on these five points 15 million 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.730
 vaccines a million at the popular 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:08.920
 alderman j 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.829
 first place 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:12.000
 it hit here again 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.299
 that's how I know here 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:16.520
 it's his shop's plan to be the sheltered workplace too 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.850
 remain constant but actually open that modern second pack 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.820

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:32.260
 we still think 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.740
 the beginning of the beginning 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.870

 As a goal we continue to work on something 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:13.649
 but yes of course I have had plenty of fun again 

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:17.369
 and maybe another double was optional wesenbeeck 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:23.119
 six of them as the best player so far and the one last 15 kw per core dea 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.449

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.589
 sixty further 

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:06.189

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:17.219
 so yes that is always fun they shoot and they are still pretty careful 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:18.869
 one in for 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:19.880
 ps 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.919
 who does not want fun is welcome in the narsingh club 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.829

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:27.429
 nice 

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:30.429

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.049
 get on the way to the play 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.709
 show 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.299
 back then that's it has the say 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.239
 the full width 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.009
 the mobile phone from the ax in the plan now receives 30 discounts 

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:03.569
 the judge ruled that to participate in September last year 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:05.869
 became the channel 

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:07.599
 how shuttles a strong 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.619

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.499
 the form 

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:20.939
 fred teeven 

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:22.770

 its busy for a while now we have again such 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.389
 150 talk but I think so 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.569
 and it still didn't really get much special 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.289
 these types of players were further afield 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:38.099
 you know 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:41.649
 nice but that does not produce anything I just want nice packs I have him two 

00:04:41.649 --> 00:04:42.990
 aprons and 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.559
 the sight of it is also what the sick 85,000 player would not make 

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:50.340
 what inspired both of them 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.620
 we have them 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.909
 to help the victory 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:56.909
 an extensive one 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.740
 increase the creation 

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:04.520
 9 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.699
 the 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:07.629

 living den 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:19.680
 especially 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.100
 hoping for this one problem I just don't want to live just because 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.100
 we have had nothing for a while 

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:30.860

 Europe for days 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:51.349
 I 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.509
 politicians who rob this 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:56.520
 mere 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.800

 nice and good text 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:08.719
 in the last place and that will not look 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:10.089

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:20.979

 the existing one is expanding 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.300
 we still have a game 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.680
 and that is a merger look when i see see the player gets there 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.499
 I completely crazy 

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:35.499

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:46.669
 topper between wanting to counter from it 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:50.650

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.509
 opened a park 

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:54.259

00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:12.279
