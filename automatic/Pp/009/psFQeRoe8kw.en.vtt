00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.809
 to make our orange liqueur 

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:12.629
 craft 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.900
 we will need 12 units of 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:17.640
 ripe oranges crystal sugar or some 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.000
 of your preference 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.670
 we will use 700 ml can kilometers 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.580
 and we 'll need a glass container 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:31.620
 with a lid for the melting process with 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.760
 help from a pile or peeler 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:37.260
 proceed to remove the skin from the orange 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.250
 we recommend taking care to remove 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.350
 only l avoiding the white part 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.430
 This prevents us from changing the taste of the 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.950
 our audience 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.780
 repeat the process of removing the skin 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.880
 all oranges 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.100
 once finished put the peels 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.100
 inside the glass pot and reserve 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.720
 then we will try the juice of the 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.820
 orange 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.090
 which will also be used our 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.090
 resource 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.580
 once you extract the juice from the orange 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.400
 reserve the same in a goal 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.560
 now we will create a syrup to add 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.260
 flavor and the south 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.240
 in a pan we prepared a symbol 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.320
 using the orange juice already 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.229
 reserved 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.160
 we will use as base the revenue of two 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.660
 glasses of juice and a glass of sugar 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.570
 thus achieving the ideal texture for 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.880
 create our infusion stir 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.539
 constantly preparing until 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.430
 can completely dilute the subject 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:46.039
 once the silo was lost 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.420
 turn the heat off and rest for 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.460
 some minutes 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.399
 now that we have orange syrup 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.119
 ready add the same to the pot where 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:58.210
 we will create the liquor 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:01.280
 if you realize that there are still 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:05.020
 small businesses in your syrup you 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.600
 you can remove them using a film strainer 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:12.200
 finally puts vodka out of his 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.790
 preference within the point if this is your 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.760
 first time creating a 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.650
 infusion uses normal vodka does not 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.310
 risk wasting premium vodka 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.799
 The tip will be to succeed in pleasing your 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.090
 own taste 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.870
 make sure you get a mixture 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.959
 homogeneous 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.299
 before taking the process of inclusion 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.670
 inclusions take between 30 and 40 days 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:37.430
 to reach equilibrium point 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.950
 if you want you can add other 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.680
 spices like clove cinnamon 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.739
 from the u 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.319
 make sure that the cot is properly closed and 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.349
 in their inclusion in a dry place and far 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.989
 of sunlight for a period of 30 to 40 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.219
 days since I have recommended 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.159
 it's over 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:03:00.609
 check the taste of your liquor and then 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:02.769
 filter to store your liquor and 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:06.459
 always use a clean bottle and 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:08.560
 use a funnel and a 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:13.019
 sieve to prevent any 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.019
 type of impurity among the public 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.489
 use the mixture to avoid 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.609
 any loss of your appreciated the 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.609
 resource 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.819
 remember that there is no better judge than 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.849
 your own taste and not the video in 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:36.969
 experiment using other flavors 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:40.709
 serve with ice cubes or use in the 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:40.709
 creation of new capital 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.410
 Cheers
