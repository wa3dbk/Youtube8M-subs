00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.090 
instantly killed him in seconds

especially with the shield on with the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.069 
especially with the shield on with the
armor<00:01:59.430> shield<00:01:59.640> which<00:01:59.939> is<00:01:59.969> your<00:02:00.270> other<00:02:00.420> ability

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
armor shield which is your other ability

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.620 
armor shield which is your other ability
which<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.500> up<00:02:01.710> on<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.009> d-pad<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.759> it

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
which is up on the d-pad and it

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.999 
which is up on the d-pad and it
recharges<00:02:04.610> but<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:05.640> don't<00:02:05.969> know<00:02:06.299> if<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.469> armor

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
recharges but I don't know if the armor

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.880 
recharges but I don't know if the armor
recharges<00:02:08.729> with<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.770> demolition<00:02:10.770> guy

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
recharges with the demolition guy

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.710 
recharges with the demolition guy
because<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.400> know<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.730> recharges<00:02:12.390> with<00:02:12.599> the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
because I know it recharges with the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.820 
because I know it recharges with the
spec<00:02:12.989> ops

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
spec ops

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.400 
spec ops
but<00:02:14.070> I<00:02:14.100> noticed<00:02:14.520> if<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.880> you<00:02:15.180> know<00:02:15.210> die<00:02:15.630> or<00:02:16.380> I

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
but I noticed if you you know die or I

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.430 
but I noticed if you you know die or I
mean<00:02:16.950> if<00:02:17.100> your<00:02:17.280> armor<00:02:17.580> goes<00:02:17.790> low<00:02:18.090> then<00:02:18.870> I

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
mean if your armor goes low then I

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.380 
mean if your armor goes low then I
noticed<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:20.160> don't<00:02:20.310> get<00:02:20.460> it<00:02:20.550> back<00:02:20.790> but<00:02:21.150> maybe

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
noticed you don't get it back but maybe

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.150 
noticed you don't get it back but maybe
you<00:02:21.600> can<00:02:21.780> like<00:02:21.990> get<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.350> back<00:02:22.560> if<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:22.950> like

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
you can like get it back if you like

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
that yet so but this is a pretty fun

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.720 
that yet so but this is a pretty fun
class<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.700> use<00:02:29.960> slightly<00:02:30.960> powerful<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:32.160> hope

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
class to use slightly powerful I hope

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.290 
class to use slightly powerful I hope
they<00:02:32.910> tweak<00:02:33.360> this<00:02:33.900> class<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.380> little<00:02:34.710> bit<00:02:35.300> you

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
they tweak this class a little bit you

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.300 
they tweak this class a little bit you
know<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.570> is<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.750> very<00:02:37.080> useful<00:02:37.320> class<00:02:37.830> for

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
know it is a very useful class for

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.850 
know it is a very useful class for
playing<00:02:38.730> objectives<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.690> I<00:02:40.050> like<00:02:40.320> that<00:02:40.590> you

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
playing objectives and I like that you

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.380 
playing objectives and I like that you
know<00:02:40.890> that's<00:02:41.280> important<00:02:41.850> you<00:02:41.880> know<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.090> need

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
know that's important you know you need

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.020 
know that's important you know you need
a<00:02:42.420> class<00:02:42.780> that<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.380> can<00:02:43.590> get<00:02:43.740> in<00:02:43.920> there<00:02:44.160> not<00:02:44.850> be

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
a class that you can get in there not be

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.270 
a class that you can get in there not be
afraid<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:45.420> get<00:02:45.660> hurt<00:02:45.960> but<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.560> think<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.920> armor

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
afraid to get hurt but I think the armor

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.930 
afraid to get hurt but I think the armor
is<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.430> little<00:02:48.090> high<00:02:48.740> and<00:02:49.740> the<00:02:50.190> killstreaks<00:02:50.760> are

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
is a little high and the killstreaks are

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.420 
is a little high and the killstreaks are
a<00:02:50.970> little<00:02:51.150> powerful<00:02:51.690> too<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:52.290> well<00:02:52.920> we'll<00:02:53.220> see

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
a little powerful too so well we'll see

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.280 
a little powerful too so well we'll see
what<00:02:53.550> happens<00:02:53.730> with<00:02:54.120> this<00:02:54.270> class<00:02:54.570> after<00:02:55.020> you

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
think I died right here so this is a

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.610

short<00:03:11.790> gameplay<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.540> know<00:03:12.600> some<00:03:13.320> of<00:03:13.380> you<00:03:13.530> guys

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
short gameplay I know some of you guys

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.470 
short gameplay I know some of you guys
want<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.100> see<00:03:14.250> full<00:03:14.520> gameplay<00:03:14.820> but<00:03:15.330> the

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
want to see full gameplay but the

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.990 
want to see full gameplay but the
gameplay<00:03:15.720> depends<00:03:16.680> on<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.459> match<00:03:17.670> like

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
gameplay depends on the match like

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.320 
gameplay depends on the match like
sometimes<00:03:18.450> it<00:03:18.660> can<00:03:18.810> last<00:03:18.989> 25<00:03:19.709> minutes<00:03:20.010> so<00:03:20.910> I

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
sometimes it can last 25 minutes so I

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.780 
sometimes it can last 25 minutes so I
may<00:03:21.750> actually<00:03:22.050> post<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.739> gameplay<00:03:23.190> where<00:03:23.430> I

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
may actually post the gameplay where I

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.030 
may actually post the gameplay where I

class<00:03:34.980> used<00:03:35.430> but<00:03:35.730> I<00:03:35.760> hope<00:03:36.030> they<00:03:36.209> tweaked<00:03:36.510> a

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
class used but I hope they tweaked a

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.020 
class used but I hope they tweaked a
little<00:03:36.660> bit<00:03:37.080> you<00:03:37.830> know<00:03:37.860> in<00:03:38.250> this<00:03:38.670> class

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
little bit you know in this class

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.650 
little bit you know in this class
because<00:03:39.360> it<00:03:39.810> is<00:03:40.019> lethal<00:03:40.440> it<00:03:40.800> is<00:03:40.980> potent

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
because it is lethal it is potent

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.020 
because it is lethal it is potent
damaging<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:42.840> I<00:03:43.590> didn't<00:03:43.890> get<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.130> level<00:03:44.400> 3<00:03:44.790> a

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
damaging and I didn't get the level 3 a

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.120 
damaging and I didn't get the level 3 a
kill<00:03:45.600> streak<00:03:45.750> for<00:03:46.170> this<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:46.500> really<00:03:46.709> don't<00:03:47.010> know

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
kill streak for this I really don't know
