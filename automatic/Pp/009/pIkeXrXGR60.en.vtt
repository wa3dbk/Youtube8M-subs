00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
either side which I guess can be bad and

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.599 
either side which I guess can be bad and
good<00:04:13.640> at<00:04:13.849> the<00:04:13.879> same<00:04:13.940> time<00:04:14.560> what<00:04:15.560> yeah<00:04:18.609> just

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
good at the same time what yeah just

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:27.640 
good at the same time what yeah just
strap<00:04:19.910> on<00:04:22.030> this<00:04:23.030> goes<00:04:25.000> inside<00:04:26.380> right<00:04:27.380> there<00:04:27.470> I

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
strap on this goes inside right there I

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:35.020

guess it goes and and put this through
here

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:52.680 

then<00:04:45.690> put<00:04:46.690> this<00:04:46.900> end<00:04:47.520> through<00:04:48.520> here<00:04:51.090> and<00:04:52.090> there

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
then put this end through here and there

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.540 
then put this end through here and there
you<00:04:52.780> go<00:04:52.840> you<00:04:53.280> got<00:04:54.280> the<00:04:54.550> stripe<00:04:54.790> board<00:04:56.430> and<00:04:57.430> if

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
you go you got the stripe board and if

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.810 
you go you got the stripe board and if
you've<00:04:57.700> ever<00:04:57.820> had<00:04:58.000> a<00:04:58.060> wii<00:04:58.360> remote<00:04:59.050> um<00:04:59.560> this<00:05:00.520> jap

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
you've ever had a wii remote um this jap

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.310 
you've ever had a wii remote um this jap
is<00:05:01.060> fairly<00:05:01.600> similar<00:05:02.080> because<00:05:02.490> you<00:05:03.490> like<00:05:04.320> it's

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
is fairly similar because you like it's

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.950 
is fairly similar because you like it's
actually<00:05:05.590> pretty<00:05:06.070> much<00:05:06.190> the<00:05:06.400> exact<00:05:06.640> same

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
actually pretty much the exact same

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.820 
actually pretty much the exact same
because<00:05:07.960> you<00:05:08.080> should<00:05:08.260> do<00:05:08.380> this<00:05:08.530> thing

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
because you should do this thing

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.520 
because you should do this thing
retighten<00:05:09.670> it<00:05:09.760> on<00:05:09.880> yourself<00:05:10.270> and<00:05:10.450> sup<00:05:10.660> and<00:05:10.930> the

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
retighten it on yourself and sup and the

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.490 
retighten it on yourself and sup and the
end<00:05:11.710> of<00:05:11.830> it<00:05:11.950> worked<00:05:12.160> eyes<00:05:12.340> on<00:05:12.610> so<00:05:13.350> it's<00:05:14.350> pretty

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
end of it worked eyes on so it's pretty

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.240 
end of it worked eyes on so it's pretty
cool<00:05:15.900> the<00:05:16.900> sliding<00:05:17.350> is<00:05:17.470> so<00:05:17.710> pretty<00:05:17.980> much<00:05:18.130> the

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
cool the sliding is so pretty much the

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:25.440 
cool the sliding is so pretty much the
same<00:05:20.490> yeah<00:05:22.410> so<00:05:23.410> far<00:05:23.680> the<00:05:24.220> only<00:05:24.310> thing<00:05:24.670> I've

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
same yeah so far the only thing I've

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.760 
same yeah so far the only thing I've
only<00:05:25.600> had<00:05:25.780> it<00:05:25.840> for<00:05:25.930> a<00:05:26.110> little<00:05:26.230> bit<00:05:26.440> the<00:05:26.620> only

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
only had it for a little bit the only

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:27.810 
only had it for a little bit the only
thing<00:05:26.920> that<00:05:27.070> I<00:05:27.100> feel<00:05:27.310> like<00:05:27.430> it's<00:05:27.610> going<00:05:27.760> to

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
thing that I feel like it's going to

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.680 
thing that I feel like it's going to
bother<00:05:27.970> me<00:05:28.240> is<00:05:28.450> this<00:05:29.080> back<00:05:29.350> piece<00:05:30.040> right<00:05:30.400> here

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
bother me is this back piece right here

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.960 
bother me is this back piece right here
because<00:05:31.690> I<00:05:32.080> hold<00:05:32.350> it<00:05:32.500> so<00:05:33.310> like<00:05:33.490> mines<00:05:33.760> right

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
because I hold it so like mines right

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.100 
because I hold it so like mines right
there<00:05:34.210> my<00:05:35.640> middle<00:05:36.640> fingers<00:05:37.000> right<00:05:37.180> there<00:05:37.420> so

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
there my middle fingers right there so

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.990 
there my middle fingers right there so
it's<00:05:38.320> like<00:05:38.440> I<00:05:38.830> don't<00:05:39.310> know<00:05:39.400> how<00:05:39.520> far<00:05:39.700> it<00:05:39.850> isn't

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
it's like I don't know how far it isn't

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.490 
it's like I don't know how far it isn't
between<00:05:40.450> there's<00:05:40.780> probably<00:05:41.080> like<00:05:41.230> a

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
between there's probably like a

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.880 
between there's probably like a
centimeter<00:05:42.400> but<00:05:43.210> it<00:05:44.140> just<00:05:44.290> feels<00:05:44.500> awkward

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
centimeter but it just feels awkward

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.040 
centimeter but it just feels awkward
when<00:05:45.460> you're<00:05:46.000> like<00:05:46.180> playing<00:05:46.630> with<00:05:46.780> it<00:05:46.930> and

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
when you're like playing with it and

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.990 
when you're like playing with it and
stuff<00:05:47.230> you<00:05:47.950> can<00:05:48.070> just<00:05:48.190> feel<00:05:48.370> a<00:05:48.430> gap<00:05:48.760> right

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
stuff you can just feel a gap right

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.510 
stuff you can just feel a gap right
there<00:05:49.060> so<00:05:49.360> it<00:05:49.480> kind<00:05:49.660> of<00:05:49.690> feels<00:05:49.810> weird<00:05:50.520> but

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
there so it kind of feels weird but

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.330 
there so it kind of feels weird but
that's<00:05:52.030> only<00:05:52.300> problem<00:05:52.810> I<00:05:52.840> think<00:05:52.870> this<00:05:53.340> case

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
that's only problem I think this case

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.450 
that's only problem I think this case
would<00:05:54.490> have<00:05:55.020> so<00:05:56.020> if<00:05:56.500> you're<00:05:56.740> thinking<00:05:57.190> about

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
would have so if you're thinking about

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.930 
would have so if you're thinking about
buying<00:05:57.820> it<00:05:58.120> I<00:05:58.350> would<00:05:59.350> definitely<00:06:00.160> consider<00:06:00.640> it

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
buying it I would definitely consider it

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.410 
buying it I would definitely consider it
I<00:06:01.240> mean<00:06:01.600> it's<00:06:01.750> only<00:06:01.870> like<00:06:02.110> forty<00:06:02.440> dollars<00:06:03.420> only

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:04.420 
I mean it's only like forty dollars only

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:09.750
