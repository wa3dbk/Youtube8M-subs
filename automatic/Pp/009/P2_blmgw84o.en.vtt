00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.310
 hi all had or basketball and we 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.670
 found for a new video on 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.690
 pokemon black version of so on the 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.730
 previous video 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:16.429
 we stopped it if I remember 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.080
 Well here it was to us tells his 4 to 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:24.259
 nice so here we will beat the last 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:26.029
 member rife in fact of pieris he 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.980
 is specialized in type pokémon 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.580
 darkness the fight type is so 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.580
 highly recommended 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:45.290
 so ben I do not really have any more 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.200
 pokemon fighting type I proclaimed rattle 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.660
 who knows the tag vendetta but suddenly 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.600
 which forces him to attack in second this 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.250
 which is not necessarily better 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.940
 then he will have to leopard this level to 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:06.560
 56.1 bagad level 56 a horrible fang 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:07.700
 level 56 and a king level 58 scalp long 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.729
 which always starts the same 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.180
 do not ask me why with a 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.780
 crappy attack 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.780
 it's about bluff 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:34.950
 so that does not help me too much so here we go 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:43.080
 I can not attack I'm going to be 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:45.360
 obliged to change pokemon then here 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.920
 for horrible croque I will use 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:54.600
 cameral what it is of type ground 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:02:01.800
 evolution s crocodile and my breasts I 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:04.850
 feel more s croco is good it's not 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.850
 engraves the number of blacks 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.200
 after for her what she believes I 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:16.930
 will aim at arcanes one who is of type game 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.680
 which is quite practical 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:27.730
 and finally for baghadi of good wants to do 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:30.860
 a little since not then guillotine 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:36.250
 yes, I'll try 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.250
 to misjudge instead of slice 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.209
 so here I said it just now 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.019
 he sends his horrible fang so me 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.019
 I will see miss the admiral 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.670
 then the tacc de claude miral drops 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:08.420
 it's not super super serious he uses me 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.420
 earthquake 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.189
 well I 'll use hydro that 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.720
 what will force him to use his 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.720
 healing 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:37.380
 which will allow me to attack him with 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:39.180
 ibra what and to make it pretty bad so 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.880
 I will not bother used weapons 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:49.680
 hydro that angers continues to use free 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:51.930
 what was the seal wat doing to me 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.770
 worse than expected what is not 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.770
 normal precisely 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:07.480
 so it's good soil type it's not 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:12.610
 serious even if he attacks bombay mans 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.610
 these are the common at normal date 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.049
 so that's it then that's what I tell you 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.199
 said just now 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.810
 I arrive at his ide bag and I have not 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:30.310
 really attac nor pokemon for the 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:33.080
 beat so we'll do with what we have 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:37.509
 I'm just going to try something that's 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.509
 to say techno the author here it works 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.280
 yeah that does not hurt him very much I 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:52.220
 still think that my bombay attack 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:54.080
 mans will be more effective which is not 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.280
 very logical because of the 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.250
 techno basterds is the biggest 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.139
 attack jean and sects it's even his 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.409
 signature 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.409
 I would say 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:14.860
 good it's not 11 worst we do not care 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.860
 the important thing is that it is chaos 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:23.980
 now I will be able to send as 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.980
 I said it arkema 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:36.119
 for the last pokémon 2 pieris it's up to 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:38.639
 say what they believe they have 

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:41.779
 folder darkness and steel an attack 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.779
 fire should be enough 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.770
 we also have this world 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:05.260
 asus why they always have a base 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.260
 and Russian when his good dog 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.750
 and I'll use the ounce complaint for 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.750
 finish this fight 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:40.180
 and that's it for the board member 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.180
 four numbers 4 pieris 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.340
 not finally me I use and the piece 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.000
 principal it's actually about the place 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.150
 primary 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.250
 which is a little bit the same so me 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:57.480
 for the next one for the next fight 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:58.980
 Forgiveness is the champion of the league 

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.870
 is risky we will face 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.970
 but I tell you no more about 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:05.450
 the moment go see you soon for a 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.450
 next video
