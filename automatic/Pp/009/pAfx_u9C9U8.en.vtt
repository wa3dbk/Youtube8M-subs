00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
batteries it stores a little bit of a

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.030 
batteries it stores a little bit of a
charge<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.210> here<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.630> then<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.439> sends<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.830> pulse

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
charge in here and then it sends a pulse

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.940 
charge in here and then it sends a pulse
a<00:01:14.460> high<00:01:15.030> frequency<00:01:15.240> pulse<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.110> through<00:01:16.680> your

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
a high frequency pulse and through your

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.070 
a high frequency pulse and through your
batteries<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.640> what<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.540> does<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:19.049> that

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
batteries and what that does is that

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.070 
batteries and what that does is that
will<00:01:19.380> help<00:01:19.560> all<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.340> little<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:21.540> credits

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
will help all the little the credits

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.240 
will help all the little the credits
that<00:01:22.229> forms<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.770> plates<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.159> the

that forms on the plates of the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.789 
that forms on the plates of the
batteries<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:24.540> think<00:01:25.020> they<00:01:25.110> call<00:01:25.259> them<00:01:25.350> sulfate

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
batteries I think they call them sulfate

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.770 
batteries I think they call them sulfate
or<00:01:26.009> something<00:01:26.250> like<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.549> they<00:01:27.150> will<00:01:27.360> it

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
or something like that they will it

battery Andrey dissolves it into the the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
battery itself so that your battery will

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.340 
battery itself so that your battery will
run<00:01:34.140> cleaner<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.689> extend<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.780> life<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.170> the

run cleaner and extend the life of the

run cleaner and extend the life of the
older<00:01:38.130> batteries<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.759> kind<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.509> rejuvenated

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
older batteries and kind of rejuvenated

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.490 
older batteries and kind of rejuvenated
a<00:01:40.110> little<00:01:40.320> bit<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:41.090> this<00:01:42.090> thing<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.570> really

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
a little bit and this thing is really

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.679 
a little bit and this thing is really
simple<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.610> hook<00:01:44.970> up<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.420> we're<00:01:45.540> going<00:01:45.630> to

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
simple to hook up and we're going to

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.870 
simple to hook up and we're going to
hook<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.899> up<00:01:45.990> right<00:01:46.140> now<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:47.310> see<00:01:47.520> I've<00:01:47.610> got<00:01:47.640> my

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
hook it up right now you see I've got my

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.810 
hook it up right now you see I've got my
four<00:01:48.090> batteries<00:01:48.420> down<00:01:48.720> here<00:01:49.430> these<00:01:50.430> are<00:01:50.549> four

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
four batteries down here these are four

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.490 
four batteries down here these are four
six<00:01:51.180> volt<00:01:51.420> batteries<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.960> are<00:01:52.020> wired<00:01:52.290> in

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
six volt batteries that are wired in

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.289 
six volt batteries that are wired in
series<00:01:52.530> parallel<00:01:53.220> everything<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.790> have<00:01:54.030> is

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
series parallel everything I have is

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.100 
series parallel everything I have is
wired<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.810> 12<00:01:55.079> volt<00:01:55.350> right<00:01:56.100> now<00:01:56.899> but<00:01:57.899> we<00:01:58.020> are

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
wired in 12 volt right now but we are

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.410 
wired in 12 volt right now but we are
going<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.439> be<00:01:58.590> real<00:01:58.979> soon<00:01:59.280> we're<00:02:00.180> going<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.329> be

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
going to be real soon we're going to be

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.690 
going to be real soon we're going to be
fixing<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:01.040> I'm<00:02:02.040> going<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.310> take<00:02:02.460> everything

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
fixing that I'm going to take everything

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.389 
fixing that I'm going to take everything
apart<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.299> we're<00:02:03.840> going<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.079> upgrade<00:02:04.649> the

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
apart and we're going to upgrade the

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.160 
apart and we're going to upgrade the
system<00:02:05.850> to

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
system to

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.730 
system to
a<00:02:07.259> 24-volt<00:02:08.069> system<00:02:08.459> which<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.789> going<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.060> be

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
a 24-volt system which is going to be

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.110 
a 24-volt system which is going to be
I'm<00:02:10.740> hoping<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:11.190> lot<00:02:11.340> more<00:02:11.520> efficient<00:02:11.970> as<00:02:12.090> far

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
I'm hoping a lot more efficient as far

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.850 
I'm hoping a lot more efficient as far
as<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.480> power<00:02:12.750> that<00:02:12.989> we<00:02:13.110> can<00:02:13.140> generate<00:02:13.290> and

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
as the power that we can generate and

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.770 
as the power that we can generate and
use<00:02:13.970> but<00:02:14.970> we<00:02:15.450> will<00:02:15.870> simply<00:02:17.420> loosen<00:02:18.420> up<00:02:18.569> this

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
use but we will simply loosen up this

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:28.729 
use but we will simply loosen up this
connector<00:02:23.810> slide<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:24.959> underneath<00:02:27.590> so<00:02:28.590> we<00:02:28.680> can

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
connector slide it underneath so we can

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:43.009 
connector slide it underneath so we can
get<00:02:28.920> a<00:02:28.980> connection<00:02:29.220> on<00:02:29.489> it<00:02:41.750> I'm<00:02:42.750> going<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:42.959> do

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
get a connection on it I'm going to do

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:50.090 
get a connection on it I'm going to do
the<00:02:43.110> same<00:02:43.319> with<00:02:43.500> this<00:02:43.620> one<00:02:43.680> over<00:02:43.920> here<00:02:49.100> always

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
the same with this one over here always

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.699 
the same with this one over here always
make<00:02:50.400> sure<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.790> read<00:02:51.030> your<00:02:51.470> manuals<00:02:52.470> and

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
kind of stuff I'm just a dude it was a

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.910 
kind of stuff I'm just a dude it was a
learning<00:03:02.010> as<00:03:02.310> he<00:03:02.340> goes<00:03:02.610> so<00:03:03.620> we'll<00:03:04.620> hook<00:03:04.739> this

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
learning as he goes so we'll hook this

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.759 
learning as he goes so we'll hook this
one<00:03:05.100> down<00:03:05.220> since<00:03:05.640> this<00:03:05.730> is<00:03:05.910> a<00:03:05.940> 12-volt<00:03:06.420> system

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769
