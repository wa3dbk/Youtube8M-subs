00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.700
 hello to all and welcome to a 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.810
 new video by other passions 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.850
 their likes that we will see 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.190
 today is this one raid the 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.750
 art of survival and I must say that I 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.160
 been pleasantly surprised for many 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.420
 reasons for this art book 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.590
 firstly that compared to his 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.270
 content that we're going to see everything to 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.620
 time and also in relation to his 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.059
 number of pages that is pretty amazing 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.330
 as you can see there are six 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.890
 bulky indeed it makes 280 flights this 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.750
 which is really excellent for an art 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.030
 book on a single video game remember 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.890
 the airs book on world of warcraft to 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.500
 water or even assassin's creed do not 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.769
 only 200 220 pages tall maximum 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.600
 here it's more than 60 pages more 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.070
 which is really excellent 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.720
 I will have a little reproach on this art 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.339
 book at the level of its external appearance 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.170
 firstly on the cover as 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.550
 you can see it here it is flexible 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.470
 while most e books 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.240
 now have a hard cover 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.490
 the other fault of this cover is 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.200
 this one the face of lara croft have 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.000
 no longer face is not you but I 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.950
 finds that on a blanket should 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.930
 still better to m it's pretty fast 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.420
 I think I would have preferred more a decor 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.280
 with lara croft on it's gonna give you 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.290
 no longer want to take a store because 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.750
 an art book like that I think that 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.610
 that makes his fans and I repeat it the 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.180
 content is really excellent and it's 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.260
 what we are going to see now 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.520
 before you talk about the content in 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.040
 details of this artbook I want to 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.820
 specify that I have never played at this 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.310
 video game 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.210
 so it's hard for me to tell you 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.020
 speak correctly and I already have 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.030
 apologize for moving forward 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.070
 so we have three parts really 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.780
 four major parts 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.130
 important in relation to this art book 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.930
 the first one that will be the one of 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.820
 characters so of course we have 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:05.530
 lara croft as you can see here 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.910
 that's it, and that's it. 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.560
 find that it is really a pity lara 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.420
 croft is still the heroine of the game 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.400
 and what do we have about ten pages 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.340
 and there is no design sketch 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.959
 on it and that's really like I say 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.580
 once again, it's a shame 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.319
 double page images still have 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.290
 pretty good but I would still have 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.930
 ask more 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.219
 compared to lara croft peace we 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.659
 have other characters that make 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:29.060
 part of the expedition 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:31.370
 everyone has the right to two or four pages 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.709
 with of course a solid illustration 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.079
 page on the side and always the same huh 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.359
 daddy more thing and that's it 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.650
 Too bad 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:42.049
 there after we are going to spend too much 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.530
 who's going to be enemies we meet 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:49.189
 throughout the game and I liked the 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.260
 Asian graphic style of the enemies 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:53.930
 who is really very very good and very 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.280
 very beautiful it is necessary, of course, 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.920
 as you can see here 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.049
 we finished the game about 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.939
 characters that is quite short you 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.349
 see a little thirty pages and 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:05.480
 there now we come on the 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.879
 part of the body and then it's going to be the 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.849
 hunk of the art book because it makes 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:13.280
 almost 200 pages 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.169
 as you can see here 200 pages that 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.340
 does almost a third of their books and 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:19.010
 which is still huge 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.720
 by cons there in this part there we 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.959
 will of course take full 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.879
 eyes 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.989
 so I do not have if you notice too 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:29.239
 these images are quite thick and they 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.319
 are also enormously iced which is 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.989
 a benefit because it puts 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.250
 perfectly worth the illustrations 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.359
 which are on the pages but 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.250
 the disadvantage is that when you 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.819
 look in full sun or so in 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.579
 full light 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.169
 there will be a lot of against light 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.060
 and that's really enough like you 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:45.190
 can see it sometimes which is enough 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.319
 hassle 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.629
 the other thing also that they told me about 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.819
 my husband without comment on my site 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.650
 I personally have the 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.409
 English version of this artbook and as 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.900
 I said the pages seem thick then 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:02.870
 only for the French version of this art 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.900
 book the pages looks smaller and there 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.579
 has small folds all over a few 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.560
 bullets so it's really minor 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.720
 really have the upper hand but I find 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.859
 that it's still a pity 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.049
 to the mud I would have liked it 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:17.180
 has the same graphic quality as the one 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:19.759
 it was also said that it is not the 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.450
 same publisher in the English version of 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.400
 call gans 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.200
 their books and brady range while 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.320
 for europe it's square enix it's 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.580
 directly occupy the edition of this 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.320
 art book may have not chosen the 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.400
 same papers 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.810
 the other thing we can see if 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.280
 is that sometimes I say well 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.100
 sometimes we have as you can 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.040
 see it here searches against 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.050
 to the different tokyo different decorations 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.520
 and it's me personally 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.380
 thing I love to fuck and I 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.020
 think there really are not enough 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.860
 throughout this book as you 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.600
 that seeing it we have a lot 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.760
 of illustrations like that in double page 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.290
 who have I repeat again this is 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.620
 really beautiful look well 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.400
 it's absolutely superb like this here with 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.460
 some drawings 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.260
 it's absolutely beautiful yeah I 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.180
 know I use a lot beautiful but 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.670
 we have almost no drawing in 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.110
 black and white search and that's it 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.630
 damage or drawings for example as 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.150
 this one where we see the different 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.630
 sketches and all that and it's really 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:20.120
 damage by cons I say it is 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.520
 a pleasure to leaf through second 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.610
 is called this art book because we are 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.230
 take a mouthful for the 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.990
 illustration of the pebble decor that's it 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.310
 I also like it 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.280
 so beautiful that it even gave me 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.050
 want to make this game it's still 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.260
 rare enough even a goat so beautiful 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.270
 it makes you want to go deeper 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.180
 and try the game and that's really 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:47.090
 very very well so 1200 pages is not going 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.470
 not all alone and do we go quickly 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.570
 anyway I made a video where 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.390
 we see the entirety of the art book 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:56.110
 and we will now go to the 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:58.670
 third part that will devote to 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.890
 camp is called different weapons and 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.350
 objects like is not worse if the 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.990
 statuses and that's really very very 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.910
 it's always like pictures 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.830
 in color still no sketch that 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.560
 it's a pity but we can see 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.050
 of course the traditional weapons by 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.670
 report to the lara croft 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.740
 for example here a desert eagle he me 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.120
 seems by the way a little girl like 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.400
 it's as easy as a desert 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.970
 eagle it seems a little weird but it 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.360
 it's a detail 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:28.100
 the traditional Kalashnikov finally brief 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.900
 that very good and the same you can 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.340
 see only about twenty pages 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.580
 for some it's still very very 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.170
 shortly after and we arrive here for the 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.690
 last part that was all 

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:40.790
 poster and all the illustrations 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.590
 promotion compared to different 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.990
 shows for this game is here too 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.030
 see me I would not have seen that anymore 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.800
 example in illustration on the with marc 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:52.040
 and fell raider on all that sar was 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.360
 a lot better than these I find 

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.520
 how that makes it all fade 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.880
 I would have really preferred these or 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:01.190
 this one on the cover so see a 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.640
 moment of still beautiful illustrations 

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:07.130
 it's absolutely superb so a benard 

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.720
 book a nice surprise and I 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:12.080
 strongly advise anyone who has 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:14.950
 loved the game we now have that 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.360
 go to the conclusion of this art book 

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.950
 so it's a bouquet really a very 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.510
 very good surprise already compared to 

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.760
 its content that is very bulky I 

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:24.050
 repeat 280 pages and also the quality 

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.000
 illustrations especially for the 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.230
 scenery it's absolutely beautiful 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.520
 double page illustrations are 

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.260
 absolutely to die for 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.180
 there are also a lot of texts really 

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.650
 very very interesting that's why 

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.650
 I recommend it again from the 

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:38.390
 to take in French in short a very good
