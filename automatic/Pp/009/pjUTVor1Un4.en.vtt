00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.750 
today but before we do I want to back up
and<00:00:52.890> say<00:00:52.980> those<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.430> who've<00:00:53.579> already

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
and say those of you who've already

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.670 
and say those of you who've already
watched<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.270> first<00:00:54.480> few<00:00:54.660> videos<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.260> have

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
watched the first few videos I have

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.670 
watched the first few videos I have
unplugged<00:00:56.370> all<00:00:56.670> major<00:00:57.020> home<00:00:58.020> electronic

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
unplugged all major home electronic

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.119 
unplugged all major home electronic
devices<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.280> appliances<00:00:59.370> and<00:01:00.829> the<00:01:01.829> train

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
devices and appliances and the train

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.030 
devices and appliances and the train
should<00:01:02.699> be<00:01:02.760> fairly<00:01:03.629> quiet<00:01:04.049> here<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.920> next

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
should be fairly quiet here in the next

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.340 
should be fairly quiet here in the next
few<00:01:05.280> minutes<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.790> no<00:01:06.510> guarantees<00:01:06.900> but<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.110> think

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
few minutes so no guarantees but I think

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.780 
few minutes so no guarantees but I think
we'll<00:01:07.530> avoid<00:01:07.890> being<00:01:08.159> interrupted<00:01:08.400> by<00:01:08.729> too

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
we'll avoid being interrupted by too

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.469 
we'll avoid being interrupted by too

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
over the next few months we're going to

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.490 
over the next few months we're going to
sort<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.460> tease<00:02:05.670> out<00:02:05.969> some<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.719> syntax<00:02:07.170> and

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
sort of tease out some of the syntax and

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.680 
sort of tease out some of the syntax and
sort<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.770> via<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.399> grammar<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:08.879> structure<00:02:09.420> a

next two videos we're going to keep

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.000 
next two videos we're going to keep
working<00:02:14.300> in<00:02:14.569> this<00:02:14.660> mode<00:02:14.930> of<00:02:14.959> when<00:02:15.709> you<00:02:15.830> see<00:02:15.980> a

gesture respond to that gesture in the
moment<00:02:20.060> in<00:02:20.180> real<00:02:20.360> time<00:02:21.069> so<00:02:22.069> now<00:02:22.370> that<00:02:22.519> we've

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
moment in real time so now that we've

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.369 
moment in real time so now that we've
established<00:02:22.670> that<00:02:23.209> let's<00:02:23.900> go<00:02:24.080> ahead<00:02:24.290> and

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
kitchen sink content where you might

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.350 
kitchen sink content where you might
have<00:03:09.470> some<00:03:09.829> few<00:03:10.400> hits<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:11.000> you<00:03:11.060> might<00:03:11.180> have

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
have some few hits and you might have

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.720 
have some few hits and you might have

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
have some extended techniques a little

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.160 
have some extended techniques a little
preview<00:03:19.010> of<00:03:19.190> another<00:03:19.609> gesture<00:03:20.170> extended

preview of another gesture extended

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.340 
preview of another gesture extended
techniques<00:03:21.319> we'll<00:03:22.100> get<00:03:22.220> to<00:03:22.310> that<00:03:22.340> later<00:03:23.350> but

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
techniques we'll get to that later but

the<00:03:24.590> analogy<00:03:25.010> I've<00:03:25.250> often<00:03:25.609> heard<00:03:25.970> in<00:03:26.600> working

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
the analogy I've often heard in working

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.710 
the analogy I've often heard in working
with<00:03:27.260> Walter<00:03:27.680> and<00:03:27.859> others<00:03:28.180> and<00:03:29.180> then<00:03:29.389> I'd<00:03:29.480> love

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
to share with you is imagine you took

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.930 
to share with you is imagine you took
four<00:03:33.079> pointillism<00:03:33.500> here's<00:03:33.829> the<00:03:34.010> imaginary
