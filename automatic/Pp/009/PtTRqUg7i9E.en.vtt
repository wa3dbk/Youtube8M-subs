00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.580
 was reached last week, the gladly two suspects arrested the action 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.370
 come in the first company were selling 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.330
 terneuzen 8 or 9 cars back we are going to make two electric, we think 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.500
 that it is important because the air quality in our living environment in particular 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.660
 letter requires many documents 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.460
 we have deliberately invested in a climate neutral city hall that the 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.770
 production stop therein we hope to develop this entire environment climate neutral 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.880
 and that is part of that has the view from the debate we have 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.740
 generate transported with us 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.200
 I myself am a bicycle more often 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.100
 of course it doesn't always work 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.380
 my bike is currently stated that is a problem but i got that from the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.380
 sale of electric company car expires 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.710
 blangÃ© the three days 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.200
 were actually engaged in sustainable business as support for ten years 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.210
 in the bk building to give an example we have designed this building 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.409
 to such an extent that we create scenes that represent the user 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.540
 and the heat storage cold stores for further development 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.900
 formulations 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.900
 rainwater which is used to flush toilets 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.930
 So sustainable business is in our blood 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.159
 we have our companies they became a lot of sustainability mr 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.270
 but that was an electric car on the way back to the top 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.950
 holman to bring our services to the attention of her 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.950
 clients profitable according to the company 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:17.040
 I have I sometimes 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.170
 for electric car, the very first religions chose one for three reasons 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.249
 learning process for me personally what happens around us 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:27.400
 what are the chances what are the threats what are the costs is it 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:30.669
 all affordable and I would like to contribute 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:34.839
 Tele2 is an abuse awareness process going old inside or out 

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:37.949
 our employees see that it is not so well known what is happening 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:39.379
 world is changing around us 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.719
 listen to change will in the future more economical cleaner we will 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:46.029
 have to go to work the third reason is the commercial reasons I would like to take the lead 

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:49.540
 By being innovative our customers are showing our region everything that we are good at 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.789
 to be busy 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:54.569
 the coach also thinks and cooperates in the field of alternative energy 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.569
 the course that is the message 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:02.609
 it is now time for action we have been talking to them about for years and what could be better 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.609
 then the plans also make a muscle injury left over 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.689
 so yesterday did not succeed is a company that services but the number of samples 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.459
 we want to look good at our polder, but we will have an image 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.719
 family situation the region 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:21.639
 photographer and then there is publicly advise our poll beaufort 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.789
 energy-saving solutions then there will also be an energy-efficient public one 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.569
 so hence our choice for this over 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.359
 rabobank has corporate social responsibility and sustainability 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.279
 Think highly of 

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:42.929
 and that also fits the purchase of an electric car by believing 

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:45.589
 has in the power of the collective 

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:47.929
 that's why I would like to have one signed 

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:49.159
 for this initiative 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:50.109
 Yes, why not 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:51.409
 we were not 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:55.230
 we are happy to tackle such projects that occur here 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.230
 to indicate 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.379
 the victory package is fully engaged in the sustainable development of 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:10.159
 rooftops 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:14.449
 perhaps 350 million square meters of roof ready for sustainable development 

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:19.309
 after ten years as said, it has been at the forefront and it will be clear 

00:04:19.309 --> 00:04:20.969
 are those 

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:24.050
 the neighborhoods have to make our music results 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.110
 in that sense, that investment is not fully justified 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.110
 electric car 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.230
 if ships ask LDD we are active in the field of waste energy 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.309
 and infra 

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:48.269
 sustainable and socially responsible entrepreneurship is not talking about nonsense 

00:04:48.269 --> 00:04:49.599
 but do it 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:53.599
 at this location in Alkmaar the stock exchange invested heavily in sustainable 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:56.009
 alternatives sorting installation 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:00.310
 then we invested in 2000 manders and developed a fully sustainable one 

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:01.360
 offices 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.020
 natural gas tank investments are made at these fuel locations 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.270
 we did think about it and decided to purchase a 100 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.900
 percent electric delivery van 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.060
 give the largest a sustainable company and good for each other 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.309
 he has a lot off two years with a bill 

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:32.459
 foreign successors after rest ensured the necessary seo2 emissions 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:37.770
 also the board that by buying red steel 2 credits it is better 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.610
 of course to tackle a problem at the source 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.029
 and a mission car to buy what me 

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:49.079
 causing vzw emissions and none are dust for the first time this car in the rijnmond 

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:19.529
 for me 

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:22.529
 of us clean again but specialists drive electrically 

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:26.369
 yes we want to become bigger and bigger 

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:30.089
 and that was almost thirty years ago due to the expansion with this 

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:31.150
 sit tricycle 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.200
 and then there were already won and not just
