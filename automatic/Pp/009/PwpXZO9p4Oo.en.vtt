 while they were told and all and 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.460
 that particularly rockstar down is 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.519

 with also little things that we can 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.780
 expect and because in fact rockstar 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.520
 simply told us what 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.379
 they were going to give us more 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.690
 information before the 10th of March which is 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.890
 in about a week and a half and 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.629
 that we can ask ourselves a lot of 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.700
 questions already what kind of information 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.379
 they will actually give us more 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.700
 exactly what it will be more at the level 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.800
 vehicles at the level of outfits 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.760
 level of weapons 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.989
 unfortunately with all the lic all 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.489
 the pictures you are given 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.199
 before and all we have a lot 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.359
 of things at the level of vehicles 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.190
 we had a lot of things we could see 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.769
 also a lot of screen things like 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.780
 that and also at the level of the weapons 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.189
 weapons we could not send too much so that 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.900
 can be a good idea of ​​us 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.180
 propose a little bit here is giving us 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.460
 a little bit of new information 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.159
 above but at the level of the outfits end 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.869
 the more we will say more precisely at 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.310
 level of accessories josé shown 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.390
 a lot of accessories like for example 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.850
 night vision 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.110
 there was also that the drill well 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.189
 sure to enter the bank do some 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.270
 stuff like that there was not bad 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.380
 accessories that you have presented 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.320
 besides enough accessories 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.500
 interesting you can also fly the kart 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.329
 the simple kart actually goes from 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.860
 the agent ie you will have this 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.390
 famous card that you will fly a 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.829
 so a security guard who will you 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.990
 will finally unlock a 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.189
 few doors that will be closed so he 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.500
 will be really really full of 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.700
 things finally that's information 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.229
 which have been leaked so for now 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.750
 we're not sure what's up 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.430
 really be the case in this dlc there me 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.979
 in any case we have noticed that in 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.479
 some low league and it's been already 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.280
 presented by rockstar there are some 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.550
 days like these new bikes that have 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.870
 been presented 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.240
 sells a few weeks before actually 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.850
 perfect mw2 who leaked these images there 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.950
 so we're saying that he 's leaked 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.300
 things that have been true we can say 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.100
 as well as other information such 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.020
 that some accessories and touba that's 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.360
 also true that it looks like it looks 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.490
 to be super interesting on me 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.030
 I also had a good idea to you 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.680
 to propose 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.730
 it seems odd to me I think 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.860
 maybe they 'll maybe add 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.480
 new game mode in this dlc 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.430
 robbery are going to be said to be here it's 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.200
 will also add a little game mode that 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.390
 a is a little rollier finally we can 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.160
 at the steering a steward a little this side 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.290
 as you talked a little bit about running 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.580
 pursuit with the poor anyway 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.900
 with thieves and a little with the 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.970
 police ie you have this 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.680
 possibility of finally choosing 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.500
 your role be you policeman either 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.330
 you be a thief simply so 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.040
 have a few camps how can we 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.110
 find now in video games 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.210
 who starts who are doing well 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.800
 know and everything and who finds this kind 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.480
 of system and that pleases quite well to the 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.490
 community so that's that stuff 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.300
 that we ask ourselves the maintenance in this is 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.680
 that eventually they will add 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.120
 maybe game mode stuff like 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.100
 that may appear in time 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.140
 we remember to accuse March 10 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.300
 that it will come out in this famous dlc there 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.550
 is also a little thing that I do not know 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.350
 at all if you 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.640
 you saw it or not but in any case 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.800
 of course as we have noticed 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.140
 is that this brief dlc this robbery there this 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.730
 mode there is going to be played at 4 here it will be 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.070
 obliged to play four characters and 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.090
 each character will have his own role 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.920
 you already knew that 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.210
 but if you know more particularly 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.100
 while there will be someone who will 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.420
 play a bit like being the sniper in 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.130
 someone who is going to be a little behind 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.410
 in retreat and he looks pretty much if 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.120
 everything goes well we'll have a little 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.410
 no one here that is going to be a little the 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.940
 hacker and everything and will look a little 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.110
 in computer systems that's going 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.640
 unlock do things like that 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.840
 and we'll have after the other two 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.240
 people actually who finally in 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.800
 German will have to embed themselves and well and 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.910
 and then stole the money and do that kind of 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.400
 things to take 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.360
 this is an option finally it's 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.470
 something that was said but 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.390
 maybe there are several 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.500
 possibilities either one can finally the 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.210
 boss because in these four 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.520
 People here need that there are many chief 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.050
 who is leading these other three people 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.280
 maybe he can decide 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.720
 possibly for example to say to themselves 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.400
 well finally I want everyone 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.950
 goes to the sage does not want people who 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.230
 are looking behind and 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.030
 all doing juice worried that 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.170
 it will depend on that I do not know at all but 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.180
 in any case it's true that this game this 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.950
 that I say about the ghana that is 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.000
 behind the guy who has and more than 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.590
 people coming in now 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.180
 that's really the official thing to 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.140
 take this papus here thanks to my 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.400

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.090
