it's really easy to breeze over this
level<00:00:44.489> with<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.760> aerial<00:00:45.390> gargoyle<00:00:45.840> because

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
level with the aerial gargoyle because

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.069 
level with the aerial gargoyle because
he's<00:00:46.980> ignore<00:00:47.309> everything<00:00:47.780> if<00:00:48.780> you're<00:00:48.899> low

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079
