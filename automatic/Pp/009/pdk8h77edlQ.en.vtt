consulting many many many many people so
Astra<00:00:54.270> numerology<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:55.160> no<00:00:56.329> or<00:00:57.329> for<00:00:57.600> those

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
Astra numerology like no or for those

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.360 
Astra numerology like no or for those
who<00:00:57.780> don't<00:00:58.079> know<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.920> science<00:00:59.250> of

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
who don't know it it is the science of

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.319 
who don't know it it is the science of
planets<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.739> numbers<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.579> planets<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
planets and numbers so planets the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.990 
planets and numbers so planets the
numbers<00:01:03.860> let<00:01:04.860> me<00:01:04.949> know<00:01:05.100> planets<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
numbers let me know planets is the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.730 
numbers let me know planets is the
planetary<00:01:06.450> sciences<00:01:06.869> astrology<00:01:07.530> and

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
planetary sciences astrology and

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.520 
planetary sciences astrology and
numerology<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:09.150> all<00:01:09.299> about<00:01:09.540> numbers<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.350> when

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
numerology is all about numbers so when

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.289 
numerology is all about numbers so when
we<00:01:10.619> combine<00:01:10.920> these<00:01:11.340> two<00:01:11.610> we<00:01:11.640> get<00:01:11.909> up<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.150> get<00:01:12.240> a

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
we combine these two we get up you get a

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.850 
we combine these two we get up you get a
better<00:01:12.540> flow<00:01:12.869> or<00:01:13.080> better<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.439> standing<00:01:13.770> of

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
better flow or better to the standing of

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.390 
better flow or better to the standing of
situations<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:15.060> we<00:01:15.390> encounter<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.990> life<00:01:16.400> so

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
situations that we encounter in life so

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.820 
situations that we encounter in life so
that<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.759> astral<00:01:18.270> immunology<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.229> and

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
that is the astral immunology is and and

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.270 
that is the astral immunology is and and
all<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.520> work<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:21.270> about<00:01:21.630> fine-tuning<00:01:22.130> it<00:01:23.130> is

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
all this work is about fine-tuning it is

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.120 
all this work is about fine-tuning it is
about<00:01:23.490> alignment<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.750> about<00:01:25.049> making<00:01:26.009> these

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
about alignment it is about making these

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.819 
about alignment it is about making these
the<00:01:26.400> flow<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.729> energy<00:01:26.909> flow<00:01:27.720> flow<00:01:28.140> flow<00:01:28.170> flow

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
the flow of energy flow flow flow flow

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.280 
the flow of energy flow flow flow flow
flow<00:01:29.130> put<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.729> our<00:01:29.850> lives<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.360> let's<00:01:31.140> say<00:01:31.259> for

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
flow put in our lives so let's say for

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.319 
flow put in our lives so let's say for
example<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.009> nerves<00:01:32.189> if<00:01:32.369> somebody<00:01:32.790> will<00:01:33.150> just

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
example the nerves if somebody will just

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.480 
example the nerves if somebody will just
take<00:01:33.479> one<00:01:33.659> example<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:34.200> numerology<00:01:34.409> or<00:01:34.890> before

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
take one example in numerology or before

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.160 
take one example in numerology or before
I<00:01:35.520> say<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.970> let<00:01:36.090> me<00:01:36.180> quickly<00:01:36.329> say<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.960> a

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
I say that let me quickly say that a

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.560 
I say that let me quickly say that a
basic<00:01:37.890> numerology<00:01:38.490> goes<00:01:38.759> from<00:01:39.030> number<00:01:39.180> one<00:01:39.540> to

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
basic numerology goes from number one to

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.289 
basic numerology goes from number one to
number<00:01:39.720> nine<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.439> each<00:01:41.220> number<00:01:41.549> master

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
number nine and each number master

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.030 
number nine and each number master
numerology<00:01:42.869> has<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.049> planet<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.770> is

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
numerology has a planet that is

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.370 
numerology has a planet that is
associated<00:01:44.340> with<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.909> now<00:01:45.630> say<00:01:45.810> for<00:01:45.869> example

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
associated with it now say for example

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.219 
associated with it now say for example
number<00:01:46.619> one<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.610> mighty<00:01:47.820> Sun<00:01:48.180> or<00:01:48.420> number

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.039 
or number six is Venus or number seven
is<00:01:54.570> Neptune<00:01:54.990> or<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.799> Saturn<00:01:56.280> or<00:01:56.450> language<00:01:57.450> so

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
is Neptune or a to Saturn or language so

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.999 
is Neptune or a to Saturn or language so
that<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.530> how<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.710> association<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.369> number

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
that is how the association of number

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.859 
that is how the association of number
and<00:02:00.520> basically<00:02:01.000> goes<00:02:01.390> from<00:02:01.420> number<00:02:01.719> one<00:02:01.840> to

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
and basically goes from number one to

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.899 
and basically goes from number one to
number<00:02:02.020> nine<00:02:02.320> and<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:03.039> rest<00:02:03.219> is<00:02:03.369> a<00:02:03.490> petition

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
number nine and the rest is a petition

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.990 
number nine and the rest is a petition
so<00:02:04.570> now<00:02:04.719> say<00:02:05.320> for<00:02:05.380> example<00:02:05.890> if<00:02:06.009> somebody<00:02:06.189> in

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
so now say for example if somebody in

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.859 
so now say for example if somebody in
the<00:02:07.060> diminutive<00:02:07.450> house<00:02:07.659> number<00:02:08.849> one<00:02:09.849> say<00:02:10.629> one

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
the diminutive house number one say one

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.000 
the diminutive house number one say one
eight<00:02:11.080> zero<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:13.440> then<00:02:14.440> we've<00:02:14.709> got<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:14.860> date

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
eight zero and then we've got the date

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.530 
eight zero and then we've got the date
of<00:02:15.129> birth<00:02:15.280> how<00:02:15.580> did<00:02:15.760> this<00:02:15.849> become<00:02:16.060> a<00:02:16.239> year<00:02:16.420> to

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
of birth how did this become a year to

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.390 
of birth how did this become a year to
work<00:02:16.660> say<00:02:16.870> for<00:02:16.900> example<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.950> date<00:02:18.130> of<00:02:18.250> birth

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
work say for example the date of birth

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.930 
work say for example the date of birth
is<00:02:18.730> it<00:02:19.540> is<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:20.260> fifth<00:02:20.470> of<00:02:20.620> May<00:02:20.680> it's<00:02:21.580> just<00:02:21.790> this

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
is it is the fifth of May it's just this

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.360 
is it is the fifth of May it's just this
comes<00:02:22.209> to<00:02:22.300> my<00:02:22.390> mind<00:02:22.620> fifth<00:02:23.620> of<00:02:23.800> May<00:02:23.920> I'll<00:02:24.190> say

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
comes to my mind fifth of May I'll say

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.650 
comes to my mind fifth of May I'll say
1970<00:02:25.319> so<00:02:26.319> now<00:02:26.880> if<00:02:27.880> you<00:02:28.030> look<00:02:28.060> at<00:02:28.299> this<00:02:28.450> house

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
1970 so now if you look at this house

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.570 
1970 so now if you look at this house
number<00:02:29.049> and<00:02:29.739> this<00:02:29.860> could<00:02:30.069> be<00:02:30.099> a<00:02:30.190> number<00:02:30.310> of<00:02:30.430> the

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
number and this could be a number of the

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.009 
number and this could be a number of the
apartment<00:02:31.120> this<00:02:31.330> could<00:02:31.540> be<00:02:31.629> a<00:02:31.660> number<00:02:31.780> of<00:02:31.930> the

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
apartment this could be a number of the

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.080 
apartment this could be a number of the
house<00:02:32.260> but<00:02:32.709> my<00:02:32.830> point<00:02:33.010> is<00:02:33.250> this<00:02:33.459> number<00:02:33.700> has<00:02:33.940> to

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
house but my point is this number has to

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.630 
house but my point is this number has to
be<00:02:34.120> on<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.780> entry<00:02:35.110> door<00:02:35.290> not<00:02:36.099> on<00:02:36.250> a<00:02:36.310> building

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
be on the entry door not on a building

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.750 
be on the entry door not on a building
or<00:02:37.620> offering<00:02:38.620> complex<00:02:38.980> but<00:02:39.130> right<00:02:39.430> on<00:02:39.640> the

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
or offering complex but right on the

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.059 
or offering complex but right on the
entry<00:02:40.030> door<00:02:40.209> of<00:02:40.360> your<00:02:40.540> particular<00:02:40.989> unit<00:02:41.380> so

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
entry door of your particular unit so

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.890 
entry door of your particular unit so
now<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.220> one<00:02:42.519> eight<00:02:42.760> zero<00:02:42.790> has<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:43.510> energy<00:02:43.780> of

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
now the one eight zero has the energy of

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.449 
now the one eight zero has the energy of
number<00:02:44.140> one<00:02:44.319> is<00:02:44.440> Sun<00:02:44.650> like<00:02:44.860> we<00:02:45.010> said<00:02:45.160> earlier

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
number one is Sun like we said earlier

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.460 
number one is Sun like we said earlier
number<00:02:46.150> eight<00:02:46.329> is<00:02:46.360> Saturn<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:46.930> zero<00:02:47.230> is<00:02:47.349> an

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
number eight is Saturn and zero is an

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.830 
number eight is Saturn and zero is an
admin<00:02:47.739> fire<00:02:47.920> so<00:02:48.760> what<00:02:48.940> happens<00:02:49.269> is<00:02:49.480> when<00:02:49.630> these

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
admin fire so what happens is when these

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.680 
admin fire so what happens is when these
energies<00:02:50.319> of<00:02:50.530> sun<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.099> saturn<00:02:51.510> come<00:02:52.510> together

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
energies of sun and saturn come together

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.069 
energies of sun and saturn come together
but<00:02:53.440> these<00:02:53.739> are<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.040> challenging<00:02:54.489> energies

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
but these are the challenging energies

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.809 
but these are the challenging energies
and<00:02:56.079> so<00:02:56.829> what<00:02:56.950> will<00:02:57.069> happen<00:02:57.340> is<00:02:57.430> things<00:02:57.670> like

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
and so what will happen is things like

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.210 
and so what will happen is things like
you<00:02:58.390> know<00:02:58.420> cups<00:02:58.810> injuries<00:02:59.230> accidents<00:02:59.410> family

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
you know cups injuries accidents family

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.150 
you know cups injuries accidents family
corns<00:03:02.400> number<00:03:03.400> now<00:03:04.329> so<00:03:04.989> what<00:03:05.170> do<00:03:05.230> we<00:03:05.319> do<00:03:05.470> well

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
corns number now so what do we do well

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.650 
corns number now so what do we do well
go<00:03:06.430> summer<00:03:06.670> house<00:03:06.880> with<00:03:07.120> that's<00:03:07.329> one<00:03:07.480> option

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
go summer house with that's one option

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.970 
go summer house with that's one option
but<00:03:07.900> if<00:03:07.989> this<00:03:08.109> market<00:03:08.440> is<00:03:08.530> not<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:08.859> know

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
but if this market is not you know

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.650 
but if this market is not you know
things<00:03:09.250> are<00:03:09.370> so<00:03:10.030> there's<00:03:10.299> something<00:03:10.540> called

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
things are so there's something called

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.259 
things are so there's something called
as<00:03:10.900> number<00:03:11.109> caching<00:03:11.620> so<00:03:12.190> if<00:03:12.280> this<00:03:12.609> is<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:13.120> date

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
as number caching so if this is the date

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.539 
as number caching so if this is the date
of<00:03:13.420> birth<00:03:13.600> of<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:14.680> person<00:03:14.980> who's<00:03:15.100> living<00:03:15.250> this

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
of birth of the person who's living this

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.449 
of birth of the person who's living this
number<00:03:15.970> so<00:03:16.810> we<00:03:17.380> could<00:03:17.590> use<00:03:17.799> another<00:03:18.190> number

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
number so we could use another number

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.729 
number so we could use another number
which<00:03:18.970> is<00:03:19.150> a<00:03:19.180> planet<00:03:19.569> actually<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:20.410> ship<00:03:20.620> the

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
which is a planet actually to ship the

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.220 
which is a planet actually to ship the
vibration<00:03:21.160> of<00:03:21.250> Senate<00:03:21.609> now<00:03:22.329> fifth<00:03:22.810> of<00:03:22.959> maybe

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
vibration of Senate now fifth of maybe

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.090 
vibration of Senate now fifth of maybe
like<00:03:23.470> we<00:03:23.620> know<00:03:23.739> is<00:03:23.889> Taurus<00:03:24.280> Emily<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:24.959> Taurus

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
like we know is Taurus Emily and Taurus

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.780 
like we know is Taurus Emily and Taurus
is<00:03:27.100> ruled<00:03:27.639> by<00:03:27.730> number<00:03:28.239> six<00:03:28.829> which<00:03:29.829> is<00:03:29.859> Venus<00:03:31.049> so

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
is ruled by number six which is Venus so

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.449 
is ruled by number six which is Venus so
our<00:03:33.790> best<00:03:34.180> bet<00:03:34.359> here<00:03:34.780> would<00:03:35.049> be<00:03:35.230> to<00:03:35.500> use<00:03:35.739> the

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
our best bet here would be to use the

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.599 
our best bet here would be to use the
energy<00:03:36.880> of<00:03:36.910> the<00:03:37.329> ruling<00:03:37.600> planet<00:03:37.750> here<00:03:38.519> that<00:03:39.519> is

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
energy of the ruling planet here that is

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.569 
energy of the ruling planet here that is
a<00:03:39.639> number<00:03:39.910> six<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:40.630> I<00:03:41.170> think<00:03:41.530> a<00:03:41.620> number<00:03:41.889> six<00:03:42.430> a

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
a number six and I think a number six a

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.690 
a number six and I think a number six a
smaller<00:03:43.180> six<00:03:43.750> here<00:03:44.170> which<00:03:44.829> is<00:03:44.980> tinier<00:03:45.670> than

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
smaller six here which is tinier than

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.089 
smaller six here which is tinier than
the<00:03:46.030> existing<00:03:46.450> numbers<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:47.500> idea<00:03:47.829> being<00:03:48.040> to

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
the existing numbers the idea being to

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:49.949 
the existing numbers the idea being to
shift<00:03:48.519> the<00:03:48.639> vibration<00:03:49.209> but<00:03:49.329> not<00:03:49.540> confuse<00:03:49.840> the

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
shift the vibration but not confuse the

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.039 
shift the vibration but not confuse the
main<00:03:50.109> thing<00:03:50.290> is<00:03:50.769> crucial<00:03:51.160> so<00:03:51.700> this<00:03:52.450> is<00:03:52.630> how<00:03:52.989> we

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
main thing is crucial so this is how we

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.400 
main thing is crucial so this is how we
advance<00:03:53.440> a<00:03:54.040> number<00:03:54.340> like<00:03:54.519> this<00:03:54.730> with<00:03:55.630> this

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
advance a number like this with this

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.150 
advance a number like this with this
tail<00:03:56.709> world

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
tail world

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.059 
tail world
now<00:03:57.849> if<00:03:58.450> very<00:03:58.690> important<00:03:59.079> when<00:03:59.650> we<00:03:59.799> catch

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
now if very important when we catch

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.270 
now if very important when we catch
homes<00:04:00.540> this<00:04:01.540> number<00:04:01.989> preferably<00:04:02.590> a<00:04:02.680> yellow<00:04:03.130> or

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
homes this number preferably a yellow or

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.039 
homes this number preferably a yellow or
a<00:04:03.310> gold<00:04:03.579> sticker<00:04:03.880> what's<00:04:04.150> great<00:04:04.419> I<00:04:04.450> realize<00:04:04.900> in

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
a gold sticker what's great I realize in

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.820 
a gold sticker what's great I realize in
the<00:04:05.169> past<00:04:05.349> the<00:04:06.040> second<00:04:06.370> thing<00:04:06.519> is

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
the past the second thing is

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.740 
the past the second thing is
has<00:04:07.400> to<00:04:07.610> be<00:04:07.700> tinier<00:04:08.180> than<00:04:08.210> the<00:04:08.450> existing

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
has to be tinier than the existing

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.500 
has to be tinier than the existing
numbers<00:04:09.050> but<00:04:09.200> not<00:04:09.470> very<00:04:09.800> tiny<00:04:10.220> the<00:04:11.060> idea<00:04:11.330> being

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
numbers but not very tiny the idea being

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.370 
numbers but not very tiny the idea being
that<00:04:11.570> we<00:04:11.750> should<00:04:11.900> not<00:04:11.990> go<00:04:12.080> through<00:04:12.140> the

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
that we should not go through the

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.630 
that we should not go through the
midline<00:04:12.650> we<00:04:12.980> just<00:04:13.190> weren't<00:04:13.310> sure<00:04:13.400> if<00:04:13.550> the

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
midline we just weren't sure if the

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.940 
midline we just weren't sure if the
vibration<00:04:13.820> is<00:04:14.480> the<00:04:14.600> best<00:04:14.810> one<00:04:14.960> of<00:04:14.990> it<00:04:15.110> but<00:04:15.740> also

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
vibration is the best one of it but also

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.660 
vibration is the best one of it but also
remember<00:04:16.549> that<00:04:17.060> before<00:04:18.049> we<00:04:18.140> use<00:04:18.410> Apache<00:04:18.890> is

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:19.670 
remember that before we use Apache is

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.020 
remember that before we use Apache is
reported<00:04:20.570> that<00:04:20.690> we<00:04:20.900> take<00:04:21.230> into<00:04:21.440> consideration

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
reported that we take into consideration

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.220 
reported that we take into consideration
everybody<00:04:23.030> else<00:04:23.480> wear<00:04:23.720> this<00:04:23.810> in<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.020> house

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
everybody else wear this in the house

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.130 
everybody else wear this in the house
because<00:04:24.860> this<00:04:25.820> pad<00:04:26.120> Shepard<00:04:26.570> only<00:04:26.780> work<00:04:26.930> at

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
because this pad Shepard only work at

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.340 
because this pad Shepard only work at
this<00:04:27.290> date<00:04:27.500> of<00:04:27.650> birth<00:04:27.860> and<00:04:28.480> and<00:04:29.480> of<00:04:29.600> course<00:04:29.810> a

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
this date of birth and and of course a

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.690 
this date of birth and and of course a
lot<00:04:30.680> different<00:04:31.040> people<00:04:31.130> have<00:04:31.370> different<00:04:31.400> date

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
lot different people have different date

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.670 
lot different people have different date
of<00:04:31.820> births<00:04:32.030> and<00:04:32.270> so<00:04:32.780> each<00:04:32.960> date<00:04:33.200> of<00:04:33.320> birth<00:04:33.500> has

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
of births and so each date of birth has

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.290 
of births and so each date of birth has
to<00:04:33.770> be<00:04:33.860> taken<00:04:34.130> into<00:04:34.220> consideration<00:04:34.280> to<00:04:34.970> find<00:04:35.210> a

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
to be taken into consideration to find a

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.930 
to be taken into consideration to find a
common<00:04:35.630> patch<00:04:35.810> to<00:04:36.680> flow<00:04:37.070> with<00:04:37.280> everybody<00:04:37.850> in

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
common patch to flow with everybody in

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.210 
common patch to flow with everybody in
that<00:04:37.970> house<00:04:38.240> so<00:04:38.930> number<00:04:39.560> patching<00:04:40.010> is

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
that house so number patching is

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.380 
that house so number patching is
extremely<00:04:40.880> powerful

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
extremely powerful

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.600 
extremely powerful
