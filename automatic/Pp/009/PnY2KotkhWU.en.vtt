00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.559
 hello to all so I present you this 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.809
 case that I bought for my 3rd set 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.480
 we will try it we will dismount it 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.050
 show you how it works 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.560
 I have orders and it was Thursday or 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.279
 Friday 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.179
 I launched today in pictures and 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.939
 especially the shipping costs are enough 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:28.939
 fast so it looks like this 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:41.899
 without too early 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:41.899
 after lyon after the breakup is in all 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:48.690
 less surprising case since I thought 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.930
 no such speed of delivery 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:59.280
 the bill is for a 307 2 liters 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.660
 hdi for setting because often 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.160
 everyone asks 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.430
 everyone wants to know the setting of 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.520
 their settings his writings the race ips it 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.659
 said it's the b a zoom setting for 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.310
 my car 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.930
 after according to the car you have 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.450
 you had good wind propose our 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.600
 settings after that you if you most 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:26.869
 powerful to set your way the 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.869
 notice this is the ad and cables 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.880
 and after showing you how the 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:39.400
 disassemble world is voted demonstrate the 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.450
 boxes set it and plugged it right there 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.070
 now we will make the adjustments 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.400
 so life is cruciform it was 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.729
 successful 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:54.610
 I had to remove them now 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:57.490
 withdraws like that hop the setting so 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:01.240
 in you have the record that is good 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.820
 sure in France is this the 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.929
 German type case so that's it 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.830
 we advise the original setting b1 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.720
 after you choose after you 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.670
 propose another 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:19.060
 other settings 1st they already know 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:20.410
 so I'm going to choose the dream hd 1 on 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.630
 take a little cursive screwdriver 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.860
 flat and just enough of two rounds 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:33.340
 the movie arrows is probed 1 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:35.049
 the d on the left and the 1 on the right that of 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.459
 left is for the power and the one 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.410
 right I think it was for the 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.680
 duration how long does it send the 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.940
 sauce 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.940
 voila 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.930
 So here I am already doing the 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.519
 branch because I tell you 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.129
 are three years old and it's really a 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.840
 little more boring on the other cars 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.489
 I believe what is really in 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.099
 below to really have small 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.099
 hands for pike found there 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.000
 this is because the connection 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.800
 so here now once both 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.080
 collectors are plugged enough to 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.510
 connect the small led on this one 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.970
 that's it 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:41.580
 m contact we have a small led 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:52.020
 lights up that's what was called the 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:53.040
 Croatian rained a lot and spends 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.840
 now we are waiting for the led is 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.860
 simple once help is one 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:06.440
 can proceed 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:11.700
 here it is removed by taking half 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:18.980
 we plug it will not insure but its 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:18.980
 tooth for not not they stand in 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.949
 it would be con that unfolds rolling 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:38.680
 here we move more but no it is 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.229
 do you just have to get him stuck somewhere 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.500
 part of it fix and martyrs and that's 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.500
 left
