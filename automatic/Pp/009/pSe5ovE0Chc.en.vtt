00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.899
 i 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.000
 hello everyone I'm sweet and 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:09.309
 salty and today we are going to prepare a 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.040
 Colombian mondongo that is made with 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:14.500
 fell with tripe takes a little bit of 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.080
 time but it's easy to prepare and it's 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.580
 a very delicious soup as always the 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.279
 link is recipe you can find 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.630
 at the end of the video and it's also in the 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.179
 information box 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.189
 this video is a collaborative of soups 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.890
 Colombian I'm doing with the 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.930
 channel the pan of silvana and silvana 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.840
 is going to show you how to make a soup or 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.550
 a guandu or pigeonpea sancocho 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.829
 that in the information box I'm going 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.659
 to leave the link of this video so that 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:46.210
 learn how to make this soup that is very 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:46.210
 popular on the Colombian Atlantic coast 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.750
 the main ingredient of the mondongo 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.450
 of course it's the callus or the mondongo 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.550
 here in the usa I get it frozen already 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.830
 comes washed more however to me 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.990
 like to rinse it about 5 times with water 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.340
 cold to remove a little more the 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.739
 odor 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.180
 then to soften it let's add a 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.180
 some water in a container 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.369
 and to the water we are going to add bicarbonate 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.310
 of sodium and again this is for 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.750
 soften the callus that is so hard 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.750
 we add the callus 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.159
 then we cover it with plastic film or 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.960
 plastic kitchen and refrigerate it moss 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.119
 At least two hours I like 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.610
 do it from one day to another then what 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.470
 rinse with cold water again and 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.929
 this step is optional we add a 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.289
 little lemon juice and again it 's 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.850
 to remove the smell of the callus 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:50.649
 and after adding the lemon juice 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.649
 we rinse it again with cold water 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.720
 then in a pressure cooker we go to 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.680
 add the callus and then cover it with 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.680
 enough water 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.110
 to add some flavor, add 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.420
 two twigs of long onion or junca 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.760
 then we cover the pot we let it 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.459
 come under pressure at high fire we reduce 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.800
 the fire at medium-low and we cook for 45 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.989
 minutes to an hour if you are using a 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.840
 regular pot let it boil on fire 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.360
 high reduce to medium low heat and go to 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.890
 cook for 2 hours then drain it 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.890
 let cool and cut it into pieces 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.000
 in a pot aside a large pot we're going 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.150
 to heat oil over medium heat and then 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.700
 we add chopped white onion 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.409
 the onion we are going to cook for about 3 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.620
 minutes or until it's okay 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:48.860
 transparent 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:53.120
 then we add garlic chopped green onion 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:56.690
 chopped and cooked for another minute more 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.209
 finally add tomato stir 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.830
 well and we cook for about 3 to 5 minutes 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:06.990
 or until the tomato is very soft 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.990
 now we add enough water 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:18.090
 we add minced pork meat 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:22.000
 that is what you want 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.130
 sliced ​​Colombian chorizo ​​sliced 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.090
 the horse or the tripe that we cook 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.090
 previously 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.109
 Y 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:41.820
 then add two cubes of broth 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.820
 of chicken chicken this is optional 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.909
 then we add cumin powder 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.909
 and color 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:00.040
 we stir one last time then we cover 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.650
 the pot and let it boil over the heat 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.300
 high once it's boiling 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:08.340
 we reduce the heat to medium and we are going to 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.340
 cook this for about 30 minutes 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.770
 after 30 minutes I like it 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.320
 remove the fat that the chorizo ​​released 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.549
 with a spoon this is optional but it 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.549
 I recommend it very much 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.440
 then add brown potato cut in 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:28.690
 raw cassava pieces cut into pieces and 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.340
 Creole potato cut into pieces the potato 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.720
 that I get here is frozen but 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.720
 It works very well for this recipe 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.880
 we also add peas 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:42.509
 and carrot, chopped or grated 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.460
 finally season with salt and pepper 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.460
 to taste 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.100
 Y 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.570
 and again we rummage one last time 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.090
 cover, let boil over high heat 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:04.520
 when it is boiling, reduce to a fire 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.520
 medium and we cook for another 30 minutes 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.010
 and that's how easy it is to prepare a 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.410
 delicious mondongo that we only have 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:15.460
 to serve and finally decorate with a 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.460
 little bit of chopped coriander 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.220
