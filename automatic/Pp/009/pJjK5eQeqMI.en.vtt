00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.299
 so so here we are always at the 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.520
 photokina with new cannon 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:14.860
 very many this year so we will 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.869
 go around the new ones 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.640
 products in the reflex universe so 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.160
 obviously a product that was 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.310
 extremely expected so what is the canon 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.749
 eos 7d marks two successors of the eos 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.460
 7d which picks up pretty much the same 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:29.789
 philosophy ie a housing 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.079
 rather compact oriented for 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.699
 professional expert photographers and 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.840
 especially oriented for sports photography 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:37.030
 and animal photography 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.579
 cannon decided to stay on a sensor 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.750
 in the format aps c 20 million pixels and 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:42.399
 integrates and a number of 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.070
 novelties, especially at the level of 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.750
 the autofocus where they picked up a lot 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.829
 technology had been developed on 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.530
 the 1d x 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:54.250
 so we end up with a system 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:57.200
 65-point autofocus 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.590
 all crossed in the central and 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.510
 compatible f 2.8 at the burst level 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.720
 device capable of mounting to 10 images 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.480
 per second so in jpeg until 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.520
 the memory card is full associated with 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.170
 this case so there is new 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.420
 optics including this one so at 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.970
 telephoto technology that water 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.100
 can identify with the green ring so 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.610
 uses lenses 10 francs people 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.970
 for that 1 400 mm f4 what is the cost 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.830
 is extremely compact and lightweight and on 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.500
 which we will also find 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.900
 technological developments had been 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.300
 point on the 200 400 two years ago 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.840
 so especially this ring that allows for 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.330
 program in this case autofocus 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.300
 cannon also comes out a 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.940
 new 24mm wide angle lens the 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.830
 ffs so for 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.040
 devices equipped with sensors aps-c 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:55.850
 only the 7d in this case and a 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.550
 transstandard 24 105 3.5 5.6 with a 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.730
 stabilized stm motorization that will give 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.390
 an entrance door an optics that's all 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.730
 made to 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.180
 for sensors for solid sensors 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.640
 format then we put a little bit 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.860
 on the cd so a new system 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.870
 autofocus a case that is really 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.420
 carved for sport a very viewfinder 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.210
 comfortable optical viewfinder parts to 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.940
 prisms 100% 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.680
 cannon has developed 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.940
 a kind of overlay on LCD screen at 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.200
 inside the viewfinder what we can 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.290
 have a lot of information 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.520
 displayed in this one is so canine 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.590
 to continue to develop as always 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.690
 the video part 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.760
 on these cases unfortunately 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.490
 still not four cases of registration 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.580
 4 cases on this 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:44.120
 on this case but we see beautiful 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:48.040
 evolutions including the appearance finally 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.180
 a headphone jack for a return 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.269
 exactly 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.640
 sound and a lot of functions there is the 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:58.560
 video so like zebra detail code 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.480
 to facilitate the registration of 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.640
 sequences the case will be proposed so 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.379
 a little below 1800 euros and will be 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.269
 available only on bare housing 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.269
 from next November
