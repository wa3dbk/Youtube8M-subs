to play Billy Joel's opening to piano
man<00:00:49.760> all<00:00:50.760> right<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:51.000> was<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.149> first<00:00:51.449> song

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
man all right this was the first song

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.420 
man all right this was the first song
that<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.930> learned<00:00:52.170> how<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.440> play<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:53.899> it's<00:00:55.430> it's

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
that I learned how to play and it's it's

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.389 
that I learned how to play and it's it's
pretty<00:00:56.640> simple<00:00:57.000> really<00:00:57.989> ranges<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:58.739> one<00:00:59.100> side

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
pretty simple really ranges on one side

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.740 
pretty simple really ranges on one side
of<00:00:59.609> harmonica<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.449> it's<00:01:01.350> not<00:01:01.559> hard<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:03.059> do<00:01:03.270> as

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
of harmonica so it's not hard to do as

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.170 
of harmonica so it's not hard to do as
you<00:01:03.899> can<00:01:03.989> see<00:01:04.939> last<00:01:05.939> page<00:01:06.180> as<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.229> can<00:01:07.290> see<00:01:08.180> it

you can see last page as you can see it

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.230 
you can see last page as you can see it
really<00:01:09.630> stays<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:09.990> one<00:01:10.470> side<00:01:10.740> but<00:01:11.729> Monica

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
really stays on one side but Monica

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.210 
really stays on one side but Monica
really<00:01:12.930> basing<00:01:13.500> around<00:01:13.740> six<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:15.210> key<00:01:15.600> six<00:01:16.220> so

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
really basing around six the key six so

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.300

probably<00:01:45.689> threw<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.079> some<00:01:46.530> extra<00:01:46.590> numbers

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
probably threw in some extra numbers

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.740 
probably threw in some extra numbers
when<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.250> was<00:01:47.369> saying<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.759> because<00:01:47.909> gets

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
when I was saying that because gets

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.260 
when I was saying that because gets
really<00:01:49.200> confusing<00:01:49.350> if<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:49.890> just<00:01:50.310> speak<00:01:51.149> it

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
really confusing if you just speak it

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.910 
really confusing if you just speak it
out<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:52.320> as<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:53.399> might<00:01:53.820> look<00:01:54.060> pretty<00:01:54.500> weird<00:01:55.500> but

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
out so as it might look pretty weird but

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.580 
out so as it might look pretty weird but
it's<00:01:56.070> playing<00:01:56.520> three<00:01:57.360> different<00:01:57.840> notes<00:01:58.469> at

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
it's playing three different notes at

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.499 
it's playing three different notes at
the<00:01:58.680> same<00:01:58.920> time<00:01:59.250> you're<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.909> makes<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.299> lot

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
the same time you're it makes it a lot

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.819 
the same time you're it makes it a lot
easier<00:02:01.020> when<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.229> don't<00:02:01.380> have<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.649> like

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
easier when you don't have to like

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.999 
easier when you don't have to like
really<00:02:02.280> feel<00:02:02.610> where<00:02:02.880> you're<00:02:03.030> playing<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:04.110> the

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
really feel where you're playing and the

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.679 
really feel where you're playing and the
reason<00:02:05.310> why<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.490> have<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:06.000> pay<00:02:06.180> just<00:02:06.390> shaded

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
reason why I have to pay just shaded

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.820 
reason why I have to pay just shaded
green<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.380> half<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.950> pages<00:02:08.479> you<00:02:09.479> know<00:02:09.599> not<00:02:10.170> is
