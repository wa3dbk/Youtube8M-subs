00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.910
 guys, if I'm not mistaken, it seems that you 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.279
 you have kept busy in my absence 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.560
 Of course but it's great to have you 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.019
 come back again if I miss you 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.449
 least since I saw you I realized 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:39.720
 that all your experiences in South America 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:43.589
 you had changed a lot, you have matured 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.159
 much to see you forced to depend on 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:45.750
 no one 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:47.070
 I remember that I was wanting so much 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.510
 tell you what had happened that 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.250
 we were even having some 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.800
 problems meditating together well say 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.120
 I also really wanted to 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.120
 listen to your adventures 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.269
 and the medallion grants the power of a 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.190
 peacefully about certain barriers 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.980
 get closer to the barrier and avoid the 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.230
 you will move with her 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.700
 I was very proud that you had 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.520
 found the leonardo medallion 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.900
 thank you teacher but it was not the end of 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.840
 the history 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.060
 the echoes tell me again what happened 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.460
 black 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.659
 because the temple began 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.999
 self-destruct 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.479
 and the typical exclusive traps of a 

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:30.479
 ancient temple 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.820
 this fine leonardo 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.820
 I have been well trained 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.600
 beckham I need a break 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.800
 they said as they sat they did not act like 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.800
 criminals 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.300
 and creatures 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.460
 someone 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.780
 that is the truth 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.329
 the medallion had mystical powers could 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.599
 use it to go through objects 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.599
 solids 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.620
 to 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.630
 continue to spread more and more 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:55.160
 it's already your excellent life my son 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.450
 I'm proud of you for resisting the 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.140
 temptation to fight by reasoning 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.140
 comes 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.330
 there were no soldiers in it 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.150
 poor the angle 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.150

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.150
 checked 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.030
 those cataracts will be so wives that 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:28.120
 it was worth it 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.120
 mine the sensor better move away from them 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.080

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.080
 of the mines 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.100
 now 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.390

 if I remember 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:34.260

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:48.519
