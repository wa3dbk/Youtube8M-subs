okay<00:00:01.439> yeah<00:00:01.740> we<00:00:02.480> this<00:00:03.480> is<00:00:03.750> a<00:00:04.819> zero<00:00:05.819> point<00:00:06.120> eight

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
okay yeah we this is a zero point eight

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.770 
okay yeah we this is a zero point eight
millimeter<00:00:07.080> sieve<00:00:07.950> and<00:00:08.250> this<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.389> our<00:00:09.540> first

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
millimeter sieve and this is our first

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.480 
millimeter sieve and this is our first
good-sized<00:00:10.200> goal<00:00:10.530> right<00:00:11.219> here<00:00:13.070> nice<00:00:14.070> big<00:00:14.309> old

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
good-sized goal right here nice big old

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.090 
good-sized goal right here nice big old
piece<00:00:14.730> oh<00:00:15.139> yeah<00:00:16.139> that's<00:00:16.590> probably<00:00:16.859> eighty

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
piece oh yeah that's probably eighty

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.359 
piece oh yeah that's probably eighty
nine<00:00:17.310> millimeter<00:00:18.000> across<00:00:18.890> Peters<00:00:19.890> ask<00:00:20.100> can

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
nine millimeter across Peters ask can

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.609 
nine millimeter across Peters ask can
you<00:00:20.400> find<00:00:21.150> two<00:00:21.420> pieces<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.140> picking<00:00:22.500> up

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
you find two pieces that picking up

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.800 
you find two pieces that picking up
their<00:00:22.890> pad<00:00:23.250> earring<00:00:23.640> earrings<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.630> think

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
their pad earring earrings and I think

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.019 
their pad earring earrings and I think
his<00:00:24.930> wife<00:00:25.080> was<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.500> very<00:00:25.650> small<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.369> tiny

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
his wife was that very small is a tiny

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.349 
his wife was that very small is a tiny
earrings<00:00:28.490> but<00:00:29.490> this<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.820> what<00:00:29.970> we're<00:00:30.119> looking

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
earrings but this is what we're looking

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.049 
earrings but this is what we're looking
for<00:00:30.390> yep<00:00:31.050> this<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.130> stuff<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.430> will<00:00:32.820> not

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
for yep this is the stuff that will not

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.709 
for yep this is the stuff that will not
normally<00:00:33.840> be<00:00:34.290> caught<00:00:34.559> by<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.550> mongolian<00:00:36.480> loose

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
normally be caught by a mongolian loose

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.440 
normally be caught by a mongolian loose
there<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.380> go<00:00:37.579> because<00:00:38.579> what's<00:00:38.760> what<00:00:39.000> size<00:00:39.239> do

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
there you go because what's what size do

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.410 
there you go because what's what size do
you<00:00:39.480> reckon<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:41.120> about<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.180> millimeter

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
you reckon that is about a millimeter

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.020 
you reckon that is about a millimeter
this<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> zero<00:00:44.129> point<00:00:44.399> eight<00:00:44.520> millimeters

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
this is a zero point eight millimeters

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.150 
this is a zero point eight millimeters
sieve<00:00:45.450> okay<00:00:46.289> well<00:00:46.530> that's<00:00:46.739> about<00:00:47.129> a

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
sieve okay well that's about a

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.369 
sieve okay well that's about a
millimeter<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:48.059> he's<00:00:48.300> flat<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.989> it's<00:00:49.200> very

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
millimeter and he's flat and it's very

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.959 
millimeter and he's flat and it's very
flat<00:00:49.649> yeah<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.399> would<00:00:50.579> just<00:00:50.789> skip

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
flat yeah so that would just skip

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.060 
flat yeah so that would just skip
through<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.300> table<00:00:51.600> Russian<00:00:52.530> sluice<00:00:52.829> well

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
through a table Russian sluice well

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.650 
through a table Russian sluice well
let's<00:00:53.250> get<00:00:53.399> some<00:00:53.579> tweezers<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.180> put<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.570> a

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
let's get some tweezers and put it in a

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.090 
let's get some tweezers and put it in a
little<00:00:54.809> bowl<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.530> look<00:00:55.649> at<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.860> with

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
little bowl and you can look at it with

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.139 
little bowl and you can look at it with
a<00:00:56.280> microscope<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.960> said<00:00:58.640> well<00:00:59.640> we<00:00:59.940> have

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
a microscope this said well we have

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.590 
a microscope this said well we have
found<00:01:00.890> gold<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.190> sibs<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:03.589> the<00:01:04.589> left<00:01:05.600> fife

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
found gold in the sibs on the left fife

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.810 
found gold in the sibs on the left fife
in<00:01:06.780> his<00:01:06.960> group<00:01:07.200> or<00:01:07.500> picking<00:01:08.369> out<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.640> gold

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
in his group or picking out the gold

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.200 
in his group or picking out the gold
pieces<00:01:09.320> which<00:01:10.320> we<00:01:10.650> did<00:01:11.010> not<00:01:11.220> check<00:01:11.580> before<00:01:12.060> we

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
pieces which we did not check before we

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.100 
pieces which we did not check before we
ran<00:01:12.950> our<00:01:13.950> material<00:01:14.520> through<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:14.970> on<00:01:15.930> the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
ran our material through and on the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.260 
ran our material through and on the
right<00:01:16.259> Robbins<00:01:16.740> checking<00:01:17.189> with<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.400> i

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
right Robbins checking with the i

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.249 
right Robbins checking with the i
believe<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.229> 0.5<00:01:19.979> millimeter<00:01:20.369> screen<00:01:21.360> to

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
believe it's 0.5 millimeter screen to

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.280 
believe it's 0.5 millimeter screen to
see<00:01:22.439> if<00:01:22.530> he<00:01:22.650> can<00:01:22.770> see<00:01:22.979> any<00:01:23.130> gold<00:01:23.400> before<00:01:24.020> we<00:01:25.020> run

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
see if he can see any gold before we run

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.990 
see if he can see any gold before we run
our<00:01:25.439> material<00:01:25.950> through<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.340> because<00:01:26.520> this

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
our material through it because this

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.710 
our material through it because this
should<00:01:27.420> catch<00:01:27.630> all<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.990> pinballs<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:29.720> also

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
should catch all the pinballs and also

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.789 
should catch all the pinballs and also
gold<00:01:32.299> but<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:33.450> want<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.689> make<00:01:33.750> sure<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.110> we

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
gold but we want to make sure that we

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.649 
gold but we want to make sure that we
use<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> baron<00:01:35.970> sieve<00:01:36.210> before<00:01:36.600> we<00:01:36.720> do<00:01:36.840> that

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
use a baron sieve before we do that

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.200 
use a baron sieve before we do that
we've<00:01:39.659> got<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.840> piece<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.079> gold<00:01:40.380> right<00:01:40.590> here<00:01:40.650> and

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
we've got a piece of gold right here and

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:48.319 
we've got a piece of gold right here and
as<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.799> pan<00:01:45.380> it<00:01:46.380> will<00:01:46.619> move<00:01:46.829> down<00:01:46.970> that<00:01:47.970> black

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
as I pan it will move down that black

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.690 
as I pan it will move down that black
sand<00:01:50.060> and<00:01:51.060> housings<00:01:51.450> ago<00:01:51.750> did<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.140> say<00:01:52.320> oh<00:01:52.700> I

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
sand and housings ago did you say oh I

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.770 
sand and housings ago did you say oh I
don't<00:01:54.299> know<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:55.490> maybe<00:01:56.490> 50<00:01:57.180> minus<00:01:57.390> you

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
don't know this is maybe 50 minus you

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.690 
don't know this is maybe 50 minus you
see<00:01:57.990> how<00:01:58.110> it's<00:01:58.290> just<00:01:58.469> scooting<00:01:58.829> down<00:01:58.860> it's<00:01:59.310> fat

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
see how it's just scooting down it's fat

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.200 
see how it's just scooting down it's fat
it<00:02:00.030> just<00:02:00.530> skates<00:02:01.530> right<00:02:01.770> on<00:02:01.979> down<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:02.549> this

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
it just skates right on down so this

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.609 
it just skates right on down so this
black<00:02:03.479> satin<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:03.990> going<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.259> bed<00:02:04.409> how<00:02:04.560> it

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
black satin is going to bed how it

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.819 
black satin is going to bed how it
packed<00:02:04.950> oh<00:02:05.280> no<00:02:05.610> no<00:02:06.020> no<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.200> I've<00:02:07.320> heard<00:02:07.560> packed

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
packed oh no no no and I've heard packed

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.339 
packed oh no no no and I've heard packed
it's<00:02:08.039> just<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.489> nature<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.539> flat<00:02:09.810> gold<00:02:10.140> on

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
it's just the nature of the flat gold on

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.080 
it's just the nature of the flat gold on
top<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.860> dense<00:02:11.039> black<00:02:11.310> sand<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.910> so

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
top of the dense black sand and so

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.380 
top of the dense black sand and so
that's<00:02:12.660> why<00:02:12.959> is<00:02:13.110> owning<00:02:14.000> surfing<00:02:15.000> that's<00:02:15.239> not

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
that's why is owning surfing that's not

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.210 
that's why is owning surfing that's not
loading<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:15.959> skated<00:02:16.530> no<00:02:16.650> it's<00:02:16.800> not<00:02:16.980> floating

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.640 
loading it skated no it's not floating
on<00:02:17.520> its<00:02:17.700> kiting<00:02:18.300> over<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:18.720> that<00:02:19.050> blocks<00:02:19.379> and

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.860 
on its kiting over that that blocks and
surface<00:02:20.069> so<00:02:20.310> that's<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.270> importance<00:02:21.750> of

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
surface so that's the importance of

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.470 
surface so that's the importance of
shaking<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.319> down<00:02:22.349> every<00:02:22.680> once<00:02:22.980> in<00:02:23.129> a<00:02:23.190> while

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
shaking you down every once in a while

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.839 
shaking you down every once in a while
coming<00:02:24.480> back<00:02:24.629> and<00:02:24.900> very<00:02:25.110> carefully<00:02:25.680> nice<00:02:26.610> and

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
coming back and very carefully nice and

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.009 
coming back and very carefully nice and
slow<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.980> even<00:02:28.980> at<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.750> even<00:02:30.750> at<00:02:30.870> that

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
slow and even at that even at that

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.180 
slow and even at that even at that
you're<00:02:31.260> going<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.530> lose<00:02:31.680> something<00:02:32.099> now

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
you're going to lose something now

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.790 
you're going to lose something now
here's<00:02:32.489> this<00:02:32.790> may<00:02:33.030> be<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.330> same<00:02:33.510> piece<00:02:33.810> that

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
here's this may be the same piece that

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.790 
here's this may be the same piece that
we're<00:02:34.920> getting<00:02:35.010> real<00:02:35.310> close<00:02:35.340> here<00:02:36.800> let's

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
we're getting real close here let's

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.110 
we're getting real close here let's
posit<00:02:38.069> and<00:02:38.310> go<00:02:38.400> within<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.790> focus<00:02:40.970> so<00:02:41.970> we're

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
posit and go within the focus so we're

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.869 
posit and go within the focus so we're
into<00:02:42.440> here<00:02:43.440> it<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:43.680> here<00:02:43.980> really<00:02:44.489> meets<00:02:44.700> or

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
into here it is here really meets or

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.050 
into here it is here really meets or
less<00:02:45.180> yeah<00:02:46.160> would<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.280> sell<00:02:47.459> better<00:02:47.730> meet<00:02:47.940> you

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
less yeah would you sell better meet you

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:55.009 
less yeah would you sell better meet you
oh<00:02:48.209> I<00:02:48.300> think<00:02:48.450> so<00:02:48.690> yeah<00:02:49.640> this<00:02:50.640> is<00:02:50.879> the<00:02:53.060> 0.5<00:02:54.060> 0.25

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
oh I think so yeah this is the 0.5 0.25

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.410 
oh I think so yeah this is the 0.5 0.25
screen<00:02:55.379> i<00:02:55.530> believe<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:56.310> just<00:02:57.030> carefully

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030

that<00:03:15.239> i'm<00:03:15.390> most<00:03:15.629> familiar<00:03:17.330> this<00:03:18.330> is<00:03:18.480> kind<00:03:18.720> of

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
that i'm most familiar this is kind of

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.170 
that i'm most familiar this is kind of
painstaking<00:03:19.080> panning<00:03:20.010> but<00:03:20.220> it's<00:03:20.489> it's<00:03:20.970> worth

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
painstaking panning but it's it's worth

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.910 
painstaking panning but it's it's worth
it<00:03:21.390> because<00:03:21.420> you<00:03:21.989> just<00:03:22.019> have<00:03:22.440> to<00:03:22.590> be<00:03:22.709> careful

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
it because you just have to be careful

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.259 
it because you just have to be careful
and<00:03:23.510> take<00:03:24.510> your<00:03:24.720> time<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:26.000> don't<00:03:27.000> think<00:03:27.209> that

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
and take your time I don't think that

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:33.710 
and take your time I don't think that
big<00:03:27.599> piece<00:03:27.870> is<00:03:28.080> gold<00:03:32.330> well<00:03:33.330> we'll<00:03:33.480> get<00:03:33.629> the

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
big piece is gold well we'll get the

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.199 
big piece is gold well we'll get the
microscope<00:03:34.230> out<00:03:34.440> in<00:03:34.590> a<00:03:34.650> minute<00:03:34.830> and<00:03:35.180> like<00:03:36.180> I

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
microscope out in a minute and like I

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.000 
microscope out in a minute and like I
said<00:03:36.540> is<00:03:36.750> that<00:03:36.989> when<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.379> reach<00:03:37.530> this<00:03:37.709> stage

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
said is that when you reach this stage

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.940 
said is that when you reach this stage
the<00:03:38.310> fine<00:03:38.580> gold<00:03:38.909> can<00:03:39.330> be<00:03:39.680> underneath<00:03:40.680> the

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
the fine gold can be underneath the

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.280 
the fine gold can be underneath the
black<00:03:41.159> satin<00:03:41.580> pie<00:03:41.760> well<00:03:42.629> here's<00:03:43.019> Steve

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
black satin pie well here's Steve

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.809 
black satin pie well here's Steve
looking<00:03:43.769> at<00:03:44.360> down<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.510> microscope<00:03:46.080> at<00:03:46.349> the

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
looking at down the microscope at the

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.990 
looking at down the microscope at the
final<00:03:47.819> Black<00:03:48.030> Sun<00:03:48.330> and<00:03:48.629> I<00:03:49.500> would<00:03:50.430> ask<00:03:50.610> you<00:03:50.730> in<00:03:50.940> a

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
final Black Sun and I would ask you in a

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.660 
final Black Sun and I would ask you in a
moment<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.510> count<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:52.530> gold<00:03:52.950> in<00:03:53.750> pieces<00:03:55.670> the

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
moment to count the gold in pieces the

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.119 
moment to count the gold in pieces the
biggest<00:03:56.909> pieces<00:03:57.269> just<00:03:57.629> jump<00:03:57.900> out<00:03:58.019> at<00:03:58.230> you<00:03:58.409> okay

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
biggest pieces just jump out at you okay

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.880 
biggest pieces just jump out at you okay
the<00:03:59.400> smallest<00:03:59.849> pieces<00:04:00.120> it<00:04:00.840> takes<00:04:01.260> a<00:04:01.409> little<00:04:01.590> a

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
the smallest pieces it takes a little a

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.809 
the smallest pieces it takes a little a
little<00:04:02.040> bit<00:04:02.519> of<00:04:02.810> maneuvering<00:04:04.340> get<00:04:05.340> your<00:04:05.519> iron

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
little bit of maneuvering get your iron

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.149 
little bit of maneuvering get your iron
and<00:04:06.090> light<00:04:06.360> just<00:04:06.599> right<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:07.110> the<00:04:07.530> focus<00:04:07.799> just

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
and light just right and the focus just

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.910 
and light just right and the focus just
right<00:04:08.489> okay<00:04:09.090> but<00:04:09.390> the<00:04:10.200> smaller<00:04:10.530> ones<00:04:10.769> are

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
right okay but the smaller ones are

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.789 
right okay but the smaller ones are
really<00:04:11.189> too<00:04:11.400> too<00:04:11.909> many<00:04:12.510> to<00:04:12.750> count<00:04:12.780> what<00:04:13.620> sort

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
really too too many to count what sort

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.080 
really too too many to count what sort
of<00:04:13.860> shape<00:04:14.129> is<00:04:14.159> the<00:04:14.489> goal<00:04:15.199> our<00:04:16.310> angular<00:04:17.310> all

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
of shape is the goal our angular all

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.129 
of shape is the goal our angular all
right<00:04:18.239> it's

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
right it's

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.170 
right it's
from<00:04:19.919> what<00:04:20.069> I've<00:04:20.189> seen<00:04:20.219> it<00:04:20.609> doesn't<00:04:20.909> look<00:04:20.999> to

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
from what I've seen it doesn't look to

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.080

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
be beat flat flakes like like what I've
