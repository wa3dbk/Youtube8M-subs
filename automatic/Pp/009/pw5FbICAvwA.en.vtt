me a lot of stuff like I used to be
really<00:02:34.300> stressed<00:02:34.720> when<00:02:34.960> I<00:02:34.990> did<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.260> commentary

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
really stressed when I did a commentary

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.530 
really stressed when I did a commentary
and<00:02:36.040> now<00:02:36.160> I'm<00:02:36.370> actually<00:02:36.760> feeling<00:02:37.210> more

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
and now I'm actually feeling more

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.950 
and now I'm actually feeling more
confident<00:02:38.050> with<00:02:38.290> what<00:02:38.320> I<00:02:38.590> do<00:02:38.710> and<00:02:39.780> he<00:02:40.780> also

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
confident with what I do and he also

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.230 
confident with what I do and he also
showed<00:02:41.470> me<00:02:41.680> not<00:02:41.890> not<00:02:42.190> just<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.580> gameplay<00:02:42.790> is

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
showed me not not just the gameplay is

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.300 
showed me not not just the gameplay is
important<00:02:43.840> but<00:02:44.050> more<00:02:44.350> more<00:02:44.890> of<00:02:45.070> the

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
important but more more of the

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.790 
important but more more of the
commentary<00:02:45.880> it<00:02:46.360> kind<00:02:46.660> of<00:02:46.750> gives<00:02:46.960> more<00:02:47.440> soul

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
commentary it kind of gives more soul

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.740 
commentary it kind of gives more soul
it's<00:02:48.280> like<00:02:48.490> kind<00:02:48.880> of<00:02:48.940> personal<00:02:49.450> when<00:02:49.600> you

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
it's like kind of personal when you

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.990 
it's like kind of personal when you
visit<00:02:50.200> some<00:02:50.410> of<00:02:50.440> someone's<00:02:50.950> channel<00:02:51.280> and<00:02:51.430> he's

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
visit some of someone's channel and he's

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.210 
visit some of someone's channel and he's
making<00:02:52.270> a<00:02:52.510> commentary<00:02:52.960> rather<00:02:53.320> than<00:02:53.560> he<00:02:53.740> if<00:02:54.010> he

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
making a commentary rather than he if he

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.070 
making a commentary rather than he if he
just<00:02:54.460> stays<00:02:54.580> silent<00:02:54.910> during<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.780> entire

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
just stays silent during the entire

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.770 
just stays silent during the entire
video<00:02:56.320> and<00:02:56.530> you<00:02:57.130> just<00:02:57.310> watch<00:02:57.520> him<00:02:57.760> how<00:02:57.940> amazing

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
video and you just watch him how amazing

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.330 
video and you just watch him how amazing
he<00:02:58.900> plays<00:02:59.170> but<00:02:59.440> if<00:02:59.560> you<00:02:59.650> combine<00:02:59.890> these<00:03:00.280> two

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
he plays but if you combine these two

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.550 
he plays but if you combine these two
things<00:03:00.550> you<00:03:01.030> can<00:03:01.600> actually<00:03:01.810> make<00:03:02.230> a<00:03:02.260> pretty

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
things you can actually make a pretty

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.880 
things you can actually make a pretty
good<00:03:02.830> result<00:03:03.280> so<00:03:03.400> that's<00:03:03.850> why<00:03:04.090> people<00:03:04.390> who<00:03:05.260> do

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
good result so that's why people who do

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.400 
good result so that's why people who do
come<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.220> trees<00:03:06.520> are<00:03:06.910> I<00:03:07.480> guess<00:03:08.140> more

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
come the trees are I guess more

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.800 
come the trees are I guess more
successful<00:03:09.040> I<00:03:09.130> would<00:03:09.190> say<00:03:09.520> that<00:03:09.670> no<00:03:09.880> but<00:03:10.570> it
