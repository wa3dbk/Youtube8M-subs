 aging the composition we primed 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:36.219
 the surface of our layout is special 

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:39.550

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:48.219
 the layers are not defended so we need 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:50.670
 must be primed with special 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:54.449
 ground 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.280
 just without any special and 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.389

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.760

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.550

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:19.630
 special decorative patched brushes 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:24.900
 again put this gold around 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.900
 Coin doesn't even miss anything 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.690
 completely different expensive-rich and 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.950
 tell the crawl paint what they 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.659
 there is no such unusual 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:51.390
 paint just with that effect 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.509
 gold is not ordinary paint is paint 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.479

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.789
 acrylic based which is used 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.350
 for decoration 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.390
 decorative coatings decorative 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.060
 plaster well, it turned out we have such 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.829
 here's the beauty of it also you wont 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.769
 to put 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:14.739

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:16.599
 chic and beauty point squeaky look with 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.700
 my side is all right yes all 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:23.940
 well I saw the first time corrected 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.840
 painting something to be rated 5 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.079
 Well Well it until dry 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.269
 and friends to everyone else trying to tighten 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:33.160
 aging process can not be said about our 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.349
 package like this and wants and asks 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.220
 so we can quickly make it 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:41.319
 although despite the fact that he is already in my 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.900
 look very beautiful looks expensive 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.799
 golden paint and did the trick and he 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.629
 already dried 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.450
 Julia what are we going to do next with an attack 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:51.970
 the help of which we will know him further 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.930
 we will take a special bituminous varnish for 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.650
 aging 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.889
 and we will apply it in order to manifest 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:04.090
 all this beautiful texture of the beginning of the baguette 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:07.889
 for this my money first gloves so 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:14.049
 how this material is very poorly washed off 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:16.630
 you take beeps and energetic 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:19.239
 movements as this varnish is very fast 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.239
 grabs we will put it on 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.709
 the wife will be in the middle of this not be afraid 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:29.099
 it is necessary that is like this 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:33.010
 wet the sponge with such movements 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:37.569
 start again to fill all the holes and 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:40.319
 slits massively gangsters and our baguette 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.650
 gets a completely different color 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:47.019
 repentance immediately seems 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:51.319
 yes brown is so beautiful state and 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:55.939
 at the same time that's the point I'm outstanding 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:59.359
 in such a natural card start 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:05.959
 it will be necessary to wipe as if leaving as 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:08.659
 times here are dark lacquer textures and we 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.129
 continue and we appeared on the table 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:13.579
 wonderful. 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:16.699
 Swipe Spirit I spent yes nothing 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:17.690
 us this substance in order to raise 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:21.289
 surplus 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:26.060
 our bituminous varnish and manifest 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:28.940
 even more beautiful texture of the baguette and 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:35.000
 light such movements begin 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:39.260
 remove excess varnish and remove yes yes yes 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:43.130
 and how not to overdo it 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:45.370
 make out beautiful of course all this is possible 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.110
 back back what varnish and 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.889
 finally our baguette has aged good 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.699
 light words 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:54.590

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.210
 we got we initially took 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.190
 young handsome untouched by that baguette 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.190
 successful composition using bitumen 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.590
