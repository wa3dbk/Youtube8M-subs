Peter pub in last week's video that we

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
saw so it doesn't necessarily mean that

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.990 
saw so it doesn't necessarily mean that
the<00:01:37.320> sleeved<00:01:37.740> version<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.490> wetsuit<00:01:38.820> is

the sleeved version of the wetsuit is

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.940 
the sleeved version of the wetsuit is
the<00:01:39.180> best<00:01:39.420> one<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.630> go<00:01:39.780> with<00:01:40.079> yes<00:01:40.740> it's

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
the best one to go with yes it's

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.670 
the best one to go with yes it's
generally<00:01:41.579> faster<00:01:42.210> but<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:43.020> might<00:01:43.229> not<00:01:43.439> suit

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
generally faster but it might not suit

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.920 
generally faster but it might not suit
your<00:01:43.860> stroke<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.909> might<00:01:45.119> prefer<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.570> freedom

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
your stroke you might prefer the freedom

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.289 
your stroke you might prefer the freedom
without<00:01:46.799> having<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.430> sleeves<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.820> all

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
without having the sleeves that all

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.929 
without having the sleeves that all
comes<00:01:48.689> down<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:49.140> your<00:01:49.649> own<00:01:49.710> preference<00:01:50.430> but

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
comes down to your own preference but

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.999 
comes down to your own preference but
based<00:01:51.299> on<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.990> shows<00:01:52.200> me<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.409> the
