00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
and let the bogie will serve as a

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.950 
and let the bogie will serve as a
platform<00:00:49.909> so<00:00:50.909> I'll<00:00:51.000> come<00:00:51.210> up<00:00:51.239> from<00:00:51.480> here<00:00:51.690> and

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
platform so I'll come up from here and

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.329 
platform so I'll come up from here and
over<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.150> caliper<00:00:54.150> bracket<00:00:54.980> real<00:00:55.980> strong

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:56.339 
over to the caliper bracket real strong

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:58.220 
over to the caliper bracket real strong
it's<00:00:56.670> got<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.000> adjust<00:00:57.269> it's<00:00:57.600> got<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.870> move<00:00:57.989> back

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
it's got to adjust it's got to move back

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.689 
it's got to adjust it's got to move back
and<00:00:58.409> forth<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.739> little<00:00:58.769> bit<00:00:59.100> as<00:00:59.250> well

going those count those the bogies
wheels<00:01:56.040> are<00:01:56.220> off<00:01:56.370> though<00:01:56.790> those<00:01:57.060> are<00:01:57.090> still

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
wheels are off though those are still

roller<00:01:58.380> wheels<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:59.070> think<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.640> put<00:01:59.790> on<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.909> big

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
roller wheels I think to put on a big

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.230 
roller wheels I think to put on a big
shock<00:02:00.360> table<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.810> big<00:02:00.960> metal<00:02:01.260> shop<00:02:01.440> table<00:02:02.240> they

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
shock table a big metal shop table they

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.520 
shock table a big metal shop table they
got<00:02:03.420> needle<00:02:04.350> bearings<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:05.340> grease<00:02:05.640> fittings

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
got needle bearings of grease fittings

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.479 
got needle bearings of grease fittings
they<00:02:07.530> won't<00:02:07.740> be<00:02:07.860> carrying<00:02:08.159> a<00:02:08.220> lot<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.369> weight

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
they won't be carrying a lot of weight

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.859 
they won't be carrying a lot of weight
so<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:08.909> don't<00:02:09.149> believe<00:02:09.330> you'll<00:02:09.509> have<00:02:09.659> any

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
so I don't believe you'll have any

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.570 
so I don't believe you'll have any
problem<00:02:10.379> as<00:02:10.500> far<00:02:10.739> as<00:02:10.769> them<00:02:10.979> going<00:02:11.190> going<00:02:11.430> the

problem as far as them going going the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.670 
problem as far as them going going the
long<00:02:11.760> run

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680

pop<00:02:13.680> them<00:02:13.830> will<00:02:13.950> grease<00:02:14.129> everything<00:02:14.549> and<00:02:14.730> I

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
pop them will grease everything and I

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.220 
pop them will grease everything and I

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230

I think it'll fit in there but it's be a

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.320 
I think it'll fit in there but it's be a
tight<00:02:50.080> tight<00:02:50.470> tight<00:02:50.650> fit<00:02:51.160> and<00:02:51.610> I'm<00:02:52.000> gonna<00:02:52.150> have

tight tight tight fit and I'm gonna have

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.180 
tight tight tight fit and I'm gonna have
to<00:02:52.360> gain<00:02:52.660> some<00:02:52.959> ground<00:02:52.989> on<00:02:53.530> that<00:02:53.560> belt<00:02:53.980> because

to gain some ground on that belt because

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.770 
to gain some ground on that belt because
it's<00:02:54.549> slipping<00:02:54.940> it's<00:02:55.090> not<00:02:55.239> wrapping<00:02:55.690> around

and<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:04.850> teeth<00:04:05.060> so<00:04:05.420> maybe<00:04:06.350> the<00:04:06.560> little<00:04:06.710> bit<00:04:06.860> of

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
and the teeth so maybe the little bit of

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.000 
and the teeth so maybe the little bit of
dirt<00:04:07.160> getting<00:04:07.460> in<00:04:07.580> there<00:04:07.790> with<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:09.560> play<00:04:09.770> that

dirt getting in there with the play that
I've<00:04:10.100> got<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.490> room<00:04:10.700> in<00:04:10.850> between<00:04:10.940> the<00:04:11.210> track

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
I've got the room in between the track

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.360 
I've got the room in between the track
and<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:11.900> teeth<00:04:12.140> the<00:04:12.470> chain<00:04:12.770> and<00:04:12.920> the<00:04:13.010> teeth<00:04:13.220> I

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
and the teeth the chain and the teeth I

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.920 
and the teeth the chain and the teeth I
don't<00:04:13.400> believe<00:04:13.730> no<00:04:13.880> dirt<00:04:14.120> will<00:04:14.270> ever<00:04:14.420> baked<00:04:14.660> I

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
don't believe no dirt will ever baked I

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.509 
don't believe no dirt will ever baked I
can't<00:04:15.320> cut<00:04:15.470> in<00:04:15.620> there<00:04:15.740> and<00:04:15.830> cause<00:04:15.950> no<00:04:15.980> problems

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
can't cut in there and cause no problems

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.729 
can't cut in there and cause no problems
because<00:04:17.510> as<00:04:17.720> you<00:04:17.840> know<00:04:17.959> I<00:04:17.989> did<00:04:18.290> not<00:04:18.470> drill

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
because as you know I did not drill

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.380 
because as you know I did not drill
holes<00:04:19.010> in<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.340> top<00:04:19.519> of<00:04:19.549> the<00:04:19.730> tracks<00:04:19.970> I<00:04:20.150> didn't

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
holes in the top of the tracks I didn't

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.680 
holes in the top of the tracks I didn't
have<00:04:20.540> an<00:04:20.600> opening<00:04:21.820> all<00:04:22.820> over<00:04:22.850> dozer<00:04:23.240> I've<00:04:23.480> got

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
have an opening all over dozer I've got

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.330 
have an opening all over dozer I've got
it<00:04:23.870> doesn't<00:04:24.230> have<00:04:24.350> an<00:04:24.470> opening<00:04:24.830> so<00:04:25.010> I<00:04:25.040> thought

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
it doesn't have an opening so I thought

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.980 
it doesn't have an opening so I thought
maybe<00:04:25.550> I'd<00:04:25.790> get<00:04:25.910> by<00:04:26.090> with<00:04:26.300> it<00:04:27.280> so<00:04:28.750> brakes<00:04:29.750> now

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
maybe I'd get by with it so brakes now

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.560 
maybe I'd get by with it so brakes now
are<00:04:30.200> going<00:04:30.410> to<00:04:30.470> be<00:04:30.880> complete<00:04:31.880> heavy<00:04:32.120> duty<00:04:32.450> if

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
are going to be complete heavy duty if

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.240 
are going to be complete heavy duty if
there<00:04:32.750> is<00:04:32.930> a<00:04:32.960> weak<00:04:33.260> point<00:04:33.470> on<00:04:33.740> these<00:04:33.920> brakes

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
there is a weak point on these brakes

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.850 
there is a weak point on these brakes
and<00:04:34.520> I<00:04:34.790> don't<00:04:34.850> think<00:04:35.210> it<00:04:35.330> is<00:04:35.480> but<00:04:35.780> it<00:04:36.590> would<00:04:36.740> be

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
and I don't think it is but it would be

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.310 
and I don't think it is but it would be
that<00:04:37.040> mini<00:04:37.310> bike<00:04:37.520> spindle<00:04:38.120> that<00:04:38.390> I<00:04:38.540> used<00:04:38.870> to

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
that mini bike spindle that I used to

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.090 
that mini bike spindle that I used to
Berens<00:04:39.770> spent<00:04:40.100> assembly<00:04:40.640> to<00:04:41.420> spend<00:04:41.720> the<00:04:41.870> rotor

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
Berens spent assembly to spend the rotor

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.470 
Berens spent assembly to spend the rotor
now<00:04:43.100> I<00:04:43.130> got<00:04:43.370> to<00:04:43.460> thinking<00:04:43.700> about<00:04:43.760> it<00:04:44.060> if<00:04:44.180> them

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
now I got to thinking about it if them

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.850 
now I got to thinking about it if them
two<00:04:44.630> little<00:04:44.900> bitty<00:04:45.020> bearings<00:04:45.380> will<00:04:45.530> go<00:04:45.650> on<00:04:45.770> a

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
two little bitty bearings will go on a

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.590 
two little bitty bearings will go on a
go-kart<00:04:46.280> or<00:04:46.400> a<00:04:46.460> mini<00:04:46.640> bike<00:04:46.850> and<00:04:47.090> hold<00:04:47.270> up<00:04:47.480> an

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
go-kart or a mini bike and hold up an

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.040 
go-kart or a mini bike and hold up an
adult<00:04:48.520> sitting<00:04:49.520> full<00:04:49.760> weight<00:04:50.450> right<00:04:50.780> on<00:04:50.930> the

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
adult sitting full weight right on the

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.110 
adult sitting full weight right on the
back<00:04:51.200> wheel<00:04:51.470> of<00:04:51.590> a<00:04:51.650> mini<00:04:51.860> bikes<00:04:52.070> surely<00:04:52.760> then

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
back wheel of a mini bikes surely then

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.310 
back wheel of a mini bikes surely then
that<00:04:53.360> will<00:04:53.510> hold<00:04:53.660> that<00:04:53.780> because<00:04:54.050> there's

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
that will hold that because there's

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.480 
that will hold that because there's
there's<00:04:54.620> not<00:04:54.800> going<00:04:54.950> to<00:04:55.040> be<00:04:55.100> no<00:04:55.250> weight

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
there's not going to be no weight

there's not going to be no weight
