00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
going to compare the insides of these

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.200 
going to compare the insides of these
packaging<00:00:36.930> right<00:00:37.680> now<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.190> see<00:00:38.940> if<00:00:39.000> we<00:00:39.090> can

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
packaging right now and see if we can

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.270 
packaging right now and see if we can
find<00:00:39.360> any<00:00:39.570> discrepancies<00:00:40.290> because<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:41.190> be

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
right away you can see that this little

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.139 
right away you can see that this little
tab<00:00:50.550> here<00:00:50.600> that<00:00:51.600> pulls<00:00:51.960> up<00:00:52.940> yeah<00:00:53.940> it's

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
tab here that pulls up yeah it's

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.139 
tab here that pulls up yeah it's
supposed<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.629> help<00:00:54.899> pull<00:00:55.379> up<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.920> box<00:00:56.910> and

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
supposed to help pull up the box and

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.430 
supposed to help pull up the box and
there's<00:00:57.329> nothing<00:00:57.690> like<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.230> one<00:00:58.379> it

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
there's nothing like that on this one it

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.099 
there's nothing like that on this one it
was<00:00:58.559> really<00:00:58.770> difficult<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.359> get<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.510> up<00:01:00.750> so

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
was really difficult to get that up so

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.170 
was really difficult to get that up so
that<00:01:01.440> came<00:01:02.039> without<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.640> tab<00:01:02.820> kind<00:01:03.120> of

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
that came without that the tab kind of

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.780 
that came without that the tab kind of
just<00:01:03.300> peeled<00:01:03.510> off<00:01:03.660> it's<00:01:03.899> kind<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.080> pointless

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
just peeled off it's kind of pointless

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.429 
just peeled off it's kind of pointless
so<00:01:05.790> that's<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.060> first<00:01:06.270> thing<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.510> noticed<00:01:08.119> so

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
so that's the first thing I noticed so

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.480 
so that's the first thing I noticed so
I'll<00:01:10.439> try<00:01:10.590> say<00:01:10.740> on<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.950> side<00:01:11.070> get<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> little

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
I'll try say on the side get a little

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.010 
I'll try say on the side get a little
better<00:01:11.580> lighting<00:01:11.880> for<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.240> but<00:01:12.810> anyway

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
better lighting for you but anyway

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.050 
better lighting for you but anyway
here's<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.979> tab<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.580> was<00:01:14.670> talking<00:01:14.820> about

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
here's that tab that I was talking about

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.880 
here's that tab that I was talking about
this<00:01:15.210> one<00:01:15.360> looks<00:01:15.509> like<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.720> has<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> tab<00:01:16.170> but

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
this one looks like it has a tab but

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.410 
this one looks like it has a tab but
it's<00:01:17.009> just<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.250> little<00:01:17.520> white<00:01:17.790> lining<00:01:18.060> there's

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
it's just a little white lining there's

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.200 
it's just a little white lining there's
no<00:01:18.540> tab<00:01:18.750> there<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.770> actually<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.880> forgot

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
no tab there so I actually I forgot

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.240 
no tab there so I actually I forgot
first<00:01:22.080> let's<00:01:22.229> compare<00:01:22.350> these<00:01:22.619> boxes<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.159> this

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
first let's compare these boxes and this

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.990 
first let's compare these boxes and this
was<00:01:23.430> why<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.700> was<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:25.310> difficult<00:01:26.310> for<00:01:26.610> me<00:01:26.759> is

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
was why it was so difficult for me is

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.749 
was why it was so difficult for me is
these<00:01:27.330> boxes<00:01:27.840> are<00:01:27.960> spot-on<00:01:28.380> they<00:01:29.369> have<00:01:29.579> been

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
these boxes are spot-on they have been

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.910 
these boxes are spot-on they have been
doing<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.270> really<00:01:30.869> good<00:01:31.200> job<00:01:31.259> over<00:01:31.740> there

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.590 

taking<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:34.950> original<00:01:35.280> design<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.150> applying

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
taking the original design and applying

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.510 
taking the original design and applying
it<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.380> left<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.950> can<00:01:37.979> see<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.340> just

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
it so on the left you can see it's just

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.289 
it so on the left you can see it's just
a<00:01:38.579> tiny<00:01:39.000> bit<00:01:39.360> darker<00:01:40.350> but<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.650> mean<00:01:41.000> just<00:01:42.000> barely

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
a tiny bit darker but I mean just barely

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.270 
a tiny bit darker but I mean just barely
like<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.049> contrast<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.649> little<00:01:44.070> lighter

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
like this contrast is a little lighter

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.910 
like this contrast is a little lighter
than<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:44.790> but<00:01:45.060> just<00:01:45.450> barely<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.899> mean<00:01:46.140> all<00:01:46.380> the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
than this but just barely I mean all the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.859 
than this but just barely I mean all the
words<00:01:47.130> line<00:01:47.460> up<00:01:47.700> everything<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.689> right

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
words line up everything is in the right

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.600 
words line up everything is in the right
place<00:01:49.790> so<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:51.450> can<00:01:51.540> see<00:01:51.600> there<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.610> mean

place so you can see there I mean
everything<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.210> almost<00:01:54.689> spot-on<00:01:54.990> there's<00:01:55.920> a

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
everything is almost spot-on there's a

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.330 
everything is almost spot-on there's a
serial<00:01:56.520> numbers<00:01:56.790> for<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:58.040> another<00:01:59.040> thing

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
serial numbers for you and another thing

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.539 
serial numbers for you and another thing
on<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.700> serial<00:02:00.000> number<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.390> fake<00:02:00.570> ones<00:02:00.840> um

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
on the serial number of the fake ones um

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.069 
on the serial number of the fake ones um
this<00:02:02.549> was<00:02:03.000> just<00:02:03.240> like<00:02:03.329> I'll<00:02:03.450> beat<00:02:03.689> up<00:02:03.840> on<00:02:03.990> the

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
this was just like I'll beat up on the

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.840 
this was just like I'll beat up on the
bottom<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.500> wasn't<00:02:04.740> properly<00:02:05.250> attached<00:02:05.640> like

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
bottom it wasn't properly attached like

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.059 
bottom it wasn't properly attached like
this<00:02:06.030> one<00:02:06.240> it's<00:02:06.750> one<00:02:06.840> securely<00:02:07.350> fastened<00:02:07.950> it's

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
this one it's one securely fastened it's

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:08.869 
this one it's one securely fastened it's
not<00:02:08.220> going<00:02:08.520> anywhere

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
not going anywhere

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.229 
not going anywhere
so<00:02:09.539> there's<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:11.099> let's<00:02:11.280> go<00:02:11.459> ahead<00:02:11.730> and

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
so there's that so let's go ahead and

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.870 
so there's that so let's go ahead and
compare<00:02:12.690> these<00:02:12.900> so<00:02:13.020> let's<00:02:13.170> open<00:02:13.319> them<00:02:13.500> up

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
compare these so let's open them up

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.510 
compare these so let's open them up
so<00:02:14.870> obviously<00:02:15.650> some<00:02:15.830> little<00:02:16.070> things<00:02:16.220> going<00:02:16.400> to

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
so obviously some little things going to

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.100 
so obviously some little things going to
be<00:02:16.580> different<00:02:16.970> because<00:02:17.060> this<00:02:17.720> one<00:02:17.930> was

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
be different because this one was

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.990 
be different because this one was
already<00:02:18.260> open<00:02:18.620> so<00:02:18.650> I<00:02:18.890> didn't<00:02:19.220> correctly

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
already open so I didn't correctly

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.750 
already open so I didn't correctly
package<00:02:20.330> that<00:02:20.570> so<00:02:21.350> let's<00:02:21.680> pop<00:02:22.100> this<00:02:22.370> up<00:02:23.440> so

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
package that so let's pop this up so

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.480 
package that so let's pop this up so
it's<00:02:25.760> kind<00:02:25.820> of<00:02:25.970> tangled<00:02:26.360> in<00:02:26.450> there<00:02:27.430> alright<00:02:28.430> so

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
it's kind of tangled in there alright so

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.190 
it's kind of tangled in there alright so
that<00:02:28.850> stops<00:02:29.240> right<00:02:29.450> there<00:02:29.510> I'm<00:02:29.780> not<00:02:29.930> sure<00:02:30.080> if

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
that stops right there I'm not sure if

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.600 
that stops right there I'm not sure if
it's<00:02:30.320> supposed<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.650> do<00:02:30.800> that<00:02:30.920> or<00:02:31.070> not

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
it's supposed to do that or not

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.850 
it's supposed to do that or not
stops<00:02:32.510> right<00:02:32.690> there<00:02:32.840> from<00:02:33.050> opening<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:35.860> you

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
stops right there from opening and you

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.230 
stops right there from opening and you
can<00:02:36.950> pop<00:02:37.100> them<00:02:37.250> out<00:02:37.340> here<00:02:37.550> so<00:02:37.580> let's<00:02:37.880> see<00:02:38.060> if

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
can pop them out here so let's see if

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.170 
can pop them out here so let's see if
that<00:02:38.270> part<00:02:38.870> isn't<00:02:38.990> different

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.650

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
have tabs if you can see that so let's

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.570 
have tabs if you can see that so let's
pop<00:03:16.340> these<00:03:16.580> real<00:03:16.850> ones<00:03:17.060> out<00:03:17.330> of<00:03:17.480> here<00:03:18.580> alright

pop these real ones out of here alright

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.270 
pop these real ones out of here alright
and<00:03:19.640> there<00:03:20.300> you<00:03:20.330> got<00:03:20.510> two<00:03:20.660> so<00:03:21.140> this<00:03:21.860> comes<00:03:22.100> all

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
and there you got two so this comes all

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.720 
and there you got two so this comes all
the<00:03:22.400> way<00:03:22.490> open<00:03:22.730> this<00:03:22.910> one<00:03:23.060> stops<00:03:23.450> from<00:03:23.630> opening

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
the way open this one stops from opening

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.520 
the way open this one stops from opening
there<00:03:25.730> you<00:03:25.820> go<00:03:26.000> subscribe<00:03:26.690> see<00:03:26.870> there<00:03:27.080> so

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
there you go subscribe see there so

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.190 
there you go subscribe see there so
let's<00:03:27.680> set<00:03:27.890> this<00:03:28.040> behind<00:03:28.460> them<00:03:29.200> respective

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
let's set this behind them respective

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.250 
let's set this behind them respective
locations<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:31.460> again<00:03:32.450> I<00:03:32.480> think<00:03:32.780> I<00:03:32.990> messed<00:03:33.140> up

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
locations and again I think I messed up

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.900 
locations and again I think I messed up
the<00:03:33.410> order<00:03:33.440> here<00:03:33.860> of<00:03:33.980> how<00:03:34.100> this<00:03:34.310> was<00:03:34.490> packaged

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
the order here of how this was packaged

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.020 
the order here of how this was packaged
I<00:03:35.060> think<00:03:35.240> the<00:03:35.330> order<00:03:35.600> was<00:03:36.020> good<00:03:36.790> and<00:03:37.790> then<00:03:37.970> I

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
I think the order was good and then I

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.580 
I think the order was good and then I
open<00:03:38.360> the<00:03:38.480> earbuds<00:03:38.900> obviously<00:03:39.590> so<00:03:40.390> okay<00:03:41.390> but

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
open the earbuds obviously so okay but

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.120 
open the earbuds obviously so okay but
this<00:03:42.590> is<00:03:42.710> not<00:03:42.860> my<00:03:43.040> mistake<00:03:43.160> so<00:03:43.580> this<00:03:45.130> package

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
this is not my mistake so this package

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.370 
this is not my mistake so this package
here<00:03:46.370> only<00:03:46.610> included<00:03:47.420> the<00:03:50.290> there's<00:03:51.290> a<00:03:51.320> little

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
here only included the there's a little

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.690 
here only included the there's a little
piece<00:03:51.620> of<00:03:51.650> double-sided<00:03:52.040> tape<00:03:52.370> that<00:03:52.610> is

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
piece of double-sided tape that is

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.300 
piece of double-sided tape that is
obviously<00:03:53.150> fake<00:03:53.420> I<00:03:53.690> think<00:03:54.170> this<00:03:54.620> was<00:03:54.830> in<00:03:55.010> there

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
obviously fake I think this was in there

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.080 
obviously fake I think this was in there
like<00:03:55.520> that

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
like that

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.760 
like that
so<00:03:56.420> just<00:03:56.720> attach<00:03:56.960> a<00:03:57.110> little<00:03:57.350> double-sided

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
so just attach a little double-sided

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:03.340 
so just attach a little double-sided
tape<00:03:58.580> and<00:03:58.940> it<00:03:59.870> removed<00:04:00.230> so<00:04:00.850> I<00:04:02.080> get<00:04:03.080> that<00:04:03.170> out<00:04:03.230> of

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
tape and it removed so I get that out of

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.860 
tape and it removed so I get that out of
there<00:04:03.940> so<00:04:04.940> here's<00:04:05.150> the<00:04:05.270> cord<00:04:07.270> pop<00:04:08.270> those<00:04:08.480> aside

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870

earbuds look pretty legit now we're
going<00:04:13.460> to<00:04:13.520> see<00:04:13.670> a<00:04:13.700> discrepancy<00:04:14.180> there<00:04:14.930> dropped

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
going to see a discrepancy there dropped

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.750 
going to see a discrepancy there dropped
on<00:04:15.590> the<00:04:15.710> floor<00:04:16.989> right<00:04:17.989> so<00:04:18.530> here's<00:04:18.950> those

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
on the floor right so here's those

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.680 
on the floor right so here's those
earbuds<00:04:21.280> set<00:04:22.280> those<00:04:22.460> here<00:04:22.850> right<00:04:23.360> now<00:04:23.540> let's

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
earbuds set those here right now let's

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.930 
earbuds set those here right now let's
keep<00:04:23.810> going<00:04:24.080> with<00:04:24.200> the<00:04:24.290> real<00:04:24.470> one<00:04:24.770> so<00:04:25.040> the<00:04:25.669> case

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
keep going with the real one so the case

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.020 
keep going with the real one so the case
the<00:04:26.240> case<00:04:26.419> shouldn't<00:04:26.600> have<00:04:26.780> any

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
the case shouldn't have any

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.700 
the case shouldn't have any
in<00:04:27.090> it<00:04:27.360> obviously<00:04:28.790> that's<00:04:29.790> the<00:04:29.940> same<00:04:30.650> see<00:04:31.650> if

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
in it obviously that's the same see if

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.970 
in it obviously that's the same see if
there's<00:04:31.860> a<00:04:31.920> difference<00:04:32.220> between<00:04:32.310> these<00:04:32.640> cases

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.500 

so<00:04:37.980> both<00:04:38.190> of<00:04:38.220> them<00:04:38.490> came<00:04:38.730> locked<00:04:39.180> in<00:04:39.450> that

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
so both of them came locked in that

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:49.850 
so both of them came locked in that
position<00:04:39.810> there<00:04:40.290> to<00:04:40.620> start<00:04:48.080> can't<00:04:49.080> tell<00:04:49.530> a

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
position there to start can't tell a

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.740 
position there to start can't tell a
difference<00:04:50.580> in<00:04:50.760> the<00:04:50.850> cases<00:04:53.120> the<00:04:54.120> real<00:04:54.360> one<00:04:54.600> on

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
difference in the cases the real one on

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:55.610 
difference in the cases the real one on
the<00:04:54.870> right

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
the right

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.010 
the right
no<00:04:56.810> okay<00:04:57.840> yeah<00:04:58.110> there<00:04:58.440> there's<00:04:58.890> a<00:04:58.950> little<00:04:59.190> tiny

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
no okay yeah there there's a little tiny

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.390 
no okay yeah there there's a little tiny
so<00:05:01.020> the<00:05:01.140> real<00:05:01.290> one<00:05:01.440> on<00:05:01.500> the<00:05:01.620> right<00:05:01.860> when<00:05:02.190> it's

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
so the real one on the right when it's

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.690 
so the real one on the right when it's
closed<00:05:02.880> you<00:05:02.910> can<00:05:03.270> see<00:05:03.510> how<00:05:03.660> the<00:05:03.720> zipper<00:05:04.700> is

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
closed you can see how the zipper is

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.600 
closed you can see how the zipper is
still<00:05:06.030> visible<00:05:06.330> whereas<00:05:07.140> on<00:05:07.410> the<00:05:07.530> left<00:05:07.800> the

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
still visible whereas on the left the

zipper<00:05:09.030> goes<00:05:09.720> away<00:05:10.020> so<00:05:10.440> that's<00:05:11.070> fake<00:05:11.850> on<00:05:12.000> the

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
zipper goes away so that's fake on the

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.720 
zipper goes away so that's fake on the
left<00:05:12.300> still<00:05:12.600> like<00:05:12.990> I<00:05:13.110> said<00:05:13.380> real<00:05:14.250> on<00:05:14.400> the<00:05:14.490> right
