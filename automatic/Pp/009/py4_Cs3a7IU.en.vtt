born the Volkswagen Golf now 38 years on
the<00:00:23.380> mark<00:00:23.590> 7<00:00:23.860> Volkswagen<00:00:24.640> Golf<00:00:24.880> is<00:00:25.150> here<00:00:25.419> and

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:25.689 
the mark 7 Volkswagen Golf is here and

the mark 7 Volkswagen Golf is here and
this<00:00:26.110> is<00:00:26.349> it<00:00:26.800> and<00:00:27.039> let's<00:00:27.189> just<00:00:27.369> talk<00:00:28.000> about<00:00:28.029> the

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
this is it and let's just talk about the

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.779 
this is it and let's just talk about the
numbers<00:00:28.779> shall<00:00:29.050> we<00:00:29.199> so<00:00:29.650> in<00:00:29.770> those<00:00:29.919> 38<00:00:30.430> years

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
numbers shall we so in those 38 years

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.150 
numbers shall we so in those 38 years
twenty<00:00:31.420> nine<00:00:31.689> million<00:00:32.199> Volkswagen<00:00:32.949> goals

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
twenty nine million Volkswagen goals

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.790 
twenty nine million Volkswagen goals
have<00:00:33.370> found<00:00:33.640> homes<00:00:33.879> and<00:00:34.210> in<00:00:34.540> the<00:00:34.660> UK<00:00:35.019> 1.6

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
have found homes and in the UK 1.6

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.229 
have found homes and in the UK 1.6
million<00:00:36.040> so<00:00:36.220> it's<00:00:36.370> a<00:00:36.400> pretty<00:00:36.670> important

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
million so it's a pretty important

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.600 
million so it's a pretty important
market<00:00:37.690> for<00:00:37.720> Volkswagen<00:00:38.470> in<00:00:38.710> terms<00:00:39.070> of<00:00:39.280> size

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
market for Volkswagen in terms of size

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.740 
market for Volkswagen in terms of size
this<00:00:40.600> car<00:00:40.930> is<00:00:41.260> 56<00:00:42.190> millimeters<00:00:42.670> longer<00:00:43.600> than

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
this car is 56 millimeters longer than

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.350 
this car is 56 millimeters longer than
the<00:00:43.870> old<00:00:43.900> one<00:00:44.230> about<00:00:45.070> that<00:00:45.339> I<00:00:45.370> think<00:00:45.579> the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
the old one about that I think the

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.660 
the old one about that I think the
wheelbase<00:00:46.660> is<00:00:46.720> 59<00:00:47.650> millimeters<00:00:48.309> longer

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
wheelbase is 59 millimeters longer

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.840 
wheelbase is 59 millimeters longer
probably<00:00:49.330> about<00:00:49.510> that<00:00:49.780> it's<00:00:50.710> 13<00:00:51.280> millimeters

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
probably about that it's 13 millimeters

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.350 
probably about that it's 13 millimeters
wider<00:00:52.239> we<00:00:52.570> spent<00:00:52.960> that<00:00:53.229> and<00:00:53.650> 28<00:00:54.610> millimeters

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
wider we spent that and 28 millimeters

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.799 
wider we spent that and 28 millimeters
lower<00:00:55.600> so<00:00:55.989> it's<00:00:56.799> pretty<00:00:57.010> much<00:00:57.159> golf<00:00:57.820> sized<00:00:58.150> the

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
lower so it's pretty much golf sized the

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:01.770 
lower so it's pretty much golf sized the
boot<00:00:59.019> is<00:00:59.229> 30<00:00:59.890> litres<00:01:00.879> larger<00:01:01.360> than<00:01:01.540> the<00:01:01.629> old

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
boot is 30 litres larger than the old

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.350 
boot is 30 litres larger than the old
car<00:01:02.019> but<00:01:02.559> crucially<00:01:03.040> the<00:01:03.489> weight<00:01:03.790> is<00:01:04.059> a

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
car but crucially the weight is a

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.750 
car but crucially the weight is a
hundred<00:01:04.989> kilos<00:01:05.530> left<00:01:05.950> and<00:01:06.189> that's<00:01:06.310> part<00:01:06.670> of

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
hundred kilos left and that's part of

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.340 
hundred kilos left and that's part of
the<00:01:06.880> advanced<00:01:07.210> chassis<00:01:07.570> technology<00:01:08.229> which

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
the advanced chassis technology which

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.740 
the advanced chassis technology which
I'll<00:01:08.470> tell<00:01:08.710> you<00:01:08.770> about<00:01:08.890> in<00:01:09.310> a<00:01:09.460> little<00:01:09.610> bit<00:01:09.820> the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
I'll tell you about in a little bit the

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.510 
I'll tell you about in a little bit the
most<00:01:11.049> important<00:01:11.710> figure<00:01:12.010> of<00:01:12.100> the<00:01:12.189> lot<00:01:12.340> though

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
most important figure of the lot though

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.060 
most important figure of the lot though
is<00:01:12.760> the<00:01:13.750> price<00:01:14.080> and<00:01:14.409> that's<00:01:14.560> pretty<00:01:14.830> unusual

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
is the price and that's pretty unusual

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.820 
is the price and that's pretty unusual
these<00:01:15.580> days<00:01:15.820> because<00:01:16.090> this<00:01:16.780> new<00:01:17.200> golf<00:01:17.590> at

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
these days because this new golf at

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.680 
these days because this new golf at
least<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.220> entry-level<00:01:18.610> model<00:01:18.729> is<00:01:19.240> no<00:01:19.480> more

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
least the entry-level model is no more

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.240 
least the entry-level model is no more
expensive<00:01:20.170> than<00:01:20.290> the<00:01:20.380> one<00:01:20.500> it<00:01:20.590> replaces<00:01:20.890> and

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
expensive than the one it replaces and

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.130 
expensive than the one it replaces and
model<00:01:21.820> for<00:01:21.970> model<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.300> engines<00:01:22.660> have<00:01:22.780> changed

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
model for model the engines have changed

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.870 
model for model the engines have changed
the<00:01:23.230> specs<00:01:23.500> have<00:01:23.710> changed<00:01:24.160> and<00:01:24.520> equipment

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
the specs have changed and equipment

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.880 
the specs have changed and equipment
levels<00:01:25.120> tend<00:01:25.420> to<00:01:25.540> have<00:01:25.630> gone<00:01:25.900> up<00:01:26.050> this<00:01:26.380> car<00:01:26.650> is

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
levels tend to have gone up this car is

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.650 
levels tend to have gone up this car is
good<00:01:27.280> value<00:01:27.460> compared<00:01:28.150> to<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.360> old<00:01:28.480> one

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
good value compared to the old one

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.710 
good value compared to the old one
that's<00:01:29.140> pretty<00:01:29.590> rare<00:01:29.800> these<00:01:29.860> days<00:01:30.340> it's<00:01:31.090> let's

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
that's pretty rare these days it's let's

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.290 
that's pretty rare these days it's let's
just<00:01:31.870> take<00:01:32.140> a<00:01:32.170> quick<00:01:32.740> look<00:01:33.100> I<00:01:33.400> pull<00:01:33.790> over<00:01:33.940> and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
just take a quick look I pull over and

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:43.240 
just take a quick look I pull over and
see<00:01:35.020> if<00:01:35.110> it<00:01:35.260> still<00:01:35.710> looks<00:01:35.860> like<00:01:35.920> a<00:01:36.040> golf

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:02:02.870 

so<00:01:44.250> let's<00:01:44.430> take<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> look<00:01:44.850> around<00:01:45.210> shall<00:01:45.390> we<00:02:01.880> yep

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
so let's take a look around shall we yep

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:14.240 
so let's take a look around shall we yep
it's<00:02:03.240> definitely<00:02:03.900> a<00:02:03.930> golf<00:02:12.170> okay<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:14.070> it's<00:02:14.220> a

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
it's definitely a golf okay so it's a

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.160 
it's definitely a golf okay so it's a
little<00:02:14.400> bit<00:02:14.580> conservative<00:02:15.150> out<00:02:15.630> there<00:02:15.900> but

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
little bit conservative out there but

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.650 
little bit conservative out there but
maybe<00:02:16.980> that's<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.400> Boris<00:02:17.730> Johnson<00:02:18.270> in<00:02:18.360> me<00:02:18.480> but

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
maybe that's the Boris Johnson in me but

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.270 
maybe that's the Boris Johnson in me but

sitting<00:04:22.870> behind<00:04:23.380> me<00:04:23.800> although<00:04:23.980> clearly<00:04:24.400> I'll

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
sitting behind me although clearly I'll

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.790 
sitting behind me although clearly I'll
be<00:04:24.760> in<00:04:24.880> two<00:04:25.060> places<00:04:25.240> at<00:04:25.540> once<00:04:25.840> there's<00:04:26.380> plenty

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
be in two places at once there's plenty

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.440 
be in two places at once there's plenty
of<00:04:26.860> knee<00:04:27.160> room<00:04:27.190> slightly<00:04:27.790> more<00:04:27.970> than<00:04:28.000> before

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
of knee room slightly more than before

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.080 
of knee room slightly more than before
decent<00:04:29.320> amount<00:04:29.560> of<00:04:29.710> shoulder<00:04:30.400> room<00:04:30.610> here<00:04:30.970> I

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
decent amount of shoulder room here I

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.460 
decent amount of shoulder room here I
have<00:04:31.210> reckoned<00:04:31.600> three<00:04:31.840> across<00:04:32.080> the<00:04:32.290> back

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
have reckoned three across the back

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.810 
have reckoned three across the back
shouldn't<00:04:32.770> be<00:04:32.830> too<00:04:32.980> much<00:04:33.100> of<00:04:33.310> a<00:04:33.370> problem<00:04:33.580> and

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
shouldn't be too much of a problem and

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.340 
shouldn't be too much of a problem and
that's<00:04:34.450> for<00:04:34.600> head<00:04:34.720> room<00:04:34.900> I<00:04:34.990> could<00:04:35.170> probably

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
that's for head room I could probably
