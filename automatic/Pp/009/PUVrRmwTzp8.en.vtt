 in Toulon and Toulouse looking for 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.730
 of a first success outside and 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.859
 yet his palms shocked at who puts the 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.290
 gas and david roumieu 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.639
 the starter hooker bayonnais look 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.769
 this first attack 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.849
 after ten minutes sportingly and the 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.800
 Bayonne intentions are the 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.390
 workers and canals kossoko cider 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.430
 if spinning channels 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.590
 but as very often during 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.800
 this first half the actions of 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.720
 the kind aborted for lack of mistakes 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.840
 techniques for lack of support in 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.270
 the occurrence on steam and so that was 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.920
 long a front fight with a 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.859
 conquest that turns 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.329
 rather conquering just side side 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:41.760
 Parisian domineering in any case to 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.120
 the image of this melee and lakes this right 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.519
 gagging especially tialata manhandled by 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.129
 the first line of the roots man us 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.140
 are the 19th minute jonathan sexton 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.969
 open the score after this photo getty 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.489
 alata and there are 3 to 0 for racing 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.109
 then three everywhere here we have a little 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.010
 little anticipated on our health but because 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.530
 that it's true that there was a lot 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.210
 of intentions in this match that started 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.429
 dry and you will understand it in 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.770
 few seconds which then passed 

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:12.390
 in single mode that's a lot of game 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.210
 of forwards and mistakes marks like here 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.159
 where van der merwe and sanction side 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.190
 racing who was playing tonight with his 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.270
 navy blue shirt 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.780
 bustos moyano who equalizes a 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.280
 curved trajectory 3 everywhere we see 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.539
 there we applaud Stephen Brett who was 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.030
 stayed on the bench at the rookie 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.350
 New Zealand and the race leads with 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.240
 maxime machenaud one of the three 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.870
 selected by philippe 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.580
 saint-andrÃ© in the 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.740
 for the September internship that leaves in 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:44.010
 the closed chavancy the relay the ruffles 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:46.270
 that stands out that would have it and who 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.070
 relayed there are nine faults 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.600
 ladji well prove that I said of 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.030
 julien puricelli who flips who will 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.310
 fall who will all come to kill the the 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.800
 good balloon not a choice that is a small 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.180
 little annoyed also some Parisians that 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.160
 I felt that I would be able to shoot at 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.950
 goal is cautioned with a yellow card 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.790
 I see some sexton who has who 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.920
 resumes the score 37th minute so 6 3 of 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.840
 the nervousness also for sexton we saw 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.280
 an infallible scorer but also 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.960
 character because there is a fault of 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.130
 her forwards she had seen another that 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.650
 the referees gentleman did not sanction 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.820
 and bustos moyano him up to the siren 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.070
 well he lets his team 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.230
 to equalize 6 per turn and hard and under the 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.030
 rain the rain of the Basque country this is a 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.280
 penalty then of shares and rock 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.510
 this to make an egg everywhere we go 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.430
 find a little bit later at the 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.480
 51st minute when this balloon carried and 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.820
 yes because of offensive intentions 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.590
 have been reduced to play upwind and 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.709
 well there is 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.690
 this departure from david roumieu will have who 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.769
 was extracted all in effect the relay of 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.739
 nizy fao are the Tongan come from agen the 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:54.090
 relay then philippe for tialata 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:55.440
 percussion then from romieu there he 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.690
 try to lift this balloon there is the 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.400
 relay also fire must look good 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.040
 follow number 5 first it's 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.989
 fenoyl who leaves on the side that is 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.900
 repressed by the defense of racing the 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.730
 balloon that will come back into the hands of 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.590
 number 5 we saw him spring number 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.130
 five times at the top this cardona asks 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.470
 the video 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.599
 and you think it's logical tone luis a 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.140
 essay granted passau rosso that surprised 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.750
 everybody 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.640
 our cameras and especially the defense 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.829
 Parisian also by coming into the heart 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.019
 of the grouping get out and we see it 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.120
 on the image come slump in the in 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.410
 Parisian goal it is thought that rowing has 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.299
 does the hardest thing at this point in the match 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.560
 since they have they took a break from 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.250
 take a break of 2.7 points 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.510
 alas 16.9 on their packaging just 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.459
 after in the wake while we say 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.920
 often it must be of course 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.540
 ensure the fundamentals on on 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.139
 referrals well a fault that leads to a 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.090
 sexton penalty that allowed his 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:50.100
 team to return to four points 16 to 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.010
 12 we come to sexton play time 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.600
 alcoa chambert luminous standing who 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.630
 allows 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.190
 at a Parisian center including fabrice 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.650
 estebanez is conquering the balloon 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.810
 retrieve it 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.420
 rush of andreu marc who escape who 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.950
 will create the breach of the liberations of 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.170
 fast ball to that has not always been 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.180
 the case in this acroban stalemate 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.769
 gerondeau for van der merwe we have it 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.030
 sure ellipses and this move you go 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.230
 understand why we are on the edge of 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.079
 touch to rain redoubled 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.430
 this action lasted 2 minutes 35 and the 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.459
 last five seconds you see them 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.229
 here with this shelling in good standing at 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.630
 before racing there was coaching the 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:27.820
 view matadi go there is also mastery 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.169
 in this exercise of shelling tests 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.690
 gerondeau and his number 8 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:35.229
 the young third racing line that 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:37.750
 in two flattened time and sir cardona 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:39.130
 wants to check the video the cameras from 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.380
 samy chastis are always well placed 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.350
 mark and look and well there are and 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:48.030
 this is also no doubt not in the 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.030
 same movement will say well helped
