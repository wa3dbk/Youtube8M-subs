00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:08.330
 bio cook today we focus biscuits 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.330
 why christmas is coming 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.130
 for our court excel we need one 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.790
 Church likes to grind it to flour 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.010
 then still have to couple with it 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:30.199
 cranberries vanilla almond moussa 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.660
 thick juice and a few other nuts too 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:39.910
 First we paint ours 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:42.800
 cashew kernels pact blender pure 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.180
 But you can also join in 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.800
 For example, almonds must be all with 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.579
 ground almonds would you be more blind 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.200
 something did not have that just takes 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:01:03.710
 ground almonds or ground 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:01:05.690
 Hazelnuts are just as good as we have 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.130
 our use or have 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:20.630
 cashew kernels are not 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:27.980
 nuts cranberries add vanilla cinnamon 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:44.600
 good fit paranuts 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:48.580
 the dashing little ones can be completely 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.580
 simply with the something powerful of knife 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.580
 to cut 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:12.620
 it will from tomorrow, the family also 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:16.880
 That's what comes out of the apple white 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.040
 Almonds certainly do not have that 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.700
 cheapest diesel must - but this 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.880
 delicious and very healthy 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.620
 yielded about as much as two tablespoons that 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:39.530
 take exact recipe then again 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:41.060
 he describes something too soft 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:50.090
 I have no normal practical 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:54.130
 ground as already said a beautiful 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.130
 Of course, almonds are an alternative 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.819
 lewis reports here as at 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.819
 block 3 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:17.390
 there is a bit like when you are 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:20.660
 now times so take to roll out the 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:29.740
 not sticking to the board is easy 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:29.740
 the yield from again 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:52.580
 the strength must know how to do that 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:52.580
 just together here 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.180
 you can cut them out 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.519
 it is best if you cut them 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.200
 by the dried fruit in it is the 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.200
 filming a bit difficult 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:26.340
 could be a bit of a buzz on it 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.120
 now dry again if you 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.520
 the tighter may be a matter of taste 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:37.070
 there is the 42 degrees in the oven 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.070
 or dry with clean 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:51.890
 a nice alternative 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:57.110
 for the euro cost to me at all 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:59.060
