I'm<00:00:41.399> pretty<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.750> there<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.170> snapchat<00:00:43.530> very

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
I'm pretty so there is a snapchat very

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.740 
I'm pretty so there is a snapchat very
similar<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.820> previous<00:00:45.030> one<00:00:45.420> if<00:00:45.629> you've

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
similar to the previous one if you've

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.690 
similar to the previous one if you've
seen<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.170> but<00:00:46.410> I'm<00:00:46.500> much<00:00:46.739> more<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.280> depth

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700

but if you look around we can see some

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.620 
but if you look around we can see some
things<00:02:49.860> which<00:02:50.070> are<00:02:50.220> very<00:02:50.400> very<00:02:50.640> familiar<00:02:51.209> if

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
things which are very very familiar if

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.600 
things which are very very familiar if
we<00:02:51.780> look<00:02:51.930> up<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.350> ceiling<00:02:52.590> we<00:02:53.280> can<00:02:53.430> see

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
we look up to the ceiling we can see

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.580 
we look up to the ceiling we can see
these<00:02:53.760> weird<00:02:54.030> surgical<00:02:54.780> lights<00:02:55.050> that<00:02:55.440> look

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
these weird surgical lights that look

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.250 
these weird surgical lights that look
very<00:02:55.950> very<00:02:56.040> similar<00:02:56.519> to<00:02:57.180> what<00:02:57.360> we<00:02:57.510> see<00:02:57.720> in<00:02:57.900> this

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
very very similar to what we see in this

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.620 
very very similar to what we see in this
snapchat<00:02:58.620> story<00:02:59.160> then<00:02:59.700> we<00:02:59.819> see<00:02:59.970> another<00:03:00.090> shot

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
snapchat story then we see another shot

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.440 
snapchat story then we see another shot
of<00:03:00.810> what<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.500> appears<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.069> be<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.519> blood<00:03:02.940> bag<00:03:03.209> but

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
of what it appears to be a blood bag but

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.150 
of what it appears to be a blood bag but
it<00:03:03.510> could<00:03:03.720> potentially<00:03:03.780> be<00:03:04.260> some<00:03:04.530> sort<00:03:05.010> of

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
it could potentially be some sort of

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.610 
it could potentially be some sort of
weird<00:03:05.519> fluid<00:03:06.269> maybe<00:03:06.600> is<00:03:06.870> not<00:03:06.930> blood<00:03:07.319> at<00:03:07.440> all

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
weird fluid maybe is not blood at all

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.470 
weird fluid maybe is not blood at all
but<00:03:08.130> look<00:03:08.220> at<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.370> positioning<00:03:08.940> of<00:03:09.030> it<00:03:09.300> in

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
but look at the positioning of it in

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.420 
but look at the positioning of it in
this<00:03:09.660> snapchat<00:03:09.959> story<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:10.769> then<00:03:11.160> let's

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
this snapchat story and then let's

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.610 
this snapchat story and then let's
compare<00:03:11.850> it<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.180> its<00:03:12.360> position<00:03:12.870> in<00:03:12.989> black<00:03:13.380> ops

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
compare it to its position in black ops

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.580 
compare it to its position in black ops
1<00:03:13.790> you<00:03:14.790> see<00:03:15.090> there<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.690> obviously<00:03:15.900> a

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
1 you see there is obviously a

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.500 
1 you see there is obviously a
coincidence<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:17.519> it<00:03:17.610> can't<00:03:17.820> be<00:03:17.880> just<00:03:18.269> a

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
coincidence and it can't be just a

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.630 
coincidence and it can't be just a

in<00:03:45.299> the<00:03:45.900> snapchat<00:03:46.680> story<00:03:47.220> so<00:03:47.579> what<00:03:47.760> does<00:03:48.060> this

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
in the snapchat story so what does this

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.080 
in the snapchat story so what does this
mean<00:03:48.359> I'm<00:03:49.049> not<00:03:49.440> too<00:03:49.650> sure<00:03:49.980> but<00:03:50.280> it's<00:03:50.459> obviously

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
mean I'm not too sure but it's obviously

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.880 
mean I'm not too sure but it's obviously
that<00:03:51.329> this<00:03:51.480> isn't<00:03:51.750> just<00:03:51.810> a<00:03:52.109> coincidence<00:03:52.260> and

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
that this isn't just a coincidence and

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.520 
that this isn't just a coincidence and
there<00:03:53.160> is<00:03:53.280> something<00:03:53.930> linked<00:03:54.930> directly<00:03:55.140> to

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
there is something linked directly to

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.160 
there is something linked directly to
this<00:03:56.160> action<00:03:56.760> on<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.120> black<00:03:57.359> ops<00:03:57.570> main<00:03:57.780> menu

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
this action on the black ops main menu

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.440 
this action on the black ops main menu

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.800 
we even see a shot in the main menu
where<00:04:00.840> all<00:04:01.049> the<00:04:01.290> TV<00:04:01.620> screens<00:04:01.980> show<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:02.519> I

where all the TV screens show and I

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.060 
where all the TV screens show and I
exactly<00:04:03.810> like<00:04:03.989> it<00:04:04.140> does<00:04:04.260> in<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.680> snapchat

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070

stories so even from black ops 1 trial
were<00:04:07.590> thinking<00:04:07.829> about<00:04:07.890> hinting<00:04:08.489> this<00:04:08.910> massive

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
were thinking about hinting this massive

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.720 
were thinking about hinting this massive
story<00:04:09.630> to<00:04:09.840> us<00:04:09.959> in<00:04:09.989> some<00:04:10.350> way<00:04:10.400> and<00:04:11.400> this<00:04:11.549> is<00:04:11.700> just

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
story to us in some way and this is just

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.000 
story to us in some way and this is just
crazy<00:04:12.060> but<00:04:12.450> if<00:04:12.540> you<00:04:12.630> guys<00:04:12.780> have<00:04:12.930> any<00:04:12.989> ideas<00:04:13.500> let

crazy but if you guys have any ideas let

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.199 
crazy but if you guys have any ideas let

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
me know down below in the comment

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.190 
me know down below in the comment
section<00:04:15.480> it's<00:04:15.570> could<00:04:15.720> possibly<00:04:15.959> mean<00:04:16.169> that

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
section it's could possibly mean that

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.810 
section it's could possibly mean that
we're<00:04:16.709> going<00:04:16.799> to<00:04:16.859> be<00:04:16.979> getting<00:04:17.220> some<00:04:17.430> zombie

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
we're going to be getting some zombie

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.699 
we're going to be getting some zombie
teasers<00:04:18.239> in<00:04:18.390> the<00:04:18.600> future<00:04:19.019> through<00:04:19.410> snapchat

teasers in the future through snapchat

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.250 
teasers in the future through snapchat
or<00:04:20.070> it<00:04:20.820> could<00:04:21.090> just<00:04:21.120> be<00:04:21.269> a<00:04:21.390> very<00:04:21.720> very<00:04:21.959> mad

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
or it could just be a very very mad

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.930 
or it could just be a very very mad
coincidence<00:04:22.890> because<00:04:23.159> it<00:04:23.370> is<00:04:23.490> very<00:04:23.849> very

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
coincidence because it is very very

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.089 
coincidence because it is very very
early<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.539> even<00:04:24.930> tease<00:04:25.169> zombie<00:04:25.590> seeing<00:04:25.860> as<00:04:25.979> the
