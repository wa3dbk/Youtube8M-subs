spot<00:01:46.220> here<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.369> here<00:01:47.700> but<00:01:48.450> what<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.630> do<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:49.079> you

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
spot here in here but what you do is you

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.899 
spot here in here but what you do is you
take<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.590> brown<00:01:49.890> plug<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.430> see<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.759> one

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
take this brown plug and you see the one

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.109 
take this brown plug and you see the one
across<00:01:54.270> here<00:01:54.979> in<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.159> top<00:01:56.369> right<00:01:56.579> corner<00:01:56.610> or

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
across here in the top right corner or

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.889 
across here in the top right corner or
top<00:01:57.990> left<00:01:58.229> corner<00:01:58.619> go<00:01:59.189> in<00:01:59.460> one<00:01:59.790> from<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.299> you

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
top left corner go in one from that you

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.510 
top left corner go in one from that you
can't<00:02:01.170> screw<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.469> up<00:02:01.619> because<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:02.009> won't<00:02:02.189> go<00:02:02.369> in

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
can't screw it up because it won't go in

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.700 
can't screw it up because it won't go in
here<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.360> won't<00:02:03.540> go<00:02:03.750> in<00:02:03.780> there<00:02:04.049> there<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.530> have

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
here it won't go in there there you have

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.550 
here it won't go in there there you have
to<00:02:04.890> get<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.130> right<00:02:05.159> here<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.790> then<00:02:06.390> click<00:02:07.320> your

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
to get it right here and then click your

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.449 
to get it right here and then click your
in<00:02:08.060> then<00:02:09.060> wire<00:02:09.379> you'll<00:02:10.379> get<00:02:10.709> your<00:02:10.890> wires<00:02:11.099> so

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
in then wire you'll get your wires so

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.979 
in then wire you'll get your wires so
that<00:02:11.489> they<00:02:11.760> come<00:02:11.970> out<00:02:12.000> over<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.750> side<00:02:12.989> here

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
that they come out over the side here

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.160 
that they come out over the side here
something<00:02:14.860> was<00:02:14.980> hot<00:02:15.159> artists<00:02:15.670> anyway<00:02:16.840> come

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
something was hot artists anyway come

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.009 
something was hot artists anyway come
out<00:02:17.349> across<00:02:17.680> here<00:02:18.069> and<00:02:19.200> then<00:02:20.200> this<00:02:20.709> plugs<00:02:21.700> into

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
out across here and then this plugs into

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.009 
out across here and then this plugs into
the<00:02:23.019> back<00:02:23.260> of<00:02:23.530> this<00:02:24.519> you<00:02:25.480> just<00:02:25.569> plug<00:02:25.900> them

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
the back of this you just plug them

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.330 
the back of this you just plug them
together<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.439> mean<00:02:26.620> it's<00:02:26.799> like<00:02:26.920> plugging<00:02:27.189> the

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
together I mean it's like plugging the

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.920 
together I mean it's like plugging the
vacuum<00:02:27.670> cleaner<00:02:27.939> into<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.269> wall<00:02:28.450> it's<00:02:28.689> not<00:02:28.780> a

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
vacuum cleaner into the wall it's not a

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.309 
vacuum cleaner into the wall it's not a
big<00:02:29.110> deal<00:02:29.730> so<00:02:31.980> take<00:02:32.980> these<00:02:33.189> two<00:02:34.140> hook<00:02:35.140> them

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
big deal so take these two hook them

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.559 
big deal so take these two hook them
together<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.980> then<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.090> next<00:02:37.359> thing<00:02:37.510> you

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
together and then the next thing you

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.470 
together and then the next thing you
want<00:02:37.810> to<00:02:37.900> do<00:02:38.049> is<00:02:38.349> go<00:02:39.040> into<00:02:39.189> the<00:02:39.280> package<00:02:39.760> get

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
want to do is go into the package get

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.660 
want to do is go into the package get
your<00:02:40.629> bracket<00:02:42.150> I'm<00:02:43.150> going<00:02:43.329> to<00:02:43.420> hang<00:02:43.569> it<00:02:43.689> by

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
your bracket I'm going to hang it by

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.369 
your bracket I'm going to hang it by
secure<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.790> bracket<00:02:46.269> I<00:02:46.389> like<00:02:46.599> to<00:02:46.810> secure<00:02:47.260> it

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
secure the bracket I like to secure it

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.610 
secure the bracket I like to secure it
on<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.819> left-hand<00:02:48.819> side<00:02:48.940> down<00:02:49.389> here<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:50.170> the

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
on the left-hand side down here and the

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.460 
on the left-hand side down here and the
reason<00:02:50.799> why<00:02:51.190> I<00:02:51.220> do<00:02:51.459> that<00:02:51.670> is<00:02:52.150> that<00:02:53.049> you're<00:02:53.290> able

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
to access the little actuator button on

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.080 
to access the little actuator button on
this<00:02:56.139> if<00:02:56.319> you<00:02:56.440> want<00:02:56.680> to<00:02:56.799> make<00:02:56.950> it<00:02:57.099> break<00:02:57.459> you

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
this if you want to make it break you

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.539 
this if you want to make it break you
push<00:02:58.329> this<00:02:58.569> down<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.040> it'll<00:03:00.040> make<00:03:00.189> it<00:03:00.340> break
