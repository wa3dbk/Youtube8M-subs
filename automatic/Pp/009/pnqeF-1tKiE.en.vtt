00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:14.299
 Hello and welcome here 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.920
 on the farm in northern emsland 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:20.310
 Today we want them a bit 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.939
 bring closer the care of the duration of 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:29.449
 landes here we are on one 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:32.369
 Green was the end of February was here 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.440
 15 cubic liquid manure applied with 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.630
 ice skates and the grass is 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.460
 through the long winter pretty much in 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.620
 been affected 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:47.730
 we see here that warns that here a lot 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:50.300
 dead grass in it is the roots 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.850
 they are green but the situation 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.620
 is not yet in progress 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.910
 come 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.550
 Here we have the skate 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:06.740
 Spent slurry traces 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:09.479
 this missed this matted grass hub 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:16.850
 once this matted this one 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:21.150
 comes out and these reste you have to 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:25.250
 be mechanically processed and to 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:29.299
 let's put a huge haul 1 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:35.600
 here we have again drag the wiesn 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:41.970
 her front we have a plan created 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:44.100
 the tree growth heap levels around the 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:50.350
 Gets beautiful to be quiet 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:54.820
 we do not have it here 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:58.810
 Next, run this fall rows six 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:02.740
 pull and these ten are all back 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:06.570
 so we put that finger on 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.399
 effect that the grassland grass hub 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:14.560
 Loosens as I showed it before 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:17.830
 I would have pointed to this with my 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.640
 we have a kelter says this 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:25.360
 seed container contains cruel and 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:29.380
 will be over these hoses with small 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:33.010
 postponed three valleys over the entire width 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.890
 Now we use the wiesn elke and 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.580
 can then see how such a device 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.580
 is working 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.040
 next is for the three meters 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:20.120
 smooth whale to 1 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:20.120
 So that the floor is a beautiful one again 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.140
 again 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.140
 not correct 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:46.010
 thanks for your attention and 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.010
 bye until next time
