00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
have liked and I'm hoping that the

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.789 
have liked and I'm hoping that the
revamp<00:02:00.630> for<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.110> as<00:02:01.490> later<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.579> date<00:02:02.850> will

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
revamp for it as later a date will

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.219 
revamp for it as later a date will
improve<00:02:04.799> its<00:02:05.040> potential<00:02:05.640> because<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.899> still

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
improve its potential because it still

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.559 
improve its potential because it still
puts<00:02:07.680> out<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.920> lot<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.310> good<00:02:08.429> damage<00:02:08.849> but<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.360> just

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
puts out a lot of good damage but I just

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.260 
puts out a lot of good damage but I just
don't<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.110> still<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:10.709> honestly<00:02:11.250> think<00:02:11.459> it's<00:02:11.700> lost

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
don't I still I honestly think it's lost

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.380 
don't I still I honestly think it's lost
some<00:02:12.629> of<00:02:12.660> its<00:02:12.840> enjoyment<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.500> it

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
some of its enjoyment to it

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.620 
some of its enjoyment to it
I<00:02:15.390> have<00:02:16.080> noticed<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.920> recent<00:02:17.790> decline<00:02:18.180> why
