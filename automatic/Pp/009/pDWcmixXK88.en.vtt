00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.120 
Drummond right into this guy let's plug
this<00:02:19.790> thing<00:02:19.850> in<00:02:20.240> hook<00:02:20.510> it<00:02:20.630> up<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:20.960> hear<00:02:21.710> how<00:02:21.980> it

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
this thing in hook it up and hear how it

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.520 
this thing in hook it up and hear how it
sounds<00:02:22.450> okay<00:02:23.450> so<00:02:23.480> we've<00:02:23.660> got<00:02:23.720> our<00:02:23.960> guitar<00:02:24.290> all

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
sounds okay so we've got our guitar all

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.980 
sounds okay so we've got our guitar all
hooked<00:02:24.830> up<00:02:24.920> here<00:02:25.190> let's<00:02:26.090> just<00:02:26.180> listen<00:02:26.540> to<00:02:26.660> the

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
hooked up here let's just listen to the

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.750 
hooked up here let's just listen to the
sound<00:02:27.620> of<00:02:27.710> the<00:02:27.800> guitar<00:02:27.890> with<00:02:28.250> all<00:02:28.490> of<00:02:28.640> the

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
sound of the guitar with all of the

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:41.290 
sound of the guitar with all of the
effects<00:02:29.300> and<00:02:29.450> amp<00:02:30.110> emulations<00:02:30.770> off<00:02:40.240> now<00:02:41.240> the

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
effects and amp emulations off now the

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.110 
effects and amp emulations off now the
first<00:02:41.600> bank<00:02:41.870> of<00:02:41.990> these<00:02:42.140> effects<00:02:42.790> is<00:02:43.790> basically

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
first bank of these effects is basically

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.270 
first bank of these effects is basically
your<00:02:44.420> amp<00:02:45.970> simulation<00:02:47.470> it's<00:02:48.470> really<00:02:49.070> more

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
your amp simulation it's really more

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.980 
your amp simulation it's really more
like<00:02:49.490> a<00:02:49.520> distortion<00:02:51.070> simulator<00:02:52.300> there<00:02:53.300> are

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
like a distortion simulator there are

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.110 
like a distortion simulator there are
three<00:02:54.440> different<00:02:54.590> types<00:02:54.800> of<00:02:55.280> amps<00:02:55.880> there's

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
three different types of amps there's

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.200 
three different types of amps there's
the<00:02:56.960> warm<00:02:57.890> then<00:02:58.340> there's<00:02:58.550> the<00:02:58.670> normal<00:02:58.880> and

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
the warm then there's the normal and

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.950 
the warm then there's the normal and
then<00:02:59.300> there's<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.540> bright

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
then there's the bright

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.370 
then there's the bright
now<00:03:00.530> when<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.740> dials<00:03:01.070> are<00:03:01.190> all<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.640> way

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
now when the dials are all the way

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.680 
now when the dials are all the way
counterclockwise<00:03:03.820> that<00:03:04.820> effects<00:03:05.360> bank<00:03:05.540> is

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
counterclockwise that effects bank is

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.100 
counterclockwise that effects bank is
basically<00:03:06.250> bypassed<00:03:07.250> so<00:03:07.880> even<00:03:08.690> if<00:03:08.780> we<00:03:08.930> play

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
basically bypassed so even if we play

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.950 
basically bypassed so even if we play
and<00:03:09.380> we<00:03:09.440> change<00:03:09.770> these<00:03:10.430> here<00:03:10.880> you<00:03:11.720> can<00:03:11.840> see

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
and we change these here you can see

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.330 
and we change these here you can see
there's<00:03:12.110> not<00:03:12.290> really<00:03:12.680> a<00:03:12.800> difference<00:03:12.860> in<00:03:13.280> the

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
there's not really a difference in the

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.030 
there's not really a difference in the
content<00:03:14.000> however<00:03:14.620> let's<00:03:15.620> bring<00:03:15.800> it<00:03:15.920> up<00:03:15.980> to

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
content however let's bring it up to

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.010 
content however let's bring it up to
warm<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:17.060> we'll<00:03:17.239> sort<00:03:17.420> of<00:03:17.510> engage<00:03:17.840> the

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
warm and we'll sort of engage the

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.370 
warm and we'll sort of engage the
distortion<00:03:18.500> here

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
distortion here

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:27.450 
distortion here

and<00:03:31.050> now<00:03:31.590> we<00:03:31.650> can<00:03:31.890> hear<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.040> difference<00:03:32.280> Moy

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
and now we can hear a difference Moy

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:43.280 
and now we can hear a difference Moy
switch<00:03:32.640> over<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:32.820> normal<00:03:41.420> and<00:03:42.420> then<00:03:43.050> we<00:03:43.110> switch

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
switch over to normal and then we switch

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.430 
switch over to normal and then we switch
over<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.530> right

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440
