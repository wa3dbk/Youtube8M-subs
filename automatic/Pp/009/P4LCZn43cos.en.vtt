interface is going to look for you in

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.080 
interface is going to look for you in
Windows<00:00:08.530> 7<00:00:08.559> because<00:00:09.370> you're<00:00:09.670> going<00:00:09.790> to<00:00:09.849> notice

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.090 
Windows 7 because you're going to notice

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:12.730 
that I'm running Windows Server on the

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.419 
that I'm running Windows Server on the
server<00:00:13.059> 2012<00:00:13.959> platform<00:00:14.589> which<00:00:14.740> looks<00:00:15.129> like

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:15.429 
server 2012 platform which looks like

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:17.279 
server 2012 platform which looks like
Windows<00:00:15.849> 8<00:00:16.150> and<00:00:16.330> I've<00:00:16.660> done<00:00:16.900> that<00:00:17.080> because

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:17.289 
Windows 8 and I've done that because

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.189 
Windows 8 and I've done that because
we're<00:00:17.830> kind<00:00:18.130> of<00:00:18.220> in<00:00:18.400> that<00:00:18.460> area<00:00:19.030> now<00:00:19.510> with<00:00:19.900> our

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.199 
we're kind of in that area now with our

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.320 
we're kind of in that area now with our
client<00:00:20.980> systems<00:00:21.429> where<00:00:21.699> some<00:00:21.939> people<00:00:21.970> have

into memory and get set up a lot of this

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.760 
into memory and get set up a lot of this
will<00:01:09.759> be<00:01:09.850> cashed<00:01:10.150> it<00:01:10.420> will<00:01:10.509> open<00:01:10.689> a<00:01:10.960> lot<00:01:11.200> faster

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
will be cashed it will open a lot faster

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.920 
will be cashed it will open a lot faster
the<00:01:12.009> next<00:01:12.280> time<00:01:12.430> around<00:01:12.460> but<00:01:13.299> there's<00:01:13.689> also

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
the next time around but there's also

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.810

something else that I want to show you
and<00:01:16.060> I'm<00:01:16.180> going<00:01:16.360> to<00:01:16.420> use<00:01:16.689> this<00:01:16.990> throughout<00:01:17.470> the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
and I'm going to use this throughout the

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.460 
and I'm going to use this throughout the
course<00:01:18.369> here<00:01:18.729> and<00:01:18.939> that<00:01:19.240> is<00:01:19.420> it's<00:01:19.780> very<00:01:20.079> easy

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
course here and that is it's very easy

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.429 
course here and that is it's very easy
in<00:01:20.829> Windows<00:01:21.159> 7<00:01:21.579> just<00:01:22.119> like<00:01:22.329> in<00:01:22.570> windows<00:01:22.960> 8<00:01:23.229> and

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
in Windows 7 just like in windows 8 and

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.760 
in Windows 7 just like in windows 8 and
in<00:01:23.860> server<00:01:24.130> 2012<00:01:24.909> to<00:01:25.360> pin<00:01:25.750> things<00:01:26.200> down<00:01:26.560> here

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
in server 2012 to pin things down here

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.620 
in server 2012 to pin things down here
to<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:27.009> taskbar<00:01:27.430> then<00:01:28.119> we<00:01:28.210> can<00:01:28.390> very<00:01:28.570> easily

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
to the taskbar then we can very easily

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.810 
to the taskbar then we can very easily
get<00:01:29.200> back<00:01:29.409> to<00:01:29.619> them<00:01:29.770> then<00:01:29.979> so<00:01:30.130> as<00:01:30.310> you<00:01:30.430> can<00:01:30.579> see

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
get back to them then so as you can see

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.700 
get back to them then so as you can see
here<00:01:31.119> the<00:01:31.420> sequel<00:01:31.960> server<00:01:32.079> management<00:01:32.530> studio
