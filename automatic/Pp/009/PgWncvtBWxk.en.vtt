basically I'll just take you around the
box<00:01:00.359> quickly<00:01:00.750> nothing<00:01:01.530> really<00:01:01.770> too

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
box quickly nothing really too

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.490 
box quickly nothing really too
significant<00:01:03.030> you're<00:01:03.149> going<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.329> see<00:01:03.539> here<00:01:03.840> but

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
significant you're going to see here but

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.710 
significant you're going to see here but
when<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.739> comes<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.390> warranty<00:01:06.390> that's

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
when it comes to the warranty that's

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.090 
when it comes to the warranty that's
something<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.080> know<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.229> lot<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.710> are<00:01:07.860> going

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
something I know a lot of you are going

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.969 
something I know a lot of you are going
to<00:01:08.250> be<00:01:08.450> curious<00:01:09.450> about<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:10.020> believe<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.950> a

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
to be curious about I believe it is a

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.490 
to be curious about I believe it is a
three<00:01:11.610> year<00:01:11.880> warranty<00:01:12.180> but<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.110> course<00:01:13.320> I'll

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
three year warranty but of course I'll

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.890 
three year warranty but of course I'll
correct<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.270> actually<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.299> don't<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:15.570> to

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
correct that actually I don't have to

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.020 
correct that actually I don't have to
there<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.470> right<00:01:17.070> there<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.700> can<00:01:17.880> see

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
there it is right there so you can see

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.300 
there it is right there so you can see
it<00:01:18.119> states<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.530> three<00:01:20.070> year

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
it states that it is a three year

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.399 
it states that it is a three year
standard<00:01:20.610> limited<00:01:21.150> warranty<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.229> that's

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
standard limited warranty so that's

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.980 
standard limited warranty so that's
another<00:01:22.979> nice<00:01:23.220> thing<00:01:23.280> but<00:01:24.180> not<00:01:24.360> surprising

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
another nice thing but not surprising

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.780 
another nice thing but not surprising
from<00:01:25.200> Toshiba<00:01:25.650> let<00:01:26.220> me<00:01:26.310> go<00:01:26.430> ahead<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.610> get

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
from Toshiba let me go ahead and get

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.280 
from Toshiba let me go ahead and get
this<00:01:26.939> out<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.479> box<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:29.780> really<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.140> a

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
this out of the box and really this is a

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.990 
this out of the box and really this is a
versatile<00:01:31.740> drive<00:01:32.040> whether<00:01:32.369> we're<00:01:32.579> talking

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
versatile drive whether we're talking

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.060 
versatile drive whether we're talking
about<00:01:33.119> using<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:34.850> an<00:01:35.850> as<00:01:36.090> device<00:01:36.570> or<00:01:37.380> just

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
about using it for an as device or just

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.730 
about using it for an as device or just
throwing<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.909> into<00:01:39.119> your<00:01:39.270> PC<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.960> think<00:01:40.560> that

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
throwing it into your PC I think that

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.039 
throwing it into your PC I think that
it's<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.130> good<00:01:41.310> solution<00:01:41.520> for<00:01:42.299> all<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.659> those

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
it's a good solution for all of those

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.859 
it's a good solution for all of those
things<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:44.009> that's<00:01:44.729> what<00:01:45.030> makes<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.600> good

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
things so that's what makes it a good

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.740 
things so that's what makes it a good
drive<00:01:46.170> especially<00:01:46.640> at<00:01:47.640> its<00:01:47.820> price<00:01:48.180> because

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
drive especially at its price because

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.139 
drive especially at its price because
it's<00:01:49.259> very<00:01:49.439> versatile<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.159> course<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.970> fact

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
it's very versatile of course the fact

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.109 
it's very versatile of course the fact
that<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:52.020> little<00:01:52.470> bit<00:01:52.619> louder<00:01:52.890> then<00:01:53.759> I

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
that it is a little bit louder then I

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.530 
that it is a little bit louder then I
think<00:01:54.570> some<00:01:54.930> will<00:01:55.229> prefer<00:01:55.710> that's<00:01:56.460> why<00:01:56.759> maybe

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
think some will prefer that's why maybe

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.719 
think some will prefer that's why maybe
it's<00:01:57.780> better<00:01:58.320> not<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.860> be<00:01:59.040> in<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.280> machine<00:01:59.579> at

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
it's better not to be in a machine at

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.190 
it's better not to be in a machine at
least<00:01:59.759> that<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.090> have<00:02:00.299> right<00:02:00.509> next<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.020> you

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
least that you have right next to you

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.819 
least that you have right next to you
especially<00:02:02.130> on<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.340> desktop<00:02:03.229> literally<00:02:04.229> but

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
especially on a desktop literally but

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.059 
especially on a desktop literally but
home<00:02:05.729> network<00:02:06.149> storage<00:02:06.479> that's<00:02:07.350> maybe<00:02:07.680> where

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
home network storage that's maybe where

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.710 
home network storage that's maybe where
this<00:02:08.250> will<00:02:08.459> be<00:02:08.580> better<00:02:08.789> off<00:02:09.060> since<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.599> won't

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
this will be better off since it won't

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.380 
this will be better off since it won't
be<00:02:09.929> literally<00:02:10.590> right<00:02:10.800> next<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:12.209> make

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
be literally right next to you to make

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.270 
be literally right next to you to make
that<00:02:12.569> noise<00:02:12.780> but<00:02:13.140> really<00:02:13.620> it

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
that noise but really it

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.910 
that noise but really it
is<00:02:14.520> going<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.910> go<00:02:15.090> wherever<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.600> choose

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
is going to go wherever you choose

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.160 
is going to go wherever you choose
three-year<00:02:16.920> warranty<00:02:17.160> right<00:02:17.850> there<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.569> the

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
three-year warranty right there and the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.980 
three-year warranty right there and the
drive<00:02:19.470> itself<00:02:20.300> and<00:02:21.300> I've<00:02:21.420> shared<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.810> lot<00:02:21.959> of

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
drive itself and I've shared a lot of

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.380 
drive itself and I've shared a lot of
drives<00:02:22.350> in<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.680> past<00:02:22.920> both<00:02:23.580> internal<00:02:24.209> and

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
drives in the past both internal and

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.390 
drives in the past both internal and
external<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:25.230> that's<00:02:26.069> why<00:02:26.220> I'm<00:02:26.370> bringing

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
external and that's why I'm bringing

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.210 
external and that's why I'm bringing
this<00:02:26.910> out<00:02:27.120> because<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:27.780> was<00:02:28.380> in<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.650> market<00:02:29.010> for

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
this out because I was in the market for

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.000 
this out because I was in the market for
a<00:02:29.280> five<00:02:30.000> terabyte<00:02:30.569> or<00:02:30.810> larger<00:02:31.319> drive<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:31.860> was

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
a five terabyte or larger drive I was

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.710 
a five terabyte or larger drive I was
really<00:02:32.280> after<00:02:32.580> an<00:02:32.670> eight<00:02:32.819> terabyte<00:02:33.270> Seagate

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
really after an eight terabyte Seagate

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.210 
really after an eight terabyte Seagate
some<00:02:33.959> of<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.170> I'm<00:02:34.350> sure<00:02:34.380> are<00:02:34.530> familiar<00:02:34.770> with

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
some of you I'm sure are familiar with

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.670 
some of you I'm sure are familiar with
that<00:02:35.310> drive<00:02:35.610> but<00:02:36.390> what<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.600> came<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:37.050> pricing

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
that drive but what it came to pricing

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.250 
that drive but what it came to pricing
this<00:02:38.250> was<00:02:38.459> really<00:02:38.880> difficult<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.510> be<00:02:39.540> because

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
this was really difficult to be because

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.120 
this was really difficult to be because
right<00:02:41.220> now<00:02:41.459> this<00:02:41.790> seems<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.360> be<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:43.560> sweet

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
right now this seems to be the sweet

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.630 
right now this seems to be the sweet
spot<00:02:44.280> with<00:02:45.180> regard<00:02:45.569> to<00:02:45.660> internal<00:02:46.560> drives<00:02:46.920> when

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
spot with regard to internal drives when

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.060 
spot with regard to internal drives when
you<00:02:47.730> compare<00:02:48.120> it<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.959> just<00:02:49.380> about<00:02:49.470> anything<00:02:49.800> I

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
you compare it to just about anything I

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.979 
you compare it to just about anything I
mean<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.310> eight<00:02:50.700> terabyte<00:02:51.209> Seagate<00:02:51.720> is<00:02:51.750> a

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
mean the eight terabyte Seagate is a

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.949 
mean the eight terabyte Seagate is a
fifty<00:02:52.380> nine<00:02:52.410> hundred<00:02:52.950> rpm<00:02:53.370> drive<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:54.060> believe<00:02:54.930> a

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
fifty nine hundred rpm drive I believe a

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.190 
fifty nine hundred rpm drive I believe a
little<00:02:55.200> bit<00:02:55.440> quieter<00:02:55.980> than<00:02:56.160> this<00:02:56.810> but<00:02:57.810> other

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
little bit quieter than this but other

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.229 
little bit quieter than this but other
than<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:58.739> in<00:02:58.980> terms<00:02:59.220> of<00:02:59.430> pricing<00:02:59.850> you're

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
than that in terms of pricing you're

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.240 
than that in terms of pricing you're
looking<00:03:00.510> at<00:03:00.600> 280<00:03:01.019> for<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.380> drive<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:01.860> the

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
looking at 280 for that drive and the

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.300 
looking at 280 for that drive and the
original<00:03:02.700> suggested<00:03:03.239> retail<00:03:03.450> of<00:03:03.840> that<00:03:03.989> drive

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
original suggested retail of that drive

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.020 
original suggested retail of that drive
was<00:03:05.870> 260<00:03:06.870> I<00:03:06.900> believe<00:03:07.410> or<00:03:07.800> 270<00:03:08.580> so<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.850> fact

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
was 260 I believe or 270 so the fact

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.120 
was 260 I believe or 270 so the fact
that<00:03:09.120> it's<00:03:09.330> running<00:03:09.480> 275<00:03:10.110> 280<00:03:10.319> or<00:03:10.560> even<00:03:10.890> higher

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
that it's running 275 280 or even higher

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.699 
that it's running 275 280 or even higher
makes<00:03:11.850> it<00:03:12.000> unrealistic<00:03:12.540> this<00:03:13.260> on<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.560> other

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
makes it unrealistic this on the other

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.460 
makes it unrealistic this on the other
hand<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.310> think<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.209> great<00:03:15.480> option<00:03:15.870> because

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
hand I think is a great option because

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.080 
hand I think is a great option because
even<00:03:16.739> though<00:03:16.860> five<00:03:17.040> terabytes<00:03:17.430> isn't<00:03:17.970> where

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
even though five terabytes isn't where

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.789 
even though five terabytes isn't where
things<00:03:18.360> are<00:03:18.510> peaking<00:03:18.989> of<00:03:19.380> course<00:03:19.620> that's

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
things are peaking of course that's

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:20.830 
things are peaking of course that's
always<00:03:19.920> going<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.160> be<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.370> most<00:03:20.549> expensive

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
always going to be the most expensive

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.080 
always going to be the most expensive
this<00:03:21.840> is<00:03:21.900> where<00:03:22.410> price<00:03:23.340> is<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:23.910> most

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
this is where price is the most

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.520 
this is where price is the most
attractive<00:03:24.269> so<00:03:24.930> again<00:03:25.200> five<00:03:25.500> terabytes<00:03:25.920> a

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
attractive so again five terabytes a

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.470 
attractive so again five terabytes a
7200<00:03:28.530> rpm<00:03:28.920> Drive<00:03:29.250> I<00:03:29.549> believe<00:03:29.970> that<00:03:30.209> is<00:03:30.360> a

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
7200 rpm Drive I believe that is a

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.650 
7200 rpm Drive I believe that is a
misprint<00:03:30.870> it's<00:03:31.079> a<00:03:31.140> 64<00:03:31.769> Meg<00:03:31.950> cache<00:03:32.329> but<00:03:33.329> three

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
misprint it's a 64 Meg cache but three

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.150 
misprint it's a 64 Meg cache but three
year<00:03:33.810> warranty<00:03:33.959> I<00:03:34.260> mean<00:03:34.650> how<00:03:34.829> could<00:03:35.040> you

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
year warranty I mean how could you

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.759 
year warranty I mean how could you
really<00:03:35.370> do<00:03:35.700> much<00:03:36.299> better<00:03:36.540> than<00:03:36.630> that<00:03:36.930> for<00:03:37.650> the

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
really do much better than that for the

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.250 
really do much better than that for the
given<00:03:38.040> price<00:03:38.400> point<00:03:38.430> so<00:03:39.390> again<00:03:39.780> this<00:03:39.989> is<00:03:40.230> a

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
given price point so again this is a

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.580 
given price point so again this is a
Toshiba<00:03:40.709> 5<00:03:41.190> terabyte<00:03:41.700> internal<00:03:42.269> drive<00:03:42.570> I<00:03:42.959> will

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
Toshiba 5 terabyte internal drive I will
