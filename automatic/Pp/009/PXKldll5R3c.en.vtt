 I am always beautiful the black sea 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:34.559
 was shot to testify here twisted 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.350
 quite interesting blow one can 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.010
 make as time is not really so 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.010

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:51.300
 it does not depend on me the wrong one 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:01:03.229
 right ones should be able to clear black 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:01:11.190
 I'm ok but that's exactly what I wanted 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:12.240

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.260

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.260
 also will do 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:30.350
 so really pure hammered the hammer 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:49.690
 Now you're all in 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:02:04.270

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.810

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:17.940
 right field of the commodity but otherwise 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.940
 a shot of the influence from germany 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:27.340

 I do not know the rules so well yet 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:44.730
 I could do it 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:49.000
 give up is quite an option 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.269
 or I can do something like that 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.269
 think 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:15.220
 they are twice as many little there 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:15.220
 true but what is not working 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:22.220

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:53.710
