millionaires coaches today we have

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.819 
millionaires coaches today we have
combination<00:00:15.900> this<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.320> little<00:00:16.529> bit<00:00:16.619> longer

00:00:16.819 --> 00:00:16.829 
combination this is a little bit longer

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:18.710 
combination this is a little bit longer
than<00:00:17.070> usual<00:00:17.250> combination<00:00:17.669> and<00:00:18.240> it's<00:00:18.419> a<00:00:18.509> nice

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
than usual combination and it's a nice

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.490 
than usual combination and it's a nice
dynamic<00:00:19.050> ending<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:20.130> have<00:00:20.340> crafted<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.360> a

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
dynamic ending and I have crafted to a

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.600 
dynamic ending and I have crafted to a
specific<00:00:22.500> piece<00:00:22.710> but<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:22.980> think<00:00:23.250> it'll<00:00:23.489> be

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:23.610 
specific piece but I think it'll be

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.400 
specific piece but I think it'll be
modifiable<00:00:24.150> for<00:00:24.509> something<00:00:24.869> else<00:00:25.050> if<00:00:25.199> you

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
modifiable for something else if you

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.560 
modifiable for something else if you
chose<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.830> use<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.250> for<00:00:26.369> something<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:27.300> we're

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570

is<00:02:09.200> important<00:02:09.860> that<00:02:10.009> we<00:02:10.130> land<00:02:10.369> right<00:02:10.550> here<00:02:10.910> and

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
is important that we land right here and

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.830 
is important that we land right here and
then<00:02:12.320> we're<00:02:12.590> going<00:02:12.709> to<00:02:12.770> step<00:02:13.010> out<00:02:13.600> I'm<00:02:14.600> going

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
gonna follow it to look back four counts

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.040 
gonna follow it to look back four counts
and<00:02:31.489> then<00:02:32.330> I'm<00:02:32.450> going<00:02:32.600> to<00:02:32.630> bring<00:02:32.810> it<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.870> so

first and then I'm going the rest I said
this<00:02:39.590> is<00:02:39.739> a<00:02:39.800> little<00:02:40.010> bit<00:02:40.100> longer<00:02:40.310> than<00:02:40.610> most<00:02:41.120> of

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
this is a little bit longer than most of

00:02:41.330 --> 00:03:02.979 
this is a little bit longer than most of
the<00:02:41.390> combinations<00:02:41.900> so<00:02:42.860> again<00:03:01.120> six<00:03:02.120> and<00:03:02.390> seven

to go two of them on the side three step

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.670 
to go two of them on the side three step
turn<00:03:48.209> in<00:03:48.510> this<00:03:48.570> direction<00:03:48.810> I'm<00:03:49.380> going<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:49.560> take

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
turn in this direction I'm going to take

that ends on the accent of the music

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.940 
that ends on the accent of the music
that<00:04:00.150> I've<00:04:00.330> chosen<00:04:00.600> I<00:04:01.019> think<00:04:01.380> I<00:04:01.440> said<00:04:01.650> this<00:04:01.769> is

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
that I've chosen I think I said this is

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.920 
that I've chosen I think I said this is
my<00:04:02.100> viable<00:04:02.640> so<00:04:03.090> I'm<00:04:03.209> going<00:04:03.390> to<00:04:03.450> do<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:03.660> second

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
my viable so I'm going to do the second

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.880 
my viable so I'm going to do the second
half<00:04:04.050> of<00:04:04.230> that<00:04:04.410> from<00:04:05.420> this<00:04:06.420> shimmy<00:04:06.690> down<00:04:06.900> so

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
half of that from this shimmy down so

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:15.650 
half of that from this shimmy down so
for<00:04:08.100> here<00:04:08.340> we'd<00:04:08.910> have<00:04:12.319> six<00:04:13.319> seven<00:04:14.239> one<00:04:15.239> two

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
for here we'd have six seven one two

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.000 
for here we'd have six seven one two
three<00:04:16.530> four<00:04:17.100> around<00:04:17.459> two<00:04:18.299> three<00:04:18.900> four<00:04:19.590> pull

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
three four around two three four pull

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.219 
three four around two three four pull
back<00:04:20.280> to<00:04:20.910> three<00:04:22.100> double<00:04:23.100> on<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.669> right<00:04:23.940> and

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
back to three double on the right and

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:31.730 
back to three double on the right and
turn<00:04:26.120> shoulders<00:04:27.120> shoulder<00:04:27.390> up<00:04:30.140> okay<00:04:31.140> so<00:04:31.200> you

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
turn shoulders shoulder up okay so you

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.200 
turn shoulders shoulder up okay so you
probably<00:04:31.890> need<00:04:32.280> to<00:04:32.430> go<00:04:32.550> through<00:04:32.880> that<00:04:33.000> with

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
probably need to go through that with

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.909 
probably need to go through that with
this<00:04:33.630> section<00:04:34.110> of<00:04:34.200> the<00:04:34.229> David<00:04:34.590> couple<00:04:34.830> the

this section of the David couple the

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.620 
this section of the David couple the
times<00:04:35.130> before<00:04:35.850> you<00:04:35.970> go<00:04:36.090> on<00:04:36.300> with<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:36.539> music

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
times before you go on with the music

00:04:36.630 --> 00:05:24.689 
times before you go on with the music
when<00:04:37.169> you're<00:04:37.289> ready

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:24.699 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.460 

but<00:05:25.699> again<00:05:26.240> you<00:05:26.419> can<00:05:26.600> take<00:05:26.810> these<00:05:26.990> elements

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
but again you can take these elements

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:28.689 
but again you can take these elements
and<00:05:27.620> kind<00:05:27.770> of<00:05:27.800> extend<00:05:28.190> them<00:05:28.340> and<00:05:28.490> shape<00:05:28.669> them

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699 
and kind of extend them and shape them

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:30.879 
and kind of extend them and shape them
into<00:05:29.060> things<00:05:29.780> that<00:05:29.900> fit<00:05:30.260> and<00:05:30.440> ending<00:05:30.740> or
