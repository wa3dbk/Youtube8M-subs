00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.769

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.170

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.510
 zara i got some paws 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.000
 to be so it was a little while 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.940
 that I wanted one is there with the 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.110
 back in the 70's fashion I 'm 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.450
 it was the right opportunity for 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:47.309
 take one so here I love the color 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.680

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.350
 very very well he's on the other hand a 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.059
 little bit long but with heels I 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.020
 think it should do it 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.949
 I might not need it 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.609
 so retouch this jeans cost me 49 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.320
 euros 95 and frankly I find it 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.970
 has a very very beautiful everything and I love the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.220
 color always at zara I got 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.320
 took this raw denim shirt 1 so 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.080
 I like it a lot years ago 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.710
 70 also in addition I love the detail at 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.350
 collar level species of small tie 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.380
 shirt that I really like and who 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.689
 actually changes jean shirts that 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.150
 I usually wear the prices in 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.250
 radius of rafah luc and it cost me 39 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.750
 euros 95 so on home vera I got 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.180
 took a leatherette skirt 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.759
 so it's a short skirt that comes to 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.820
 above the knee so I like it a lot 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.170
 the color I think it changes 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.470
 here is the closing gala at the back 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.079
 the pocket on the side and she told me 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.950
 cost 29 euros 95 and frankly I 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.820
 really does not like 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.490
 I think with 1 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.560
 with a black hole or even a shirt and 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.270
 raw shirt that should really do 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.570
 Then I took this very pretty 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.580
 coat at zara so gray heather 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.200
 I love the collar that can be worn 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.420
 completely open or otherwise 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.670
 we can close so it's a coat 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.200
 who does not have a button so you can 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.709
 perfectly associate with a pretty 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.980
 belt 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.500
 it's long I think it's a very 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.020
 nice autumn coat and the coat has me 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.610
 cost 79 euros 95 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.680
 then I took this little sweater 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.100
 navy blue from zara so sleeves 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.480
 short 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.010
 I love this kind of little sweaters because 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.470
 that you can grant them with all 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.940
 you can put it under a jacket 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.910
 you can wear so with jeans 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.270
 bootcut you can also wear 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.700
 with the leather skirt 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.620
 here and in addition this marine color 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.570
 I did not have that color and I find 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.730
 that it's really very classy 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.350
 in fact it exists in other colors 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.510
 you have seen it in me you have it in 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.670
 rose hill r I think I 'm going to get it 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.430
 take in other colors and he has me 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.870
 cost 19 euros 95 with the purchase coup de 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.500
 heart by Zara is really what 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.459
 his brown sweaters already I like 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.840
 I like it a lot because it is long and 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.549
 I also like the detail at the level of the goal 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.959
 an asymmetrical collar and that makes me 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:10.030
 really a very nice neckline 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.650
 So here is a sweater that cost me 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.780
 49 0 95 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.910
 we really have a lot of the detail at 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.459
 collar level it 's something that I 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.980
 do not have in my wardrobe and that's it 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.940
 with jeans and blue jeans 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.799
 little black boots 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.480
 you really do is then in 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:29.079
 speaking of black boots I got 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.299
 bought a pair of ankle boots so 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.400
 here is a very nice pair of 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.560
 boots I love the boots in 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.910
 autumn and winter 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.410
 so she really has small details 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.910
 really very nice she is a 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.280
 opening at the ankle this 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.170
 who really is what makes them 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.370
 shoe details not to mention 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.049
 that she still has a heel 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.220
 surf between the flat boot and the 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.739
 beauty the table where you are 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.239
 we enter the two is frankly at a 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.890
 very nice cut I like I like 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.010
 really a lot and this father has me 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.690
 cost 49 9 95 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.519
 but quite frankly they are worth 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.100
 really blow so then at h &amp; m 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.970
 do not remove this pretty kimono jacket from 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.070
 khaki color 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.470
 so if you follow me on snapshot you 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.510
 most certainly have a chance to see the 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.139
 door and when i was in London 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.699
 I love this jacket honestly I like 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:17.230
 already much the color I like the 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:18.989
 matter and I find that the facts that 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.459
 told me it's really pretty 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.870
 So here is a jacket that I do not stop 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.010
 door right now and suddenly I think 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.600
 I'm going to buy one less 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.030
 also like that I really like 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.500
 the kimono effect when I was so I 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.270
 Stopped in boots and I added 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.520
 still a brush to my collection 8 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.919
 technics so this time I chose to 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.770
 take the skull thing bluff so that's it 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.270
 it's a brush that's great for the 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.220
 touring account so he marries 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.139
 perfectly the shape of the face 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.630
 and that's how I think he's really 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:49.300
 very well there is a cost of eight or 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.830
 nine pounds and frankly his brushes 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.260
 sofa I keep saying it but I 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.729
 finds that techno bubble brushes 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.910
 frankly are really very good 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.949
 by the way the subscribers who asked me 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.380
 what were the best brushes for 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:04.060
 start and I take the opportunity to answer you 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.310
 if you watch the video 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.630
 very honestly you can invest in 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.669
 the technical bull brushes you'll be at 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.710
 see not disappointed in terms of price of 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.030
 quality and longevity 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.770
 I think it's really 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.750
 excellent brush then I went 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.930
 at mac and I stopped to see 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.210
 their new collection of 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.350
 I was going in the morning and so I added 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.960
 new colors to my collection 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.479
 first is the color persistence 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.690
 so here it is a nude 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:35.389
 it's a nude lipstick I'm going 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:39.949
 you swatch it and so that's it 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:43.130
 gives second color that I took these 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:50.690
 stocks that are so here it seems to me that 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:52.910
 it's a Bordeaux and that's it 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.750
 really it's really very very 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.070
 very beautiful colors 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.020
 we had moreover that I wanted 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.340
 really it was the world and it's in 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.199
 out of stock everywhere 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.750
 and finally when I managed to 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:04.250
 find and froze swatch and I got 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.199
 realized that this was exactly the 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.220
 same as mac's top 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:11.900
 so if you run after the world 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.639
 stopped running take the top it's 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.710
 exactly the same thing so then 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:17.780
 at sephora I took the picture 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.440
 finish foundation pliner from this 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.180
 match box 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.699
 so a little over a month ago I you 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:25.010
 had presented in a video 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:27.050
 the miniature version of this prime hours 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.570
 I tested since I had never bought 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.130
 of brand newcomers this match box and 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.070
 honestly I really liked 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:36.169
 the result so suddenly there I went 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.580
 take me the big format so then 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:40.310
 my birthday i had the nice 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.460
 surprised to receive the ceni sweetie 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.750
 chocolate bar in all makes 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.979
 honestly it's really a super 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.050
 gift I was really very very 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:49.159
 content 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:51.099
 finally the colors are really 

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:54.020
 intense and beautiful 

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:57.320
 very honestly I took care of some 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:59.389
 colors I do not even dare to use it 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.610
 it's a jewel this palette where the 

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:02.870
 look possibilities with seven pallets 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.659
 are really tiny 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.370
 the colors are beautiful I even 

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:08.419
 not want to use so much so 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.550
 I find it beautiful I believe elsewhere 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:11.840
 that this is the most beautiful palette that 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.780
 I have France regarding the water of time 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.650
 it is true that they are very very good 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.780
 close I would not say they are 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.110
 chocolate but it's true that she has a 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.480
 smell of sweets 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:23.820
 they are really good and that makes it 

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.590
 even more pleasant to use 

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.750
 that's all for me I hope that 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:30.470
 the video will have pleased you and I repeat very 

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.470
 next
