00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:07.950
 who knows what is wrong there is say 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.330
 but you probably know something 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.160
 this is because you visit car week 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.450
 of course regularly but a lot 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.910
 people in the Netherlands really still have 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.650
 not even an idea what brand this is 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.280
 this ladies and gentlemen is namely the new one 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.050
 ssangyong tivoli precisely the brand we have 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.400
 know the korando among other things 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.040
 try again 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.360
 in europe with this compact b-segment 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.890
 crossover 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.460
 well take a look at the design 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.460
 do you think so yourself 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.469
 well i don't know what you think but 

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:38.940
 I find quite successful you see 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.620
 very clear that ssangyong again 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.399
 tries to match the European taste 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.989
 to speak 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.940
 and that's no coincidence because this car is 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.280
 drawn by to designs that make it art 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.690
 has cheated on citroÃ«n the man who 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.429
 is also responsible for this car 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.659
 has also given its name to the 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:52.979
 Citroen DS3 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:54.780
 well and if you go to the details 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:55.829
 then you will see some similarity 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.079
 just look at this kind 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.190
 The shark fin gives you some details that that 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.899
 give the machine character 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.899
 I have to say good work 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.800
 a nice body is of course one 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.510
 thing how is the car on the inside 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.340
 practical area 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.950
 this tivoli is therefore a b-segment 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.230
 crossover so he competes with cars 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.420
 as the opel mocha and the renault captur 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.980
 and in terms of dimensions he is four meters 19 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.870
 For a long time he also sits between those two cars 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.890
 and then you sit in the back then falls 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.270
 not at all against me 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.770
 i have the front life you give them something to it 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.610
 put forward to make it a little more realistic 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.650
 to make 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.990
 but sitting in the main room looked down 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.510
 I'm definitely not disappointed in the roof 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.940
 and also the space for the knees and the 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.830
 thighs is not wrong even 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.729
 what frivolous things here in the back as 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:47.920
 you talking about it 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:49.660
 captur that reminds me too 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.729
 you need the space in the trunk 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.110
 not to leave the tivoli 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.300
 although you do see a decent one 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.180
 look at the threshold, but it is quite high 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.190
 but the space behind it is 430 liters 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.030
 and that is not at all in this segment 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.790
 wrong 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.759
 and then with a little extra effort oil 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.080
 so the behind my worksheet and then you have 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.250
 a room that suits you pretty well 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.810
 the feet can 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.060
 this is a pre production car so the 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.340
 finish quality leaves her and the still 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.910
 something to be desired but also here 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.410
 rubber bands and also here in the front and just the 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.360
 build quality and reasonable 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.980
 quirky design must say that 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.110
 do the materials with something too much 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.450
 think of a blocker stereo 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.370
 it's all a bit hard very much 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.110
 shiny plastic but it all sticks out 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.269
 it neatly down do ask myself together 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.910
 it is still pre-production but how long 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.560
 these buttons remain beautiful for the rest 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.900
 seating position is very reasonable it is 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.730
 just a pity that the steering wheel is only in the 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.730
 height adjustable is not the depth 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.470
 no collision with the tivoli then you notice 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.020
 that ssangyong clearly the recipe of 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.790
 kia and hyundai wanted to copy and 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.260
 then you can take it quite literally because the 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.060
 control, for example, is exact 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.410
 the same system as my used here 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.000
 in the i30 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.920
 including the three 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.290
 setting options sport normal 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.300
 and comfort with which you especially the gravity 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.190
 of the system 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.440
 yes in the i30 it does not work very much 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.220
 nice and that does not apply to this tivoli 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.630
 different 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.090
 it's a bit of an artificial system 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.130
 you do have control but 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.320
 you do not feel what you are doing he became 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.090
 just very numb and very light 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.150
 so that's not something you do this car 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.500
 specifically by example 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.270
 engine area there are two choices 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.730
 available from this ssangyong 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.260
 in the first instance this will be in June 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.930
 version on the market that is a one 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.500
 princess gasoline and without turbo with 128 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.920
 pk 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.690
 the four-cylinder and later in September 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.410
 also follows a diesel in a process with 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.410
 115 hp 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.860
 the car is basically 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.240
 two-wheel drive but later will come 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.290
 also a four-wheel drive version 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.210
 available 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.410
 this is two-wheel drive and that will 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.670
 the most sold version will be in 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.140
 the Netherlands of course 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.250
 why does that engine behave that one 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.650
 point 6 gasoline 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.640
 well i am not there to much and i will 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.350
 I say so 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.120
 no it is not a motorcycle that is a real swint 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.020
 a power or amazing performance 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.090
 put down 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.700
 but now berries are some strength at the bottom 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.380
 also packs nicely smoothly in a row now in 60 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.290
 in fifth gear and that pulls 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.700
 so effortlessly the gear ratios 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.670
 of the six-speed gearbox are also 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.770
 neatly chosen well yes you get there 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.460
 no brooding in the lower abdomen of I will 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.260
 but say so 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.120
 but for daily use and dutch 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.120
 flat roads this is a great combination 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.510
 and 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.110
 it is an engine specific to such 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:50.389
 is built young by a company in 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.580
 austria and yes he meets but it is 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.410
 also no adolescent modern machine 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.850
 it also applies to co2 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.580
 emissions and consumption 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.560
 he scores reasonable marks March is 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.419
 no world improver that is relatively high 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.090
 co2 emissions are also reflected 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.590
 in the price too because where a renault 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.289
 captur for example is available for 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.720
 about 18,000 euros in the cheese, the 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.130
 This version represents a minimum of 21,000 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.050
 in the price lists 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.150
 but you have to look further than you 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.800
 nose is long because one for that amount 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.080
 spoon ssangyong quite a bit 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.669
 things on board this car 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.009
 go for that second equipment level 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.750
 that costs around 25,000 euros 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:28.940
 then you really have more stuff than at the 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.419
 competition and it scores there 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.419
 number of point 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.200
 and then of course the driving behavior 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.000
 how shall I describe well this is 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.160
 not his strongest side thresholds 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.720
 mean the celebration 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.310
 picks it all up quite smoothly but 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.060
 especially the damping on the rear axle is one 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.940
 bit too hard 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.040
 therefore the car is still refinement i would 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.810
 described as the neat and medium on 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.250
 the red and frankly it is 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.620
 the entire final conclusion of this ssangyong 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.450
 tivoli it's a good car that good 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.320
 once looked at what's important 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.910
 in the segment 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.950
 but you still miss your own 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.330
 character and therefore a reason why me 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.470
 would thereby say you need one 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.620
 buy ssangyong tivoli 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:13.240
 it is absolutely great value for money 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.240
 but for the rest a neat 7
