00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.220 
adjust the brakes and stuff is really
really<00:00:22.680> simple<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.160> did<00:00:23.340> respond<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.900> text

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
really simple I did respond and the text

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.960 
really simple I did respond and the text
on<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.380> video<00:00:25.590> but<00:00:25.800> as<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.550> said<00:00:26.730> you'd<00:00:26.849> like

on the video but as you said you'd like

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.609 
on the video but as you said you'd like
a<00:00:27.000> video<00:00:27.300> it's<00:00:27.660> easier<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.080> show<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.320> what<00:00:28.590> to

a video it's easier to show you what to

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.890 
a video it's easier to show you what to
do<00:00:28.890> right<00:00:29.730> well<00:00:29.970> basically<00:00:30.240> it's<00:00:30.570> very<00:00:30.599> very

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
do right well basically it's very very

do right well basically it's very very
simple

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
simple

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.950 
simple
you've<00:00:32.790> got<00:00:33.380> the<00:00:34.380> steering<00:00:34.710> servo<00:00:35.040> which<00:00:35.430> is

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
you've got the steering servo which is

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.860 
you've got the steering servo which is
obviously<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.770> one<00:00:38.480> towards<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.510> back<00:00:39.719> of

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
obviously this one towards the back of

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.770 
obviously this one towards the back of
the<00:00:39.930> car<00:00:40.520> as<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.700> said<00:00:41.910> depends<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:42.360> which<00:00:42.510> model

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
the car as I said depends on which model

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.020 
the car as I said depends on which model
you<00:00:42.930> have<00:00:43.170> but<00:00:43.410> if<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.489> latest

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
you have but if you have the latest

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.650 
you have but if you have the latest
model<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.829> eb4<00:00:46.829> then<00:00:47.520> you'll<00:00:47.700> have<00:00:47.879> twin<00:00:48.210> discs

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
model of eb4 then you'll have twin discs

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.430 
model of eb4 then you'll have twin discs
and<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:49.530> one<00:00:49.710> has<00:00:50.059> one<00:00:51.059> pin<00:00:51.360> at<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.809> top<00:00:51.930> and

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
and this one has one pin at the top and

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.430 
and this one has one pin at the top and
a<00:00:52.949> second<00:00:53.280> pin<00:00:53.460> at<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.120> bottom<00:00:54.270> they<00:00:55.079> both<00:00:55.260> do

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
a second pin at the bottom they both do

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.689 
a second pin at the bottom they both do
the<00:00:55.530> same<00:00:55.559> thing<00:00:55.949> they<00:00:56.070> both<00:00:56.219> work<00:00:56.460> on<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
the same thing they both work on the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.420 
the same thing they both work on the
brakes<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.090> discs<00:00:57.480> but<00:00:58.109> obviously<00:00:58.680> if<00:00:59.309> you've

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
brakes and discs but obviously if you've

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.430 
brakes and discs but obviously if you've
got<00:00:59.550> two<00:00:59.789> then<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.180> need<00:01:00.329> two<00:01:00.510> arms<00:01:00.870> you've

metal thing all you need is an allen key

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.810 
metal thing all you need is an allen key
to<00:01:33.329> go<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:33.930> there<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.530> just<00:01:34.710> undo<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.729> if

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
to go in there you just undo it and if

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.429 
to go in there you just undo it and if
you<00:01:35.939> want<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.150> make<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> brake<00:01:36.540> stronger<00:01:37.170> you

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
you want to make the brake stronger you

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.649 
you want to make the brake stronger you
bring<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:38.189> way<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.880> if<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.420> want<00:01:39.570> to

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
bring it this way and if you want to

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.510 
bring it this way and if you want to
make<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.869> brakes<00:01:40.110> less<00:01:40.470> strong<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.159> you

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
make the brakes less strong and you

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.730 
make the brakes less strong and you
bring<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.060> way<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:43.140> all<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.380> do<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.560> you

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
bring it that way and all you do is you

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.109 
bring it that way and all you do is you
just<00:01:43.770> fiddle<00:01:44.220> around<00:01:44.280> with<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.670> adjustment

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
just fiddle around with the adjustment

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.719 
just fiddle around with the adjustment
until<00:01:45.299> you've<00:01:45.450> got<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.689> how<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.840> want<00:01:46.729> and

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
until you've got it how you want and

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:48.499 
until you've got it how you want and
that's<00:01:47.909> about<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.240> really

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
that's about it really

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.960 
that's about it really
so<00:01:48.840> if<00:01:49.140> it's<00:01:49.290> not<00:01:49.409> braking<00:01:49.860> strongly<00:01:50.790> enough

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
so if it's not braking strongly enough

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.359 
so if it's not braking strongly enough
at<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.149> moment<00:01:51.509> then<00:01:52.079> just<00:01:52.409> bring<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.710> towards

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
at the moment then just bring it towards

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.969 
at the moment then just bring it towards
this<00:01:53.490> side<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.909> car<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:55.380> if<00:01:55.470> it's<00:01:55.649> braking

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
this side of the car and if it's braking

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.770 
this side of the car and if it's braking
too<00:01:56.130> strong<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.850> want<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.119> loosen<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.689> off

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.420 
too strong and you want to loosen it off
of<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.049> or<00:01:58.170> just<00:01:58.439> adjust<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.070> more<00:01:59.219> how<00:01:59.369> you

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
of it or just adjust it to more how you

of it or just adjust it to more how you
want<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.939> be<00:02:00.090> then<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:01.259> just<00:02:01.409> take<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:01.979> this

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
want it to be then you just take it this

want it to be then you just take it this
way<00:02:02.369> or<00:02:02.549> put<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.210> wherever<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.570> want<00:02:03.719> it

way or put it wherever you want it
really<00:02:04.880> yeah<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.210> that's<00:02:06.659> about<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.899> really

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
really yeah and that's about it really

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.100 
really yeah and that's about it really
and<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:08.580> should<00:02:08.819> hopefully<00:02:09.060> help<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.690> with

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
and that should hopefully help you with

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.220 
and that should hopefully help you with
your<00:02:10.379> brakes<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.370> trying<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.150> adjust<00:02:12.420> them

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
your brakes and trying to adjust them

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.509 
your brakes and trying to adjust them
so<00:02:13.920> yeah<00:02:14.900> also<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:16.290> thought<00:02:16.560> I'd<00:02:16.709> say<00:02:16.950> it's<00:02:17.160> just

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
so yeah also I thought I'd say it's just

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.509 
so yeah also I thought I'd say it's just
a<00:02:17.730> personal<00:02:18.300> thing<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.750> but<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:19.860> don't<00:02:20.400> use

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
a personal thing and but I don't use

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.009 
a personal thing and but I don't use
this<00:02:20.700> car<00:02:20.940> in<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.120> rain<00:02:21.300> I<00:02:21.480> only<00:02:21.629> use<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:21.840> when

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
this car in the rain I only use it when

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.180 
this car in the rain I only use it when
it's<00:02:22.140> dry<00:02:23.030> prolongs<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.180> life<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.660> I<00:02:25.470> just<00:02:26.010> I

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
it's dry prolongs the life and I just I

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.619 
it's dry prolongs the life and I just I
just<00:02:26.459> prefer<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:26.910> really<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.180> mean<00:02:27.300> it's<00:02:27.450> a

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
just prefer it really I mean it's a

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
stick this over the end of the exhaust

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:44.000 
stick this over the end of the exhaust
pipe<00:03:40.700> like<00:03:41.700> that<00:03:42.560> perfect<00:03:43.560> fit<00:03:43.799> for<00:03:43.980> a

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
pipe like that perfect fit for a

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.069 
pipe like that perfect fit for a
standard<00:03:44.400> EB<00:03:44.670> what<00:03:44.850> EB<00:03:45.150> for<00:03:45.389> exhaust<00:03:45.690> pipe<00:03:45.930> as

standard EB what EB for exhaust pipe as

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.530 
standard EB what EB for exhaust pipe as
you<00:03:46.200> can<00:03:46.290> see<00:03:46.470> will<00:03:47.130> not<00:03:47.250> come<00:03:47.459> off<00:03:47.549> and<00:03:48.299> then

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
you can see will not come off and then
