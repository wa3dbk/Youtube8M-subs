00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.049
 Among general ladies and gentlemen I may praise them 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:04.910
 welcome 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.600
 to the video lecture of how that would be to the topic 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.769
 what is holistic dentistry 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.599
 Our focus today is dead teeth, that is, how do dead teeth work 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.339
 on the whole organism 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:20.179
 burdensome dead 10s our health 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.169
 before I discuss this topic in detail I'm brief 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:24.140
 imagine 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.980
 my name is whether dates Wolfgang Koch 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.259
 I am a post-doctoral thesis at the Center for Holistic Dentistry in Herne 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.210
 in beautiful Westphalia 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.380
 Percent life of a professional activity in practice I have myself 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.740
 very intensive with the topic holistic dentistry 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.100
 dealt 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.250
 i am inter alia children international society for 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.900
 holistic dentistry 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.860
 also responsible for the research area, I also have the honor 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.220
 To train students of medical students to also participate in medical students 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.220
 Get information on holistic dentistry 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.820
 Holistic dentistry is very similar to actual ones 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.659
 Medicine also in medicine there are different subject 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.810
 8 STA 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.680
 Just as we have is that means we have different journal Cell 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.930
 seven see my team here 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.130
 among other things see here as for example the Persello personello 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.910
 is our oral surgeon 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.100
 whoever for the 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.470
 Kerr concern posters is responsible 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.990
 "This is not the topic of today's lecture but the topic of another 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.970
 lecture 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.880
 But here you see a specialist who drives with the so-called 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.080
 inner so busy with the dead teeth 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.810
 In addition, we also have children's dentists country flags very early 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.380
 on with holistic dentistry 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.350
 That means we have a tooth-op are a symposium for orthodontics 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.330
 Decade of Wittenberg's double 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.960
 and their two children dentists with the small holistic 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.010
 Dentistry 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.150
 holistic dentistry also has something to do with pain unfortunately and also something 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.450
 with operations 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.410
 Accordingly, we have set up a clinic right near ours 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.260
 center 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.009
 This had Mr. Ronny clinic in Herne 

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:15.009
 Mr. to the clinic is a child for interdisciplinary diagnostics 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.989
 and the farewell 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.489
 what are we doing differently what are we doing differently than the normal tooth has pulling 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.459
 they do not have any to whom they have always trusted 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.209
 and where you should stay, we are the specialist 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.579
 dentists 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:30.999
 what are we doing? 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:34.559
 the basis of our actions is clearly the 

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:39.029
 University Dentistry, that is, we are drilling other dentists as well 

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:41.719
 fillings we make Samper saving boys 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:43.719
 but beyond 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:47.749
 We have two goals and I would like to explain this to him 

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:49.189
 example 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:51.019
 that is very happy 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.799
 Of course, they say that 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.819
 the settlement does not look cheerful 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.019
 that's right what he's doing we're not just looking those cheerful in the 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:58.699
 mouth 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:02.749
 but we also see, for example, that Mr. Cheerful with a backpack 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:05.679
 carries around with visor 

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:09.369
 heavy boulders are the so-called stressful factors 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:13.939
 and the task of holistic dentistry is to find out 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.209
 which has stressful factors 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.269
 Mr. Fröhlich in his backpack that is to diagnose 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:25.179
 there are stressful factors in the mouth and jaw area and we can 

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:29.059
 we eliminate them and when we have eliminated them then they see 

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:32.079
 Herr Fröhlich looks a bit happier too 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.430
 that means he can hop around 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.999
 and of course I am all this goal 

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:39.799
 that means that very happy at all no stressful 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.479
 Factors that have and now really 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:44.879
 lives up to its name 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.369
 what can be stressful factors 

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:50.739
 tooth and mouth area in his 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.069
 I once listed them Assen once the so-called dental Montreal 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.540
 So all you have at Kronenburger so far in our mouth 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.829
 would have 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.899
 the second is the inflammation this is under periodontal disease or w-lan 

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:05.749
 the professionals Parum Title 

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:10.099
 and the dead scene our focus today but also the so-called boots 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.949
 to 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:13.969
 we start with the dead teeth 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:15.279
 they need to know 

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:17.749
 how does a dead number ever arise? 

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:20.750
 I brought him a diagram and here they see him 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.270
 that career is 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.539
 the all too bacterial caused it are bacteria in the numbers 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:27.620
 penetration 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.740
 and here in the tooth cause a corresponding inflammation 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.430
 Here on the right side of Siemer's still very clear here are the bacteria in 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.710
 likes to tame 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.469
 we call the desk couple 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:43.029
 Percent keep destruction of this tooth market, the vessels destroy the nerves 

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.860
 and similar 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.710
 and these bacteria go out of the club so the tooth is not too 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.559
 look at it like a mister 

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:53.830
 but he has gotten out and through this opening against the bacteria 

00:04:53.829 --> 00:04:57.879
 the teeth and then call, for example, in the root apex or at the 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:58.900
 root tip 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.240
 an inflammation that even the Grand Ole Opry will certainly see 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.240
 heard from her dentist 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:07.979
 unpleasant is here 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.349
 that you can consider the numbers inside I like stovepipe summer numbers 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:13.729
 inner 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:16.129
 Franks bent they see that up here 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:19.719
 this percent on this representation that means we have the here 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:21.349
 green 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:24.449
 10 11 10 at heart not exactly here again very clearly 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.980
 the Kom is the whole one here you see the corresponding Grano Lohmann 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.689
 and the break honor is continuing 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:34.749
 and you can see that here in the so-called true anatomy 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.740
 Many small ramifications exist in the area of ​​messenger channels and 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.800
 everywhere in these ramifications 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.800
 sit the appropriate bacteria 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:47.620
 and Swiss before about 18 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.040
 For 15 years one was not able to fully absorb these bacteria 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.180
 To get out toes meant that every dead tsar, even if the messenger 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.810
 filled was always bacteria and bacteria included as before 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.309
 mentioned go out of the tooth 

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:07.099
 and burden the whole organism 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:10.709
 and if they have my lectures about 15 years ago there also the critters still 

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:14.330
 Never seen a counter I kept saying dead teens at chronic 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.330
 Sick patients in stressed patients 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.389
 In any case be removed that was of course a dilemma 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:23.569
 you can imagine 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:26.849
 if, as a young person, you have a dead incisor or a dead one 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:27.819
 Has molar tooth 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:31.389
 and get rid of them because he has kidney problems, for example 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:34.490
 or similar causes then that is of course not so very pleasant that 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:35.870
 Of course, the goal is always 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.250
 for relative easy but the question is yes what comes after it must be bridges 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.639
 made or similar 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:45.069
 there we are today God thanks to others before I explain this Dorian 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:47.169
 First of all the riveting effects 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:51.930
 The one dead numbers have name Kahn and that scientific research 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.710
 here is an API Canepa and Kitas and you have to know the API he can 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:56.809
 there is that with us 

00:06:56.809 --> 00:07:00.090
 Glossary of words for dead tooth that simply put it 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.310
 a dead fan about the risk of occurrence 

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:07.519
 a polar heart disease significantly a Finnish study 

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:10.300
 which has determined 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.289
 that he must have caused diseases through dead teeth 

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:17.590
 this is just an example of a study there are quite a few others 

00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:19.189
 Studies of which we know 

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:22.509
 that even remorse Marten can be caused by dead 10 

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:27.269
 Headache percent managed to change its whole range of disease 

00:07:27.269 --> 00:07:28.660
 possibilities 

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.289
 and accordingly demand the medical profession now 

00:07:32.289 --> 00:07:36.379
 also a chronic applicator brawn tigers so a dead tooth without 

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:37.580
 clinical symptoms 

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:38.569
 this means 

00:07:38.569 --> 00:07:41.469
 Unfortunately, the Alster ten spyhounds are not 

00:07:41.469 --> 00:07:44.930
 that they have a dead fan in their merry what that insidious that 

00:07:44.929 --> 00:07:45.849
 creeping 

00:07:45.849 --> 00:07:49.319
 and accordingly, the doctors demand that a dead fan without synonymous 

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:51.919
 clinical symptoms as well as without hurting 

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:56.039
 should be treated for general medical reasons 

00:07:56.039 --> 00:07:57.770
 that's the reason why 

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:01.600
 many internists many general practitioners meanwhile their patients 

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.810
 Sultan honored send with the pad 

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:04.990
 have a look 

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:06.870
 my patient has death numbers 

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:09.479
 and do something about it 

00:08:09.479 --> 00:08:11.009
 with that the question is the stove
