but it says we have 49 watt hours right
here<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.890> 44<00:01:50.399> milli<00:01:50.640> amps<00:01:51.060> at<00:01:52.009> 11.1<00:01:53.299> bolts

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
here the 44 milli amps at 11.1 bolts

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.080 
here the 44 milli amps at 11.1 bolts
interestingly<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:57.210> says<00:01:57.479> here<00:01:57.719> 4<00:01:58.020> point<00:01:58.350> 2<00:01:58.439> 4

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
so that's why it says squirts then of

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.030 
so that's why it says squirts then of
