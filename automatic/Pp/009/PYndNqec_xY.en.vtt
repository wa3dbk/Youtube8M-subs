00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:08.170
 so the idea 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.170
 lubricate the cable 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.920
 what is the part I don't want to shoot the drum 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.970
 ok pond 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.609
 God fuck me 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.560
 here we start as the doctor keeps cable 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:25.900
 urgently comes to you right 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.800
 rear drum 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.800
 leave to try 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.820
 I want to try to push him away 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.090
 this place 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.490
 and 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.670
 call to liquid 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.330
 mickey like grease 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.670
 for this 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.850
 we lower against the crucible 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.230
 Turn off 3 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.520
 tornan again 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.060
 I already before that 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.060
 maz 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.770
 I'll try a little 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.780
 pull it out 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.789
 its place if you do not have to 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.290
 torn off we need to free up traffic for 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:23.430
 it is necessary to remove the lock 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.430
 in general, the stopper 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.110
 screwdriver 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.110
 we fill 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.470
 take off 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.470
 what he is 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.369
 such a spring 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.000
 how we try 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.000
 treats rose 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.150
 help pliers a little bit he can 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.150
 wrap up 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:59.990
 it is impossible to knock hammer 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.870
 after tapping with milk and 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.830
 loosening started small 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.830
 stirring 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.740
 try to lubricate 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.310
 do not continue 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.950
 our games 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.950
 but 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.020
 it turned out to be faster to remove the drum therefore 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.100
 we want you doing now unscrewed 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.700
 jersey 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.670
 here I will shoot the drum drum 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:42.970
 starred effortlessly 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:47.030
 a little bit of everything rubbed so look 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:52.470
 how it all worked and we move 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:55.230
 here around the calculated axes grandfather 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.620
 who keeps him not clear idea 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.120
 is that you do not move 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.629
 spring 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.490
 and upload there by mask and then once 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.330
 walk 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.330
 that's what we'll do 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:39.130
 The problem was solved in another way. 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.940
 thermal protection 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.220
 resonator 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.520
 she kept such here 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.340
 and newbies 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.280
 here it is actually filmed and had to 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.200
 bend a little 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:59.020
 so she twisted 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.020
 around this resonator 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.500
 under the resonator 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.690
 located 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.000
 just the whole mechanism he was under 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.310
 his defense was not visible 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.580
 scary here these tracks are 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.580
 are visible
