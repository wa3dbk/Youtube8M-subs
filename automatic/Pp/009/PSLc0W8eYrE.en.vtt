00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.230
 dvd review and the attentive viewer 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.389
 I realize that lately I am a little girl 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.099
 I have little inferior to the treasure 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.090
 currently just enjoy it 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.969
 that's why it just does not go on 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.170
 with the next monster high review of 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.970
 in fact partly already in the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.039
 cinema is almost up in the cinema starts almost 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.320
 simultaneously blu ray and dvd release tag 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.930
 all a huge confusing 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.930
 obama, that's about it now 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.350
 Fri. 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.200
 Magna is 86 minutes from 16 years 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.510
 released comes on cut on blu ray and 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.640
 dvd like to be in 3d versions therefore 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.320
 It would be nice to do it 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.880
 somehow it already works 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.470
 the small cinemas in germany starts 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.479
 actually on 7 november in the cinemas 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.009
 But it will be such a day from 8 november 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.950
 later on dvd and blu-ray 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.909
 sold and that's a weird one 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.830
 strategies to go public 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.810
 But what should the story tell 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.479
 from one and that is in this trasch 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.210
 Dinosaur actually completely sausage tornado 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.860
 that pulls over the Atlantic or over 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.390
 the open sea ​​attracts passive I can 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.390
 I am not sure about that, but I am 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.370
 a whole lot of greedy sharks sucks 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.060
 Thousands of people in this tornado 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.560
 move 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.330
 the is still offers itself in several 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.980
 tornadoes and then moves direction country 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.450
 and then nobody is sure who 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.850
 not afraid of tornadoes 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.560
 should be afraid of tornadoes with home in it 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.670
 they are very greedy and eat 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.100
 also like people directly from 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.569
 helicopter away because that's what you can say 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.370
 also in a helicopter in a dream 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.870
 fly there to drop bombs with it 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.140
 you shattered all the sharks there just like that 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.970
 tornado destroys yes that 's the new one 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.070
 but I think it definitely 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.450
 Trashy and funny exactly what they need 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.739
 it 's the hard part on its core 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.120
 story of a bar owner of 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.799
 in addition then also his child 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.840
 wants to save and his wife and everyone 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.910
 pull across los angeles as well as from 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.790
 The tornadoes would be happy then 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.170
 a kind of home ronaldo ghostbusters 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.750
 totally where the markets are totally 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.310
 It is absurd, but that is a pity 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.590
 around German after the wonderful addition 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.120
 enough said is what you need 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.920
 if you have fun we are with buddy 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.450
 with friends with friends wants to 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.310
 Want to know how to correctly recognize 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.470
 bad movie tell me you have with 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.510
 checkmate and then you say okay I am 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.070
 We did it for 86 minutes 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.390
 a lot of nonsense and you have to 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.980
 also say during the last tranche 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.200
 with this direction about not 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.120
 he said the talk was 13 minutes 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.549
 has credits and makes the château whole 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.920
 cool behind 30 seconds credits 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.930
 The loans are almost the same 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.850
 screen as if it does not matter who 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.350
 there has been playing though even a like 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.450
 tara reid is there before 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.920
 reasonably well known and also by 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.239
 your appeal somehow very 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.130
 popular now already a little 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.390
 Little sold out but it is funny 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.940
 To see her the movie is just 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.430
 absurdly stupid but is partly with 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.989
 the camera setting 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.430
 the good hd therefore comes you have to completely 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.819
 be honest almost a little more 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.900
 effort 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.159
 that was why for me in the 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.480
 Appreciation after also more points 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:52.719
 as he gets for example jurassic 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.519
 park or shampoos and thats me too 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:57.010
 still cool is that for all träsch 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.409
 Fans on the blu ray at wednesday on the 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.379
 dvd actually also to head start 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.840
 as a bonus film on it is and that is 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:06.489
 unfamiliar and cool as I am supposed to 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.909
 To film is just the hammer all know 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.530
 decision 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.150
 which comes from this direction what this 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.680
 Production company like with this movie 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.549
 be created so did not see 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.750
 like to see 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.189
 I have that in the weekend in the 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.840
 raffle in there and on the point 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:18.459
 come it is absurd that is abstruse it 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.590
 is trash and sharks are not even too 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.940
 a thousandth as bad as they are in 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.380
 it will be shown to all these films 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.539
 but also shit is a little bit 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.759
 more naked skin would have done well 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.830
 but what should be very predictable before 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:32.289
 until the stop this film is moving 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.940
 like crazy and gets trash from me 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:36.280
 movie as a trash movie really fun 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.620
 makes 8 out of 10 possible points for that 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.570
 is also the genre rating as a whole 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.889
 because he comes along with proper hd 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.500
 and because he is not technically bad 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.180
 still a strong one and a half 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.400
 out of 10 possible points and you see 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.750
 I have fun with these reviews 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.889
 this job and therefore would like more often 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.479
 maybe even do the week once 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.919
 what do you say about that? 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:57.970
 the comments and that was it now 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:59.830
 said to be strong enough with my review 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.030
 as I said from november I link you 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.060
 the movie as always the infobox 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.430
 home cinema releases and yes who my revier 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.960
 mothballed like to leave a thumb there'll 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.490
 It does not leave you that way 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.139
 do not care 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.280
 Looks like last time movie reviews 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:13.810
 over or on twitter and facebook 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.520
 to write about other films 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.830
 Wanted to be this or my second 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.330
 channel if no videos from and with me 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.699
 Let's miss it if 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.440
 but only you decide tomorrow 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:26.020
 at 15 o'clock there are one later 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:31.229
 new video and by then I hope you are 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.229
