00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.010
 Argentina has all the conditions for the generation of bioenergies in 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.290
 all its forms from crops and agricultural and livestock residues and agro 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.770
 industrial sectors, becoming one of the main producers of 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.770
 biofuels 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:29.359
 against the diversification of energy sources together with a 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.239
 growing contemplation of the environmental effects that they bring about 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.239
 integral use of biomass the inta intervenes through its 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.940
 national bioenergy program 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.840
 within the framework of this program the waste and waste project is developed 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.220
 agricultural crops for the production of biofuels p ng 1400 11 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.100
 with the purpose of studying and optimizing the integral use of 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.100
 biomass for energy purposes 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.840
 as part of that project in the experimental station of manfredi it 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.680
 developed the sorghum module for bioenergy with the participation of 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.640
 other Inca units 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.880
 you can get ethanol from your group from the white grain starch or 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.560
 red without condensed tannins or from the case of the case in the latter 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.950
 case with a technology similar to obtaining ethanol from the 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.620
 sugar cane 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.120
 Obtaining bioethanol from these easily convertible sugars 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.070
 it's known as biofuels first-generation technologies 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.870
 can also be obtained from the cellulosic biomass cellulosic pollen of sorghum 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:09.639
 or anything ubeda sugary sorghum for the production of ethanol 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:16.829
 in that of that therefore of the grain starch as of the whole plant with 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.829
 This type of stem that allocate more than 70 tons 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:25.450
 70 100 tons free workshop per heat detailed leaf clean per hectare 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.179
 with high concentration of sugar more than 18 degrees brito 

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:33.239
 in this way similar to sugarcane 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:40.449
 we can have in ethanol and at this moment in the new world scenario 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:45.559
 of the use of fuel employment of heresy pinion this material is 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:51.319
 constitute an important alternative and what is already 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.819
 a comment of the origin experimentation in the designs 

00:03:55.529 --> 00:03:59.649
 our origin in the noa and also the north of that context to 

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:06.329
 complemented sugarcane after the harvest today immediately Antilles 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.590
 both for energy day and for obtaining bioethanol 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.200
 meanwhile manual 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.739
 the stick orders for sugary sorghum farizano 

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:20.539
 on going 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:24.129
 with the male line of ourense this category 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:29.689
 you have about that company hitwise to get an easy money to offer 

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:43.029
 and so the politicization of the matter is made 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:47.889
 the inta manfredi 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.719
 In addition to the development of lines, sorghum hybrids are created and 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:56.479
 fierce and sugary with special agro-industrial characteristics for vigo 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:57.749
 Energy 

00:05:57.749 --> 00:06:02.189
 materials with drought resistance are evaluated and selected in trials 

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:04.860
 made in different locations 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:05.889
 Likewise 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.960
 The response is studied and evaluated by sugar-coated sorghums 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.339
 different environments 

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:15.580
 seeking the optimization of the crop and the ecological regions of greater 

00:06:15.579 --> 00:06:18.549
 adaptation and potential possibilities of it
