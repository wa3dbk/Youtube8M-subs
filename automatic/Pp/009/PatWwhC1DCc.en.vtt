perfectly<00:02:00.210> with<00:02:00.960> badali<00:02:01.409> even<00:02:01.890> if<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.070> have<00:02:02.159> a

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189

perfectly with badali even if you have a
beside<00:02:02.460> your<00:02:02.610> TV<00:02:02.969> or<00:02:03.149> in<00:02:03.270> time

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
beside your TV or in time

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.310 
beside your TV or in time
listen<00:02:04.000> to<00:02:04.090> this<00:02:04.210> particular<00:02:04.810> one<00:02:05.080> is<00:02:05.290> a

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
listen to this particular one is a

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.590 
listen to this particular one is a
terabyte<00:02:05.890> which<00:02:06.160> is<00:02:06.310> huge<00:02:06.670> for<00:02:06.790> thousands<00:02:07.420> and

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
terabyte which is huge for thousands and

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.530 
terabyte which is huge for thousands and
thousand<00:02:07.990> gigs<00:02:08.229> so<00:02:08.890> it's<00:02:09.010> gonna<00:02:09.130> start<00:02:09.540> low

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
thousand gigs so it's gonna start low

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.270 
thousand gigs so it's gonna start low
distortion<00:02:10.960> you<00:02:11.260> can<00:02:11.380> actually<00:02:11.500> do<00:02:11.740> the<00:02:11.800> USB

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
distortion you can actually do the USB

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.370 
distortion you can actually do the USB
on<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.520> front<00:02:12.730> so<00:02:12.880> if<00:02:13.090> one<00:02:13.660> terabyte<00:02:14.050> isn't

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
on the front so if one terabyte isn't

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.930 
on the front so if one terabyte isn't
big<00:02:14.500> enough<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:15.160> can<00:02:15.310> add<00:02:15.400> another<00:02:15.640> hard

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
big enough you can add another hard

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.180 
big enough you can add another hard
drive<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.390> make<00:02:16.720> it<00:02:16.870> bigger<00:02:17.050> well<00:02:17.590> right<00:02:17.830> and

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
drive and make it bigger well right and

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.770 
drive and make it bigger well right and
you<00:02:18.340> can<00:02:18.460> also<00:02:18.580> backup<00:02:18.910> all<00:02:19.210> your<00:02:19.240> work<00:02:19.540> file

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
you can also backup all your work file

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.960 
you can also backup all your work file
so<00:02:19.990> you<00:02:20.020> have<00:02:20.200> security<00:02:20.830> then<00:02:21.010> as<00:02:21.160> well<00:02:21.310> so<00:02:21.640> k

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
so you have security then as well so k

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.210 
so you have security then as well so k
which<00:02:22.240> is<00:02:22.270> very<00:02:22.720> very<00:02:22.810> important<00:02:23.500> you<00:02:23.650> know<00:02:23.800> so

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
which is very very important you know so

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.070 
which is very very important you know so
it<00:02:24.340> is<00:02:24.370> it<00:02:24.700> is<00:02:24.820> great<00:02:25.030> no<00:02:25.150> so<00:02:25.330> not<00:02:25.480> only<00:02:25.660> only
