00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
only and fold it straight up about like

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:18.180 
only and fold it straight up about like
that<00:03:16.019> so<00:03:17.019> that's<00:03:17.290> how<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:17.530> model<00:03:17.950> should<00:03:18.130> look

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
that so that's how the model should look

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.190 
that so that's how the model should look
right<00:03:18.430> now<00:03:18.670> now<00:03:19.239> fold<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.630> whole<00:03:19.750> model<00:03:20.080> in

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
right now now fold the whole model in

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:27.780 
right now now fold the whole model in
half<00:03:20.350> from<00:03:20.769> this<00:03:21.010> side<00:03:21.250> over<00:03:21.580> to<00:03:21.670> here<00:03:26.790> little

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
half from this side over to here little

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:36.479 
half from this side over to here little
bit<00:03:27.910> tricky<00:03:28.269> might<00:03:28.630> pick<00:03:28.870> it<00:03:28.959> up<00:03:29.080> there<00:03:35.489> just

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
bit tricky might pick it up there just

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.180 
bit tricky might pick it up there just
like<00:03:36.640> that<00:03:36.700> now<00:03:37.230> makes<00:03:38.230> a<00:03:38.350> lot<00:03:38.500> of<00:03:38.530> sense<00:03:38.890> if<00:03:39.070> we

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
like that now makes a lot of sense if we

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.410 
like that now makes a lot of sense if we
just<00:03:39.400> swivel<00:03:39.910> the<00:03:40.120> model<00:03:40.390> around<00:03:40.720> a<00:03:40.870> bit<00:03:41.019> now

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
just swivel the model around a bit now

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.479 
just swivel the model around a bit now
this<00:03:43.420> section<00:03:43.900> here<00:03:44.260> is<00:03:44.440> going<00:03:44.860> to<00:03:44.980> form<00:03:45.250> one

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
this section here is going to form one

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.220 
this section here is going to form one
of<00:03:45.519> the<00:03:45.640> wings<00:03:45.910> what<00:03:46.510> I<00:03:46.540> want<00:03:46.810> you<00:03:46.870> to<00:03:46.930> do<00:03:47.110> is

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
of the wings what I want you to do is

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.140 
of the wings what I want you to do is
fold<00:03:47.440> it<00:03:47.590> straight<00:03:47.680> back<00:03:48.100> up<00:03:48.370> in<00:03:48.820> this

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
fold it straight back up in this

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.530 
fold it straight back up in this
direction<00:03:50.190> like<00:03:51.190> that<00:03:51.489> so<00:03:51.910> it<00:03:52.060> sort<00:03:52.269> of<00:03:52.329> sticks

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
direction like that so it sort of sticks

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.830 
direction like that so it sort of sticks
up<00:03:52.780> a<00:03:52.900> little<00:03:53.049> bit<00:03:54.000> now<00:03:55.000> turn<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.360> model<00:03:55.480> over

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
up a little bit now turn the model over

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.110 
up a little bit now turn the model over
and<00:03:57.870> do<00:03:58.870> exactly<00:03:59.170> the<00:03:59.470> same<00:03:59.500> thing<00:04:00.010> on<00:04:00.220> this

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
and do exactly the same thing on this

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.729 
and do exactly the same thing on this
section<00:04:01.360> here<00:04:01.510> folding<00:04:02.110> it<00:04:02.230> up<00:04:02.320> to<00:04:02.470> meet<00:04:02.620> the

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
section here folding it up to meet the

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:10.910 
section here folding it up to meet the
fold<00:04:03.010> you<00:04:03.280> just<00:04:03.370> made

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.969 

starts<00:04:11.920> to<00:04:12.010> look<00:04:12.130> like<00:04:12.160> wings<00:04:12.519> already<00:04:13.650> okay

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:22.770 

we'll<00:04:17.979> flip<00:04:18.280> it<00:04:18.400> over<00:04:21.360> now<00:04:22.360> we're<00:04:22.539> going<00:04:22.690> to

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
we'll flip it over now we're going to

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.370 
we'll flip it over now we're going to
make<00:04:23.050> the<00:04:23.530> neck<00:04:23.710> and<00:04:23.919> the<00:04:24.430> head<00:04:25.020> so<00:04:26.020> I<00:04:26.050> want<00:04:26.289> you

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
make the neck and the head so I want you

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.170 
make the neck and the head so I want you
to<00:04:26.410> put<00:04:26.620> your<00:04:26.740> thumb<00:04:27.010> in<00:04:27.250> this<00:04:27.400> section<00:04:27.700> very

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
to put your thumb in this section very

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.500 
to put your thumb in this section very
carefully<00:04:28.720> underneath<00:04:29.729> same<00:04:30.729> time<00:04:31.030> pressing

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
carefully underneath same time pressing

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.050 
carefully underneath same time pressing
down<00:04:31.690> on<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:31.930> top<00:04:32.520> holding<00:04:33.520> near<00:04:33.729> the<00:04:33.850> wings

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
down on the top holding near the wings

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.540 
down on the top holding near the wings
and<00:04:34.740> folding<00:04:35.740> that<00:04:35.860> down<00:04:36.690> inside<00:04:37.690> itself<00:04:38.550> once

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
and folding that down inside itself once

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.159 
and folding that down inside itself once
it<00:04:39.729> gets<00:04:39.910> to<00:04:40.090> there<00:04:40.270> squashing<00:04:41.050> it<00:04:41.110> flat<00:04:42.990> so<00:04:43.990> it

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
it gets to there squashing it flat so it

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.750 
it gets to there squashing it flat so it
should<00:04:44.380> look<00:04:44.410> like<00:04:44.620> that<00:04:45.010> on<00:04:45.280> both<00:04:45.780> sides<00:04:47.760> do

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
should look like that on both sides do

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.790 
should look like that on both sides do
exactly<00:04:49.210> the<00:04:49.390> same<00:04:49.419> thing<00:04:49.840> again<00:04:50.200> except

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
exactly the same thing again except

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.930 
exactly the same thing again except
bringing<00:04:51.130> this<00:04:51.280> section<00:04:51.669> here<00:04:51.970> straight<00:04:52.570> up

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
bringing this section here straight up

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.830 
bringing this section here straight up
open<00:04:54.940> it<00:04:55.030> up<00:04:55.120> a<00:04:55.270> little<00:04:55.450> bit

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
open it up a little bit

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:03.779 
open it up a little bit
fold<00:04:56.260> it<00:04:56.410> straight<00:04:56.530> up<00:04:56.710> and<00:04:57.720> close<00:04:58.720> it<00:05:02.789> that's

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789 
fold it straight up and close it that's

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:06.120 
fold it straight up and close it that's
made<00:05:04.060> the<00:05:04.210> neck<00:05:04.419> now<00:05:05.080> to<00:05:05.140> make<00:05:05.470> the<00:05:05.620> head<00:05:05.830> do

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
made the neck now to make the head do

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.680 
made the neck now to make the head do
exactly<00:05:06.460> the<00:05:06.610> same<00:05:06.640> thing<00:05:07.060> right<00:05:07.240> at<00:05:07.390> the<00:05:07.479> tip

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
exactly the same thing right at the tip

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.800 
exactly the same thing right at the tip
so<00:05:08.349> we<00:05:08.530> open<00:05:08.860> that<00:05:08.890> up<00:05:09.039> very<00:05:09.370> carefully<00:05:09.810> push

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
so we open that up very carefully push

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.409 
so we open that up very carefully push
the<00:05:10.960> head<00:05:11.110> section<00:05:11.380> down<00:05:11.830> and<00:05:12.220> just<00:05:12.970> pinch<00:05:13.240> it

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
the head section down and just pinch it

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:16.830 
the head section down and just pinch it
shut<00:05:14.460> gives<00:05:15.460> us<00:05:15.640> a<00:05:15.729> sort<00:05:15.880> of<00:05:16.000> a<00:05:16.120> bird<00:05:16.450> looking

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
shut gives us a sort of a bird looking

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.320 
shut gives us a sort of a bird looking
head<00:05:17.050> let's<00:05:17.560> tuck<00:05:17.890> the<00:05:18.220> tip<00:05:18.430> of<00:05:18.580> the<00:05:18.669> nose<00:05:18.849> back

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
head let's tuck the tip of the nose back

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.500 
head let's tuck the tip of the nose back
in<00:05:19.890> opening<00:05:20.890> that<00:05:20.919> up<00:05:21.070> tucking<00:05:21.669> the<00:05:21.940> nose<00:05:22.120> in

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
in opening that up tucking the nose in

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.710 
in opening that up tucking the nose in
and<00:05:23.190> squashing<00:05:24.190> it<00:05:24.280> flat<00:05:24.550> looks<00:05:25.300> more<00:05:25.539> like<00:05:25.690> a

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
and squashing it flat looks more like a

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.969 
and squashing it flat looks more like a
dinosaur<00:05:26.440> or<00:05:26.470> a<00:05:26.710> dragon<00:05:27.130> I<00:05:27.220> think<00:05:28.680> all<00:05:29.680> right

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
dinosaur or a dragon I think all right

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.670 
dinosaur or a dragon I think all right
now<00:05:30.250> we're<00:05:30.370> going<00:05:30.490> to<00:05:30.580> make<00:05:31.050> the<00:05:32.050> tail<00:05:32.320> and<00:05:32.590> the

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
now we're going to make the tail and the

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.620 
now we're going to make the tail and the
back<00:05:32.830> legs<00:05:35.190> flip<00:05:36.190> the<00:05:36.340> model<00:05:36.520> around<00:05:36.729> might<00:05:37.390> be

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
back legs flip the model around might be

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.149 
back legs flip the model around might be
easier<00:05:37.840> if<00:05:37.930> you<00:05:38.020> don't<00:05:38.229> but<00:05:38.440> I<00:05:38.500> prefer<00:05:38.950> it<00:05:39.130> that

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:39.159 
easier if you don't but I prefer it that

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.980 
easier if you don't but I prefer it that
way

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
way

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.310 
way
now<00:05:40.990> open<00:05:41.169> up<00:05:41.380> the<00:05:41.440> bottom<00:05:42.370> section<00:05:42.760> here<00:05:42.789> and

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
now open up the bottom section here and

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.250 
now open up the bottom section here and
fold<00:05:44.320> this<00:05:44.530> whole<00:05:44.740> section<00:05:45.099> across<00:05:45.460> this<00:05:45.820> way

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
fold this whole section across this way

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.589 
fold this whole section across this way
inside<00:05:47.260> itself<00:05:47.650> and<00:05:47.950> underneath<00:05:48.370> I'll<00:05:49.060> show

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:49.599 
inside itself and underneath I'll show

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.320 
inside itself and underneath I'll show
you<00:05:49.659> what<00:05:49.840> I<00:05:49.870> mean

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
you what I mean

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.880 
you what I mean
fold<00:05:52.330> it<00:05:52.510> across<00:05:52.780> like<00:05:52.840> that<00:05:55.380> to<00:05:56.380> about<00:05:56.650> there

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890 
fold it across like that to about there

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.680 
fold it across like that to about there
I<00:05:56.919> guess<00:05:57.250> and<00:05:58.349> squashing<00:05:59.349> it<00:06:00.539> should<00:06:01.539> look

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
I guess and squashing it should look

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.779 
I guess and squashing it should look
exactly<00:06:01.870> the<00:06:02.229> same<00:06:02.349> on<00:06:02.740> both<00:06:02.770> sides<00:06:05.580> one<00:06:06.580> more

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:06.789 
exactly the same on both sides one more

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:09.260 
exactly the same on both sides one more
time

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.290 

just<00:06:10.080> pass<00:06:10.320> the<00:06:10.590> wings<00:06:10.770> here<00:06:11.220> opening<00:06:11.970> up<00:06:12.120> the

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
just pass the wings here opening up the

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.000 
just pass the wings here opening up the
bottom<00:06:12.660> section<00:06:13.050> and<00:06:13.140> following<00:06:13.650> it<00:06:13.740> ride

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.010 
bottom section and following it ride

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:18.170 
bottom section and following it ride
across<00:06:14.310> and<00:06:14.730> then<00:06:15.060> shutting<00:06:16.880> now<00:06:17.880> we're<00:06:18.030> going

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
across and then shutting now we're going

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.480 
across and then shutting now we're going
to<00:06:18.300> fold<00:06:18.450> this<00:06:18.630> back<00:06:18.840> again<00:06:19.080> in<00:06:19.620> exactly<00:06:20.010> the

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
to fold this back again in exactly the

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.450 
to fold this back again in exactly the
same<00:06:20.670> way<00:06:20.850> so<00:06:20.880> opening<00:06:21.630> it<00:06:21.720> up<00:06:22.370> folding<00:06:23.370> it

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
same way so opening it up folding it

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:31.480 
same way so opening it up folding it
back<00:06:23.700> and<00:06:25.580> then<00:06:27.830> shutting<00:06:28.830> that<00:06:29.010> there<00:06:29.400> and

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490 
back and then shutting that there and

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.680 
back and then shutting that there and
that's<00:06:32.490> how<00:06:32.640> your<00:06:32.820> model<00:06:33.090> should<00:06:33.240> look<00:06:33.300> at<00:06:33.600> the

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690 
that's how your model should look at the

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.530 
that's how your model should look at the
moment<00:06:34.050> now<00:06:34.860> let's<00:06:35.160> make<00:06:35.370> the<00:06:35.580> hind<00:06:35.820> legs<00:06:36.210> the

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:36.540 
moment now let's make the hind legs the

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.380 
moment now let's make the hind legs the
sort<00:06:36.750> of<00:06:36.810> the<00:06:36.990> curve<00:06:37.230> of<00:06:37.470> the<00:06:37.560> hind<00:06:37.740> legs<00:06:37.950> here

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:38.390 
sort of the curve of the hind legs here
