00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.080
Hi youtube friends, speaks Kocers,
this time to give you some tips

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.260
to keep your computer fast.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.060
Who would not happened? , To buy a
computer with the sweat of your brow and after

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.890
a year, open a simple word is torture.
The misuse we give computers

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.820
just for passing the bill later.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.579
then I will give some tips to avoid
These problems

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.610
First speak to the virus, they are the
principal must control because

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.960
they cause slow computer, prioritizes
use a good anti-virus (several are free)

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.710
but the best anti-virus is yourself, bone
just try to click on links that you know,

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.950
and prioritizes be careful with your email.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.060
Second speak about the system log,
is where the operating system stores

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.960
what you've cast, I'll explain as being
histories you've done, as

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.579
install or uninstall a program, then
a long time our computer is filled

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:11.579
of these registers and cause slowness, 
I recommend the registry cleaner "CCleaner".

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:22.039
So an example would be entering the Ccleaner,

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:29.039
click register and then click on scan for issues,

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:36.639
wait for it to load to 100%, will
to detect all the problems we have,

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:38.909
and select fix selected issues, that would
all we have to do,

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:51.909
can also delete all temporary files, click
to analyze, wait for it to finish,

00:01:51.909 --> 00:02:00.359
then give click on run cleaner, and that would be all
to optimize your computer.

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:08.649
Third, start on your computer, I mean the
programs that start right there turn on your computer,

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.459
is a tip for people who
have some skill in systems

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.030
because you could cause worse problems than
your computer slow.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:31.879
So what is open msconfig.exe, we see
five tabs and click on the fourth tab (windows start)

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:39.879
ok now see the lines and
all you should do is read

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.099
what you think you should not run 
when turning on your computer and deselect it,

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.129
when you're done to deselect everything
you think you should not run to catch

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.379
your computer click accept or apply, 
in my case click accept because I don't want

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:57.950
modify  any And with that we would 
try to optimize the speed

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.140
of your computer when to turn on and give
a use.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.140
Fourth, we must care for our hard drive 
because there are stores all the information,

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:13.549
imagine a messy room in which we try to find something, 
it will be difficult 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:20.390
to find what we seek, then what we do is this, 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:27.390
defragment the disk, that would be a kind of synonym
for what would sort the room.

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:34.769
So what we will do is write
defragmenter if you have windows 7 and appears

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.260
this window, otherwise you had
another system click Start / computer,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:50.260
right click on your hard drive, select properties
and select Tools and click on this button

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:57.459
and opens the same window
Now in my case comes 0%, because I just did recently

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.999
then in this case they
will come out a different percentage of the time

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:08.379
to select "Analyze Disk",  when selecting "Analyze Disk" will start looking up

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:15.379
the mess that has, just waiting for
reaches 100%, as you can see just as continuous

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.310
at 0% because I had already done this before,
when you observe a percentage other

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.580
than 0, after putting "Analyze Disk" is
just click on "disk defrag"

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:35.580
load a single time and then you must wait
click to close, with it will have already ordered

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:42.860
the information you have in your hard drive.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.980
As a fifth advice would tell you have
your desktop as clean as possible, since

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:56.100
any program that is on the desktop
will start when turning on the computer,

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.810
then as my desktop observed this
I have totally clean just have a folder,

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:06.810
least have the programs affecting performance
graphic on the desktop, these programs

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:12.630
make the boot graphics card
when you turn on your computer and that originates

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:18.760
much more time to turn on the computer,
then a tip is not to have programs

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:24.790
on the desktop, oh and by the way shortcuts 
do not matter because they are only 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:31.790
arrival routes and no other programs running
nothing, then no matter how many shortcuts 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.400
you have this will not affect the
speed-power on your computer.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.630
My sixth advice would be,  well,
a little better budget buy RAM,

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:49.270
RAM always will determine the
speed up your computer.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:55.180
Well I hope you liked the video

I leave you with this and until next time see ya!.
