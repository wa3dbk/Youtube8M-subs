00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
yeah it was a good feeling you know just

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.190 
yeah it was a good feeling you know just
amongst<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.309> boys<00:00:08.519> like<00:00:08.880> we<00:00:09.540> knew<00:00:09.660> we<00:00:09.750> got<00:00:10.050> to

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
amongst the boys like we knew we got to

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.560 
amongst the boys like we knew we got to
go<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.380> their<00:00:10.590> place<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:10.860> sort<00:00:11.550> of<00:00:11.730> get<00:00:12.540> a

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
go to their place and sort of get a

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.990 
go to their place and sort of get a
decent<00:00:12.990> result<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.469> we<00:00:13.650> think<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:13.920> we<00:00:14.549> maybe

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
decent result and we think that we maybe

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.099 
decent result and we think that we maybe
we<00:00:15.150> could<00:00:15.299> have<00:00:15.389> won<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.660> game<00:00:15.839> but<00:00:15.960> at<00:00:16.049> the

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
we could have won the game but at the

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.750 
we could have won the game but at the
same<00:00:16.230> time<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.619> know<00:00:16.710> draw<00:00:16.949> was<00:00:17.160> was<00:00:17.460> enough

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
same time you know draw was was enough

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.609 
same time you know draw was was enough
but<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.510> know<00:00:18.600> we<00:00:18.720> come<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.080> Carroll<00:00:19.350> Road<00:00:19.470> we

do<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.819> game<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.239> so<00:02:12.480> it's<00:02:12.629> just<00:02:12.690> going<00:02:12.870> to

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930

do in the game so so it's just going to
be

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
be

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.900 
be
to<00:02:13.560> be<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.710> normal<00:02:13.980> routine<00:02:14.250> but<00:02:14.460> I<00:02:14.520> think<00:02:14.730> that

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
to be a normal routine but I think that

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.700 
to be a normal routine but I think that
they'll<00:02:15.570> have<00:02:15.660> that<00:02:15.780> extra<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.350> did<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.620> little

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
they'll have that extra I did a little

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.840 
they'll have that extra I did a little
bit<00:02:16.860> of<00:02:16.950> spice<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.310> know<00:02:17.340> because<00:02:17.610> we<00:02:17.730> know
