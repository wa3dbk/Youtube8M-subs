 video this time a tutorial to the team 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.300
 bot that is a minecraft mod and yes the 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.900
 you probably know from others 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.130
 For example, once had last in it 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.170
 and yes, I'll get you guys first 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.660
 show how to install and after 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.910
 then all the functions though it only 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.710
 there is one every case now goes first 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.600
 on download always a meet two 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.099
 or if it already is one 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.220
 another version of minecraft then gives 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.949
 as one stands then here the newest 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.180
 version 1.4 for example on the topic there 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.450
 then you just go on advertising 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.770
 skip on meat you go 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.870
 Just skip to advertising and 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.850
 Take then have it downloaded already 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:48.329
 It was like timber and then at 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.420
 model or scroll down to her 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.180
 this spot comes modder 13.2 and here 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.640
 Then all the providers I would 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.420
 So it would be me at f2 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.910
 download 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.710
 I also did it and then 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.000
 please wait five seconds four 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.200
 three two one and zero so and then 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.020
 Yes, yes, press here again on advertising 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.310
 skip and then click 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.140
 Skip advertising and then you have 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.390
 even if you did that 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.810
 you have these two files and 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.520
 then percentages also go from tata percent 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.830
 ap dpa 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.810
 and then go to the point team 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.950
 folder in the bendler and the microprof 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.060
 ne animal with windows r archivar that can 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.310
 you were going to take you everywhere 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.049
 For my part it could be on the internet 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.119
 google search youtube actually finds 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.250
 always what the most important is of course 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.200
 Feet in this folder because of the 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.210
 prevents mods from being installed 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.700
 can therefore simply wrestle away 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.590
 year i want so when we get the folder 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.490
 deleted so then start now 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.060
 with in the boat 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.009
 here that is here so the read me is only 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.409
 one is there will only stop the 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.329
 installation, so to speak, and explained 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.700
 That's why we only take these two 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.520
 files that we advised let us in there and 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.200
 Pull all here so okay the 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.539
 can we then close this one here 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.940
 and then the model or actually 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.349
 the same 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.050
 simple control a or hold everything 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.810
 mark and then stop here too 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.300
 move in okay and then we have that 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.340
 actually already installed one 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.200
 close and then go up now 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:31.650
 the minecraft exe we start minecraft 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:33.540
 lure us a walking in the single player 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.890
 I have already prepared a world like that 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.209
 and now I'll show you something of this 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.130
 mod by and large I can 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.830
 now just a game mode then 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.239
 I'll take it fast because yes 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.370
 okay I take now first two ex 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.470
 give me a quick look, yes, just do it 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.730
 short game mode from game mode 0 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:59.400
 so now I show you that of the 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.340
 carpenter here if for example 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.170
 here the lowest blog of a tree 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.360
 then the whole tree falls from the wood 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.030
 together or you can, of course 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.370
 here the second block and then stops 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.620
 all together except for the one on the 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.450
 Of course, the lowest is also possible 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.549
 a diamond ax that goes with every ax 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.250
 but if you do it with your fist the 200th 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.109
 because of or with wood we do 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.510
 not at the bottom now 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:26.970
 to confuse or so it works 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.209
 namely not because it is only with the 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.750
 narrowest of fear so it goes holstein 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.620
 Ax Goldack traveling ax and diamond ax 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.780
 I think I have everything now 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.910
 enumerated 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.190
 yes that's exactly the mod if you eg 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.140
 inlays just need wood again and 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.440
 not feel like you have everything individually 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.780
 then you can dismantle the mod 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.400
 successful or actually always that 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.600
 which is actually very useful mod 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.280
 I do not know if I'll go in there too 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.000
 I should take that 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.100
 still superior 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.040
 Definitely very useful this mod 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:03.319
 and I think that's really cool 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:07.319
 partly because I already have the 64th 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:09.720
 wood had achieved that and that was it 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.609
 actually already from the motto that 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.019
 it's kinda good that's what 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.850
 actually already before the murder have 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:18.090
 I once showed him for the big picture 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.890
 oh yes fix is â€‹â€‹for example if the 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.959
 black screen should have then 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.210
 you just point minecraft 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.430
 of course, the self and everything 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.699
 just delete it again and exit 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:33.120
 then again a new point minecraft 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:35.729
 Create and then stop again the 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.229
 here the whole place again 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.759
 then install it should not he 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:42.360
 Should it work otherwise you will do so many times 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:44.280
 until it works or if you fps if 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.810
 your fps should go strong in the cellar 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.930
 by doing this murder simply takes yours 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.160
 texture pack out or and unscrew the 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.539
 Graphics settings just a bit 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.819
 then the whole thing should be down 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.410
 compensate again so that 's it 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:57.300
 actually big by and large 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.690
 from j and at this point I say then 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.690
 bye
