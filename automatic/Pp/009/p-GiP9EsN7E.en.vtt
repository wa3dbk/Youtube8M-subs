oh why am i crops not growing healthy
whereas<00:00:07.550> Ramos<00:00:08.550> crops<00:00:08.910> are<00:00:09.090> growing<00:00:09.330> so

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
whereas Ramos crops are growing so

let<00:00:11.670> me<00:00:11.849> check<00:00:12.059> what<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.840> he<00:00:12.990> doing<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.410> get

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
let me check what is he doing to get

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.320 
let me check what is he doing to get
better<00:00:13.889> yield<00:00:15.529> mmm<00:00:16.529> he's<00:00:17.279> adding<00:00:17.760> manures<00:00:18.180> and

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
better yield mmm he's adding manures and

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.590 
better yield mmm he's adding manures and
fertilizers<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.380> his<00:00:19.500> crops

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.600 
fertilizers to his crops

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.630 
fertilizers to his crops
let<00:00:21.600> me<00:00:21.779> also<00:00:21.930> add<00:00:22.170> fertilizer<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:23.130> my<00:00:23.279> crops

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
let me also add fertilizer to my crops

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.779 
let me also add fertilizer to my crops
and<00:00:23.910> then<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:25.019> will<00:00:25.710> also<00:00:25.859> get<00:00:26.250> better<00:00:26.580> yield<00:00:26.970> oh

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
and then I will also get better yield oh

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.870 
and then I will also get better yield oh
the<00:00:29.789> previous<00:00:30.300> trick<00:00:30.510> did<00:00:30.750> not<00:00:30.960> work<00:00:31.579> now<00:00:32.579> what
