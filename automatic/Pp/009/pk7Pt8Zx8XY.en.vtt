 #Bringing The Muppets! 

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:04.604
 It is the 

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:06.606
 with our special guests 

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:08.108
 The Muppets! 

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.210
 Ebaaaaa! 

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:13.446
 It's good to be in Britain. 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.482
 Having tea with a cookie 

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:17.517
 I do not think that's right 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.052
 Do not you like tea? 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.992
 Aaah, the Golden Anvil! 

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:28.028
 I could become the 

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:30.063
 THE MOST POWERFUL ACTION IN THE WORLD! 

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:33.233
 Okay, buddy. Get away from the anvil! 

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:35.268
 We can not take our eyes off these people ... 

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:36.770
 Hey 

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:38.772
 Did you just get that anvil? 

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:40.273
 Not 

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:41.775
 OK 

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:44.978
 Thanks for the anvil 

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:46.546
 What?? 

00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:48.381
 Stop that penguin! 

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:50.383
 He stole the Golden Anvil! 

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:52.419
 Well, we can sit here and have fun. 

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:54.421
 or chase that guy around the world 

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:56.423
 These cookies are really cold. 

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:58.425
 Let's go! 

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:01.094
 Something to declare? 

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:02.595
 A Golden Anvil 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.097
 You can pass 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.868
 Something to declare? 

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:10.870
 Just a bottle of water 

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:12.872
 Wait here next door, please. 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.709
 I should have come first class 

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:17.711
 This plane is a bit noisy 

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:21.748
 Could you not snore, please? 

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:23.249
 Ah, sorry. 

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:25.352
 Hey, it's the anvil thief! 

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:27.354
 Uoou, who's driving this business? 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.955
 I BE CAPTAIN! 

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:30.457
 I PILOT AIRPLANE! 

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:39.866
 But they land safely! (do not ask me how) 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.368
 BYE 

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:42.869
 Thanks for the flight 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.839
 I can not believe that that silversmith left. 

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:47.841
 I can not believe a peanut costs 5 stacks 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:50.176
 France! 

00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:53.680
 Oh no! I broke my gold ring 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.981
 OURIVES IN ACTION 

00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:56.950
 I can fix it for you, ma'am. 

00:01:59.986 --> 00:02:01.454
 Here it is 

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:04.090
 Merci! 

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:05.358
 OURIVES IN ACTION 

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:08.294
 Have you seen a goldsmith? 

00:02:08.328 --> 00:02:09.796
 black apron 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.297
 same as the logo on the screen? 

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:12.799
 Hmmm ... 

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:14.300
 Not 

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:16.636
 Germany! 

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:22.275
 Have you seen a goldsmith? 

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:23.777
 Flinder minden 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.779
 On the floopen stinzen 

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:27.280
 Great thank you! 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.017
 Russia! 

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:37.257
 Have you seen a goldsmith? 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.259
 Meep meep meep meep 

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:40.760
 What did he say? 

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:43.196
 He said flinder minden 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:45.198
 On the floopen stinzen 

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:46.700
 Great thank you! 

00:02:48.702 --> 00:02:49.669
 Mexico! 

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:56.509
 The goldsmith is next to that boat! 

00:02:56.543 --> 00:02:58.011
 I'll get it! 

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.981
 Can you help me with the boat? 

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:03.483
 clear 

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:05.885
 You let him escape! 

00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:07.454
 He asked so politely 

00:03:09.456 --> 00:03:10.423
 U.S! 

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:14.594
 I can not believe you let the goldsmith run away 

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:16.596
 Please do not be angry, Kermit. 

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:17.864
 OURIVES IN ACTION 

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:19.399
 Gentlemen 

00:03:19.432 --> 00:03:21.401
 It's my job to fix valuable things. 

00:03:21.434 --> 00:03:22.902
 How the friendships 

00:03:25.105 --> 00:03:27.073
 Hey, I'm not mad at you anymore! 

00:03:27.107 --> 00:03:29.075
 And I'm not mad at you! 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.077
 Why were YOU mad at me? 

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:33.113
 Let's not ruin this moment. 

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:36.850
 You should return the Golden Anvil 

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:38.351
 I can not 

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:39.853
 be yourself 

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.022
 I AM the golden anvil 

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:43.990
 For this I did not expect 

00:03:44.024 --> 00:03:45.992
 If you have a theater party 

00:03:46.026 --> 00:03:48.028
 Are you going back to the museum? 

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:49.529
 Yes 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.378
 I'll keep my word. 

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:07.380
 And go back to the museum 

00:04:07.647 --> 00:04:09.549
 How did you know you were having a party? 

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:11.051
 This is the Muppets Theater 

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:13.053
 Always having a party! 

00:04:13.687 --> 00:04:19.000
