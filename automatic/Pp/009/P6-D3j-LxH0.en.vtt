TV today we'll look at the role that

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:18.720 
TV today we'll look at the role that
whether<00:00:16.570> a<00:00:16.840> Bucks<00:00:17.320> aged<00:00:17.590> deer<00:00:18.189> densities

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:18.730 
whether a Bucks aged deer densities

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.359 
whether a Bucks aged deer densities
human<00:00:19.480> pressure<00:00:19.750> and<00:00:20.050> much<00:00:20.259> more<00:00:20.590> play<00:00:21.340> in

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
human pressure and much more play in

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.210 
human pressure and much more play in
determining<00:00:22.000> deer<00:00:22.210> activity<00:00:22.770> so<00:00:23.770> stay<00:00:23.980> tuned

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
determining deer activity so stay tuned

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.740 
determining deer activity so stay tuned
because<00:00:24.460> we're<00:00:24.820> about<00:00:25.000> to<00:00:25.210> share<00:00:25.450> some

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
because we're about to share some

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:57.580 
because we're about to share some
cutting-edge<00:00:26.230> information

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.500 

you<00:00:58.590> feel<00:00:58.860> it<00:00:59.190> when<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.460> enter<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.880> woods

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
you feel it when you enter the woods

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.080 
you feel it when you enter the woods
it's<00:01:01.380> an<00:01:01.560> electricity<00:01:02.220> that<00:01:02.400> brings<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.880> deer

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
it's an electricity that brings the deer

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.790 
it's an electricity that brings the deer
hunter<00:01:03.239> an<00:01:03.540> adrenaline<00:01:04.140> rush

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.920 

hitting<00:01:07.550> the<00:01:07.670> woods<00:01:07.850> on<00:01:08.090> a<00:01:08.120> day<00:01:08.330> when<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:08.720> deer

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
hitting the woods on a day when the deer

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.720 
hitting the woods on a day when the deer
are<00:01:09.080> chasing<00:01:09.560> is<00:01:09.920> unlike<00:01:10.310> any<00:01:10.580> other

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:10.730 
are chasing is unlike any other

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:32.830 
are chasing is unlike any other
experience<00:01:11.090> you'll<00:01:11.900> have<00:01:12.140> as<00:01:12.590> a<00:01:12.650> deer<00:01:13.070> hunter

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.530 

but<00:01:33.840> what<00:01:33.990> shuts<00:01:34.290> them<00:01:34.500> down<00:01:34.910> why<00:01:35.910> do<00:01:35.970> deer<00:01:36.330> bed

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
but what shuts them down why do deer bed

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.840 
but what shuts them down why do deer bed
down<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:36.840> stay<00:01:37.230> put<00:01:37.470> on<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.740> day<00:01:38.010> that<00:01:38.400> has<00:01:38.550> all

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
down and stay put on a day that has all

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.890 
down and stay put on a day that has all
the<00:01:39.030> signs<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.480> being<00:01:39.630> an<00:01:39.900> active<00:01:40.350> day

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:02:05.919 

how<00:01:44.900> do<00:01:44.960> you<00:01:45.230> hunt<00:01:45.410> deer<00:01:45.740> that<00:01:46.130> don't<00:01:46.520> move

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.210 

there<00:02:06.929> are<00:02:07.020> basically<00:02:07.469> six<00:02:07.740> things<00:02:08.099> that

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
there are basically six things that

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.969 
there are basically six things that

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
suppress deer activity bad weather in

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.369 
suppress deer activity bad weather in
the<00:02:11.039> form<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.400> rain<00:02:11.610> or<00:02:11.640> snow<00:02:12.379> warm

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
haven't heard human pressure and food

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.320 
haven't heard human pressure and food
sources<00:02:25.040> let's<00:02:26.040> look<00:02:26.250> at<00:02:26.370> each<00:02:29.060> when<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.150> comes

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
sources let's look at each when it comes

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.449 
sources let's look at each when it comes
to<00:02:30.569> suppressing<00:02:31.110> whitetail<00:02:31.470> activity

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
to suppressing whitetail activity

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.850 
to suppressing whitetail activity
heavy<00:02:33.060> rains<00:02:33.390> heavy<00:02:33.720> snows<00:02:34.110> can<00:02:34.470> shut<00:02:34.739> them

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
heavy rains heavy snows can shut them

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.660 
heavy rains heavy snows can shut them
down<00:02:35.069> in<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.310> heartbeat

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
down in a heartbeat

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.509 
down in a heartbeat
for<00:02:36.390> example<00:02:36.900> if<00:02:37.380> you've<00:02:37.620> got<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.799> storm<00:02:38.160> front

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
for example if you've got a storm front

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:39.259 
for example if you've got a storm front
moving<00:02:38.579> in

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
moving in

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.360 
moving in
then<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.959> barometric<00:02:40.290> pressure<00:02:40.739> is<00:02:40.860> actually

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
then the barometric pressure is actually

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.430 
then the barometric pressure is actually
dropping<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:42.030> when<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.299> happens<00:02:42.750> white

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
dropping and when that happens white

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.750 
dropping and when that happens white
tails<00:02:43.680> are<00:02:43.920> up<00:02:44.040> on<00:02:44.190> their<00:02:44.310> feet<00:02:44.489> they're

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
tails are up on their feet they're

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.390 
tails are up on their feet they're
feeding<00:02:44.940> but<00:02:45.720> when<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:45.959> storm<00:02:46.349> hits<00:02:46.680> they<00:02:47.250> go

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
feeding but when that storm hits they go

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.190 
feeding but when that storm hits they go
on<00:02:47.489> their<00:02:47.640> belly<00:02:47.819> and<00:02:48.510> normally<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:48.930> storm

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
on their belly and normally the storm

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.110 
on their belly and normally the storm
last<00:02:49.470> anywhere<00:02:49.890> from<00:02:49.950> four<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:50.489> eight<00:02:50.700> hours

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
last anywhere from four to eight hours

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.509 
last anywhere from four to eight hours
and<00:02:51.390> then<00:02:51.959> once<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.379> passes<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:53.370> mayor

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
and then once it passes the mayor

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.850 
and then once it passes the mayor
barometric<00:02:54.180> pressure<00:02:54.599> starts<00:02:55.049> to<00:02:55.230> rise<00:02:55.440> and

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
barometric pressure starts to rise and

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.770 
barometric pressure starts to rise and
when<00:02:56.069> that<00:02:56.190> happens<00:02:56.640> deer<00:02:56.970> are<00:02:57.120> up<00:02:57.239> feeding

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
when that happens deer are up feeding

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:06.520 
when that happens deer are up feeding
and<00:02:58.049> moving<00:02:58.980> again

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.809 

another<00:03:07.530> thing<00:03:07.799> that<00:03:07.829> suppresses<00:03:08.280> whitetail

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
another thing that suppresses whitetail

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.809 
another thing that suppresses whitetail
activity<00:03:09.359> is<00:03:09.959> warm<00:03:10.319> temperatures<00:03:10.799> here<00:03:11.730> in

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
activity is warm temperatures here in

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.490 
activity is warm temperatures here in
the<00:03:11.879> Northeast<00:03:12.299> anyway<00:03:12.840> you've<00:03:13.469> got

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
the Northeast anyway you've got

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.099 
the Northeast anyway you've got
situations<00:03:14.430> where<00:03:14.640> if<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.819> air<00:03:15.000> temperature

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
situations where if the air temperature

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.860 
situations where if the air temperature
rises<00:03:16.109> above<00:03:16.349> 45<00:03:16.920> degrees

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
rises above 45 degrees

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.360 
rises above 45 degrees
whitetail<00:03:18.870> activity<00:03:19.620> pretty<00:03:19.950> much<00:03:20.099> shuts

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
whitetail activity pretty much shuts

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.849 
whitetail activity pretty much shuts
down<00:03:20.579> a<00:03:20.909> whitetail<00:03:21.659> in<00:03:22.019> November<00:03:22.439> has<00:03:22.620> about

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
down a whitetail in November has about

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.470 
down a whitetail in November has about
three<00:03:23.129> inches<00:03:23.370> of<00:03:23.549> fur<00:03:23.700> on<00:03:23.730> their<00:03:24.000> body<00:03:24.209> and

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
three inches of fur on their body and

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.960 
three inches of fur on their body and
they<00:03:24.989> simply<00:03:25.290> cannot<00:03:25.799> function<00:03:26.310> when<00:03:26.730> warm

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
they simply cannot function when warm

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.179 
they simply cannot function when warm
temperatures<00:03:27.420> show<00:03:27.599> up<00:03:27.810> so<00:03:28.620> warm

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:29.189 
temperatures show up so warm

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:31.490 
temperatures show up so warm
temperatures<00:03:29.760> will<00:03:30.480> force<00:03:30.750> them<00:03:30.930> to<00:03:30.959> bed

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
temperatures will force them to bed

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.920 
temperatures will force them to bed
and<00:03:31.829> obviously<00:03:32.310> when<00:03:32.849> that<00:03:33.000> happens<00:03:33.389> you

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
and obviously when that happens you

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.379 
and obviously when that happens you
don't<00:03:34.109> see<00:03:34.349> a<00:03:34.379> lot<00:03:34.560> of<00:03:34.709> deer<00:03:34.859> activity<00:03:35.389> when

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
don't see a lot of deer activity when

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.059 
don't see a lot of deer activity when
Charlie<00:03:36.719> talked<00:03:36.930> about<00:03:37.170> whether<00:03:37.409> we're

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
Charlie talked about whether we're

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.399 
Charlie talked about whether we're
talking<00:03:38.220> about<00:03:38.489> 40<00:03:39.299> degrees<00:03:39.389> and<00:03:39.930> that

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
talking about 40 degrees and that

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:41.660 
talking about 40 degrees and that
usually<00:03:40.620> shuts<00:03:41.069> deer<00:03:41.280> down<00:03:41.459> when

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
usually shuts deer down when

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.190 
usually shuts deer down when
temperatures<00:03:42.060> are<00:03:42.090> above<00:03:42.359> that<00:03:42.629> well<00:03:43.109> that's

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
temperatures are above that well that's

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.839 
temperatures are above that well that's
for<00:03:43.439> the<00:03:43.470> Midwest<00:03:43.799> in<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.040> north<00:03:44.340> and<00:03:44.639> the

they're down in the south especially

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.220 
they're down in the south especially
during<00:03:50.909> the<00:03:51.060> rut<00:03:51.209> you<00:03:51.359> can<00:03:51.540> have<00:03:51.689> temperatures

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
during the rut you can have temperatures

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.009 
during the rut you can have temperatures
in<00:03:52.379> the<00:03:52.470> 60s<00:03:52.950> 70s<00:03:53.099> and<00:03:53.549> even<00:03:53.700> 80s<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:54.389> this<00:03:54.870> is

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
in the 60s 70s and even 80s and this is

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.649 
in the 60s 70s and even 80s and this is
gonna<00:03:55.139> curtail<00:03:55.680> your<00:03:55.709> activity<00:03:56.579> greatly<00:03:57.000> but

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
move is gonna be dictated on how hot it

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.830 
move is gonna be dictated on how hot it
is<00:04:04.200> for<00:04:04.950> example<00:04:05.489> you're<00:04:05.909> hunting<00:04:06.269> the<00:04:06.359> rut<00:04:06.540> in

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
is for example you're hunting the rut in

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.589 
is for example you're hunting the rut in
say<00:04:07.319> November<00:04:07.919> in<00:04:08.069> Oklahoma<00:04:09.030> let's<00:04:09.299> say<00:04:09.419> for

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
say November in Oklahoma let's say for

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.170 
say November in Oklahoma let's say for
example<00:04:10.019> and<00:04:10.319> at<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:10.979> daytime<00:04:11.340> temperature

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
example and at the daytime temperature

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.050 
example and at the daytime temperature
is<00:04:12.299> 80<00:04:12.510> degrees<00:04:12.840> or<00:04:13.109> 70<00:04:13.470> degrees<00:04:13.739> it<00:04:14.669> gets<00:04:14.879> down

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
is 80 degrees or 70 degrees it gets down

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.029 
is 80 degrees or 70 degrees it gets down
to<00:04:15.090> maybe<00:04:15.389> 40<00:04:15.900> at<00:04:16.049> night<00:04:16.289> you<00:04:16.769> would<00:04:16.889> think

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
to maybe 40 at night you would think

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.830 
to maybe 40 at night you would think
mornings<00:04:17.489> are<00:04:17.579> gonna<00:04:17.669> be<00:04:17.849> fantastic<00:04:18.479> for<00:04:18.510> deer

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
mornings are gonna be fantastic for deer

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.479 
mornings are gonna be fantastic for deer
activity<00:04:18.959> and<00:04:19.349> that<00:04:19.440> really<00:04:19.680> Seoul<00:04:19.979> because

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
activity and that really Seoul because

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.570 
activity and that really Seoul because
when<00:04:20.789> you<00:04:20.880> have<00:04:21.030> temperatures<00:04:21.570> that<00:04:21.780> extreme

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
when you have temperatures that extreme

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.770 
when you have temperatures that extreme
especially<00:04:23.580> for<00:04:23.760> mature<00:04:23.849> deer<00:04:24.360> those<00:04:24.570> mature

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
especially for mature deer those mature

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.390 
especially for mature deer those mature
deer<00:04:25.110> are<00:04:25.380> actually<00:04:25.740> gonna<00:04:25.830> be<00:04:25.889> moving<00:04:26.250> under

the cover of darkness so when the
temperatures<00:04:28.530> are<00:04:28.710> hot<00:04:28.979> do<00:04:29.550> you<00:04:29.610> stand<00:04:29.820> a

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
temperatures are hot do you stand a

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.000 
temperatures are hot do you stand a
chance<00:04:30.000> yes<00:04:30.840> you<00:04:31.020> do<00:04:31.199> but<00:04:31.710> you<00:04:31.830> have<00:04:31.860> to

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
understand that most of that activity is

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:35.600 
understand that most of that activity is
gonna<00:04:34.500> be<00:04:34.620> when<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:34.889> air<00:04:35.010> temperature<00:04:35.580> is

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
gonna be when the air temperature is

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.760 
gonna be when the air temperature is
coolest<00:04:36.150> and<00:04:36.360> for<00:04:37.169> the<00:04:37.260> most<00:04:37.440> part<00:04:37.680> that's

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
coolest and for the most part that's
