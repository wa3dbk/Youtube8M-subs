00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
web and then one other set of little

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.719 
web and then one other set of little
lines<00:01:21.799> towards<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.979> top<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.580> cupcake<00:01:24.259> and

lines towards the top of the cupcake and

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.530 
lines towards the top of the cupcake and
there<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.850> your<00:01:26.970> spiderweb<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:29.360> started<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.420> put

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
there is your spiderweb I started to put

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.240 
there is your spiderweb I started to put
the<00:01:30.630> eyes<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.170> cupcake<00:01:31.710> here<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.159> I

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
realized that they were a little bit too

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.219 
realized that they were a little bit too
big<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.850> simply<00:01:36.270> took<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.659> pair<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:36.990> scissors

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
big so I simply took a pair of scissors

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.200 
big so I simply took a pair of scissors
and<00:01:37.619> just<00:01:37.710> cut<00:01:38.070> them<00:01:38.340> down<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.610> bit<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:39.060> make

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
and just cut them down a bit to make

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.969 
and just cut them down a bit to make
them<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.450> little<00:01:39.600> bit<00:01:39.840> smaller<00:01:44.390> and<00:01:45.770> then<00:01:46.770> once

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
them a little bit smaller and then once

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.679 
them a little bit smaller and then once
you<00:01:47.100> have<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.369> right<00:01:47.549> size<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:48.119> eyes<00:01:48.360> you

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
you have the right size of eyes you

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.990 
you have the right size of eyes you
simply<00:01:49.170> place<00:01:49.439> them<00:01:49.680> on<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.860> cupcake<00:01:50.340> right

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
over top of the spiderweb and just

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.740 
over top of the spiderweb and just
gently<00:01:52.530> press<00:01:52.890> them<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.090> they<00:01:54.210> stick<00:01:54.450> to
