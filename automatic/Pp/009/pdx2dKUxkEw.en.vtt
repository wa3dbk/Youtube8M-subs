00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.190 
put in your gun and it's kinda like an
artistic<00:01:25.890> captain<00:01:26.640> price<00:01:27.030> camo<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.630> there

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
artistic captain price camo and there

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.450 
artistic captain price camo and there
looks<00:01:28.350> really<00:01:28.560> cool<00:01:28.740> as<00:01:28.860> well<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.310> then

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
looks really cool as well and then

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.219 
looks really cool as well and then
finally<00:01:29.850> we<00:01:29.970> also<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.570> reticle

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
finally we also have the reticle

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.260 
finally we also have the reticle
which<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.799> like<00:01:32.009> his<00:01:32.220> classic<00:01:32.729> handlebar

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
which is like his classic handlebar

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.270 
which is like his classic handlebar
moustache<00:01:33.780> which<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.170> can<00:01:34.290> use<00:01:34.500> on<00:01:34.650> your<00:01:35.100> gun

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
moustache which you can use on your gun

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.010 
moustache which you can use on your gun
it's<00:01:35.430> not<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.670> best<00:01:35.820> for<00:01:36.030> practical<00:01:36.630> use<00:01:36.840> in

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
it's not the best for practical use in

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.539 
it's not the best for practical use in
gunfights<00:01:37.409> but<00:01:37.650> it's<00:01:37.740> still<00:01:37.860> pretty<00:01:38.040> cool<00:01:38.220> and

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549
