if it's a little small but overall it's
very<00:05:14.260> nice<00:05:14.500> now<00:05:15.370> the<00:05:15.430> voice<00:05:15.760> it<00:05:16.120> sounds<00:05:16.510> pretty

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
very nice now the voice it sounds pretty

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.330 
very nice now the voice it sounds pretty
much<00:05:16.840> like<00:05:16.990> the<00:05:17.260> one<00:05:17.290> on<00:05:17.500> the<00:05:17.590> show<00:05:17.740> that<00:05:17.950> one

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
much like the one on the show that one

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.490 
much like the one on the show that one
on<00:05:18.430> the<00:05:18.520> show<00:05:18.669> it<00:05:18.789> sounds<00:05:19.030> a<00:05:19.120> little

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
on the show it sounds a little

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.140 
on the show it sounds a little
different<00:05:19.980> so<00:05:20.430> I<00:05:20.490> wish<00:05:20.670> it<00:05:20.820> could<00:05:20.940> have<00:05:21.030> been<00:05:21.090> a

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
different so I wish it could have been a

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.640 
different so I wish it could have been a
little<00:05:21.300> more<00:05:21.480> show<00:05:21.660> accurate<00:05:21.840> but<00:05:22.350> that's

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
little more show accurate but that's

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.800 
little more show accurate but that's
just<00:05:22.800> being<00:05:22.950> a<00:05:23.010> little<00:05:23.160> bit<00:05:23.280> nitpicky<00:05:23.760> and<00:05:24.000> I

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
just being a little bit nitpicky and I

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.420 
just being a little bit nitpicky and I
personally<00:05:25.140> prefer<00:05:25.470> the<00:05:25.590> ryouki<00:05:25.920> voice<00:05:26.100> but

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
personally prefer the ryouki voice but

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.370 
personally prefer the ryouki voice but
if<00:05:26.520> you're<00:05:26.670> a<00:05:26.700> fan<00:05:26.850> of<00:05:26.880> Dragon<00:05:27.270> Knight<00:05:27.450> or
