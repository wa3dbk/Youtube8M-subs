today I wanted to give you a video
tutorial<00:00:07.950> about<00:00:08.370> integer<00:00:09.120> race<00:00:09.410> or<00:00:10.410> interets

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
tutorial about integer race or interets

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.690 
tutorial about integer race or interets
as<00:00:11.250> they<00:00:11.580> are<00:00:11.759> more<00:00:12.000> commonly<00:00:12.059> known<00:00:12.690> as

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
as they are more commonly known as

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.820 
as they are more commonly known as
interets<00:00:14.700> or<00:00:15.030> integer<00:00:15.420> race<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.929> used<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.619> lot

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
interets or integer race I used a lot

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.429 
interets or integer race I used a lot
more<00:00:17.340> in<00:00:17.760> programming<00:00:18.449> but<00:00:18.480> they<00:00:18.900> can<00:00:19.080> be<00:00:19.170> used

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
more in programming but they can be used

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.740 
more in programming but they can be used
in<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.650> redstone<00:00:19.949> for<00:00:20.400> cool<00:00:20.910> things<00:00:21.180> like<00:00:21.330> a

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
in a redstone for cool things like a

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.410 
in a redstone for cool things like a
display<00:00:22.350> screen<00:00:22.410> or<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.920> cursor<00:00:23.519> as<00:00:23.789> we've<00:00:24.210> got

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
display screen or a cursor as we've got

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.570 
display screen or a cursor as we've got
here<00:00:24.689> now<00:00:24.900> I'm<00:00:25.410> not<00:00:25.560> using<00:00:25.590> any<00:00:25.980> spoilers<00:00:26.310> or

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
here now I'm not using any spoilers or

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.080 
here now I'm not using any spoilers or
anything

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
anything

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.720 
anything
the<00:00:27.240> only<00:00:27.390> redstone<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.289> done<00:00:29.070> with<00:00:29.400> come<00:00:29.640> on

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
the only redstone is done with come on

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.980 
the only redstone is done with come on
blocks<00:00:30.000> just<00:00:30.090> getting<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.599> out<00:00:30.750> there<00:00:30.779> at

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
blocks just getting that out there at

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.680 
blocks just getting that out there at
the<00:00:31.109> very<00:00:31.289> beginning<00:00:32.149> just<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.270> case<00:00:33.480> people

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
the very beginning just in case people

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.410 
the very beginning just in case people
had<00:00:34.079> questions<00:00:34.230> about<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.610> anyway<00:00:35.940> we<00:00:36.270> can

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
had questions about it so anyway we can

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.770 
had questions about it so anyway we can
move<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:36.840> cursor<00:00:37.110> around<00:00:37.559> fairly<00:00:37.890> freely

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
move this cursor around fairly freely

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.540 
move this cursor around fairly freely
without<00:00:39.780> any<00:00:40.050> hang-ups<00:00:40.950> or<00:00:41.160> anything<00:00:41.340> like

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
without any hang-ups or anything like

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.880 
without any hang-ups or anything like
that<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:42.390> only<00:00:42.480> hang-up<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.050> waiting<00:00:43.559> for<00:00:43.770> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
that the only hang-up is waiting for the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.740 
that the only hang-up is waiting for the
stupid<00:00:44.640> pressure<00:00:45.000> plate<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:47.239> disengage<00:00:48.239> after

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
stupid pressure plate to disengage after

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.389 
stupid pressure plate to disengage after
we've<00:00:48.899> stepped<00:00:49.140> on<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.440> but<00:00:49.710> otherwise<00:00:50.010> you

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
we've stepped on it but otherwise you

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.799 
we've stepped on it but otherwise you
know<00:00:50.489> we<00:00:50.610> can<00:00:50.730> move<00:00:50.879> around<00:00:51.000> fairly<00:00:51.600> quickly

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
know we can move around fairly quickly

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.060 
know we can move around fairly quickly
so<00:00:52.800> what's<00:00:53.430> basically<00:00:53.640> happening<00:00:54.059> here<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:55.559> we

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
so what's basically happening here is we

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.369 
so what's basically happening here is we
have<00:00:56.100> basically<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.969> 10<00:00:57.270> by<00:00:57.449> 10<00:00:57.660> pixel<00:00:58.140> screen

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
have basically a 10 by 10 pixel screen

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.430 
have basically a 10 by 10 pixel screen
depicts<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.579> there<00:00:59.850> is<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> pixel<00:01:00.420> it's<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.020> 2x2

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
depicts that there is a pixel it's a 2x2

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.149 
depicts that there is a pixel it's a 2x2
section<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.399> screen<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.940> it's<00:01:03.870> 2x2<00:01:04.350> let's

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
section of a screen and it's 2x2 let's

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.230 
section of a screen and it's 2x2 let's
reset<00:01:05.549> up<00:01:05.700> our<00:01:06.270> cursor<00:01:06.869> position<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.820> yeah<00:01:08.820> so

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
reset up our cursor position and yeah so

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.520 
reset up our cursor position and yeah so
the<00:01:10.170> main<00:01:11.390> thing<00:01:12.390> we<00:01:12.570> see<00:01:12.840> here<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.380> was

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
the main thing we see here that it was

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.450 
the main thing we see here that it was
just<00:01:13.770> loading<00:01:14.490> issues<00:01:15.110> is<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:17.130> it

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
just loading issues is that the it

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.580 
just loading issues is that the it
basically<00:01:18.030> follows<00:01:18.540> where<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.900> want<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.409> go

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
basically follows where I want it to go

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.010 
basically follows where I want it to go
that's<00:01:19.950> where<00:01:20.310> out<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.729> loading<00:01:21.570> areas

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
that's where out of the loading areas

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.249 
that's where out of the loading areas
well<00:01:22.259> that's<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.890> fraps<00:01:23.220> bug<00:01:23.549> not<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:24.259> program

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
well that's a fraps bug not a program

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.620 
well that's a fraps bug not a program
bug<00:01:25.500> that's<00:01:26.250> just<00:01:26.520> because<00:01:27.180> like<00:01:27.360> for<00:01:27.570> example

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
bug that's just because like for example

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.960 
bug that's just because like for example
I<00:01:27.900> prices<00:01:28.110> up<00:01:28.350> again<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.890> will<00:01:29.040> be<00:01:29.250> half

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
I prices up again and that will be half

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.719 
I prices up again and that will be half
again<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:30.659> it's<00:01:30.780> actually<00:01:31.110> all<00:01:31.409> there<00:01:31.829> so

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
again but it's actually all there so

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.660 
again but it's actually all there so
yeah<00:01:33.509> it's<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.290> gotta<00:01:34.770> love<00:01:34.950> graphics<00:01:35.400> like

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
yeah it's a gotta love graphics like

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.249 
yeah it's a gotta love graphics like
glitches<00:01:37.759> so<00:01:38.759> basically<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.780> like<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.079> said

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
glitches so basically you like I said

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.100 
glitches so basically you like I said
how<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.500> works<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.890> we<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:42.110> coordinate

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
how it works is we have a coordinate

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.760 
how it works is we have a coordinate
system<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:44.280> little<00:01:44.820> bit<00:01:44.909> different<00:01:45.299> to

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
system a little bit different to

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.160 
system a little bit different to
programming<00:01:46.770> arrays<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:48.119> for<00:01:48.780> example

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
programming arrays in that for example

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.560 
programming arrays in that for example
we<00:01:49.290> have<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.860> guess<00:01:50.610> kind<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.060> similar<00:01:51.390> in

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
we have I guess kind of similar in

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.260 
we have I guess kind of similar in
programming<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.799> would<00:01:53.009> have<00:01:54.020> for<00:01:55.020> an<00:01:55.110> array

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
programming you would have for an array

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.170 
programming you would have for an array
integers<00:01:57.320> within<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.469> array<00:01:58.619> like<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.790> series

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
integers within that array like a series

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.730 
integers within that array like a series
entry<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.570> say<00:02:00.719> for<00:02:00.899> example<00:02:01.229> an<00:02:01.320> array<00:02:01.409> could

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
entry to say for example an array could

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.480 
entry to say for example an array could
have<00:02:01.979> 5<00:02:02.719> slots<00:02:03.719> in<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.170> in<00:02:04.829> this<00:02:05.009> case<00:02:05.189> we<00:02:05.369> don't

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
have 5 slots in it in this case we don't

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.479 
have 5 slots in it in this case we don't
have<00:02:05.579> any<00:02:05.850> limit<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.299> our<00:02:06.540> slots<00:02:07.220> but<00:02:08.220> we<00:02:08.340> could

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
have any limit to our slots but we could

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.609 
have any limit to our slots but we could
have<00:02:08.550> 5<00:02:08.819> slots<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.330> each<00:02:09.450> slot<00:02:09.509> would<00:02:10.379> have<00:02:10.590> a

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
have 5 slots and each slot would have a

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.670 
have 5 slots and each slot would have a
a<00:02:10.830> new<00:02:11.340> piece<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.819> information<00:02:12.290> now<00:02:13.290> in<00:02:13.500> this

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
a new piece of information now in this

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.020 
a new piece of information now in this
case

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
case

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.910 
case
we<00:02:15.450> can<00:02:15.659> actually<00:02:15.959> do<00:02:16.109> the<00:02:16.260> same<00:02:16.499> kind<00:02:16.799> of

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
we can actually do the same kind of

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.089 
we can actually do the same kind of
thing<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:18.780> selection<00:02:19.409> method<00:02:19.739> all<00:02:19.829> the<00:02:19.950> way

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
thing the selection method all the way

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.789 
thing the selection method all the way
that<00:02:20.340> we've<00:02:20.459> basically<00:02:21.650> displayed<00:02:22.650> this

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
that we've basically displayed this

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.300 
that we've basically displayed this
pixel<00:02:23.159> on<00:02:23.189> the<00:02:23.280> screen<00:02:23.549> is<00:02:24.060> by<00:02:24.840> giving<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.799> a<00:02:25.980> CA

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
pixel on the screen is by giving it a CA

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.300 
pixel on the screen is by giving it a CA
and<00:02:26.609> address<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:27.870> this<00:02:28.170> top<00:02:28.379> corner<00:02:28.560> here<00:02:28.769> has

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
and address so this top corner here has

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.099 
and address so this top corner here has
a<00:02:29.340> y-value<00:02:30.239> of<00:02:30.269> 10<00:02:30.659> and<00:02:30.930> an<00:02:31.049> x<00:02:31.230> value<00:02:31.319> of<00:02:31.620> 1

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109 
a y-value of 10 and an x value of 1

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:35.949 
a y-value of 10 and an x value of 1
horizontal<00:02:34.109> coordinates<00:02:34.620> are<00:02:34.829> X<00:02:35.069> and

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
horizontal coordinates are X and

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.709 
horizontal coordinates are X and
vertical<00:02:36.959> components<00:02:37.590> are<00:02:37.709> Y<00:02:38.180> so<00:02:39.180> this<00:02:39.420> here

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:39.719 
vertical components are Y so this here

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:45.229 
vertical components are Y so this here
would<00:02:39.870> be<00:02:40.969> Y<00:02:41.969> of<00:02:42.000> 10<00:02:42.900> y<00:02:43.769> of<00:02:43.950> 1<00:02:44.189> sorry<00:02:44.489> and<00:02:44.790> X<00:02:45.090> of

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
would be Y of 10 y of 1 sorry and X of

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.610 
would be Y of 10 y of 1 sorry and X of
10<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:46.230> X<00:02:46.469> 10<00:02:46.799> y<00:02:47.099> 1<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.840> opposite<00:02:49.230> corner

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
10 so X 10 y 1 and the opposite corner

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.869 
10 so X 10 y 1 and the opposite corner
would<00:02:49.769> be<00:02:51.349> x1<00:02:52.849> y1<00:02:54.049> x1<00:02:55.049> y1<00:02:55.379> the<00:02:56.310> top<00:02:56.579> corner

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
would be x1 y1 x1 y1 the top corner

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.240 
would be x1 y1 x1 y1 the top corner
there<00:02:56.909> would<00:02:57.150> be<00:02:57.180> X<00:02:57.480> 10<00:02:57.750> y<00:02:57.959> 10<00:02:58.260> so<00:02:58.859> similar<00:02:59.219> to

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
there would be X 10 y 10 so similar to

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.059 
there would be X 10 y 10 so similar to
moving<00:03:00.180> around<00:03:00.419> now<00:03:00.989> how<00:03:01.379> that<00:03:01.620> works<00:03:01.859> with

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
moving around now how that works with

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.270 
moving around now how that works with
these<00:03:02.280> is<00:03:02.669> we<00:03:02.909> basically<00:03:03.419> have<00:03:04.049> a<00:03:04.439> little

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
these is we basically have a little

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.879 
these is we basically have a little
system<00:03:05.730> here<00:03:05.760> I<00:03:06.239> did<00:03:06.989> try<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.260> set<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.620> up<00:03:07.709> with

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889 
system here I did try to set it up with

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.599 
system here I did try to set it up with
a<00:03:07.919> clock<00:03:08.250> but<00:03:08.579> this<00:03:09.000> part<00:03:09.269> here<00:03:09.569> is<00:03:09.659> too<00:03:09.930> short

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
a clock but this part here is too short

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.679 
a clock but this part here is too short
that's<00:03:11.609> what<00:03:11.849> we<00:03:11.939> have<00:03:12.090> that<00:03:12.239> little<00:03:12.389> bit<00:03:12.599> of

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:12.689 
that's what we have that little bit of

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.080 
that's what we have that little bit of
extra<00:03:12.900> redstone<00:03:13.469> on<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.680> side<00:03:13.919> there<00:03:14.189> that's

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
extra redstone on the side there that's

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.990 
extra redstone on the side there that's
otherwise<00:03:15.449> useless<00:03:15.719> because<00:03:16.139> we<00:03:16.409> can't

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
otherwise useless because we can't

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.129 
otherwise useless because we can't
create<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.150> clock<00:03:18.689> with<00:03:20.750> what's<00:03:21.750> that<00:03:21.930> thing

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
create a clock with what's that thing

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.199 
create a clock with what's that thing
let<00:03:22.530> me<00:03:22.560> show<00:03:22.739> you<00:03:22.829> what<00:03:22.949> I<00:03:22.979> mean<00:03:23.159> by<00:03:23.220> that<00:03:23.549> let

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
let me show you what I mean by that let

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.800 
let me show you what I mean by that let
me<00:03:24.359> power<00:03:24.959> this<00:03:25.889> one<00:03:26.129> here<00:03:26.459> as<00:03:26.729> you<00:03:27.509> can<00:03:27.569> see

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
me power this one here as you can see

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.890 
me power this one here as you can see
we're<00:03:27.959> not<00:03:28.079> receiving<00:03:28.409> a<00:03:28.829> a<00:03:29.189> clock<00:03:29.909> whereas<00:03:30.720> if

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
we're not receiving a a clock whereas if

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.080 
we're not receiving a a clock whereas if
we<00:03:30.930> were<00:03:31.109> to<00:03:31.379> extend<00:03:32.159> the<00:03:32.400> signal<00:03:32.579> a<00:03:32.790> couple

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
we were to extend the signal a couple

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.789 
we were to extend the signal a couple
more<00:03:33.239> blocks<00:03:34.370> we<00:03:35.370> would<00:03:35.549> receive<00:03:35.909> a<00:03:36.209> clock<00:03:36.799> one

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
more blocks we would receive a clock one

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:44.689 
more blocks we would receive a clock one
more<00:03:37.949> strong<00:03:38.489> one<00:03:38.579> more<00:03:39.859> so<00:03:43.489> that's<00:03:44.489> not

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:44.699 
more strong one more so that's not

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:46.909 
more strong one more so that's not
working<00:03:44.909> oh<00:03:45.180> because<00:03:45.870> we<00:03:46.049> don't<00:03:46.349> have<00:03:46.500> it<00:03:46.590> on<00:03:46.680> -

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
working oh because we don't have it on -

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:51.589 
working oh because we don't have it on -
that's<00:03:47.220> why<00:03:47.629> duh<00:03:49.370> so<00:03:50.370> that<00:03:50.549> does<00:03:50.819> work<00:03:51.090> and<00:03:51.329> it

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
that's why duh so that does work and it

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.960 
that's why duh so that does work and it
just<00:03:51.659> wasn't<00:03:51.989> on<00:03:52.139> -<00:03:52.500> so<00:03:53.129> yeah<00:03:53.669> that's

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
just wasn't on - so yeah that's

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.509 
just wasn't on - so yeah that's
basically<00:03:54.799> why<00:03:55.799> it<00:03:55.859> doesn't<00:03:56.069> work<00:03:56.220> it's<00:03:56.489> like

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
basically why it doesn't work it's like

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.670 
basically why it doesn't work it's like
one<00:03:56.819> block<00:03:57.060> too<00:03:57.299> short<00:03:57.599> I<00:03:57.780> mean<00:03:57.959> I<00:03:57.989> could<00:03:58.319> make

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
one block too short I mean I could make

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.140 
one block too short I mean I could make
it<00:03:58.859> go<00:03:59.040> out<00:03:59.069> one<00:03:59.459> more<00:03:59.639> block<00:03:59.849> in<00:04:00.030> every

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
it go out one more block in every

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.439 
it go out one more block in every
direction<00:04:00.530> but<00:04:01.579> some<00:04:02.579> of<00:04:02.759> them<00:04:02.849> for<00:04:03.090> example

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:03.449 
direction but some of them for example

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:05.599 
direction but some of them for example
this<00:04:03.599> one<00:04:03.810> here<00:04:04.139> or<00:04:04.319> only<00:04:04.469> one<00:04:04.769> block<00:04:05.040> long<00:04:05.310> and

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
this one here or only one block long and

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.640 
this one here or only one block long and
it<00:04:05.699> would<00:04:05.790> have<00:04:05.969> just<00:04:06.409> elongated<00:04:07.409> at<00:04:07.560> the

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
it would have just elongated at the

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.890 
it would have just elongated at the
bottom<00:04:07.919> section<00:04:08.129> too<00:04:08.489> much<00:04:08.759> and<00:04:09.120> I<00:04:09.719> thought

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
bottom section too much and I thought

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.459 
bottom section too much and I thought
well<00:04:10.199> because<00:04:11.180> it's<00:04:12.180> for<00:04:12.359> now<00:04:12.449> and<00:04:12.900> I'll<00:04:13.019> leave

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:13.469 
well because it's for now and I'll leave

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:15.979 
well because it's for now and I'll leave
it<00:04:13.500> with<00:04:14.310> the<00:04:14.489> possibility<00:04:15.120> to<00:04:15.150> maybe<00:04:15.539> extend

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
it with the possibility to maybe extend

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.930 
it with the possibility to maybe extend
it<00:04:16.109> later<00:04:16.289> so<00:04:16.560> just<00:04:17.009> just<00:04:17.400> in<00:04:17.519> case<00:04:17.699> you<00:04:17.849> were

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
it later so just just in case you were

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:18.800 
it later so just just in case you were
confused<00:04:18.030> by<00:04:18.479> that

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
confused by that

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.259 
confused by that
but<00:04:19.229> basically<00:04:19.620> what<00:04:19.829> I've<00:04:19.979> done<00:04:20.159> to<00:04:20.459> restrict

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
but basically what I've done to restrict

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.290 
but basically what I've done to restrict
the<00:04:21.710> the<00:04:22.710> edge<00:04:22.889> parts<00:04:23.370> because<00:04:23.610> as<00:04:23.849> you<00:04:24.180> can

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
the the edge parts because as you can

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.029 
the the edge parts because as you can
see<00:04:24.360> by<00:04:25.169> this<00:04:25.310> this<00:04:26.310> part<00:04:26.610> here<00:04:26.789> will<00:04:26.969> not<00:04:27.210> go

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
see by this this part here will not go

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:31.490 
see by this this part here will not go
any<00:04:29.039> lower<00:04:29.280> and<00:04:29.810> neither<00:04:30.810> will<00:04:31.020> this<00:04:31.199> go<00:04:31.470> any

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
any lower and neither will this go any

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.529 
any lower and neither will this go any
higher<00:04:31.949> than<00:04:32.190> 10<00:04:33.650> as<00:04:34.819> you<00:04:35.819> can<00:04:35.970> see<00:04:36.180> it<00:04:36.300> will

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
higher than 10 as you can see it will

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.070 
higher than 10 as you can see it will
not<00:04:36.569> go<00:04:37.080> beyond<00:04:37.740> 10<00:04:38.479> and<00:04:39.479> the<00:04:39.599> same<00:04:39.810> is<00:04:39.960> true

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
not go beyond 10 and the same is true

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.270 
not go beyond 10 and the same is true
for<00:04:40.139> the<00:04:40.319> sides<00:04:40.530> but<00:04:40.710> I<00:04:40.770> can't<00:04:41.039> be<00:04:41.160> bothered

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
for the sides but I can't be bothered

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.680 
for the sides but I can't be bothered
showing<00:04:41.669> you<00:04:41.819> that<00:04:41.970> it<00:04:42.120> would<00:04:42.240> take<00:04:42.389> too<00:04:42.539> long

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
showing you that it would take too long

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.110 
showing you that it would take too long
but<00:04:43.410> basically<00:04:43.949> how<00:04:44.130> that<00:04:44.160> works<00:04:44.580> let's<00:04:44.910> get

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
but basically how that works let's get

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.430 
but basically how that works let's get
rid<00:04:45.240> of<00:04:45.300> these<00:04:45.509> because<00:04:45.810> I<00:04:45.870> like<00:04:46.020> it<00:04:46.199> be<00:04:46.289> a<00:04:46.319> nice

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
rid of these because I like it be a nice

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.900 
rid of these because I like it be a nice
clean<00:04:46.680> inventory<00:04:47.569> on<00:04:48.569> these<00:04:48.870> sides<00:04:49.759> this<00:04:50.759> is

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
clean inventory on these sides this is

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.439 
clean inventory on these sides this is
to<00:04:51.060> go<00:04:51.180> backwards<00:04:51.660> so<00:04:52.259> why<00:04:52.560> is<00:04:52.620> decreasing<00:04:53.520> by

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
to go backwards so why is decreasing by

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.409 
to go backwards so why is decreasing by
one<00:04:54.780> each<00:04:55.139> time<00:04:55.310> provided<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:56.400> minimum<00:04:56.819> is<00:04:57.030> 2

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
one each time provided the minimum is 2

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.480 
one each time provided the minimum is 2
now<00:04:58.229> the<00:04:58.289> reason<00:04:58.620> I've<00:04:58.710> got<00:04:58.770> the<00:04:58.919> minimum<00:04:59.190> is<00:04:59.280> 2

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
now the reason I've got the minimum is 2

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.670 
now the reason I've got the minimum is 2
instead<00:04:59.819> of<00:04:59.880> 1<00:04:59.970> it's<00:05:00.780> so<00:05:00.930> that<00:05:01.169> when<00:05:01.410> you're<00:05:01.650> on

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
instead of 1 it's so that when you're on

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.310 
instead of 1 it's so that when you're on
2<00:05:02.039> you<00:05:02.250> can<00:05:02.430> get<00:05:02.610> down<00:05:02.820> to<00:05:02.970> 1<00:05:03.180> if<00:05:03.660> I<00:05:03.840> was<00:05:03.960> on<00:05:04.050> 1

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
2 you can get down to 1 if I was on 1

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.529 
2 you can get down to 1 if I was on 1
you<00:05:04.650> and<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.580> minimum<00:05:05.880> of<00:05:05.940> 1<00:05:06.150> it<00:05:06.300> would<00:05:06.360> go

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
you and the minimum of 1 it would go

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:09.589 
you and the minimum of 1 it would go
down<00:05:06.690> to<00:05:06.720> zero<00:05:07.169> if<00:05:07.229> I<00:05:07.470> -<00:05:07.770> one<00:05:07.949> more<00:05:08.190> so<00:05:08.580> 2<00:05:09.270> is<00:05:09.419> our

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 
down to zero if I - one more so 2 is our

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:12.620 
down to zero if I - one more so 2 is our
minimum<00:05:09.960> now<00:05:10.530> for<00:05:10.919> increasing<00:05:11.669> I<00:05:11.849> basically

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
minimum now for increasing I basically

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.719 
minimum now for increasing I basically
just<00:05:12.750> added<00:05:13.320> irrespective<00:05:14.310> of<00:05:14.400> what<00:05:14.610> it<00:05:14.699> is

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
just added irrespective of what it is

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:17.870 
just added irrespective of what it is
and<00:05:15.120> then<00:05:15.330> have<00:05:15.750> this<00:05:15.990> set<00:05:16.410> to<00:05:16.440> 10<00:05:16.949> if<00:05:17.250> it<00:05:17.699> goes

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
and then have this set to 10 if it goes

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.050 
and then have this set to 10 if it goes
beyond<00:05:18.300> 10<00:05:18.630> basically<00:05:19.380> it's<00:05:19.949> not<00:05:20.639> complicated

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
beyond 10 basically it's not complicated

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.180 
beyond 10 basically it's not complicated
at<00:05:21.509> all<00:05:21.659> I'll<00:05:22.169> have<00:05:22.409> this<00:05:22.500> up<00:05:22.680> for<00:05:22.830> download<00:05:23.159> so

sensor just so I don't have to work in

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.159 
sensor just so I don't have to work in
the<00:05:31.650> dark<00:05:31.830> but<00:05:32.820> yeah<00:05:33.360> hope<00:05:33.570> you've<00:05:33.810> gained
