00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
 hello to all guys and well found in 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.450
 a new tutorial black video 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.269
 this today I finally propose the 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:14.190
 definitive method to execute the 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.929
 downgrade from ajo s6 against 1.30 s 6.1 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.119
 unfortunately the download from me and if you are 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.180
 point 1.2 is impossible but it is possible 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.590
 return to 6.1 which is almost identical 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.769
 the 6.1 point 2 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.640
 as you can see on my ipod touch of 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.399
 fourth generation a lot io s6 point 1.3 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.230
 10329 ruled logic and in this video 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.230
 dot will show you how to get back to 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.320
 they 6.1 I uploaded two videos on 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.550
 how to do this but since using 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.320
 very many videos of you have 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.300
 encountered many problems because i 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.610
 programs were wet this is the 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.860
 definitive method and do not worry 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.809
 it will give you no problem also because 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.489
 I did it five times five times in 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.340
 went well so he wo n't give me 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.620
 absolutely no problems whatsoever 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:02.370
 then this from a radio works with 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.470
 iphone 4 iphone 3gs ipod touch 4g 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.659
 only with these three devices if 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.950
 you have another device I'm sorry 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.970
 but currently you can not perform 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.020
 this downgrade will help the reds 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.140
 downloadable from the link in the description 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.200
 itunes the latest version the certificate 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.030
 shsh different 6.1 or if you don't have 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.110
 that of 6.1 is also good for 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.060
 6.0 of 6.0.1 the important thing is that it is not 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.310
 of 6.1 point 2 because precisely it does not go 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.900
 well and precisely the relevant firmware 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.420
 then firmware to which you want to return 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.159
 back I want to go back to 6.1 e 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.729
 so I got the certificate 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.900
 in 6.1 and the firmware of 6.1 the 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.090
 firmware download from the link in 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.490
 description and applies to all while the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.630
 certificate you can not download 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.820
 this is something they ask me a lot 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.610
 in shsh certificate as it changes from 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.960
 device to device you should have 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.509
 save it 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.460
 when you had the opportunity then if now 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.490
 you don't have this certificate I'm sorry 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.890
 but there is no way to find it therefore not 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.189
 you could not downgrade 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.380
 I luckily had it saved and now 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.030
 which unfortunately can no longer be saved 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.679
 however he had observed it in 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.650
 previously and so here it is on mine 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.590
 computer 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.870
 nice close and at this point we will need it 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.360
 also to the faith I recommend it must be 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.819
 the latest version of the 1.5 point 7 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.150
 because the old versions are banked 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.610
 you absolutely need 1.5 point 7 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.920
 well then once all downloaded 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.349
 these materials first 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.180
 you will have to do the right button of yours 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:38.379
 faith property go into compatibility 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.120
 tick the item run the program of 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.730
 fashion in compatibility mode for 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.989
 windows xp service pack 2 check also 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.450
 run this program as 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.269
 admin giving apply is ok and then 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.159
 do the same also with aim therefore 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.900
 compatibility tick these two items 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.599
 I recommend that you choose windows xp 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.389
 service pack 2 applies is ok 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.849
 at this point we have to the red as a 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:05.139
 perfect administrator here to ai 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:07.750
 faith we do ok and click on 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:10.689
 first option bild sad eyed peas ruby 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.599
 blobs here we click on it while browse 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:18.280
 who sacks globes and we have to choose the 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:21.819
 shsh certificate of 6.1 open perfect 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.699
 ok braus for life is good days 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:29.459
 we select our 6.1 firmware opened 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:32.349
 and wait for it to check the psv 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.449
 perfect once child to verify 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:37.389
 we will simply have to click on bild 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:40.030
 at the perfect psv and once finished 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:43.629
 create our custom firmware we will have to 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:47.530
 press ok and close the feeds 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:50.159
 at this point we should put in dfu 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.030
 our device so we keep 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.699
 make sure it 's connected to your computer 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:58.019
 I recommend and keep texts ready 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:58.019
 like power for 10 seconds 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.720
 perfect ten seconds have passed 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.960
 we release the power button and continue 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:16.130
 to hold down only the home button 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.130
 for another fifteen seconds 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.660
 here in this case it was enough 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.850
 even less because itunes and it's already there 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.090
 warned that there is an ipod touch imo in 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:31.160
 dfu mode and then back to itunes e 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:33.990
 we open to the reds as an administrator 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.880
 perfect was we click on the type of 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.570
 our device in this case in the 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:43.040
 products 4 and will put a little end of f 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:45.210
 all we have to do is wait 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.300
 perfect we do ok 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.580
 close and open itunes 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.930
 now we ignore this message that gives us 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.540
 windows the program works 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.750
 correctly we hold down the key 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.640
 keyboard shift and click on 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:04.380
 restore the pods and select the 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:07.580
 firmware 6.1 opened and we wait for the 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.580
 recovery procedure 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.950
 ok now ignore any error 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.430
 vi from itunes 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:54.700
 but the important thing is that your ai 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:57.790
 device has been restored by os 6.1 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:00.340
 point 2 I will now perform a configuration 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:03.310
 very narrow in the sense that I don't 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.280
 will connect to wifi not not and not 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.830
 I'll log in with my apple id 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:11.950
 to make the configuration faster 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.900
 but I recommend you complete it 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.030
 I don't complete it 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.650
 unfortunately I am obliged to connect 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:22.480
 to the network because otherwise I don't 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.290
 would activate the ipod so I connect to the 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.830
 network 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:28.480
 ok let's do the next one on 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.280
 location services lo 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.140
 we configure as the new ipod and mi 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.580
 I recommend 

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:36.040
 I ignore the passage of the apple you 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.420
 I recommend you to log in 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.600
 with your apple 

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:43.060
 we send and start using ipod touch 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.950
 and as you see mounts to a version 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:49.240
 clean that clearly will be 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:50.950
 skillful jailbreak of ios 6.1 like 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.380
 you will travel impossible to return to the 6th 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:55.300
 point 1.2 but it is possible to fear 6.1 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.070
 pretty much the same thing if you are then 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.320
 interested in performing the jailbreak 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:01.240
 just click here 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.430
 on this video and you will be taken back to 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.250
 my video tutorial on how to run the 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:09.070
 it 6.16 point untethered jailbreak 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.419
 1.2 and hope that I liked 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.490
 that it was useful to you as always vi 

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:13.810
 remember to subscribe to canalis on twitter 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.370

 Hi everyone
