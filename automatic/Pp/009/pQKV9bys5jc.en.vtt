00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
going to discuss now is the IT band er

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.930 
going to discuss now is the IT band er
the<00:00:14.969> iliotibial<00:00:15.389> band<00:00:16.550> most<00:00:17.550> people<00:00:17.850> are

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
the iliotibial band most people are

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.880 
the iliotibial band most people are
familiar<00:00:18.029> with<00:00:18.330> this<00:00:18.600> it's<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.380> band<00:00:19.619> on<00:00:19.800> the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
familiar with this it's the band on the

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.980 
familiar with this it's the band on the
side<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.400> lake<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.820> lot<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.300> runners<00:00:21.539> dance

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990

with<00:00:22.230> Labbe<00:00:22.590> issues<00:00:22.949> with<00:00:23.160> this<00:00:23.340> when<00:00:23.939> we're

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
with Labbe issues with this when we're

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.450 
with Labbe issues with this when we're
talking<00:00:24.420> about<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.750> IT<00:00:24.930> band<00:00:25.410> it's<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.160> thick

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
talking about the IT band it's a thick

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.400 
talking about the IT band it's a thick
fiber<00:00:26.910> structure<00:00:27.330> here<00:00:27.660> on<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.840> side<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.170> the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
fiber structure here on the side of the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.620 
fiber structure here on the side of the
link<00:00:28.590> but<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.130> actually<00:00:29.310> ties<00:00:29.760> down<00:00:30.090> into<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
link but it actually ties down into the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.630 
link but it actually ties down into the
knee<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.080> into<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.679> structures<00:00:32.070> above<00:00:32.430> on

knee and into the structures above on
the<00:00:32.669> side<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.210> hip<00:00:33.390> here<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:34.170> ties<00:00:34.350> into

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
the side of the hip here it ties into

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.340 
the side of the hip here it ties into
the<00:00:34.739> TfL<00:00:35.340> we<00:00:35.880> have<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.149> glute<00:00:36.360> medius<00:00:36.600> here

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.250 
the TfL we have the glute medius here
basically<00:00:38.129> any<00:00:39.059> problems<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.690> may<00:00:39.780> arise<00:00:39.899> in

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
basically any problems that may arise in

this area between the knee and the hip

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.540 
this area between the knee and the hip
will<00:00:42.660> involve<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.050> IT<00:00:43.320> band<00:00:43.500> usually<00:00:43.950> some

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
will involve the IT band usually some

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.040 
will involve the IT band usually some
people<00:00:44.820> will<00:00:44.940> form<00:00:45.149> restrictions<00:00:45.809> between

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
people will form restrictions between

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.470 
people will form restrictions between
the<00:00:46.469> band<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.340> quads<00:00:47.640> here<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.059> lateral

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
the band and the quads here the lateral

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.299 
the band and the quads here the lateral
part<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.930> quads<00:00:49.170> if<00:00:49.500> there's<00:00:50.160> any

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
part of the quads if there's any

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
slightly off the table here and we're

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.480 
slightly off the table here and we're
going<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.330> start<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.689> drop<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.080> down<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.530> as<00:01:17.310> we

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
going to start to drop it down and as we

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.730 
going to start to drop it down and as we
do<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:18.170> you're<00:01:19.170> going<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.350> start<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.650> feel

do this you're going to start to feel

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.469 
do this you're going to start to feel
tension<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.460> through<00:01:20.610> here<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.299> might

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
tension and through here you might

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.020 
tension and through here you might
notice<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.170> leg<00:01:22.380> will<00:01:22.590> stay<00:01:22.830> up<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.310> some

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
notice that the leg will stay up in some

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.980 
notice that the leg will stay up in some
people<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:25.350> will<00:01:25.470> drop<00:01:25.680> quite<00:01:26.070> down<00:01:26.990> there's

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
people it will drop quite down there's

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.050 
people it will drop quite down there's
quite<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> wide<00:01:28.920> range<00:01:29.280> here<00:01:29.549> but<00:01:29.759> what<00:01:29.909> we're

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
quite a wide range here but what we're

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.760 
quite a wide range here but what we're
looking<00:01:30.299> for<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.659> restriction<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.590> might

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
looking for is restriction it might

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.890 
looking for is restriction it might
elicit<00:01:32.040> pain<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.729> area<00:01:33.090> but<00:01:33.509> usually

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
elicit pain in this area but usually

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.210 
elicit pain in this area but usually
it's<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.110> range<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.470> motion<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:34.979> will<00:01:35.100> let

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
it's the range of motion that will let

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.190 
it's the range of motion that will let
you<00:01:35.400> know<00:01:35.430> if<00:01:35.610> there's<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.909> problem<00:01:36.060> or<00:01:36.390> not<00:01:36.570> so

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
you know if there's a problem or not so

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.219 
you know if there's a problem or not so
we're<00:01:37.320> bringing<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:37.680> down<00:01:38.840> and<00:01:39.840> as<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.110> can

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
we're bringing this down and as you can

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.649 
we're bringing this down and as you can
see<00:01:40.290> here<00:01:40.740> we've<00:01:41.340> got<00:01:41.369> quitting<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.270> range<00:01:42.479> of

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
see here we've got quitting the range of

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.200 
see here we've got quitting the range of
motion<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.619> was<00:01:43.740> short<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.189> contracted<00:01:44.759> we

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
motion that was short and contracted we

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.730 
motion that was short and contracted we
probably<00:01:45.479> get<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:45.960> far<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.409> there'd<00:01:46.590> be

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
probably get this far and there'd be

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.609 
probably get this far and there'd be

over<00:02:06.350> a<00:02:06.560> common<00:02:07.550> stretch<00:02:07.790> to<00:02:07.910> -<00:02:08.119> you<00:02:08.300> see<00:02:08.509> in

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
over a common stretch to - you see in

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.710 
over a common stretch to - you see in
Pilates<00:02:09.710> and<00:02:09.830> yoga<00:02:09.890> classes<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:10.700> we're<00:02:11.600> in<00:02:11.660> a

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
Pilates and yoga classes and we're in a

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.990 
Pilates and yoga classes and we're in a
little<00:02:12.560> bit<00:02:12.650> of<00:02:12.770> a<00:02:12.830> different<00:02:13.190> twist<00:02:13.670> on<00:02:13.970> it

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
little bit of a different twist on it

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.850 
little bit of a different twist on it
here<00:02:14.360> pun<00:02:15.230> intended

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
here pun intended

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.949 
here pun intended
so<00:02:16.460> when<00:02:16.730> we're<00:02:16.880> here<00:02:17.090> we're<00:02:17.390> actually<00:02:17.630> going

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
so when we're here we're actually going

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.360 
so when we're here we're actually going
to<00:02:18.110> normally<00:02:18.470> we<00:02:18.560> think<00:02:18.590> of<00:02:18.800> this<00:02:18.950> is<00:02:19.130> actually

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
to normally we think of this is actually

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.140 
to normally we think of this is actually
stretching<00:02:19.700> out<00:02:19.820> the<00:02:19.940> back

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
stretching out the back

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.780 
stretching out the back
the<00:02:20.420> last<00:02:20.660> external<00:02:21.200> rotators<00:02:21.770> but<00:02:22.610> when

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
the last external rotators but when

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.010 
the last external rotators but when
you're<00:02:22.880> in<00:02:23.000> this<00:02:23.120> position<00:02:23.300> where<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:23.810> cross

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
you're in this position where you cross

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.320 
you're in this position where you cross
one<00:02:24.230> leg<00:02:24.440> over<00:02:24.500> we<00:02:25.250> can<00:02:25.370> also<00:02:25.520> stretch<00:02:25.970> over

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
one leg over we can also stretch over

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.210 
one leg over we can also stretch over
and<00:02:26.540> stretch<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:27.050> bottom<00:02:27.350> of<00:02:27.440> either<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.740> TfL

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
and stretch the bottom of either the TfL

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.670 
and stretch the bottom of either the TfL
the<00:02:28.490> glutes<00:02:28.700> here<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:29.660> what<00:02:29.780> we<00:02:29.900> do<00:02:30.110> is<00:02:30.380> we

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
the glutes here and what we do is we

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.840 
the glutes here and what we do is we
basically<00:02:30.800> bring<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.310> into<00:02:31.400> it<00:02:31.670> whatever

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
basically bring it into it whatever

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.810 
basically bring it into it whatever
maximum<00:02:32.330> stretches<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:32.989> then<00:02:33.709> we<00:02:33.950> resist<00:02:34.700> it

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
maximum stretches and then we resist it

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.490 
maximum stretches and then we resist it
with<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:35.000> arm<00:02:35.150> pushing<00:02:35.840> over<00:02:36.200> in<00:02:36.350> this

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
with the arm pushing over in this

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.740 
with the arm pushing over in this
direction<00:02:36.940> okay<00:02:37.940> we<00:02:38.209> do<00:02:38.330> that<00:02:38.480> for<00:02:38.600> maybe

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
direction okay we do that for maybe

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.110 
direction okay we do that for maybe
about<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:38.959> count<00:02:39.230> of<00:02:39.320> eight<00:02:39.410> now<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.940> might

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
about a count of eight now you might

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.670 
about a count of eight now you might
notice<00:02:41.239> you<00:02:41.510> may<00:02:41.630> not<00:02:41.780> be<00:02:41.870> feeling<00:02:42.140> too<00:02:42.440> much

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
notice you may not be feeling too much

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.640 
notice you may not be feeling too much
on<00:02:42.890> there<00:02:43.040> and<00:02:43.390> after<00:02:44.390> it<00:02:44.540> counts<00:02:44.930> you<00:02:45.440> try

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
on there and after it counts you try

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.320 
on there and after it counts you try
every<00:02:45.860> eight<00:02:45.920> over<00:02:46.070> as<00:02:46.130> far<00:02:46.280> as<00:02:46.370> you<00:02:46.459> can<00:02:46.670> and

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
every eight over as far as you can and

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.150 
every eight over as far as you can and
you<00:02:47.420> may<00:02:47.540> find<00:02:47.720> well<00:02:47.989> maybe<00:02:48.350> that's<00:02:48.739> not<00:02:48.830> quite

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
you may find well maybe that's not quite

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.130 
you may find well maybe that's not quite
uh<00:02:49.400> quite<00:02:49.610> getting<00:02:49.970> it<00:02:50.150> yet<00:02:50.300> so<00:02:50.810> what<00:02:50.930> you<00:02:51.020> do

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140

is you have a partner and they basically
take<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.300> leg<00:02:53.480> here<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:53.930> it<00:02:54.590> helped<00:02:54.830> to

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
take the leg here and it helped to

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.680 
take the leg here and it helped to
reinforce<00:02:55.130> the<00:02:55.489> back<00:02:55.670> and<00:02:55.970> bring<00:02:56.180> it<00:02:56.300> over<00:02:56.390> are

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690

you<00:02:56.780> feeling<00:02:57.020> that<00:02:57.140> your<00:02:57.320> knee<00:02:57.530> okay<00:02:58.340> so<00:02:58.489> you

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
you feeling that your knee okay so you

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.490 
you feeling that your knee okay so you
might<00:02:59.030> want<00:02:59.810> to<00:02:59.870> bet<00:03:00.110> a<00:03:00.140> little<00:03:00.320> bit<00:03:00.410> of

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
might want to bet a little bit of

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.560 
might want to bet a little bit of
stretch<00:03:00.739> there<00:03:00.950> okay<00:03:01.250> and<00:03:01.430> again<00:03:02.239> you<00:03:02.390> hold

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
stretch there okay and again you hold

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.900 
stretch there okay and again you hold
that<00:03:02.810> and<00:03:03.050> in<00:03:03.170> this<00:03:03.320> case<00:03:03.620> what<00:03:04.280> you<00:03:04.310> do<00:03:04.550> is<00:03:04.790> you

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
that and in this case what you do is you

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.259 
that and in this case what you do is you
push<00:03:05.150> against<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:06.680> other<00:03:06.890> person's<00:03:07.310> hand<00:03:07.610> for

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
push against the other person's hand for

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:09.880 
push against the other person's hand for
about<00:03:08.420> a<00:03:08.450> count<00:03:08.690> of<00:03:08.750> eight<00:03:08.840> so<00:03:09.410> in<00:03:09.500> this<00:03:09.590> case<00:03:09.769> I

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
about a count of eight so in this case I

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.199 
about a count of eight so in this case I
would<00:03:09.950> get<00:03:10.100> Julie<00:03:10.310> to<00:03:10.459> push<00:03:10.670> your<00:03:10.880> leg<00:03:11.030> out

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
would get Julie to push your leg out

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.380 
would get Julie to push your leg out
this<00:03:11.450> way<00:03:11.690> get<00:03:12.440> good<00:03:12.980> good<00:03:13.190> good<00:03:13.340> and<00:03:13.610> you<00:03:14.269> can

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
this way get good good good and you can

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.180 
this way get good good good and you can
just<00:03:14.600> feel<00:03:14.750> muscle<00:03:15.440> contraction<00:03:15.890> right<00:03:16.040> now

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
just feel muscle contraction right now

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.590 
just feel muscle contraction right now
we<00:03:16.370> do<00:03:16.489> that<00:03:16.640> for<00:03:16.730> about<00:03:16.790> eight<00:03:17.000> counts<00:03:17.420> and

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
we do that for about eight counts and

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.930 
we do that for about eight counts and
then<00:03:18.140> we<00:03:18.260> release<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:18.920> they're<00:03:19.670> just<00:03:19.790> a

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
then we release and they're just a

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.420 
then we release and they're just a
little<00:03:20.630> too<00:03:20.720> far<00:03:20.959> and<00:03:21.200> slowly<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:22.160> slowly

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
little too far and slowly and slowly

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.990 
little too far and slowly and slowly
move<00:03:22.910> into<00:03:23.060> that<00:03:24.400> that's<00:03:25.400> excellent

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
move into that that's excellent

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.600 
move into that that's excellent
it<00:03:26.660> is<00:03:26.780> this<00:03:26.870> create<00:03:27.140> a<00:03:27.230> great<00:03:27.620> stretch<00:03:28.010> we're

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
it is this create a great stretch we're

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.050 
it is this create a great stretch we're
not<00:03:28.700> just<00:03:28.850> attea<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.810> tibia<00:03:30.470> man<00:03:30.650> but<00:03:31.340> also<00:03:31.519> we

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
not just attea the tibia man but also we

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.520 
not just attea the tibia man but also we
start<00:03:32.269> getting<00:03:32.360> up<00:03:32.570> into<00:03:32.720> glutamine<00:03:33.230> here

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
start getting up into glutamine here

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.920 
start getting up into glutamine here
because<00:03:34.190> we're<00:03:34.310> traveling<00:03:34.430> into<00:03:34.850> fashion<00:03:35.450> we

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
because we're traveling into fashion we

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.199 
because we're traveling into fashion we
don't<00:03:36.080> really<00:03:36.320> separate<00:03:36.980> things<00:03:37.250> we<00:03:37.850> start<00:03:38.060> to

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
don't really separate things we start to

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:39.220 
don't really separate things we start to
see<00:03:38.360> all<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:38.630> different<00:03:38.720> connections

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
see all the different connections

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.330 
see all the different connections
between<00:03:39.380> different<00:03:39.560> areas<00:03:39.799> now<00:03:40.100> one<00:03:40.310> area

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
between different areas now one area

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.340 
between different areas now one area
affects<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.060> next<00:03:41.410> great<00:03:42.410> little<00:03:42.650> stretch

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
affects the next great little stretch

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.650 
affects the next great little stretch
okay<00:03:45.350> we're<00:03:46.250> going<00:03:46.370> to<00:03:46.430> talk<00:03:46.640> about<00:03:46.910> here<00:03:47.120> in

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
okay we're going to talk about here in

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.289 
okay we're going to talk about here in
terms<00:03:47.959> of<00:03:48.079> stretching<00:03:48.410> out<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.590> active<00:03:48.950> and

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
terms of stretching out the active and

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.180 
terms of stretching out the active and
quite<00:03:50.299> often<00:03:50.510> we'll<00:03:50.840> give<00:03:51.200> patients

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
quite often we'll give patients

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.560 
quite often we'll give patients
different<00:03:52.820> instructions<00:03:53.239> for<00:03:53.360> different

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
different instructions for different

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.449 
different instructions for different
exercise<00:03:53.900> we<00:03:54.650> find<00:03:54.860> they're<00:03:55.040> not<00:03:55.190> very

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
exercise we find they're not very

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.759 
exercise we find they're not very
effective<00:03:55.760> so<00:03:56.540> if<00:03:56.720> you<00:03:56.810> do<00:03:56.930> get<00:03:57.079> a<00:03:57.110> chance<00:03:57.170> to

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
effective so if you do get a chance to

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.490 
effective so if you do get a chance to
work<00:03:58.160> with<00:03:58.220> somebody

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
work with somebody

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
work with somebody

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
you're going to stretch out the band

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.270 
you're going to stretch out the band

telling me I was able to basically

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.170 
telling me I was able to basically
isolate<00:04:08.860> different<00:04:08.980> areas<00:04:09.490> and<00:04:09.730> get

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
isolate different areas and get

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.750 
isolate different areas and get
different<00:04:10.360> areas<00:04:10.750> to<00:04:10.780> move<00:04:11.140> quite<00:04:11.920> well<00:04:12.280> it's

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
different areas to move quite well it's

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.460
