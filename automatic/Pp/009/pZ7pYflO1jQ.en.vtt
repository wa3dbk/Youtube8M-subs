00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
kind of difficult to get but maybe a

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.590 
kind of difficult to get but maybe a
little<00:01:55.590> bit<00:01:55.829> too<00:01:56.100> easy<00:01:56.340> because<00:01:57.149> some<00:01:57.329> people

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
little bit too easy because some people

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.719 
little bit too easy because some people
get<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.960> like<00:01:58.079> on<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.350> first<00:01:58.619> day<00:01:59.009> or<00:01:59.250> two<00:01:59.460> and
