00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:12.770
 greet friends my name is denis 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:15.049
 afraid you are on the fifa channel 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.030
 life.ru and now we will consider 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.950
 top options are top it 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.900
 the exercise is aimed at developing our 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.370
 back muscles 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.470
 exercise refers to the base because 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.200
 what works besides the elbow joint 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.260
 still brachial respectively involved 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.539
 in the work a huge amount of muscle besides 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.540
 back muscles of the community running biceps and 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:37.790
 Now our task is to learn as much as possible 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.430
 involve just the person in the job we 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.380
 turning off for work biceps and for this 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.410
 we need to use different 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.620
 grip options that is what grip we have already 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.720
 use the more we work 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:54.630
 biceps the wider grip we use 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.580
 running back on the other hand wider 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.620
 grip we use the shorter we 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.210
 imagine the amplitude if we have 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.490
 very wide grip what short 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.309
 amplitude if we have a narrow grip there 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.380
 slab to substantially more but if we 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.630
 make narrow hold 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.640
 biceps we start off 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.950
 do not interfere with active work 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.080
 perform exercises so our task 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.750
 to find 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.170
 I advise you an intermediate position 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.570
 try different grip options 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.790
 start with the middle then you can 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.880
 try very wide then you can 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.270
 go on very narrow personally I more often 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:38.490
 total perform this exercise average 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:42.390
 grip looks like it's all about this 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.990
 in a way that is also important as in any 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.800
 exercise is important that there was a deflection 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.340
 lower back 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.390
 if i don't have a backbend 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.970
 respectively back muscles a little 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.320
 fully shrink as soon as I 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.540
 leave buttocks 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.690
 going forward no deflection appears 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.600
 lower back muscles begin to fully 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.240
 shrink the first moment the second moment 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.800
 in order to 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.420
 elbow did not go back and it is important to me 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.160
 so that elbows go back if i want 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.490
 so that it is the back muscles that they contract 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.520
 biceps for that i need to deviate 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.010
 back and here is a very important nuance 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.440
 which practically nobody in the hall 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.650
 abide by people deviate forward and 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.520
 accordingly begin to pull the rope 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:32.940
 at an angle to yourself and the cable should pass 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:36.390
 vertically up to the tech 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.540
 we had the right there need to move up 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.380
 closer projectile bend more 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.590
 lower back 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:47.340
 lean back so that when 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:51.750
 we will pull the cable down to the vector 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:55.140
 strength we passed between our breasts 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.209
 between our spine and going along 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.760
 spinal column down with all of 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.620
 this is ours 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.260
 wrists should be perpendicular 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.140
 and u should pass along this one too 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.310
 here is a kind of plane 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.459
 let me show you this 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.049
 was clearly visible 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.720
 here I seem to bend my back 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:19.950
 right i'm starting to pull it wrong 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.670
 i don't have to back too much 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.430
 deviate 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.470
 here's how the cable goes vertically down 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.319
 should enter the spinal column exactly 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.269
 so and moreover in the same plane 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.000
 should be my wrist 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.790
 for this i have to very much 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.959
 bend back and move up to 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.769
 simulator closer 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:43.040
 only then my elbows are inserted back 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.629
 and only then does it happen to me 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.750
 quality 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:53.040
 contraction of the back muscles upper points i up 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.480
 end not throwing the handle to 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.170
 I had tension in my muscles 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.120
 backs 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:02.819
 the top point i keep tense and 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.950
 stretched at the lowest point I pause 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:09.680
 a second for me to have 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:16.099
 peak exhalation reduction on exhalation effort 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:19.099
 pause-pause stretch exhale pause-pause 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.099
 stretched out 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.460
 try various modifications wider 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.890
 there may already be some kind of person 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.050
 very convenient reverse grip when you 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.750
 use reverse grip you have more 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.910
 biceps are involved in work but if your 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.440
 biceps 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.590
 poorly developed if initially 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.870
 accustomed themselves to do work 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.510
 at the expense of the back, even the reverse grip is not 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.980
 it will harm the exercise even 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.410
 I am using a reverse grip it anyway 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:52.530
 back muscles will contract they biceps 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:55.440
 so all these things are very individual 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:58.140
 and you need to try to memorize everything 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.240
 the main loin we should have 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:03.050
 we should be arched 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.610
 closer to the projectile 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.520
 force vector that must go 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:11.640
 vertically down not at an angle a 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.700
 vertically down and along this vector 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:19.320
 forces must be our elbows our 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:21.840
 wrists ie we must be completely 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.120
 in the direction of one motion vector not 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.400
 should be so that elbows go in one 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.140
 the side and the force vector is the other 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.420
 our spine is tilted 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.670
 in general in the third direction all this should 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:35.190
 be synchronized by one vector 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:38.300
 only then will the maximum 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:41.100
 qualitatively contract back muscles 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.680
 exercise can also be performed for 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.970
 the head then the load will shift with 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.810
 middle back 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.180
 top 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.070
 his back is a more professional thing 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:55.250
 I recommend you start to learn 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:55.250
 technique with a classic medium grip and 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:04.850
 pull the chest handle this 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.850
 thrust upper unit baby
