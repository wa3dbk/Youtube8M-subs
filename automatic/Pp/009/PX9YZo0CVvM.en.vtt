00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.410
 How about a good fellow, well, look 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.899
 we just did an installation of 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.450
 tdt antenna and the last point to 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.790
 take action is the final shot I've 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.040
 replaced because the shot that he had the 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.370
 he raised many losses but complicated in 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.200
 those using the cable that is normally 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:23.020
 purchase in hardware stores 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:26.040
 here we have no or bad sign 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:29.620
 we have this channel that is telecinco 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.960
 well without having a field medium this 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.510
 normally you do not usually have yourselves 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.580
 you can not have good access if by 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.430
 it has a lot of cost with which it is a 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:42.129
 very technical apparatus without using the means of 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:46.570
 field and simply replacing the 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:51.010
 then let's see what we remove the 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.190
 old and we put this cable and go 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.190
 here 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.629
 and we connect it to the entrance 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.690
 from the TV 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.480
 What's happening 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.450
 we already have working in this channel 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.910
 was very low signal or not even 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.500
 had sealed and now we're going to do the 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.690
 try the middle of the field so that 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.640
 you see exactly the differences that 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.640
 they are good enough to remove them 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.789
 I'm going to place the old good of what 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.799
 I'll have it here for 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:32.770
 measure on the meter and let's see the 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.929
 differences that exist in the cable 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.430
 right now I've channeled the channel here 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:43.830
 69 what antenna3 and I take out my cable 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.830
 and I'm going to connect it here to the meter 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:55.390
 the signs as you see the cn not even 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:58.780
 appears the power does not reach 40 elmer 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.060
 20 and then already the other values â€‹â€‹are 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.830
 below normative the bar that 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.300
 normally he has to be here at 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.940
 minus 7 look how strange doing voucher or 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:13.300
 be that there you have the sample of what 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.530
 is the operation of the power that 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.980
 transmit the cable now let's 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.980
 change it 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.420
 let's put a cable of ours that we have 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.340
 made manually 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.340
 with shielded connectors 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.079
 Y 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.170
 let's plug it in here 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:40.200
 the differences are in 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:43.200
 tremendous we have gone from 40 to 48 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.140
 decibels and from having a 20 meter to 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.110
 25 now it's how well the level of 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.629
 sign with the bar completely removed 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.019
 and the ub see in -7 that's how it has to 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:57.050
 to be 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:59.960
 Well, nothing now with the subject of 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.720
 of 4g that will come on January 1 the 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.120
 digital dividend there will be many 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.800
 problems with cables and especially 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.950
 with cable of this type of 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.230
 Features cables that do not have 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.470
 armored connectors that are section 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.530
 very small and not even 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.750
 transmit the tdt signal by copper 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.740
 but they have a kind of aluminum 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:28.940
 inside and with very little mesh so if 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.930
 you have a problem with tdt here in the 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.940
 living place 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.370
 The first thing you have to do is 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.430
 change the cable put a high wire 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.830
 quality 3 and if you can put connectors 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.170
 armored much better then nothing 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.030
 colleagues as always thanks for 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.670
 be there and see you in the next 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.290
 video tutorial a hug and knows what 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.010
 They have to do 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.010
