00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.510
 hello to everyone the same moped is shorter 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.360
 I missed one important thing 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:15.660
 remember when unpacking the engine inside 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.499
 the box was this here relyushka so 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.720
 it turned out vilyushka was there for good reason 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:23.849
 it turned out that we have a generator here 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.439
 this motor is single phase 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:31.229
 Well, I mean, the two wires are these 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.919
 of which phase which one is zero value 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:35.190
 does not have 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:39.390
 it matters that they do not communicate 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.339
 with weight like on old engines on 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.570
 whether the old generator was moving 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:47.789
 dot sound so let's say 1 coil 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.469
 high voltage which provides 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.719
 disk and the second feeds the onboard network 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:58.980
 the bottom line is that we would leave the engines 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.370
 two phase generator I mean green 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.390
 the wire 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.360
 0 and 2 phases from this one 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.110
 We were fed backlight and distant neighbor 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.590
 shine 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.020
 but now we have a single phase generator and 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.820
 Naturally here I am so not on it 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.240
 will work in the box was single phase 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.240
 relay 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.460
 She came here charging on the battery 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.460
 but there is one problem 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:04.460
 we have high beam and lights 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.540
 powered by yellow wire and due 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.270
 the relay controller starts working 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.880
 wrong because it is served on 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.600
 additional load on one phase 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.990
 we need to disassemble the headlamp and in this 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.260
 mess 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:23.430
 we will need to find this one here 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:28.410
 with three wires and simple ordinary 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.220
 the yellow wire is this one by the way 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.960
 this wire 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:37.380
 it goes directly from the generator and on 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.060
 he goes to the right control panel well 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.910
 i.e 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:45.750
 dimensions light and starter button 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.930
 And this here is the wire we need from chips 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.320
 pull out but I'm already from here like 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.700
 see from the call fell 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.720
 put so little heat shrink 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.810
 happily connect and see how 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.680
 Does the headlight work and is it charging 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:09.030
 the battery is on, turning on the light 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:13.670
 contact and push it into this chip 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.670
 This is the way the chip comes from the ignition 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:28.920
 Now turn on the ignition 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:35.300
 here's how we see the battery from the drive 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.300
 Is the light already strong enough ? 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.360
 Well, now let's try without a battery 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:21.660
 Well 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:25.139
 I connected a multimeter shows 12 4 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:28.949
 volt battery connected through 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:34.139
 fuse now factory moped 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:36.180
 turn on the high beam and see if it goes 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:41.400
 we should have a normal charge 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:43.949
 somewhere plus minus that's 13 6 to 14 there are two 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.160
 and 14 3 I also have a ceiling that should 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.160
 charge 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.050
 but here's a little refinement 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.720
 I had to do that is to change 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.310
 religion regulator and reinstall one 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.390
 posting 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:02.370
 Well, basically everything is here for the price of this one 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.000
 here is a relay controller worth approximately 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.310
 somewhere 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:11.160
 and 20 or 30 hryvnia and I do not remember exactly 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:13.170
 but basically there is nothing more than me well 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.750
 what here here short for today 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:19.130
 I have a video for now take care of everything 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.130
 technique all bye
