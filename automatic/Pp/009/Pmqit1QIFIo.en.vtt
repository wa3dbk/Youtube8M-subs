00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.410 
can only be found in dungeons you cannot
craft<00:01:34.439> them<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.950> they<00:01:35.310> can<00:01:35.460> also<00:01:35.670> be<00:01:35.970> found<00:01:36.210> by

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
craft them and they can also be found by

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.749 
craft them and they can also be found by
fishing<00:01:36.869> as<00:01:37.259> treasure<00:01:37.710> which<00:01:38.310> i<00:01:38.430> think<00:01:38.490> is

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
fishing as treasure which i think is

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.370 
fishing as treasure which i think is
really<00:01:38.909> cool<00:01:39.210> instead<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:39.780> fishing<00:01:40.200> and

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
really cool instead of just fishing and

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.499 
really cool instead of just fishing and
getting<00:01:40.860> those<00:01:41.040> fish<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.610> can<00:01:41.939> fish<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.390> get

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
getting those fish you can fish and get

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.450 
getting those fish you can fish and get
some<00:01:42.659> nametags<00:01:43.110> I'd<00:01:43.350> be<00:01:43.470> very<00:01:43.710> very<00:01:43.829> awesome

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
some nametags I'd be very very awesome

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.130 
some nametags I'd be very very awesome
but<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.640> think<00:01:44.850> nametags<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.689> definitely

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
but I think nametags is definitely

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.389 
but I think nametags is definitely
something<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.590> would<00:01:46.740> be<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> great<00:01:47.189> feature

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
something that would be a great feature

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.760 
something that would be a great feature
to<00:01:47.700> come<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:47.970> our<00:01:48.060> next<00:01:48.090> update<00:01:48.509> for<00:01:48.960> Minecraft

to come in our next update for Minecraft

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.190 
to come in our next update for Minecraft
being<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.250> will<00:01:50.729> most<00:01:51.090> likely<00:01:51.299> get<00:01:51.659> horses

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
being that will most likely get horses

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.139 
being that will most likely get horses
it's<00:01:52.740> only<00:01:53.070> right<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.610> we<00:01:53.670> should<00:01:53.939> be<00:01:54.030> able

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
it's only right that we should be able

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.700 
it's only right that we should be able
to<00:01:54.299> name<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.840> don't<00:01:54.899> think<00:01:55.290> it's<00:01:55.439> something

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
to name and I don't think it's something

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.770 
to name and I don't think it's something
that's<00:01:55.979> too<00:01:56.490> crazy<00:01:56.729> look<00:01:57.060> at<00:01:57.149> happy<00:01:57.450> feet<00:01:57.630> he

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
that's too crazy look at happy feet he

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.959 
that's too crazy look at happy feet he
just<00:01:57.960> walked<00:01:58.170> right<00:01:58.320> off<00:01:58.439> away<00:01:59.009> from<00:01:59.369> me<00:01:59.490> but

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
just walked right off away from me but

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.760 
just walked right off away from me but
yeah<00:02:00.090> name<00:02:00.540> tag<00:02:00.810> shouldn't<00:02:01.079> be<00:02:01.140> something<00:02:01.409> too

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
yeah name tag shouldn't be something too

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.740 
yeah name tag shouldn't be something too
crazy<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.700> think<00:02:02.759> it'd<00:02:02.969> be<00:02:03.000> very<00:02:03.149> awesome

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
crazy and I think it'd be very awesome

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.600 
crazy and I think it'd be very awesome
