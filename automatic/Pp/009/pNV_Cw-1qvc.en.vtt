for AutoCAD mechanical my name is Matias
and<00:00:05.480> this<00:00:05.959> time<00:00:06.229> I'll<00:00:06.500> show<00:00:06.770> you<00:00:06.830> some<00:00:07.160> AutoCAD

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:07.609

this drawing to make it look like this
in<00:00:12.920> the<00:00:13.330> end<00:00:14.330> we'll<00:00:14.570> have<00:00:14.600> a<00:00:14.750> top<00:00:15.050> view<00:00:15.350> and<00:00:15.560> a

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
in the end we'll have a top view and a

becomes<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.970> lot<00:01:27.120> easier<00:01:27.150> when<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.930> use<00:01:28.110> some

are quite a few options to choose from

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.060 
are quite a few options to choose from
that<00:01:32.850> means<00:01:33.660> you're<00:01:33.930> not<00:01:33.960> restricted<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.770> the

and I'm done all construction lines in
AutoCAD<00:02:09.270> mechanical<00:02:09.300> are<00:02:10.050> also

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
AutoCAD mechanical are also

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.360 
AutoCAD mechanical are also
automatically<00:02:11.190> drawn<00:02:11.550> on<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:12.030> same<00:02:12.240> layer

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
automatically drawn on the same layer

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.250 
automatically drawn on the same layer
now<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.520> only<00:02:14.670> takes<00:02:15.060> one<00:02:15.209> click<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:15.780> hide<00:02:15.990> them

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
now it only takes one click to hide them

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.260 
now it only takes one click to hide them
or<00:02:17.600> display<00:02:18.600> them<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.670> if<00:02:20.670> I<00:02:20.820> want<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.150> delete

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
or display them and if I want to delete

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.210 
or display them and if I want to delete
them<00:02:21.570> later<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:22.080> just<00:02:22.830> have<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.190> click<00:02:23.370> here

for example I can now simply use the

for example I can now simply use the
power<00:03:38.110> view<00:03:38.470> command<00:03:38.800> to<00:03:39.670> generate<00:03:39.879> the<00:03:40.239> front

view to a sectional view and we don't

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.230 
view to a sectional view and we don't
need<00:05:03.420> hidden<00:05:03.690> lines<00:05:03.870> for<00:05:04.140> that<00:05:04.260> I<00:05:05.060> start<00:05:06.060> with

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
need hidden lines for that I start with

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.150 
need hidden lines for that I start with
drawing<00:05:06.600> a<00:05:06.690> section<00:05:06.840> line

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
drawing a section line

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.760 
drawing a section line
I<00:05:09.420> select<00:05:10.420> the<00:05:10.570> end<00:05:10.750> points<00:05:11.140> of<00:05:11.230> the<00:05:11.290> section

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
I select the end points of the section

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.629 
I select the end points of the section
line

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.770

last<00:05:18.590> I<00:05:18.920> add<00:05:19.130> a<00:05:19.160> hatch<00:05:19.430> I<00:05:19.840> choose<00:05:20.840> the<00:05:21.050> hatch

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 
last I add a hatch I choose the hatch

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.310 
last I add a hatch I choose the hatch
type<00:05:21.590> and<00:05:21.890> simply<00:05:22.400> click<00:05:22.670> in<00:05:22.880> the<00:05:23.000> areas<00:05:23.450> where

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
and that's it we're done without drawing
