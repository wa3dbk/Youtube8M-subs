00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
much easier to push when you actually

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.760 
much easier to push when you actually
lift<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.880> barrow<00:01:39.090> system<00:01:39.509> up<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:40.110> makes<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.560> so

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
lift the barrow system up it makes it so
