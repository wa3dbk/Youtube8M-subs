00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.059
 the wind is beginning to arrive 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.129
 storms is over cañuelas in this 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.049
 moment and it's happening advancing on 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:17.090
 we will start to leave water and 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.560
 there you can see how it is likely that 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.410
 come the ring now let's show 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.699
 the images that we recorded but this is 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.800
 intense can be a 9 in intensity 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.420
 from this storm we are going to the walk 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.420
 because there is lightning falling everywhere 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.070
 well we are in the middle of a storm 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.719
 which is called super cell which is the 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.090
 storm that leaves hail that leaves 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.570
 severe weather most of the time and 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.370
 we are looking for a cloud that is in a 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.170
 lower level than the rest a cloud 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.030
 within the great storm a cloud 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.460
 particular could be the one that 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.640
 we are seeing there on the background about 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.280
 the horizon in which it seems to come down 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.310
 from a much larger cloud that has 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.409
 over good in that area is the 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.200
 possibility that this kind of 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.420
 storms generate tornadoes if given 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.910
 some tornado within this area is there 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.130
 on the side of that big cloud if in 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.500
 some time we can double the 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.950
 right let's do it to be able to is 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.100
 spend more time following that part 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.259
 of the storm that I repeat the most 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.819
 conflictive the most dangerous now 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.960
 We are coming out of the water area and 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:43.230
 again we are with the sky 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.840
 clear 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.880
 but 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.969
 We are careful because more than one cloud 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.280
 can charge rotation can rotate in 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:55.310
 lower levels we will continue 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.009
 observing the entire horizon 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.040
 I repeat this storm is not going good 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.170
 Aires is going to move further south but it's 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.000
 the area where we had to be 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.289
 attentive because a slight change of the 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.069
 address could leave us 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:12.170
 above the city ​​of Buenos Aires 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.790
 Well we just got out of cañuelas already 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.000
 they inform us that there are fallen trees 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.709
 cutting part of the route we hooked 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.440
 another storm and now we're going 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.380
 towards the most intense that will happen 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.239
 surely very close to lujan left san 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.400
 Andres de Giles and is moving 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.549
 to the east we are 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.010
 pressing moving us forward and 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.810
 coming forward we wanted to say some of 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.680
 the storms we said more intense of 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.700
 area 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.130
 We are close to Lujan and the 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.660
 storm moves towards the northeast is 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.319
 say we have to hurry up and get there 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.319
 to this area 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.480
 we are a little more than 20 km from the 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.880
 storm that we just leave behind and 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.310
 we grab another storm the meteors 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.250
 we say storm cell another cell 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.210
 look at this is a front of rafa at 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.240
 along the entire route 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.860
 they are almost 180 degrees 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.970
 storm that is advancing this front 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.270
 look from the west where the sun is 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.270
 are putting 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.230
 taking typical greenish colors and 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.990
 own from the previous moments many 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.290
 times that organize this cloud in general 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.069
 is called 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:29.310
 cloud in English is a cloud that advances 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.409
 ahead of the cold air is to say no 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.170
 you have to be a fortune-teller to know that in 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:37.410
 little less than 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.120
 five minutes here is going to start 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.670
 rain and strong first let's have 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.800
 a gust of intense wind that's what 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.380
 that separates the air that falls from the 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.599
 storm and move across the floor raising 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.440
 all the warm air that we are having 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:54.000
 now because there are almost 27 28 degrees 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.520
 because because previously a storm 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.900
 I refresh the zone but we wish it is 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:05.880
 moving forward notice how it is kind of 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:08.130
 shovel a kind of spatula and that's why 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.750
 it has that diagonal shape the first 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.350
 of the clouds those below and 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.470
 ahead another cloud over another 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.780
 cloud that confirms that you look now 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.500
 will begin to blow the wind from the south 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.500
 Attentive to 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.590
 the cameras that we are with these 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.530
 cameras that are watching here with these 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.630
 cameras is vain let's make a pass 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.010
 accelerated time later we're going to 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.020
 increase the playback speed 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.510
 so they can see how they move 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:40.140
 this camera on one side and this camera 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.610
 on the other whenever we do this 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.740
 We carry several cameras to be able 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.740
 capture the phenomenon of different places 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.440
 So that's the image that you get 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.860
 Ball wanted to give a clear finish me 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.870
 you say the bow of the report in that 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.910
 moment we were going to the air to 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.740
 the newscast already coming back at the moment 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.389
 in which the rainbow appeared just 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.250
 over the horizon that indicated that 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:31.800
 It had stopped raining on that side of the 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.330
 side more south of the storm but 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.440
 it had started to rain so 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.330
 intense 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.099
 that last storm the one that advanced from that 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.690
 way leaving water was the one that then 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:41.069
 affected the city of Buenos Aires what 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.220
 we said the report is going to happen very close 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:46.440
 of good luján and luján as we say 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.330
 Meteorologists charge in a few terms 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.169
 scientists had a bad time during 15 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.169
 minutes with lots of rain
