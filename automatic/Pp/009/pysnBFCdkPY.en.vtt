00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
flutter technique witches and this helps

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.800 
flutter technique witches and this helps
to<00:02:09.560> have<00:02:09.679> more<00:02:10.100> you<00:02:10.490> know<00:02:10.610> more<00:02:10.760> kick<00:02:11.210> off<00:02:11.420> on

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.070 
basic one if you will this is just
straight<00:03:25.800> 1<00:03:26.070> 1<00:03:26.490> 2<00:03:26.700> 3<00:03:26.730> 4<00:03:27.030> all<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.390> way<00:03:27.480> across<00:03:27.630> it

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
straight 1 1 2 3 4 all the way across it

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:45.830 
straight 1 1 2 3 4 all the way across it
up<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.440> neck<00:03:33.300> bring<00:03:33.810> back<00:03:44.690> all<00:03:45.690> right

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
up the neck bring back all right

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.090 
up the neck bring back all right
now<00:03:46.380> we're<00:03:46.500> going<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:46.650> try<00:03:46.800> that<00:03:46.980> other

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
now we're going to try that other

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.500 
now we're going to try that other
pattern<00:03:47.550> that<00:03:47.670> goes<00:03:47.820> 1<00:03:48.150> 2<00:03:48.180> 3<00:03:48.420> 4<00:03:48.750> 4<00:03:49.260> 3<00:03:49.530> 2<00:03:49.800> 1<00:03:50.300> 13<00:03:51.300> you

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
pattern that goes 1 2 3 4 4 3 2 1 13 you

00:03:51.510 --> 00:04:13.310 
pattern that goes 1 2 3 4 4 3 2 1 13 you
for<00:03:52.130> 1434<00:03:53.130> where<00:03:53.850> to<00:03:53.940> run<00:03:54.060> that<00:03:54.240> across

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.810 

the<00:04:14.320> next<00:04:14.560> one<00:04:14.680> was<00:04:14.830> the<00:04:14.950> position<00:04:15.400> switching

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
the next one was the position switching

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:33.020 
the next one was the position switching
switching<00:04:16.120> sorry

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.750 

all<00:04:33.840> right<00:04:34.040> following<00:04:35.040> that<00:04:35.100> was<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:35.490> crowd

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
all right following that was the crowd

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.760 
all right following that was the crowd
I'll<00:04:36.300> show<00:04:36.510> you<00:04:36.570> this<00:04:36.630> both<00:04:36.930> variations<00:04:37.320> this

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
is started with finger one and three and

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.450 
is started with finger one and three and
the<00:04:45.960> next<00:04:46.140> one<00:04:46.290> would<00:04:46.500> take<00:04:46.680> fingers<00:04:47.040> two<00:04:47.280> and

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
the next one would take fingers two and

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:55.010 
the next one would take fingers two and
four<00:04:47.730> starting<00:04:48.510> at<00:04:48.570> two<00:04:48.690> and<00:04:48.810> four<00:04:53.840> take<00:04:54.840> that

four starting at two and four take that
up<00:04:55.200> and<00:04:55.410> across<00:04:55.680> and<00:04:56.070> backwards<00:04:56.750> next

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
up and across and backwards next

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.950 
up and across and backwards next
exercise<00:04:58.170> was<00:04:58.410> spider<00:04:59.540> this<00:05:00.540> will<00:05:00.690> all<00:05:00.780> zoom

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
exercise was spider this will all zoom

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:22.670 
exercise was spider this will all zoom
in<00:05:01.140> a<00:05:01.170> little<00:05:01.320> more<00:05:21.140> little<00:05:22.140> tricky<00:05:22.380> going
