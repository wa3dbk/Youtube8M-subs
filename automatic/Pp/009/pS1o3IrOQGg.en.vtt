00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
in the bottom two I think in my mind I

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.429 
in the bottom two I think in my mind I
knew<00:01:16.740> from<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.250> two<00:01:17.580> previous<00:01:17.610> dances<00:01:18.570> that

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
knew from the two previous dances that

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.859 
knew from the two previous dances that
potentially<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.220> could<00:01:20.280> be<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> problem

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
potentially it could be a problem

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.429 
potentially it could be a problem
personally<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.619> know<00:01:23.030> blackpool<00:01:24.030> yeah<00:01:24.990> we

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
personally you know blackpool yeah we

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.109 
personally you know blackpool yeah we
will<00:01:25.619> kind<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.890> start<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.340> didn't<00:01:26.820> go<00:01:26.909> too<00:01:26.970> well

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
will kind of start it didn't go too well

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.179 
will kind of start it didn't go too well
and<00:01:27.450> then<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.720> week<00:01:27.869> after<00:01:28.020> smooth<00:01:28.530> only

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
and then the week after smooth only

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.520 
and then the week after smooth only
enough<00:01:29.369> stop<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:30.060> think<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:31.049> public's

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
enough stop so I think the public's

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.670 
enough stop so I think the public's
perception<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.780> the<00:01:33.780> celebrities<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.500> they're

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
perception of the celebrities is they're

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.340 
perception of the celebrities is they're
following<00:01:34.950> their<00:01:35.220> journey<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:36.200> we'd<00:01:37.200> had<00:01:37.320> a

different place with my you know me

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.570 
different place with my you know me
energy<00:03:13.290> actually<00:03:13.440> i<00:03:13.650> was<00:03:13.800> i<00:03:13.980> was<00:03:14.070> quite<00:03:14.280> down

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
the last three weeks and i think that

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.500 
the last three weeks and i think that

showed and had its you know effect on

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.380 
showed and had its you know effect on
performance<00:03:18.630> definitely<00:03:19.560> but<00:03:20.310> because<00:03:21.300> we

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
performance definitely but because we

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.850 
performance definitely but because we
are<00:03:21.480> birds<00:03:21.660> don't<00:03:21.750> need<00:03:21.960> the<00:03:22.080> finish<00:03:22.410> exactly

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860
