00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.120 

in<00:01:12.520> most<00:01:12.790> interesting<00:01:13.390> thing<00:01:13.630> is<00:01:14.110> the<00:01:14.860> switch

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
in most interesting thing is the switch

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.820 
in most interesting thing is the switch

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
on Papa for microphone though you can

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.040 
on Papa for microphone though you can
adjust<00:01:17.980> the<00:01:18.640> sound<00:01:18.880> settings<00:01:19.150> very<00:01:19.690> quickly

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
adjust the sound settings very quickly

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.440 
adjust the sound settings very quickly
we<00:01:21.010> have<00:01:21.130> three<00:01:21.430> different<00:01:21.670> sounds<00:01:22.120> ethics

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
we have three different sounds ethics

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.220 
we have three different sounds ethics
work<00:01:22.870> of<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.140> microphone<00:01:24.930> power<00:01:25.930> the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
work of the microphone power the

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.150 
work of the microphone power the
microphone<00:01:27.360> with<00:01:28.360> phantom<00:01:28.750> power<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.950> see

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
microphone with phantom power you see

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.790 
microphone with phantom power you see
easily<00:01:30.610> which<00:01:31.030> position<00:01:31.600> you<00:01:31.690> have<00:01:31.870> which

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
easily which position you have which

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.730 
easily which position you have which
makes<00:01:33.100> it<00:01:33.310> very<00:01:33.910> good<00:01:34.870> visible<00:01:35.410> in<00:01:36.310> front

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
makes it very good visible in front

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.670 
makes it very good visible in front
of<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.159> microphone<00:01:38.700> even<00:01:39.329> on<00:01:39.450> dark<00:01:39.659> stages

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
of the microphone even on dark stages

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.510 
of the microphone even on dark stages
so<00:01:42.340> we<00:01:42.520> have<00:01:42.700> fitness<00:01:43.690> signal<00:01:44.280> please<00:01:45.280> be

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
so we have fitness signal please be

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.660 
so we have fitness signal please be
inside<00:01:46.050> mixed<00:01:47.050> with<00:01:47.230> the<00:01:47.260> audio<00:01:47.650> signal<00:01:47.860> in<00:01:48.550> a

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
inside mixed with the audio signal in a

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.820 
inside mixed with the audio signal in a
transform<00:01:49.240> our<00:01:49.450> top<00:01:49.720> of<00:01:49.870> the<00:01:49.990> microphone<00:01:50.470> and

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
transform our top of the microphone and

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.780 
transform our top of the microphone and
it's<00:01:51.370> the<00:01:51.640> transformer<00:01:52.390> of<00:01:52.570> the<00:01:53.020> originality

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
it's the transformer of the originality

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.480 
it's the transformer of the originality
414<00:01:54.790> microphone<00:01:55.300> of<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.960> 70s<00:01:56.440> and<00:01:56.680> that's

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
414 microphone of the 70s and that's

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.810 
414 microphone of the 70s and that's
really<00:01:58.210> vintage<00:01:58.960> sounding<00:01:59.470> microphone<00:02:00.160> and

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
really vintage sounding microphone and

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.150 
really vintage sounding microphone and
also<00:02:01.180> a<00:02:01.210> making<00:02:01.600> dynamic<00:02:02.020> mode<00:02:02.229> the

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
also a making dynamic mode the

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.060 
also a making dynamic mode the
microphone<00:02:03.700> thing<00:02:04.540> is<00:02:04.690> always<00:02:05.070> connected

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
microphone thing is always connected

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.060 
microphone thing is always connected
with<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.640> transformer<00:02:07.270> it's<00:02:07.630> also<00:02:07.930> a<00:02:08.140> dynamic

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
with the transformer it's also a dynamic

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.420 
with the transformer it's also a dynamic
mode<00:02:09.250> we<00:02:09.610> have<00:02:09.789> this<00:02:10.000> voltage<00:02:10.539> approach

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
mode we have this voltage approach

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.360 
mode we have this voltage approach
so<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.790> t12<00:02:12.239> is<00:02:12.540> called<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:13.170> 12<00:02:13.859> vintage

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
so the t12 is called a 12 vintage

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:30.460 
so the t12 is called a 12 vintage
reissue

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.590
