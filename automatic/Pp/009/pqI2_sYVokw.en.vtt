00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hey people we want to talk about everything 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.319
 Osmosis is based on the phenomena 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.769
 diffusion if you have a video already 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.900
 have a short break to relax 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.630
 The merger was the endeavor of 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.000
 in itself about evenly too 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.699
 strive is now natural 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.519
 for a cause because the particles have 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.580
 yes, no no will or something but there 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.170
 we can always observe that, one says 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.349
 that's why very friendly they want 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.710
 distributed as even what is with 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.630
 the osmosis so special 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.390
 if we have that we have to look at each other 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.100
 If we have a special case country 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.789
 must be a special case of 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.890
 diffusion to say in the special case when so 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.440
 We have a chamber or a vessel 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.180
 and in that we have a certain substance 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.550
 we in the water and in there we have 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.620
 any substances solved the but 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.180
 unevenly distributed and we pull 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.210
 a wall in between 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.160
 so now the two halves are up 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.850
 help those in half 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.040
 wants 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.510
 differently focused characters 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.600
 here on this page little on this 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.040
 side a lot if we have an impermeable 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.720
 wall between draw 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.430
 then, of course, could not move 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.680
 even if they are unevenly distributed they are 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.720
 would like to be able to balance themselves 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.860
 Yes, really relevant is impermeable 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.800
 if we drive now and do it 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.840
 make the wall permira so permeable 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.090
 for the particles then we can 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.229
 Watch that they start to walk 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.960
 and always from the side has more 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.040
 from the particles gives to the side where it 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.229
 there are fewer signs 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.200
 this is called the hike along 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:48.030
 a concentration gradient that 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.530
 means the side where the fabric for 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.670
 concentrated from there they migrate 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.740
 Particles in the direction where it where 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.759
 they are less focused and that 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.990
 do it with a specific one 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.479
 speed with a certain 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.970
 pressure and that is the osmotic pressure 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.130
 that must be how brok depends on it 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.860
 strong the concentration is like 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.600
 so it is relatively balanced then 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.370
 Can we see what is possible 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.290
 the concentration 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.519
 Huge as I unite the boy 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.260
 We also drew 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.849
 corresponding enormous osmotic 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.440
 print 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.450
 beyond that, the expression is too 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.159
 depending on the temperature because ever 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.080
 higher the temperature is the more 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:29.610
 energy has got the times stronger 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.480
 they move the agila are pulling 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.239
 Accordingly, mother gets out 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.129
 Groups too are important as well as permeable 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.360
 this wall have the pictures for this 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.269
 substances are 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.720
 that means when the fabric is fast 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:48.190
 this may be the osmotic pressure 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.150
 just so that's relatively fast 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.190
 balanced 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.379
 and then of course there are immediately 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.209
 because when you first evenly 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.769
 there is no reason to be distributed 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.549
 more why it is the same everywhere 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.989
 However, the pores are distributed very much 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.819
 narrow and they can really only one 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.989
 after the other a hero out for pressure 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.019
 accordingly long 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.670
 yes, that was the osmosis, I hope so 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.049
 could help you a lot with that 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.049
 Success while learning until next time
