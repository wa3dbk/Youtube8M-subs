trust it and you it'll actually take a

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.130

couple<00:00:50.969> seconds<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.420> load<00:00:51.600> but<00:00:51.809> pretty<00:00:52.110> much

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
couple seconds to load but pretty much

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.500 
couple seconds to load but pretty much
once<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.500> see<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:52.829> screen<00:00:53.129> you're<00:00:53.910> ready<00:00:54.239> to

server<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:57.180> pretty<00:00:57.510> much<00:00:57.690> what<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.020> does<00:00:58.289> is

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
server so pretty much what this does is
