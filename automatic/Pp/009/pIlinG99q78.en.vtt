00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:11.130
 speak my comrades ladino mirror leza 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.389
 same new, bringing another video to 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.040
 you 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.560
 I'm back in the crowd with our series 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.630
 more dear and present to you 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.539
 one more episode of the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.400
 I'll go there and not go too hard. 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.289
 saw that in the past episode was not 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.240
 with no luck this was still in the 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.490
 same game session so I decided not to 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.109
 engineer for today is over 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.630
 and then as I was already in first in the 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.600
 call and the gm was already guaranteed then 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.430
 I decided to say a little gold for him. 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.379
 families chips like I told you 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.879
 I want for my ceps until I take 30 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.860
 so that's what I did I just 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.200
 finding this base there as the beam 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.270
 plan and with 60 thousand gold 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.070
 I had no doubts what to do in that 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.680
 if I wanted to secure the three stars 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.379
 then he has a truce and doubled the 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.559
 prass's goal guarantees 100k even 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.680
 public and the pitfalls is from there the 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.219
 25 are all above 350 households out of 30 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.439
 houses 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.210
 so what guarantees soon not to lose 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.700
 a long time and with what he gave 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.229
 We should sit back and before 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.070
 To sleep, I'm going to have a break for 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.170
 evolve 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.299
 looking at this layout and I saw that it is 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.880
 better job to leave me the cloth is 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.549
 would be a cannon because if he let 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.040
 saw the head guardian and the cloth then was 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.020
 gg would not have much difficulty 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.840
 two teps there they will still give a 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.540
 insured then before bed 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.500
 leaving soar base is scratched with 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.390
 sure is 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.979
 but then I saw with experience in the game 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.110
 more or less not always personal 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.509
 uses position for the stone to dedicate 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.340
 more so I left there just to be the 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.420
 night maybe I can save a 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.460
 left over in the morning 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.540
 let's see how this result was 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.310
 there it was already in the morning 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.500
 I'm not very surprised if they see 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.810
 that I was more or less right to take 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.850
 people do not use potion and they end up 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.130
 being only with a star this guy there 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.869
 maybe a more experienced guy the day was 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.270
 direct and disabling position to 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.950
 ensure his leg and took beauty 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.630
 Calm, I was more or less 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.759
 waiting for it but then we have 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.439
 mania makes for a very naughty crowd and 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.300
 to recover my stone 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.819
 As I told you, I do this. 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.829
 more 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.230
 the most obvious conclusion because 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:16.659
 I accelerated the ritual so I went in. 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.639
 already in the game I already put a stone to them 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:21.459
 to replace a ritual and went home 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:23.469
 I always do it personal, that way. 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.269
 look pretty basic but many players 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:26.409
 experienced stage you leave a rock 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.450
 rolling in the ritual 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:30.159
 and you'll go home later when 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.859
 You find your stones are with 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:34.569
 slot x accelerates the ritual again goes 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:37.450
 for hunting is so you always get 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.879
 to save a couple of such is a tip 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.530
 What I can leave for you is basic. 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.379
 but not everyone thinks about it 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.609
 so stay there registered as you are 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:49.329
 saw to be able to win the league nor 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:52.449
 first 175 of feel some more missions 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:54.879
 to retrieve more orders from the parent as well 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:56.650
 that never hurts 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:59.709
 so after a few glasses I got 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.540
 finding this basis giving luck that the 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.159
 strikes they are not welcome and one 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.019
 stone of 10 k more 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.180
 but I have to confess to you 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.310
 who have great difficulty in 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.290
 in those layouts where you have the 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.909
 kiss combination in the fall of the treasure 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.379
 with that jump on the corner 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.639
 if you have a tip write in a 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.769
 comment because I have enough 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:19.989
 difficulty but as always he already has 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.810
 trepp and still manage to take this stone 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.239
 there because what good does this run of bad luck 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.409
 passed this stone you saw that I 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:31.689
 I basically got no more book slots 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:33.790
 and film that I have a stone there for 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:36.549
 be recovered yet then what I do 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.500
 is to quickly accelerate the ritual is haste 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.509
 stone case someone rick perry at the moment 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.250
 she will not come in shape because I 'm not 

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:44.169
 interested that is not it 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.840
 and then you see a ritual that 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:48.159
 I'm 38 more or less dead. 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.199
 my intention 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:52.689
 just so to save the works or to 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:54.669
 an equal speed as I said , and there already have 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:58.000
 two batches books that already gives to go 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:59.829
 home again and so get personal 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.439
 I hope you are learning something 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.060
 thing or if you have any suggestions it is 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:06.729
 write in the comments a lot of people 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.979
 talked about these layout there me 

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:11.709
 sent another's suggestion then very 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:13.930
 Thank you very much for the feedback. 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.019
 Then you saw how the next day I ended up. 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.549
 falling in a ricci league is not 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.400
 It is complicated so I think it gives to 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.740
 lead strategy has first on chips 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.060
 and then you end up finding the bases 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.319
 You're wrong, it was just 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.009
 many people ask how we people 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:31.500
 does this and chooses very loudly that 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:32.729
 It has a lot of chip and a lot of secrecy. 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.080
 patience too 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.180
 after some types and ends up 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.090
 finding this other base and how you 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.620
 you can see that you have this combination of 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.659
 remedy with burke that is 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.210
 there are more frequent days there 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:47.430
 Does anyone know the secret to this? 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.530
 denies his gift has not lost his way in 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.169
 mother not so this time I got 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.720
 I could not pass but I disabled the 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:57.810
 two there and still calm and for 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.819
 take the gem all if they are very personal 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.199
 makes all the difference in white shadow 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:04.050
 so do not 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:05.880
 or rather speaking the best way to 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.199
 protect your gems first defense 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.169
 of stone for sure 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:12.090
 and second is the trap is not because it 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.380
 most of them had the last 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.240
 Sunday 26 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.669
 net with seven deaths I already have with one 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.740
 star will not give to disable the 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:21.780
 trap and still stick with two 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.090
 stars then this is the secret is by 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.750
 This is what I'm focusing on in this trap. 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:29.909
 arrow level 30 and the crowd after 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:33.270
 some leave in the same game session 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:35.219
 ends up finding this base there and I had 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.870
 which to analyze a little this layout galera 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:39.180
 because the next thing you can not play in 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.770
 layout because it has healing the saw I'm not 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.289
 specialist in painting saw then my 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.449
 ultimate goal is to turn this mountain there 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:47.520
 so I threw myself twice in the 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:49.219
 make sure it is disabled and 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.289
 then you only have to have patience 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:54.659
 patience without doubt a very good quality 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.340
 important in king of its 16 has a lot of 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:58.590
 people who just rush to linen 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.259
 dark or something when entering 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.360
 a basis under analysis is the subsidiary 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:04.729
 a look at xii did as they are 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.830
 distributed in them 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:09.050
 indicate more or less where the owner 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.270
 from where the pastor ewen what is the 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.949
 trap you can either deactivate or 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.370
 do not rush to find the team 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:18.469
 right there frog up there then 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.509
 This is the secret, this is how the 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:24.439
 I got the gem in a little while 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:27.319
 worsened already I went to 50 home laís korn and 

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:29.719
 Jamie has put me in a very good position 

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:31.520
 in the league reads this league and the guys I know 

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:33.409
 It takes me a long time to see if I 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.659
 get there but when you get there do 

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:38.689
 all the difference in your game that you 

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:40.669
 can gain from and nourish your 

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:42.800
 next game, so you win 

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:44.779
 bind that league in which with these works 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.849
 What you win you end up using 

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:47.689
 next and you can always keep 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:49.339
 on the top 

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:52.219
 for those who are not in the league and still only have 

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:54.680
 a little patience is and now it's good 

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:56.659
 that the game has a great way to win 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.180
 Nowadays you have energy and you 

00:06:56.659 --> 00:07:00.289
 It has the mission to give to those who do not pick up 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.969
 is playing on the pitch and gives 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:03.169
 recover their law missions thing 

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:05.779
 people did not do it before 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:07.189
 you also have the challenge mean 

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:08.629
 every Friday 

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:10.699
 so in that sense surely the game 

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:12.439
 was much more then in that sense with 

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:13.699
 sure the game with much older and 

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:15.610
 win the game and I sincerely hope 

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:18.129
 that you have learned 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.960
 it was the video today if you did not see the 

00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:21.669
 channel sign up for the channel now that 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.830
 this will give a great support to 

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:26.319
 Thank you very much for everything and how.
