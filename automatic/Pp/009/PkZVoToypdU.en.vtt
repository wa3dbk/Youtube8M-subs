00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.819
 Service of the young the report one wanted a Bremen 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.299
 it should be checked 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:12.929
 the trade has it annoyed 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.469
 jabs 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.469
 Munch future 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.649
 and then it's all about frontman pull through 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.890
 I know that I've been somewhere else 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.110
 then I make a second hole in the ice 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.970
 below 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.690
 Eutin Sara Nuru is the core 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.980
 their 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.000
 that generated something confused good the bottom line 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.360
 on 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.360
 we dapd 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.660
 No 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.980
 Test us on 9 it is overjoyed 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.660
 "This is not an opportunity 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.020
 to delete the jobs 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.350
 maybe he even knows what interesting Sevenval can hear 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.570
 and indeed 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.570
 League not 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.380
 you are 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.380
 Music to be played 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.560
 Jork 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.560
 They do not actually give any more b and also left 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.650
 I do not know more 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.010
 beautiful difficult to overtake and humiliate 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.900
 then we want to 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.890
 the something faltering 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.890
 not that there is anyone else 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.670
 and 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.919
 Artist the stove 

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.919
 Entringen 

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:16.119
 That's right 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:26.389
 that we test again water tilts 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.139
 Gerd Eckert said I should 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:37.759
 They love Bootz brushing their teeth 

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:42.179
 that we are here now but still a child 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.129
 Katy Perry runs pretty pointless against the wall 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.289
 No matter but I'm not going there 

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:54.929
 I will 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:56.779
 another way around the ship 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:03:00.419
 The minimalists I know that I discovered only by accident 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:06.029
 almost 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:07.669
 security 

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:08.979
 Eater because 

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:11.979
 you do not want so much showcase observers 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:17.059
 UL 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:25.719
 b 4 8 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:28.719
 far too many people 

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:37.969
 Red 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:40.969
 at least occasionally only briefly Wolfsburg 

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:46.979
 McCreevy you have to happen so what food is 712 determining factor 

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:51.039
 certainly not overlooked 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:54.039
 This week is what I want 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.919
 that are CSF many weapons discovered 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.159
 that's what's on my mind 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:02.999
 makes this still life a bit nervous 

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:06.469
 so that people may but simply nothing 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:09.469
 at the times and that must be different 

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:13.529
 Christoph climbed 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:15.979
 but also should 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:18.979
 Wittmann and poems she is 20 degrees 

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:24.939
 has not worked so well worried yet 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.139
 there could be shown if users can join 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.249
 Green and why 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:35.129
 is now also involved 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:38.129
 the title has appeared 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.979
 there is, for example, one 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.419
 there is still open 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:54.689
 Rocket 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.919
 what is the catch 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.009
 that was bad 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.490
 that was very bad 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.559
 determining factor 

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:17.559
 so again 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.150
 Quick tests Otto turn on under one year he has me and says to you 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.150
 Beech if that makes sense 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.809
 as the kooks 

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:44.039
 while not asking yourself before brake
