00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
would want to see two of them so I

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.979 
would want to see two of them so I
decided<00:01:02.189> I'm<00:01:02.460> gonna<00:01:02.670> make<00:01:02.850> an<00:01:03.030> elf<00:01:03.299> goblin

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
decided I'm gonna make an elf goblin

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.640 
decided I'm gonna make an elf goblin
deck<00:01:04.140> from<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.680> elves<00:01:05.129> versus<00:01:05.640> goblin<00:01:06.650> set

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
deck from the elves versus goblin set

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.790 
deck from the elves versus goblin set
and<00:01:08.150> so<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.210> combined<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.780> two<00:01:09.810> sets<00:01:10.230> to<00:01:10.560> try<00:01:10.740> to

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
and so I combined the two sets to try to

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.650 
and so I combined the two sets to try to
make<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.250> deck<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.730> then<00:01:11.880> pendant<00:01:12.240> Haven<00:01:12.450> was

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 
make the deck and then pendant Haven was

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.450 
make the deck and then pendant Haven was
