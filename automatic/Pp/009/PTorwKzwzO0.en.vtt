to<00:00:24.630> do<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:25.130> take<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.340> preamp<00:00:26.789> output<00:00:27.300> feed<00:00:27.810> it

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
to do is take the preamp output feed it

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.259 
to do is take the preamp output feed it
into<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.349> power<00:00:28.529> station<00:00:29.189> somehow<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.029> have

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
into the power station somehow and have

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.009 
into the power station somehow and have
the<00:00:30.510> lineout

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019

without using a speaker and there is a

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.959 
without using a speaker and there is a
way<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.550> do<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:42.110> what<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.200> do<00:00:43.460> is<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.670> set<00:00:44.879> up

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
way to do that what you do is you set up

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.760 
way to do that what you do is you set up
your<00:00:45.120> preamp<00:00:45.360> as<00:00:45.660> normal<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.230> we're<00:00:46.379> using<00:00:46.680> a

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
your preamp as normal and we're using a

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.580 
your preamp as normal and we're using a
gp3<00:00:47.399> here<00:00:47.610> as<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.789> reference<00:00:48.320> plug<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.469> guitar

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
gp3 here as a reference plug the guitar

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.189 
gp3 here as a reference plug the guitar
into<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.250> input<00:00:50.399> as<00:00:50.760> normal<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.390> we've<00:00:51.960> got

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
into the input as normal and we've got

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.170 
into the input as normal and we've got
the<00:00:52.379> rhythm<00:00:52.530> channel<00:00:52.980> set<00:00:53.190> up<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.550> here's<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
the rhythm channel set up and here's the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.170 
the rhythm channel set up and here's the
master<00:00:54.390> volume<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.379> we<00:00:55.590> set<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.640> volume<00:00:56.969> where

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
master volume so we set the volume where

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.099 
master volume so we set the volume where
we<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.129> we're<00:00:59.129> all<00:00:59.250> done<00:00:59.489> so<00:00:59.699> far<00:01:00.109> now

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
we like it and we're all done so far now

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.579 
we like it and we're all done so far now
coming<00:01:01.410> around<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.949> back<00:01:03.199> you<00:01:04.199> take<00:01:04.439> the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
coming around to the back you take the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.969 
coming around to the back you take the
preamp<00:01:05.010> output<00:01:05.400> which<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.610> here<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.830> feed<00:01:07.830> it

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
preamp output which is here and feed it

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.500 
preamp output which is here and feed it
directly<00:01:08.130> into<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.939> line-in

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
directly into the line-in

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.830 
directly into the line-in
of<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:10.110> power<00:01:10.260> station<00:01:10.830> which<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.280> here<00:01:11.840> you

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
of the power station which is here you

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.100 
of the power station which is here you
can<00:01:13.049> also<00:01:13.229> use<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.729> effects<00:01:15.090> return<00:01:15.509> jack

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
can also use the effects return jack

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.300 
can also use the effects return jack
which<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.799> here<00:01:17.100> for<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.490> same<00:01:17.700> purpose<00:01:19.310> what

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
which is here for the same purpose what

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.600 
which is here for the same purpose what
happens<00:01:20.670> next<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.119> really<00:01:21.360> fun<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:23.220> signal

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
happens next is really fun the signal

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.630 
happens next is really fun the signal
from<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.880> preamp<00:01:24.270> going<00:01:24.570> into<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.900> line-in

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
from the preamp going into the line-in

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.670 
from the preamp going into the line-in
feeds<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.939> power<00:01:27.180> amp<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.840> breaks<00:01:28.409> the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
feeds the power amp and breaks the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.520 
feeds the power amp and breaks the
signal<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.729> normally<00:01:30.360> would<00:01:30.630> be<00:01:30.659> fed<00:01:31.140> from

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
signal that normally would be fed from

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.830 
signal that normally would be fed from
the<00:01:31.680> app<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.520> when<00:01:32.790> you're<00:01:32.970> using<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.509> as<00:01:33.659> an

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
the app in when you're using it as an

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.969 
the app in when you're using it as an
attenuator<00:01:35.659> now<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.409> take<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.740> speaker

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
attenuator now you can take the speaker

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.819 
attenuator now you can take the speaker
output<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:39.479> power<00:01:39.659> station<00:01:40.259> which<00:01:40.680> would

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
output of the power station which would

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.800 
output of the power station which would
normally<00:01:40.979> drive<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.549> speaker<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.119> feed<00:01:42.780> that

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
normally drive the speaker and feed that

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.889 
normally drive the speaker and feed that
back<00:01:43.020> into<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.979> amplifier<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:45.030> which<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:45.720> the

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
back into the amplifier in which is the

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.780 
back into the amplifier in which is the
input<00:01:46.079> for<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.590> reactive<00:01:47.130> load<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.610> power

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.859 
input for the reactive load of the power
station<00:01:49.070> that<00:01:50.070> load<00:01:50.399> then<00:01:50.820> reduces<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.450> signal

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
station that load then reduces a signal

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.960 
station that load then reduces a signal
down<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.229> light<00:01:52.439> level<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.070> sends<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.759> the

what's<00:02:14.700> happening<00:02:15.150> now<00:02:15.299> is<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.989> preamp<00:02:16.469> is

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
what's happening now is the preamp is

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.729 
what's happening now is the preamp is
driving<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.670> power<00:02:17.909> amp<00:02:18.239> which<00:02:18.599> allows<00:02:19.530> you

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
driving the power amp which allows you

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.679 
driving the power amp which allows you
to<00:02:19.769> control<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:20.340> power<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.849> volume<00:02:21.239> here<00:02:21.569> and

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
to control the power and volume here and

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.949 
to control the power and volume here and
the<00:02:22.560> presence<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.189> the<00:02:23.760> depth<00:02:24.060> controls<00:02:24.480> to
