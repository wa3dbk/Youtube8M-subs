00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.200
 winter tires are always the choice 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.650
 best to ride in the ugly 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.080
 season 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.090
 someone continues to prefer chains 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.420
 from snow and then let's clarify a 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.420
 little ideas 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.970
 we begin to understand how they recognize each other 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.470
 winter by law on the roads 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.990
 where the ordinances are in force one can 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.850
 circular with eye mps tires though 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.140
 this abbreviation stands for mud and snow mud 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.180
 and snow in English but really 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.960
 identifies the tires that is for all seasons 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.880
 all Seasons 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.410
 the real winter tires instead have the 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.870
 snowflake symbol inside one 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.880
 stylized mountain next to the mls 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.010
 the difference is important under 7 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.600
 temperature degrees a rubber winter does 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:46.039
 much more grip than a season or 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:47.719
 amused not only in the snow but also 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.250
 in the dry in the wet because they have 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.690
 compound designed for cold one 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.000
 specific carcass and a tread 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.100
 detail also equipped with slats and le 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.420
 chains by law are equivalent to 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.250
 winter tires but actually do 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.170
 really the difference on the ice on 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.719
 very steep climbs and when the layer 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.220
 snow is high anyway if you live in one 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.930
 area where it is not cold in winter but 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.640
 occasionally travel along roads subject to 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.320
 ordinances you can choose to travel 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.250
 with summer tires with snow chains 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.870
 in the trunk 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.850
 but know that it is not the solution 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.650
 optimal in case of snowfall should 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.299
 know how to mount them without hindering the 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.829
 traffic and you won't have the same 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.909
 safety and driving comfort of a 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.909
 winter tire train 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.230
 all that remains is to understand where to buy all 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.360
 the winter car shoes we have 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.590
 seen for both tires and chains 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.910
 you can go to a tire shop between 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.260
 the other can advise me if you want 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.000
 change the circle leaving the tires 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.680
 summer in storage if you have not placed a 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.510
 case or you can visit the sites 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.010
 internet selling tires a lot 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.200
 useful even just to compare the 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.850
 prices of more brands and then there are the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.440
 malls that can do 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.440
 some nice offers on chains tires 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.860
 in any case it is better not to save 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.610
 too much about safety first and foremost 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.410
 on practicality 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.330
 in the case of chains often those 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.770
 economic are difficult to assemble 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.300
 tires of the rest are the only point of 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.890
 contact we have with the road to 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.060
 to heal or avoid obstacles 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.340
 also all the major manufacturers 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.320
 of tires have sub brands with 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.640
 technically and less expensive products 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.410
 which may be the right solution 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.680
 to travel by car in winter without 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.680
 to risk
