00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.410
 hi to all the boys and welcome back up 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.720
 those two on the server 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.040
 today we talk to you rather viri we talk about 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.840
 a game and we have already covered in the 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.740
 alpha version that had intrigued us 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.869
 quite a lot of 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.670
 we are talking about a betrayer game that 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.980
 released in alpha in 2013 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.109
 now it's 2014 and we've had 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.460
 the opportunity to play join access and 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.960
 so we played it before 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.180
 of the exit and these are ours 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.800
 considerations absolutely if not 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.629
 but you have seen the first review 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.800
 let's summarize what it is 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:40.569
 really betrayer it is a fps 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.280
 very particular because you will have to 

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:44.589
 reconstruct a story through 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.299
 letters that you will find here and there and you must 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.489
 face different creatures 

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:50.409
 the gdr imprint is very strong there too 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.139
 in this game since we can in 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:55.479
 somehow grow our own 

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:57.609
 ability thanks to spells 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:59.859
 we can collect items we can 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:02.589
 buy weapons always keep in order 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:05.260
 our inventory and above all is a 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:07.690
 game with a strong horror component 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.080
 and atmospheric yes yes yes yes it really is 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.820
 atmosphere we talk when we go to 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.070
 see some of the graphics in this game 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.440
 that struck us a lot because they had 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.730
 chosen the developers had chosen 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:24.040
 to use a little chromaticity 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.530
 different from the usual by removing the 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.210
 chromaticity that is making a game that gives 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.860
 its maximum result 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.630
 when it is played in black and white 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.210
 also because some screen elements 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.460
 they will be bright red but it does 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.010
 given the possibility also to play it a 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.070
 colors in colors that we will 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.630
 we also strongly advise against it 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.630
 graphics 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.479
 it is not all this masterpiece in fact 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.200
 is in black and white from the maximum this 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.180
 game 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.180
 yes exactly it seems silly to put us 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.210
 colors betrayer gameplay is a lot 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.220
 very particular because from one 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.619
 great chance to explore the map 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.500
 in which we find ourselves and among other things every 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.509
 map is as if it was worth two because 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.550
 we can explore it both in conditions 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.250
 normal both in decidedly conditions 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.440
 more disturbing considering that in each 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.510
 fortino we will be able to unlock there 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.940
 it will be a bell once it is rung 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.200
 this bell will fall darkness e 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.970
 and more and more strange creatures will come 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.349
 as well as during the day there are not these 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.110
 creatures because they are also there during the day 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.330
 but at night they are even more disturbing 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.430
 because when you go maybe close to 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.190
 then you need some special items 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.380
 free from the evil one they will come back to 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.900
 net cache shoulders far below if 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.970
 very very disturbing this game e 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.180
 leads to exploration precisely because 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.280
 of everything there is a second level 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.819
 precisely wrapped in darkness 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.680
 the fights are really 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.900
 impossible sometimes because this game 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.880
 is set more or less in 1600 and 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.489
 then your weapons must be reloaded 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.920
 with holy patience with dust 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.810
 put the powder 20 then the bullet 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.030
 he disappeared and if you're lucky you hit 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.980
 something one of the few things we do 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.019
 you really enjoy using the toma hoc that 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.910
 pulled at the head of the opponents though 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.880
 you must collect from time to time 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.500
 then throw pick up when there is 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.389
 they are a lot of creator around you 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.850
 let's say it's a bit impossible to 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:22.709
 use I was these are elements that 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.930
 they are straight ahead of the best 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.310
 survival horror that is knowing how to manage the 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.609
 few resources you have available 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.930
 the few bullets the few arrows 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:34.079
 having to expose yourself to go and recover 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.690
 an arrow a tome which is a spear 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.940
 anything and it is very much 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.970
 disquieting having to do it in the dark 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.030
 total when 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.730
 all around you hear lumps of strangers 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.790
 sighs, and here we come to the audio that is 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.610
 very well taken care of also because you will have to 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.190
 use a specific function that has 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.340
 your character to listen to 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.350
 voices in the sense that you hear these 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.030
 sighs that come from a certain one 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.660
 direction you need to go there 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.130
 sling because the center of the is there 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.900
 of the action in the action only the 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.820
 problem is that in the alpha version 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.920
 this thing was so much more 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.170
 suggestive because in fact you had to 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.180
 use only your ears then 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.310
 having to wear a nice pair of headphones and 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.140
 based on what you felt to understand the 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.360
 direction in which to go in the version 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.540
 definitive added markers 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.850
 visuals that take much away second 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.310
 we of the involvement because you can 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.940
 also play on the sofa without sound 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:36.490
 yes indeed yes but in the end it is one 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.320
 choice they may have had to make 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.480
 developers also because not everyone 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.160
 maybe they can play with headphones 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.560
 and therefore do a bit of effort to 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.690
 listen to the voices but let's just come to 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.660
 what we didn't like about this 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:52.690
 first and foremost game is the choice of 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.360
 language and structure a little bit of the 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.630
 yes indeed the story of this game 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:02.070
 betrayer vi is given to you 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.960
 in small doses using diary rags 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.090
 correspondence and very brief dialogues 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.150
 you will do precisely with the souls who 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.760
 you will be able to trace the world 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.710
 obscure however the problem is that it is written 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.300
 in English all in English at the very least 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.490
 there are no others in yerli access 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.979
 languages there is only English is described 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.500
 he too also in rather English 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:25.090
 this is the problematic one 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.460
 main because we know 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.169
 English is pretty good though 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.900
 we find ourselves in difficulty precisely because 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.669
 these words are really archaic 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.720
 so they are really difficult 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:36.520
 comprehension 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.160
 there are some pieces of history 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.320
 especially missed 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.880
 in the dialogues between the characters why not 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.700
 you can always translate 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.710
 however the gameplay remains anyway 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.670
 that very very interesting and a lot 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.430
 hard 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:52.950
 the enemies are very varied and above all 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:55.170
 there are different enemies according to a 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.630
 depending on whether you wander by day or 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.800
 after ringing the bell when yes 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.570
 the bell rings 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.510
 whoever happens to all the enemies are 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:06.240
 well differentiated well characterized e 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:09.660
 we only show you some why 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.310
 others spoil you and they might have some things 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.650
 yes indeed we do not actually want 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:16.680
 spoil you nothing especially those of you 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.660
 this will want to play this entirely 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.120
 I play another thing that we did n't like 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.910
 is the recharge of the energy you are in 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.740
 effects a little strange you will have to drink this 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.710
 water that is probably magical is not 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:31.020
 know from you barrels and you will recover the energy 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:34.530
 and you will recover these spreaders that 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:38.040
 you can then use during the 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:40.350
 gameplay but to recharge so when 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.000
 is the same as staying in the shelter a 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.170
 automatically recharge your own 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.880
 energy as in a cod 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:47.940
 in the alpha version the game was a lot 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.010
 more bullshit if you tumors wasting you 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:53.940
 your last arrow is reborn without you 

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:56.910
 arrows if you want some energy for david 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.770
 you had to find a barrel to drink from 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:00.870
 water to restore health 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:03.360
 you couldn't take the flask with you 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:05.490
 so with water it was much more tough 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.960
 the alpha and me would have liked to have seen and 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.270
 considering we are sure that i am 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.340
 game will sell very little because it really 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.250
 niche we would have liked that 

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.720
 would remain very niche would be 

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.130
 could become a small masterpiece 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.930
 a little jewel 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.790
 however we have made several gameplay 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:23.310
 of found on the second channel with those 

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:26.960
 description and also the link 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.960
 at the game if anything you would like
