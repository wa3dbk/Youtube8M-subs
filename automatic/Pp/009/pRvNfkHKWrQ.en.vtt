v3 60 pluses for both are the exact same

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.779 
v3 60 pluses for both are the exact same
process<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.920> narrow<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.160> person<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:20.640> need

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
process and narrow the person you need

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.099 
process and narrow the person you need
to<00:00:20.820> do<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.150> need<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.330> put<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.689> not-allowed

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
to do is you need to put and not-allowed

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.890 
to do is you need to put and not-allowed
sim<00:00:22.619> card<00:00:22.859> in<00:00:23.039> what<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.060> our<00:00:24.180> lab<00:00:24.359> SIM<00:00:24.600> card<00:00:24.810> is

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
sim card in what in our lab SIM card is

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.480 
sim card in what in our lab SIM card is
basically<00:00:25.260> any<00:00:25.560> other<00:00:25.800> network<00:00:26.189> than<00:00:26.400> the

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
basically any other network than the

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.939 
basically any other network than the
original<00:00:26.939> network<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.900> Rogers<00:00:28.470> bone

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
original network this is a Rogers bone

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.009 
original network this is a Rogers bone
so<00:00:29.789> what<00:00:29.939> I'm<00:00:30.060> doing<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.390> I'm<00:00:30.539> putting<00:00:30.570> a

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
so what I'm doing is I'm putting a

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.920 
so what I'm doing is I'm putting a
t-mobile<00:00:31.500> SIM<00:00:31.980> card<00:00:32.309> in<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.690> Rogers<00:00:33.690> and

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
t-mobile SIM card in it Rogers and

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.750 
t-mobile SIM card in it Rogers and
Canada<00:00:34.260> t-mobile's<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.980> u.s.<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.430> doesn't

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
Canada t-mobile's in the u.s. it doesn't

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.970 
Canada t-mobile's in the u.s. it doesn't
matter<00:00:35.940> what<00:00:36.149> network<00:00:36.710> now<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.829> doesn't

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
matter what network now it doesn't

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.799 
matter what network now it doesn't
necessarily<00:00:38.190> have<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.730> be<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.239> SIM<00:00:39.480> card<00:00:39.750> that

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
necessarily have to be the SIM card that

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.569 
necessarily have to be the SIM card that
you're<00:00:40.050> going<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.649> use<00:00:40.860> with<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.190> phone

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
you're going to use with the phone

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.940 
you're going to use with the phone
like<00:00:42.239> for<00:00:42.600> example<00:00:42.629> t-mobile<00:00:43.230> SIM<00:00:43.530> card<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.800> put

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
like for example t-mobile SIM card I put

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.319 
like for example t-mobile SIM card I put
in<00:00:44.100> actually<00:00:44.250> does<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.670> doesn't<00:00:45.000> have<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.120> live

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
in actually does it doesn't have a live

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.260 
in actually does it doesn't have a live
line<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.230> but<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:46.980> will<00:00:47.100> work<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:48.120> this

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
line on it but it will work so this

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.970 
line on it but it will work so this
point<00:00:48.510> you've<00:00:48.629> gone<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:49.020> global<00:00:49.320> off<00:00:49.469> comm

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
point you've gone to global off comm

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.100 
point you've gone to global off comm
you've<00:00:50.309> gotten<00:00:50.579> your<00:00:50.700> unlock<00:00:50.969> code<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.780> you

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
you've gotten your unlock code and you

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.220 
you've gotten your unlock code and you
are<00:00:52.320> ready<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.739> go<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.690> couple<00:00:54.690> things<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:55.020> make

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
are ready to go a couple things you make

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.990

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
means that you've tried the wrong code

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.930 
means that you've tried the wrong code
too<00:00:58.440> many<00:00:58.620> times<00:00:58.859> we've<00:00:59.160> got<00:00:59.370> ways<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.820> get

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
too many times we've got ways to get

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.599 
too many times we've got ways to get
around<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:01.289> don't<00:01:01.770> worry<00:01:02.039> about<00:01:02.250> that

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
around that so don't worry about that

message now you've got intercept city

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.039 
message now you've got intercept city
code<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:05.970> what<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.210> need<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.390> do<00:01:06.570> right<00:01:06.750> now<00:01:06.780> is

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
code so what you need to do right now is

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.200 
code so what you need to do right now is
you<00:01:07.080> need<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.320> enter<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.920> subsidy<00:01:08.369> code<00:01:08.580> into

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
you need to enter the subsidy code into

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.060 
you need to enter the subsidy code into
the<00:01:09.240> phone<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:10.290> I'm<00:01:10.470> going<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.680> enter<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> one

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
the phone so I'm going to enter the one

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.770 
the phone so I'm going to enter the one
again<00:01:11.490> it's<00:01:11.670> unique<00:01:11.939> for<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.270> phone<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:12.659> it's

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
again it's unique for this phone so it's

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.620 
again it's unique for this phone so it's
not<00:01:12.900> going<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.140> work<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.680> your<00:01:14.280> phone<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:15.420> you

not going to work on your phone and you

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.510 
not going to work on your phone and you
can't<00:01:15.840> even<00:01:15.990> see<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.530> because<00:01:16.920> who<00:01:17.040> I'm<00:01:17.130> typing

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
can't even see it because who I'm typing

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:26.359 
can't even see it because who I'm typing
3<00:01:18.330> 0<00:01:19.310> 9<00:01:20.310> 9<00:01:20.460> 9<00:01:21.119> 8<00:01:23.000> 4<00:01:24.290> 7<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.799> once<00:01:25.979> you've<00:01:26.130> done<00:01:26.310> that

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
you click the top line it says ok watch

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.460 
you click the top line it says ok watch
what<00:01:29.369> happens

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.710 

now<00:01:33.470> chose<00:01:33.770> Fido<00:01:34.040> now<00:01:34.940> chose<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:35.360> number<00:01:35.479> that

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
now chose Fido now chose the number that

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.660 
now chose Fido now chose the number that
was<00:01:35.840> actually<00:01:36.260> on<00:01:36.440> the<00:01:36.650> SIM<00:01:36.830> card<00:01:36.860> I<00:01:37.190> should

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
was actually on the SIM card I should

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.910 
was actually on the SIM card I should
know<00:01:37.760> about<00:01:37.790> it<00:01:38.090> it<00:01:38.270> was<00:01:38.420> a<00:01:38.450> vital<00:01:38.990> mystify<00:01:39.890> the

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
know about it it was a vital mystify the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.899 
know about it it was a vital mystify the
phone<00:01:40.310> which<00:01:40.549> is<00:01:40.729> owned<00:01:40.940> by<00:01:41.060> Rogers<00:01:45.790> so<00:01:46.790> now

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
phone which is owned by Rogers so now

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:47.980 
phone which is owned by Rogers so now
let's<00:01:47.060> searching<00:01:47.330> for<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.509> network<00:01:47.750> it's<00:01:47.930> not

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
let's searching for the network it's not

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.870 
let's searching for the network it's not
gonna<00:01:48.259> find<00:01:48.470> a<00:01:48.590> network<00:01:48.770> how<00:01:49.520> would<00:01:49.670> you<00:01:49.759> like

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
gonna find a network how would you like

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:58.060 
gonna find a network how would you like
to<00:01:49.970> personalize<00:01:50.420> no<00:01:56.590> so<00:01:57.590> what's<00:01:57.830> gonna<00:01:57.979> happen

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
to personalize no so what's gonna happen

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.830 
to personalize no so what's gonna happen
is<00:01:58.460> you're<00:01:58.490> actually<00:01:58.880> able<00:01:58.970> to<00:01:59.149> enter<00:01:59.600> into

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840
