at my house so let's get started this is

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.700 
at my house so let's get started this is
where<00:00:34.590> we<00:00:34.739> usually<00:00:35.160> always<00:00:35.430> start<00:00:35.910> baby<00:00:36.149> on

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
where we usually always start baby on

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.010 
where we usually always start baby on
the<00:00:37.710> beanbag<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.399> we've<00:00:39.239> got<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.600> set<00:00:39.840> up<00:00:39.870> here

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
the beanbag and we've got it set up here

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.700 
the beanbag and we've got it set up here
and<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.950> usually<00:00:41.239> layer<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.870> beanbag<00:00:43.290> with<00:00:43.530> my

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
and I usually layer the beanbag with my

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.830 
and I usually layer the beanbag with my
blanket<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.340> it's<00:00:44.489> easy<00:00:44.760> just<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.239> peel<00:00:45.600> them

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
blanket so it's easy just to peel them

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.040 
blanket so it's easy just to peel them
back<00:00:46.230> when<00:00:46.559> we<00:00:46.710> want<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.950> different<00:00:47.100> background

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
back when we want a different background

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.970 
back when we want a different background
and<00:00:49.050> then<00:00:49.800> under<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.550> layers<00:00:51.379> have<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.440> little

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
and then under the layers have a little

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.490 
and then under the layers have a little
pad<00:00:53.190> here<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.670> case<00:00:53.879> well<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.629> baby<00:00:54.989> goes<00:00:55.260> potty

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
configuration because we can easily turn

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.250 
configuration because we can easily turn

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.789 
window light so that is how I like to do
it<00:01:24.330> with<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> newborns<00:01:25.170> because<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.439> don't<00:01:25.619> use

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
it with the newborns because I don't use

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.300

flash<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:26.580> all<00:01:26.729> natural<00:01:27.060> light<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:28.680> we

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
flash it's all natural light and then we

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.060 
flash it's all natural light and then we
have<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:30.000> heater<00:01:30.450> which<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.259> really<00:01:31.680> important

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
have a heater which is really important

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.770 
have a heater which is really important
for<00:01:32.100> newborn<00:01:32.520> sessions<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.090> keep<00:01:33.270> them<00:01:33.450> warm

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
for newborn sessions to keep them warm

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.950 
for newborn sessions to keep them warm
and<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.680> also<00:01:35.280> crank<00:01:35.880> up<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.270> heater<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
and I also crank up the heater in the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.410 
and I also crank up the heater in the
house<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.650> we're<00:01:37.920> all<00:01:38.040> sweating<00:01:38.579> during<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
house so we're all sweating during the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.160 
house so we're all sweating during the
sessions<00:01:39.869> but<00:01:40.020> it's<00:01:40.259> worth<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:41.390> over<00:01:42.390> here<00:01:42.750> we
