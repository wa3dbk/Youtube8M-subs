 because I know you must be 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.480

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.240
 18 went to the streets at home was the galera 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.940
 But she told me that there are three tips. 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:22.140
 and they are very good so stay there for us 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:26.460
 to be able to see in I'll talk like you have 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.070
 bars in the area of several but I 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.140
 I chose three that are very important 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.010
 to get a perfect result missing 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.620
 back to the first thing at the time of washing 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.809
 It's time to wash hair hair 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.640
 when it's 3 possible you do 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:47.129
 very employed emulation movements and 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.190
 scrubbing too much can embarrass 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.620
 and then it's time to get 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.430
 time of the pent may cause the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.640
 wires 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.059
 then the ideal is to apply the shape shampoo 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.300
 massaging their children in this 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.250
 first scalp movement after 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.400
 massaging the ends for total cleansing 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.270
 in the hair and will have hair pv and 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.600
 next tip the next tip is at the time of 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.680
 moisturize time to moisturize is people 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.340
 important you divide your hair into 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.009
 four parts is four or more parts 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.770
 or more there and apply the product there 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.619
 moisturizing cream by all threads 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.680
 so that none of them is 100 and now 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.049
 has glove also goes on people do not go 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.479
 having the piano renews so that the 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.880
 product can penetrate the hair fiber 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.369
 and so you have a good result and 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.950
 another tip you have you come back to 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.100
 to train this other tip is in the 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.930

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.869
 apply on hair and make're after 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.140

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.670
 apple hair from the bottom up and this 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.500
 makes the cars get more 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.030
 defined must now they speak a 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.440
 thing and when are we going to go to the bathroom? 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.910
 from the mall 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.260
 I already saw this scene 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.940
 sometimes even I have already given a 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.180
 hassan peek concluded when 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.430
 that thing what it can do when the 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.840
 hair is kind of dry during the day you 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.140
 You'll want that look because you can not 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.470
 You can not wet the sink in your hair. 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.850
 in the technician stack can see if I'll 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.050
 to say something I will confess that in 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.900
 In my adolescence I suffered a lot with 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.520
 I did it and I did it because I did not 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.310
 had a ready I did not know the 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.960
 product of such quality and I 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.850
 I wanted my hair in a way 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.340
 reduced volume hydration and at the same 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.200
 defined time and wet the time it is 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.170
 Like what you use I use a 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.350
 humidifier to that here it already is 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.920
 That 's because this is why you 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.760
 look a lot of hair you can bring 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.130
 damages 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.960
 you might be stinking bad smell then 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.100
 has this product that is ideal and then I 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.210
 I'll do it here, what I'm going to do 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.980
 Now for you I go I did not know 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.650

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.390

 match that treats will have hair 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.650
 Treated is already very good steering wheel 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.810
 I liked to finish our last one. 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.730
 He asks that we have received many 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.280
 readers asked about the 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.240
 wire flower is to ask why that 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.520
 does not grow 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.440
 what you can suggest to help in 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.780
 yarn growth is we find 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.240
 many consumers with this 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.280
 Worry about your Afro and little hair 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.250
 developing my hair it grows 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.250
 May your run a lot and grow a lot 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.350
 but this also goes from the treatment then 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.370
 the hair it grows on average per month 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:50.340
 approximately one centimeter in nothing and 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:54.180
 people also need some attitudes 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.860
 have some up to 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.360
 also I think it is 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.670
 important for hair growth 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.220
 healthy and not only food but 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.100

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.520
 hairy then do not hold wet no 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.230
 use up the doll 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.060
 a look not to not use the 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.860
 hydration leave the whole day finding 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.960
 who will treat me more robberies with 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.790
 hydration and this is not valid 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.160
 hydration has its time of action and has 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.239
 to be respected in this day and feed 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.180
 it is fundamental 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:26.540
 and use them is the power to 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.330
 meat-based liver of leguminous 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.700
