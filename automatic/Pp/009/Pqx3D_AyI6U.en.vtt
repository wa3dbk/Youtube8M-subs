transformers<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.969> inside<00:00:36.480> here<00:00:36.809> it's<00:00:37.530> really

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
transformers and inside here it's really

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.010 
transformers and inside here it's really
nothing<00:00:37.920> other<00:00:38.219> than<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.489> case<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.030> some

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
nothing other than the case and some

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.330 
nothing other than the case and some
literature<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.620> get<00:00:40.739> like<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.920> one<00:00:41.160> year

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
literature you get like a one year

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.610 
literature you get like a one year
warranty<00:00:41.370> card<00:00:42.090> from<00:00:42.629> varus<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.500> then<00:00:43.590> a

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
warranty card from varus and then a

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.819 
warranty card from varus and then a
dummy<00:00:44.010> note<00:00:44.879> for<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.930> take<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> look<00:00:46.320> at<00:00:46.500> and

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
dummy note for to take a look at and

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.639 
dummy note for to take a look at and
there<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.730> case<00:00:48.059> now<00:00:48.390> if<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:49.140> caught<00:00:49.500> my

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
there is the case now if you caught my

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.990 
there is the case now if you caught my
review<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.550> case<00:00:50.850> for<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.780> iphone<00:00:52.579> 6<00:00:53.579> you

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
review of this case for the iphone 6 you

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.279 
review of this case for the iphone 6 you
already<00:00:54.239> know<00:00:54.329> how<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.629> works<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.260> a

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
already know how it works and this is a

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.740 
already know how it works and this is a
wallet<00:00:55.829> style<00:00:56.039> case<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:57.030> has<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.180> hybrid

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
wallet style case that has a hybrid

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.840 
wallet style case that has a hybrid
design<00:00:58.050> now<00:00:58.320> there<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.850> honeycomb-like

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
design now there is a honeycomb-like

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.729 
design now there is a honeycomb-like
pattern<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.780> inside<00:01:01.079> for<00:01:01.379> shock

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
pattern on the inside for shock

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.950 
pattern on the inside for shock
absorption<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:03.030> can<00:01:03.180> see<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.359> TPU

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
absorption and you can see that TPU

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.289 
absorption and you can see that TPU
material<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.710> then<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.159> polycarbonate<00:01:05.970> back

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
material and then a polycarbonate back

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.260 
material and then a polycarbonate back
and<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:07.020> has<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.260> special<00:01:07.799> slide-out<00:01:08.670> wallet

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
and this has a special slide-out wallet

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.420 
and this has a special slide-out wallet
style<00:01:09.510> feature<00:01:09.869> which<00:01:10.680> might<00:01:10.920> be<00:01:11.040> hard<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.280> do

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
style feature which might be hard to do

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.980 
style feature which might be hard to do
without<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.729> phone<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.360> but<00:01:12.570> let's<00:01:12.689> see<00:01:12.810> if<00:01:12.840> I

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
without a phone in but let's see if I

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.219 
without a phone in but let's see if I
can<00:01:13.020> do<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.950> kind<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.250> need<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:15.229> rigidness

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
can do it you kind of need the rigidness

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.080 
can do it you kind of need the rigidness
that<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> phone<00:01:16.890> gets<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.430> get<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.820> open

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
that a phone gets to get this to open

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.670 
that a phone gets to get this to open
but<00:01:18.240> essentially<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.780> slides<00:01:19.140> open<00:01:19.500> like<00:01:19.650> that

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
but essentially it slides open like that

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.800 
but essentially it slides open like that
and<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.580> can<00:01:20.729> place<00:01:20.909> credit<00:01:21.299> cards<00:01:21.630> or

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
and you can place credit cards or

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.050 
and you can place credit cards or
whatever<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.290> want<00:01:22.500> debit<00:01:22.920> card<00:01:23.130> ID<00:01:23.369> or<00:01:23.820> cash

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
whatever you want debit card ID or cash

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.719 
whatever you want debit card ID or cash
in<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.930> little<00:01:25.170> slot<00:01:25.470> right<00:01:25.740> there<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.280> then

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
in the little slot right there and then

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.390 
in the little slot right there and then
you<00:01:26.880> pop<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.299> closed<00:01:27.630> like<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.290> again<00:01:29.100> it's<00:01:29.310> a

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
you pop it closed like so again it's a

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.010 
you pop it closed like so again it's a
little<00:01:29.610> bit<00:01:29.729> hard<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.030> do<00:01:30.240> without<00:01:30.390> having<00:01:30.930> a

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
little bit hard to do without having a

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.840 
little bit hard to do without having a
phone<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.890> kind<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.520> have<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.700> get<00:01:32.790> a
