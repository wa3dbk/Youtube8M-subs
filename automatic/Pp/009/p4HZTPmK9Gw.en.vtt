this<00:00:16.020> car<00:00:16.350> that<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.590> bought<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:17.039> charity<00:00:17.580> shop

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
this car that I bought in charity shop

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.590 
this car that I bought in charity shop
quite<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.300> while<00:00:18.539> ago<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:19.580> remember<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:21.090> did<00:00:21.390> do<00:00:21.570> a

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
quite a while ago I remember I did do a

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.640 
quite a while ago I remember I did do a
video<00:00:21.869> on<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:23.869> there's<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:25.140> couple<00:00:25.529> of

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
video on it and there's a couple of

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.269 
video on it and there's a couple of
things<00:00:25.859> wrong<00:00:26.189> with<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.720> there's<00:00:27.859> a<00:00:28.859> basic

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
things wrong with it there's a basic

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.330 
things wrong with it there's a basic
problem<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.260> steering<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.560> broken<00:00:31.859> on

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
problem that the steering is broken on

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.920 
problem that the steering is broken on
one<00:00:32.880> side<00:00:34.820> the<00:00:35.820> other<00:00:35.850> side<00:00:36.030> was<00:00:36.540> loose<00:00:36.899> but

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
one side the other side was loose but

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.889 
one side the other side was loose but
I've<00:00:37.320> managed<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.129> just<00:00:38.460> pop<00:00:39.059> back<00:00:39.329> back<00:00:39.719> in

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
I've managed to just pop back back in

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.700 
I've managed to just pop back back in
place<00:00:41.360> but<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.540> side<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.200> linkage<00:00:43.559> is

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
place but this side the linkage is

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.510 
place but this side the linkage is
actually<00:00:44.040> broken<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:45.980> other<00:00:46.980> thing<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.309> was

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
actually broken the other thing that was

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.439 
actually broken the other thing that was
wrong<00:00:47.730> with<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:47.989> was<00:00:48.989> none<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.710> my

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
wrong with it was none of my

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.770 
wrong with it was none of my
transmitters<00:00:51.449> will<00:00:51.809> talk<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.379> receiver

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
transmitters will talk to that receiver

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.850 
transmitters will talk to that receiver
so<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:54.809> thought<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.079> might<00:00:55.289> just<00:00:55.320> spend<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.829> few

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
so I thought I might just spend a few

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.700 
so I thought I might just spend a few
minutes<00:00:56.160> tonight<00:00:56.670> I'll<00:00:57.629> swap<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.289> receiver

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
minutes tonight I'll swap that receiver

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.920 
minutes tonight I'll swap that receiver
over<00:00:58.980> for<00:00:59.309> one<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.699> know<00:00:59.760> works<00:01:02.690> this<00:01:03.690> one

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
over for one that I know works this one

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.190 
over for one that I know works this one
takes<00:01:05.960> five<00:01:06.960> double-a<00:01:07.530> batteries<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.400> that's

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
takes five double-a batteries so that's

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.899 
takes five double-a batteries so that's
three<00:01:10.200> six<00:01:10.619> seven<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.130> half<00:01:11.159> volts

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
three six seven and a half volts

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.850 
three six seven and a half volts
I<00:01:13.729> think<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.090> receivers<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.049> I've<00:01:16.140> got<00:01:16.470> run

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
I think the receivers that I've got run

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.310 
I think the receivers that I've got run
on<00:01:17.009> slightly<00:01:17.580> less<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.090> we'll<00:01:18.750> take<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.990> risk

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
on slightly less so we'll take a risk

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.870 
on slightly less so we'll take a risk
see<00:01:19.680> if<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.890> can<00:01:20.119> take<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.330> extra<00:01:21.689> power<00:01:22.880> but

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
see if it can take the extra power but

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.280 
see if it can take the extra power but
then<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.090> have<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.390> see<00:01:24.600> if<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.810> can<00:01:24.960> do<00:01:25.080> anything

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
then I have to see if I can do anything

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.899 
then I have to see if I can do anything
about<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.820> broken<00:01:26.820> linkage<00:01:28.640> not<00:01:29.640> quite<00:01:29.880> sure

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
about that broken linkage not quite sure

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.780 
about that broken linkage not quite sure
what<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.360> can<00:01:30.450> do<00:01:30.750> there<00:01:31.020> because<00:01:31.320> it's<00:01:31.500> a

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
what I can do there because it's a

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.399 
what I can do there because it's a
awkward<00:01:32.790> shape<00:01:33.090> bit<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.600> plastic<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.200> can't

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
awkward shape bit of plastic I can't

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.789 
awkward shape bit of plastic I can't
just<00:01:34.650> glue<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.360> might<00:01:36.360> be<00:01:36.420> able<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.799> rig

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
just glue it I might be able to rig

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.060 
just glue it I might be able to rig
something<00:01:37.829> up<00:01:38.250> with<00:01:38.490> some<00:01:38.729> bits<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.210> wire<00:01:39.479> and

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
something up with some bits of wire and

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.130 
something up with some bits of wire and
some<00:01:41.070> 2-pack<00:01:41.640> epoxy<00:01:44.420> so<00:01:45.420> that's<00:01:45.930> what<00:01:46.049> we're

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
some 2-pack epoxy so that's what we're

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.700 
some 2-pack epoxy so that's what we're
going<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.320> do<00:01:46.439> tonight<00:01:48.320> but<00:01:49.320> I'll<00:01:49.470> need<00:01:49.649> to

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
going to do tonight but I'll need to

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.609 
going to do tonight but I'll need to
clear<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> space<00:01:50.189> on<00:01:50.670> my<00:01:50.700> desk<00:01:51.380> because<00:01:52.380> there's

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
clear a space on my desk because there's

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.260 
clear a space on my desk because there's
a<00:01:52.680> few<00:01:52.829> other<00:01:52.979> things<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.430> was<00:01:53.610> doing<00:01:55.969> I'll<00:01:56.969> use

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
a few other things I was doing I'll use

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.950 
a few other things I was doing I'll use
this<00:01:57.560> receiver<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.159> one<00:01:59.630> that<00:02:00.630> I've<00:02:00.750> used

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
this receiver this is one that I've used

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.370 
this receiver this is one that I've used
in<00:02:01.170> one<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.380> my<00:02:01.469> projects

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
in one of my projects

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.560 
in one of my projects
so<00:02:04.380> I'll<00:02:04.469> just<00:02:04.710> D<00:02:04.979> solder<00:02:05.430> these<00:02:05.579> wires

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
so I'll just D solder these wires

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:27.360 
so I'll just D solder these wires
and<00:02:09.000> just<00:02:10.000> do<00:02:10.149> a<00:02:10.180> straight<00:02:10.570> replacement

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.000 

all<00:02:28.000> right<00:02:28.209> I<00:02:28.300> was<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:28.780> bit<00:02:29.230> of<00:02:29.319> a<00:02:29.410> fiddle<00:02:29.769> but

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
all right I was a bit of a fiddle but

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.040 
all right I was a bit of a fiddle but
I've<00:02:30.099> got<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.489> replacement<00:02:31.390> receiver<00:02:31.780> in

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
I've got the replacement receiver in

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:43.380 
I've got the replacement receiver in
there<00:02:41.489> I've<00:02:42.489> actually<00:02:42.640> got<00:02:42.970> them<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.239> right

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
there I've actually got them the right

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.479 
there I've actually got them the right
way<00:02:43.420> round<00:02:43.780> forwards<00:02:45.569> forwards<00:02:47.489> backwards

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
way round forwards forwards backwards

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.900 
way round forwards forwards backwards
about<00:02:49.239> steering<00:02:53.310> now<00:02:54.310> I've<00:02:54.430> got<00:02:54.580> steering

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
about steering now I've got steering

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:13.100 
about steering now I've got steering
backwards<00:02:55.540> or<00:02:55.870> reversed<00:03:06.060> swap<00:03:07.060> that<00:03:07.269> over

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.000 

we've<00:03:14.110> got<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.290> start<00:03:14.560> anyway<00:03:16.530> I'll<00:03:17.530> swap<00:03:17.829> them

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
we've got to start anyway I'll swap them

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.410 
we've got to start anyway I'll swap them
over<00:03:18.160> then<00:03:18.489> we'll<00:03:18.640> see<00:03:18.879> what<00:03:19.000> we<00:03:19.120> can<00:03:19.209> do<00:03:19.329> about

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
over then we'll see what we can do about

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.920 
over then we'll see what we can do about
the<00:03:20.280> broken<00:03:22.200> steering<00:03:23.200> arm<00:03:24.569> that's<00:03:25.569> not<00:03:25.780> going

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
the broken steering arm that's not going

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.809 
the broken steering arm that's not going
to<00:03:25.989> be<00:03:26.079> very<00:03:26.230> clear<00:03:26.739> to<00:03:27.099> see<00:03:27.310> what<00:03:27.459> I've<00:03:27.579> done

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
to be very clear to see what I've done

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:34.440 
to be very clear to see what I've done
there<00:03:28.890> but<00:03:29.890> I<00:03:29.920> had<00:03:30.190> a<00:03:30.299> plastic<00:03:33.299> needle<00:03:34.299> I

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
there but I had a plastic needle I

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.620 
there but I had a plastic needle I
suppose<00:03:34.720> you<00:03:34.840> call<00:03:35.200> it<00:03:39.269> that's<00:03:40.269> all<00:03:40.510> that's

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
suppose you call it that's all that's

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.440 
suppose you call it that's all that's
left<00:03:40.750> of<00:03:41.109> it<00:03:41.319> it<00:03:42.130> was<00:03:42.250> about<00:03:42.430> three<00:03:43.150> or<00:03:43.239> four

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
left of it it was about three or four

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.740 
left of it it was about three or four
inches<00:03:43.480> long<00:03:44.670> but<00:03:45.670> it<00:03:45.819> was<00:03:45.910> a<00:03:45.940> sort<00:03:46.209> of<00:03:46.269> plastic

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
inches long but it was a sort of plastic

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.190 
inches long but it was a sort of plastic
that<00:03:46.870> when<00:03:46.989> you<00:03:47.109> heat<00:03:47.349> it<00:03:47.380> it<00:03:47.650> melts<00:03:48.750> so<00:03:49.750> I<00:03:49.780> bent

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
that when you heat it it melts so I bent

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.729 
that when you heat it it melts so I bent
it<00:03:50.549> so<00:03:51.549> that<00:03:51.700> it's<00:03:51.790> going<00:03:51.970> through<00:03:52.299> the

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
it so that it's going through the

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.409 
it so that it's going through the
linkage<00:03:53.739> there<00:03:54.389> bent<00:03:55.389> it<00:03:55.630> back<00:03:55.660> and<00:03:56.290> then<00:03:56.500> I've

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
linkage there bent it back and then I've

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:01.530 
linkage there bent it back and then I've
melted<00:03:58.419> it<00:03:58.540> into<00:03:59.160> the<00:04:00.160> existing<00:04:00.819> plastic

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
melted it into the existing plastic

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.199 
melted it into the existing plastic
linkage<00:04:02.489> it's<00:04:03.489> not<00:04:03.790> going<00:04:04.000> to<00:04:04.060> be<00:04:04.150> very<00:04:04.359> strong

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
linkage it's not going to be very strong

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:18.949 
linkage it's not going to be very strong
but<00:04:07.209> it<00:04:07.359> does<00:04:07.630> work

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.360 

because<00:04:19.959> the<00:04:20.110> battery<00:04:20.560> covers<00:04:20.920> missing<00:04:21.070> a

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
because the battery covers missing a

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.730 
because the battery covers missing a
swell<00:04:21.640> so<00:04:22.120> I'll<00:04:22.870> see<00:04:23.050> if<00:04:23.140> I<00:04:23.170> can<00:04:23.290> find<00:04:23.470> a<00:04:23.530> bit<00:04:23.650> of

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
swell so I'll see if I can find a bit of

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.440 
swell so I'll see if I can find a bit of
plastic<00:04:24.190> to<00:04:24.340> put<00:04:24.490> on<00:04:24.610> there<00:04:24.820> so<00:04:25.090> it<00:04:25.180> doesn't

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
plastic to put on there so it doesn't

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.660 
plastic to put on there so it doesn't
drop<00:04:25.630> out<00:04:25.840> when<00:04:26.290> it's<00:04:26.440> driving<00:04:26.680> along<00:04:27.100> that's

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
drop out when it's driving along that's

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.690 
drop out when it's driving along that's
the<00:04:27.850> battery<00:04:28.060> cover<00:04:28.420> fixed<00:04:28.960> I<00:04:29.200> cut<00:04:29.920> up<00:04:29.950> a<00:04:30.280> old

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
the battery cover fixed I cut up a old

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.860 
the battery cover fixed I cut up a old
CD<00:04:32.400> not<00:04:33.400> quite<00:04:33.730> sure<00:04:33.760> of<00:04:34.180> the<00:04:34.270> camera<00:04:34.630> pick

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
CD not quite sure of the camera pick

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.740 
CD not quite sure of the camera pick
this<00:04:34.990> up<00:04:35.250> but<00:04:36.250> it<00:04:36.790> didn't<00:04:37.090> last<00:04:37.240> very<00:04:37.510> long

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
this up but it didn't last very long

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.630 
this up but it didn't last very long
that<00:04:38.370> fix<00:04:39.370> that<00:04:39.640> I<00:04:39.730> did<00:04:40.230> so<00:04:41.230> I've<00:04:41.350> now<00:04:41.640> wrapped

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
that fix that I did so I've now wrapped

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.510 
that fix that I did so I've now wrapped
it<00:04:42.850> in<00:04:42.970> wire<00:04:43.300> to<00:04:43.870> strengthen<00:04:44.410> it<00:04:44.530> and<00:04:44.710> then

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
it in wire to strengthen it and then

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.170 
it in wire to strengthen it and then
sealed<00:04:46.030> it<00:04:46.300> in<00:04:46.570> the<00:04:47.230> epoxy<00:04:47.470> resin<00:04:48.090> so<00:04:49.090> it

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
sealed it in the epoxy resin so it

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.420 
sealed it in the epoxy resin so it
should<00:04:49.360> be<00:04:49.510> a<00:04:49.540> little<00:04:49.660> bit<00:04:49.900> stronger<00:04:50.290> test<00:04:51.160> run

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
should be a little bit stronger test run

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:59.679 
should be a little bit stronger test run
in<00:04:51.730> the<00:04:51.910> conservatory

00:04:59.679 --> 00:04:59.689 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:01.850 

you<00:05:00.689> can<00:05:00.839> probably<00:05:01.050> see<00:05:01.319> we<00:05:01.409> haven't<00:05:01.589> got<00:05:01.679> much

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
you can probably see we haven't got much

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:29.590 
you can probably see we haven't got much
grip<00:05:02.279> here

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:37.629 

you

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:37.639 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:44.140 

but<00:05:38.639> it's<00:05:38.820> working<00:05:39.300> so

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.170 

I<00:05:44.919> should<00:05:45.919> be<00:05:46.070> fairly<00:05:46.400> happy<00:05:46.580> with<00:05:46.699> that

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
I should be fairly happy with that

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.939 
I should be fairly happy with that
the<00:05:47.630> only<00:05:47.810> thing<00:05:47.930> is<00:05:48.050> I<00:05:48.139> don't<00:05:48.199> think<00:05:48.800> my

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:48.949 
the only thing is I don't think my

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:51.550 
the only thing is I don't think my
repair<00:05:49.370> will<00:05:49.580> last<00:05:49.820> all<00:05:50.090> that<00:05:50.240> long<00:05:50.300> I<00:05:50.930> think

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
repair will last all that long I think

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.620 
repair will last all that long I think
if<00:05:51.830> my<00:05:52.070> grandchildren<00:05:52.940> play<00:05:53.060> with<00:05:53.330> it<00:05:53.449> and

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
if my grandchildren play with it and

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.930 
if my grandchildren play with it and
smash<00:05:54.139> it<00:05:54.290> into<00:05:54.410> the<00:05:54.590> walls<00:05:54.800> and<00:05:55.010> that<00:05:55.190> it

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
smash it into the walls and that it

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.760 
smash it into the walls and that it
probably<00:05:56.180> will<00:05:56.449> break<00:05:56.780> again<00:05:56.930> fairly<00:05:57.410> quickly

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
probably will break again fairly quickly

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.990 
probably will break again fairly quickly
so<00:05:59.050> long<00:06:00.050> term<00:06:00.350> this<00:06:00.650> is<00:06:00.830> probably<00:06:01.130> a<00:06:01.220> part

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
so long term this is probably a part

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.530 
so long term this is probably a part
only<00:06:02.510> car<00:06:03.470> that<00:06:03.770> I'll<00:06:04.669> take<00:06:04.940> the<00:06:05.060> motors<00:06:05.419> out

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:05.540 
only car that I'll take the motors out

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.050 
only car that I'll take the motors out
of<00:06:05.780> and<00:06:05.990> use<00:06:06.199> for<00:06:06.380> something<00:06:06.560> else<00:06:06.880> but<00:06:07.880> in<00:06:07.970> the

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
of and use for something else but in the

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:56.670 
of and use for something else but in the
meantime<00:06:08.240> it's<00:06:09.169> working

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:56.680 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.550 

so<00:06:57.680> job<00:06:58.310> done
