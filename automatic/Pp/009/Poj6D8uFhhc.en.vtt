flat back up to this date and then up to
80<00:01:23.530> here<00:01:24.530> sound<00:01:24.800> like

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.510 

and<00:01:29.290> then<00:01:29.380> you<00:01:29.470> could<00:01:29.590> add<00:01:29.740> in<00:01:29.950> this<00:01:30.160> little

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
and then you could add in this little

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:37.020 
and then you could add in this little
little<00:01:31.240> piece<00:01:32.080> that<00:01:32.380> goes<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:35.290> it's<00:01:35.530> made<00:01:36.030> you

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
little piece that goes so it's made you

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.380 
little piece that goes so it's made you
up<00:01:37.150> from<00:01:37.300> an<00:01:37.420> A<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:39.280> C<00:01:39.400> and<00:01:39.790> then<00:01:39.910> that<00:01:40.060> goes<00:01:40.210> D

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
up from an A to C and then that goes D

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:48.080 
up from an A to C and then that goes D
so<00:01:40.690> it's<00:01:40.810> going<00:01:40.930> to<00:01:40.990> sound<00:01:41.110> like<00:01:45.690> like<00:01:46.690> that

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
so it's going to sound like like that

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.150 
so it's going to sound like like that
