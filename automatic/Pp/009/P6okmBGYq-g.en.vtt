00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.819 
the Iman but I believe that your mind
and<00:01:46.470> target<00:01:46.950> can<00:01:47.520> run<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.880> up<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.270> $17<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.320> think

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
and target can run you up to $17 I think

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.649 
and target can run you up to $17 I think
but<00:01:50.310> it's<00:01:50.430> really<00:01:50.610> not<00:01:50.880> one<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.180> those<00:01:51.360> really

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
but it's really not one of those really

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.300 
but it's really not one of those really
cheap<00:01:51.780> products<00:01:52.500> like<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.799> Maybelline<00:01:53.280> one

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
cheap products like the Maybelline one

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.130 
cheap products like the Maybelline one
are<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.850> like<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> simulant<00:01:54.509> brush<00:01:54.689> like<00:01:54.899> this

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
are you like a simulant brush like this

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.230 
are you like a simulant brush like this
you<00:01:55.799> should<00:01:56.070> be<00:01:56.219> fine<00:01:56.430> because<00:01:56.610> it's<00:01:57.030> big

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
you should be fine because it's big

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.910 
you should be fine because it's big
enough<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.689> distribute<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.259> product<00:01:58.500> evenly

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
enough to distribute the product evenly

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.429 
enough to distribute the product evenly
on<00:01:59.130> your<00:01:59.159> face<00:01:59.549> but<00:02:00.060> using<00:02:00.450> like<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.840> sponge<00:02:01.200> or

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
on your face but using like a sponge or

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.020 
on your face but using like a sponge or
something<00:02:01.469> makes<00:02:01.950> look<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.369> product<00:02:02.610> so

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
something makes look of the product so

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.819 
something makes look of the product so
you<00:02:03.090> may<00:02:03.360> use<00:02:03.570> more<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.259> product<00:02:04.710> and

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
you may use more of the product and

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.560 
you may use more of the product and
might<00:02:05.100> cause<00:02:05.369> your<00:02:05.640> pores<00:02:05.909> be<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.149> little<00:02:06.450> more

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
might cause your pores be a little more

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.389 
might cause your pores be a little more
clogged<00:02:06.869> than<00:02:07.110> normal<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:07.829> with<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.039> BB<00:02:08.220> cream

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
I used was this matte

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.340 
I used was this matte
Matt<00:02:10.220> cream<00:02:10.640> like<00:02:11.180> I<00:02:11.270> said<00:02:11.510> I'm<00:02:11.600> not<00:02:11.630> sure<00:02:11.810> if

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
Matt cream like I said I'm not sure if

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.080 
Matt cream like I said I'm not sure if
they<00:02:12.530> still<00:02:12.830> sell<00:02:13.130> this<00:02:13.310> in<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:13.580> max<00:02:13.790> stores

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
they still sell this in the max stores

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.059 
they still sell this in the max stores
because<00:02:14.390> I<00:02:14.420> haven't<00:02:14.750> seen<00:02:15.080> them<00:02:15.319> and<00:02:15.680> I<00:02:15.860> got

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
because I haven't seen them and I got

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.130 
because I haven't seen them and I got
just<00:02:16.250> a<00:02:16.370> long<00:02:16.610> time<00:02:16.970> ago<00:02:17.240> from<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.750> count<00:02:17.990> over

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
just a long time ago from the count over

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.110 
just a long time ago from the count over
I'm<00:02:18.530> really<00:02:18.860> really<00:02:19.010> filling<00:02:19.430> in<00:02:19.580> I<00:02:19.760> think<00:02:19.819> it

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
I'm really really filling in I think it

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.270 
I'm really really filling in I think it
looks<00:02:20.300> very<00:02:20.569> natural<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:21.410> although<00:02:21.800> I<00:02:21.950> am<00:02:22.250> a

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
looks very natural and although I am a

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.070 
looks very natural and although I am a
little<00:02:22.610> shiny<00:02:22.940> but<00:02:23.270> I'm<00:02:23.390> not<00:02:23.569> super<00:02:23.930> shiny

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
little shiny but I'm not super shiny

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.380 
little shiny but I'm not super shiny
because<00:02:24.470> from<00:02:24.770> me<00:02:25.370> priming<00:02:25.819> my<00:02:25.850> face<00:02:25.970> or

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
because from me priming my face or

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.530 
because from me priming my face or
whatever<00:02:26.540> but<00:02:26.930> it's<00:02:27.560> just<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:28.070> natural<00:02:28.700> look<00:02:29.300> to

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
whatever but it's just a natural look to

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.870 
whatever but it's just a natural look to
it<00:02:29.870> so<00:02:30.080> it<00:02:30.350> looks<00:02:30.530> like<00:02:30.620> my<00:02:31.250> skin<00:02:31.310> just<00:02:31.700> got<00:02:31.850> a

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
it so it looks like my skin just got a

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.820 
it so it looks like my skin just got a
little<00:02:32.209> old<00:02:32.420> without<00:02:32.720> any<00:02:33.080> makeup<00:02:33.320> on<00:02:33.620> but<00:02:33.770> I

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
little old without any makeup on but I

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.370 
little old without any makeup on but I
love<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.430> way<00:02:34.550> covers<00:02:35.120> it's<00:02:35.570> like<00:02:35.900> coverage

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
love the way covers it's like coverage

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.840 
love the way covers it's like coverage
so<00:02:36.500> apparently<00:02:36.920> because<00:02:37.190> we<00:02:37.280> all<00:02:37.430> know<00:02:37.610> Matt

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850
