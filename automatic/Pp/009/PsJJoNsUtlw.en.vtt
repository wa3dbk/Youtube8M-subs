00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
couple months ago and they gave me a

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.430 
couple months ago and they gave me a
sample<00:00:38.800> of<00:00:38.950> the<00:00:39.610> random<00:00:40.329> glycol<00:00:40.870> lactic

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
sample of the random glycol lactic

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.830 
sample of the random glycol lactic
radiance<00:00:41.890> renewal<00:00:42.370> mask<00:00:42.609> the<00:00:43.120> sample<00:00:43.510> but

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
radiance renewal mask the sample but

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.810 
radiance renewal mask the sample but
this<00:00:44.050> it's<00:00:44.469> a<00:00:44.500> pretty<00:00:44.710> fat<00:00:45.039> sample<00:00:45.579> so<00:00:45.789> I

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
this it's a pretty fat sample so I

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.549 
this it's a pretty fat sample so I
decided<00:00:46.270> to<00:00:46.420> try<00:00:46.660> it<00:00:46.690> out<00:00:46.899> I<00:00:46.930> don't<00:00:47.260> like<00:00:47.410> those

haven't done the whole wipe up with the
cloth<00:02:51.610> thing<00:02:51.940> but<00:02:52.270> just<00:02:52.510> based<00:02:53.320> on<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.680> sample

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
cloth thing but just based on the sample

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.860 
cloth thing but just based on the sample
I<00:02:54.220> absolutely<00:02:54.640> love<00:02:55.030> this<00:02:55.180> product<00:02:55.450> um<00:02:55.660> it's

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
I absolutely love this product um it's

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.050

so<00:02:55.990> all<00:02:56.260> skin<00:02:56.710> types<00:02:56.980> except<00:02:57.400> for<00:02:57.610> sensitive

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
so all skin types except for sensitive

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.090 
so all skin types except for sensitive
skin<00:02:58.420> types<00:02:58.570> it<00:02:58.840> does<00:02:59.050> have<00:02:59.230> a<00:02:59.260> slight<00:02:59.680> tingle

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
skin types it does have a slight tingle

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.590 
skin types it does have a slight tingle
to<00:03:00.280> it<00:03:00.400> so<00:03:00.520> I<00:03:00.550> can<00:03:00.730> imagine<00:03:00.940> I<00:03:01.270> don't<00:03:01.330> have

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
to it so I can imagine I don't have

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.020 
to it so I can imagine I don't have
sensitive<00:03:02.050> skin<00:03:02.290> I<00:03:02.350> don't<00:03:02.410> think<00:03:02.770> so<00:03:02.950> so<00:03:03.640> I<00:03:03.670> can

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
sensitive skin I don't think so so I can

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.490 
sensitive skin I don't think so so I can
imagine<00:03:04.450> if<00:03:04.570> you<00:03:04.690> do<00:03:04.870> have<00:03:05.020> sensitive<00:03:05.470> skin

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
imagine if you do have sensitive skin

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.350 
imagine if you do have sensitive skin
that<00:03:05.710> it<00:03:05.890> would<00:03:05.980> probably<00:03:06.190> burn<00:03:06.910> so<00:03:07.330> I

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
that it would probably burn so I

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.320 
that it would probably burn so I
wouldn't<00:03:07.750> suggest<00:03:07.870> it<00:03:08.350> um<00:03:09.280> but<00:03:09.730> it's<00:03:09.940> really

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
wouldn't suggest it um but it's really

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.180 
wouldn't suggest it um but it's really
really<00:03:10.510> nice<00:03:10.780> I<00:03:10.990> have<00:03:11.200> dry<00:03:11.440> skin<00:03:11.770> and<00:03:11.860> I<00:03:11.950> think

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
really nice I have dry skin and I think

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.490 
really nice I have dry skin and I think
it<00:03:12.310> just<00:03:12.460> just<00:03:13.060> makes<00:03:13.330> my<00:03:13.480> skin<00:03:13.540> look<00:03:13.990> you<00:03:14.380> know
