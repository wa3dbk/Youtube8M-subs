00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.199
 the person who is not being what he has to do 

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:13.269
 for me the first thing that happens is that they lose their vision 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:17.249
 truly things 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.670
 when one is focused on what he has to do more but focused on what 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.480
 who does not have a house 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.810
 and that is one of the dangers that I see 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.699
 today our youth 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.850
 they have lost vision they have lost dreams 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.660
 we are good themselves in which reality and they find it 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.040
 the way to project beyond 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.740
 and we are seeing efe 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.350
 how suddenly the roles that we had to follow the example we have 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.830
 and we have examples like these celebrities that the only thing they do is run over people 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.660
 and kill people getting drunk was doing crap had the show business is 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.510
 speaking of style that he and because this one burried of the dressing room with the other and 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.700
 and we do not have oaks to follow where the news is that they tell us about the 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.150
 great achievements that people do the other day read nn cnn who there is no 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.380
 boy with that haiti theme 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.070
 a baby of the cholo years 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.040
 took a page on the internet a blog and put I'm going to run 8 kilometers this was 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.560
 in england I'm going to run with my bike eight kilometers around the 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.560

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.110

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.070
 8 year credit 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.520
 hence the need of people does not have needs 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.049
 but he saw the need for news 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.690
 he was struck by what he saw 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.030
 he had a vision said 'I'm going to collect money to send it to the corner 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.790

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.790

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.810
