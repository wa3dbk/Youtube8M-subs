weekend<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.320> think<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:43.829> loss<00:01:44.189> in<00:01:44.460> Los<00:01:44.579> Angeles

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
weekend I think that loss in Los Angeles

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.300 
weekend I think that loss in Los Angeles
really<00:01:45.509> stung<00:01:45.899> for<00:01:46.200> sporting<00:01:46.770> they<00:01:46.920> knew<00:01:47.159> they

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
really stung for sporting they knew they

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.740 
really stung for sporting they knew they
were<00:01:47.369> tired<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.060> just<00:01:48.240> didn't<00:01:48.479> work<00:01:48.570> out

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
were tired and it just didn't work out

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.270 
were tired and it just didn't work out
for<00:01:48.810> them<00:01:48.990> now<00:01:49.380> they<00:01:49.590> come<00:01:49.799> home<00:01:50.070> that

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
for them now they come home that

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.649 
for them now they come home that
cauldron<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.820> going<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.000> be<00:01:51.119> rocking<00:01:51.540> and

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
cauldron is going to be rocking and

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.600 
cauldron is going to be rocking and
rolling<00:01:51.780> or<00:01:52.140> bubbling<00:01:52.560> over<00:01:52.710> if<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.220> will<00:01:53.399> and

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
rolling or bubbling over if you will and

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.520 
rolling or bubbling over if you will and
i<00:01:53.880> think<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.210> with<00:01:54.570> graham<00:01:54.780> zusi<00:01:55.020> looking<00:01:55.470> to

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
i think that with graham zusi looking to

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.440 
i think that with graham zusi looking to
push<00:01:55.740> as<00:01:55.920> much<00:01:55.950> as<00:01:56.250> possible<00:01:56.430> i'm<00:01:56.909> still

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
push as much as possible i'm still

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.870 
push as much as possible i'm still
waiting<00:01:57.840> for<00:01:57.869> CJ<00:01:58.350> Sapong<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.979> find<00:01:59.430> his<00:01:59.670> rhythm

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
waiting for CJ Sapong to find his rhythm

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.850 
waiting for CJ Sapong to find his rhythm
I<00:02:00.180> don't<00:02:00.659> think<00:02:00.869> he's<00:02:01.020> really<00:02:01.320> looked<00:02:01.770> like

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
I don't think he's really looked like

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.800 
I don't think he's really looked like
the<00:02:02.100> old<00:02:02.250> CJ<00:02:02.640> Sapong<00:02:02.700> we<00:02:03.090> saw<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.299> first<00:02:03.570> couple

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
the old CJ Sapong we saw a first couple

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.840 
the old CJ Sapong we saw a first couple
years<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:04.020> his<00:02:04.170> career<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:04.740> can<00:02:05.250> he<00:02:05.430> find<00:02:05.700> that

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
years of his career so can he find that

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.069 
years of his career so can he find that
rhythm<00:02:06.060> that's<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.360> big<00:02:06.509> one<00:02:06.630> for<00:02:06.750> sporting

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
rhythm that's a big one for sporting

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.359 
rhythm that's a big one for sporting
yeah<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.380> certainly<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.829> speaking<00:02:08.280> of

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
yeah it certainly is speaking of

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.680

are<00:02:16.110> both<00:02:16.320> doubts<00:02:16.860> right<00:02:17.250> now<00:02:17.430> which<00:02:17.820> who<00:02:18.330> do

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
are both doubts right now which who do

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.460 
are both doubts right now which who do
you<00:02:18.480> think<00:02:18.630> is<00:02:18.720> more<00:02:18.900> important<00:02:19.260> for<00:02:19.320> them<00:02:19.410> to

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
you think is more important for them to

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.050 
you think is more important for them to
have<00:02:19.680> in<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.860> lineup<00:02:20.160> on<00:02:20.280> Saturday<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.940> know

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
have in the lineup on Saturday you know

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.910 
have in the lineup on Saturday you know
the<00:02:21.210> way<00:02:21.390> things<00:02:21.450> went<00:02:22.020> with<00:02:22.260> Landon<00:02:22.620> Donovan

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
the way things went with Landon Donovan

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.410 
the way things went with Landon Donovan
last<00:02:23.130> weekend<00:02:23.460> I<00:02:23.580> think<00:02:23.610> he<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.210> more

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
last weekend I think he is more

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.150 
last weekend I think he is more
important<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:24.930> they<00:02:25.020> need<00:02:25.140> obviously<00:02:25.530> what

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
important that they need obviously what

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.650 
important that they need obviously what
Robbie<00:02:26.340> Keane<00:02:26.640> brings<00:02:26.910> with<00:02:27.090> his<00:02:27.210> ability<00:02:27.600> to

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
Robbie Keane brings with his ability to

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.150 
Robbie Keane brings with his ability to
finish<00:02:27.990> his<00:02:28.140> ability<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.560> hold<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:28.950> ball<00:02:29.130> up

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
finish his ability to hold the ball up

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.190 
finish his ability to hold the ball up
and<00:02:29.520> everything<00:02:29.790> that's<00:02:30.240> huge<00:02:30.600> for<00:02:30.660> them<00:02:30.870> but

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
and everything that's huge for them but

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.530 
and everything that's huge for them but
Landon<00:02:31.950> Donovan<00:02:32.340> brings<00:02:32.610> them<00:02:32.880> that<00:02:33.090> presence

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
Landon Donovan brings them that presence

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.390 
Landon Donovan brings them that presence
on<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.720> outside<00:02:34.140> especially<00:02:34.680> on<00:02:35.190> the

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
on the outside especially on the

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.680 
on the outside especially on the
counter-attack<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.150> when<00:02:36.300> they're<00:02:36.420> on<00:02:36.540> the

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
counter-attack and when they're on the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.970 
counter-attack and when they're on the
road<00:02:36.840> that's<00:02:37.140> when<00:02:37.380> they're<00:02:37.530> at<00:02:37.710> their<00:02:37.740> best

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
road that's when they're at their best

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.100 
road that's when they're at their best
that<00:02:38.490> way<00:02:38.610> so<00:02:38.670> i<00:02:39.060> think<00:02:39.420> there's<00:02:39.780> also<00:02:39.900> this

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
that way so i think there's also this

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.420 
that way so i think there's also this
sort<00:02:40.350> of<00:02:40.380> you<00:02:40.650> know<00:02:40.680> almost<00:02:41.280> like<00:02:41.370> a

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
sort of you know almost like a

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.670 
sort of you know almost like a
psychological<00:02:42.330> lift<00:02:42.690> that<00:02:43.110> they<00:02:43.260> get<00:02:43.500> when

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
psychological lift that they get when

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.530 
psychological lift that they get when
they<00:02:43.710> see<00:02:43.830> landon<00:02:44.430> step<00:02:44.670> on<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:44.940> field<00:02:45.120> you

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
they see landon step on the field you

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.910 
they see landon step on the field you
could<00:02:45.720> also<00:02:45.870> end<00:02:45.990> up<00:02:46.230> having<00:02:46.530> just<00:02:46.710> Jack

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
could also end up having just Jack

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.010 
could also end up having just Jack
McBean<00:02:47.280> play<00:02:47.670> up<00:02:47.850> as<00:02:48.030> that<00:02:48.210> target<00:02:48.630> man<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:48.960> do

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
McBean play up as that target man and do

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.140 
McBean play up as that target man and do
some<00:02:49.350> of<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.530> work<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.740> Keane<00:02:50.190> can<00:02:50.430> do<00:02:50.550> he's

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
some of the work that Keane can do he's

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.030 
some of the work that Keane can do he's
not<00:02:51.330> necessarily<00:02:51.780> able<00:02:51.990> to<00:02:52.110> turn<00:02:52.410> a<00:02:52.440> defender

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
not necessarily able to turn a defender
