let's talk about hair fall which is a

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.220 
let's talk about hair fall which is a
complete<00:00:22.220> nightmare<00:00:22.609> for<00:00:23.570> a<00:00:23.599> whole<00:00:23.929> lot<00:00:24.199> of

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:26.509 
people so what are the causes of hair

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.960 
people so what are the causes of hair
fall<00:00:26.749> the<00:00:27.230> most<00:00:27.499> important<00:00:28.099> cause<00:00:28.339> today<00:00:28.730> is

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
fall the most important cause today is

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.010 
fall the most important cause today is
stress<00:00:29.419> it<00:00:30.079> could<00:00:30.380> be<00:00:30.529> physical<00:00:30.890> stress<00:00:32.020> lack

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
stress it could be physical stress lack

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.569 
stress it could be physical stress lack
of<00:00:33.050> sleep<00:00:34.210> lack<00:00:35.210> of<00:00:35.420> adequate<00:00:35.629> rest<00:00:36.340> very<00:00:37.340> bad

of sleep lack of adequate rest very bad

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.900 
of sleep lack of adequate rest very bad
lifestyle<00:00:38.329> or<00:00:38.989> it<00:00:39.530> could<00:00:39.800> be<00:00:39.949> mental<00:00:40.370> stress

lifestyle or it could be mental stress

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.360 
lifestyle or it could be mental stress
where<00:00:41.239> one<00:00:41.660> is<00:00:41.870> overloaded<00:00:42.530> with<00:00:42.680> work<00:00:42.829> or

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
where one is overloaded with work or

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.660 
where one is overloaded with work or
it's<00:00:44.120> a<00:00:44.239> personal<00:00:44.870> stress<00:00:45.289> which<00:00:45.949> can<00:00:45.980> cause<00:00:46.399> a

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
it's a personal stress which can cause a

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.209 
it's a personal stress which can cause a
hormonal<00:00:46.910> change<00:00:47.570> and<00:00:47.840> result<00:00:48.530> in<00:00:48.739> a<00:00:48.920> lot<00:00:49.070> of

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
hormonal change and result in a lot of

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.250 
hormonal change and result in a lot of
hair<00:00:49.399> loss<00:00:49.550> the<00:00:50.449> other<00:00:50.570> causes<00:00:51.019> causes

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
hair loss the other causes causes

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.700 
hair loss the other causes causes
genetics<00:00:52.219> so<00:00:52.519> if<00:00:52.609> there<00:00:52.789> is<00:00:52.910> a<00:00:52.940> family<00:00:53.210> history

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
genetics so if there is a family history

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.950 
genetics so if there is a family history
it<00:00:54.710> comes<00:00:54.980> down<00:00:55.219> the<00:00:55.429> genes<00:00:55.670> and<00:00:56.149> then<00:00:56.510> you

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
it comes down the genes and then you

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.439 
it comes down the genes and then you
have<00:00:57.170> hair<00:00:57.559> loss<00:00:57.769> the<00:00:58.280> third<00:00:58.640> cause<00:00:59.030> of<00:00:59.239> hair

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
have hair loss the third cause of hair

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.229 
have hair loss the third cause of hair
fall<00:00:59.690> something<00:01:00.649> which<00:01:01.190> you<00:01:01.519> are<00:01:01.550> deficient

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
fall something which you are deficient

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:02.830 
fall something which you are deficient
in

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
in

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.970 
in
iron<00:01:03.620> deficiency<00:01:04.390> biotin<00:01:05.390> deficiency

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:05.980 
iron deficiency biotin deficiency

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.590 
iron deficiency biotin deficiency
protein<00:01:06.980> deficiency<00:01:07.610> most<00:01:08.000> importantly

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
protein deficiency most importantly

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.590 
protein deficiency most importantly
remember<00:01:09.140> there<00:01:09.950> are<00:01:09.980> hair<00:01:10.460> are<00:01:10.790> made<00:01:11.330> up<00:01:11.480> of

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
remember there are hair are made up of

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.140 
remember there are hair are made up of
keratin<00:01:12.290> and<00:01:12.770> keratin<00:01:13.370> F<00:01:13.460> is<00:01:13.580> nothing<00:01:13.850> but

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
keratin and keratin F is nothing but

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.990 
keratin and keratin F is nothing but
four

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
four

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.990 
four
so<00:01:15.540> be<00:01:15.690> very<00:01:15.720> very<00:01:16.320> careful<00:01:16.590> about<00:01:17.070> what<00:01:17.730> you

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
so be very very careful about what you

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.140 
so be very very careful about what you
eat<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.690> must<00:01:19.050> have<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.710> very<00:01:20.100> high<00:01:20.520> protein

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
eat you must have a very high protein

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.429 
eat you must have a very high protein
diet<00:01:21.690> a<00:01:22.080> diet<00:01:22.530> which<00:01:22.860> has<00:01:22.970> minerals<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.570> know

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
diet a diet which has minerals you know

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.209 
diet a diet which has minerals you know
biotin<00:01:26.399> in<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:27.240> can<00:01:27.420> also<00:01:27.630> take

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.219 
biotin in it you can also take

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:31.370 
biotin in it you can also take
supplements<00:01:29.219> of<00:01:29.340> biotin<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.299> proteins<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
supplements of biotin and proteins the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.709 
supplements of biotin and proteins the
fourth<00:01:31.619> course<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.159> an<00:01:32.520> illness<00:01:32.819> so<00:01:33.240> if<00:01:33.600> you

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
fourth course is an illness so if you

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:36.550 
fourth course is an illness so if you
suffered<00:01:34.259> from<00:01:34.439> any<00:01:34.799> illness<00:01:35.069> like<00:01:35.520> say<00:01:36.119> a

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
suffered from any illness like say a

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.300 
suffered from any illness like say a
typhoid<00:01:37.560> or<00:01:37.829> malaria<00:01:38.280> or<00:01:38.700> even<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.630> viral<00:01:40.049> fever

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
typhoid or malaria or even a viral fever

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.849 
typhoid or malaria or even a viral fever
there<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.969> damage<00:01:42.539> that<00:01:42.780> occurs<00:01:43.200> eventually

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:43.859 
there is a damage that occurs eventually

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:46.789 
there is a damage that occurs eventually
and<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.459> hair<00:01:44.670> fall<00:01:44.939> starts<00:01:45.799> approximately

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
and the hair fall starts approximately

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.249 
and the hair fall starts approximately
two<00:01:47.039> months<00:01:47.429> after<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:48.030> illness<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.929> it<00:01:49.049> goes

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
two months after the illness and it goes

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.889 
two months after the illness and it goes
on<00:01:49.500> for<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.770> couple<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.219> months<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:51.060> there<00:01:51.329> you

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
on for a couple of months so there you

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.740 
on for a couple of months so there you
will<00:01:52.200> need<00:01:52.439> some<00:01:53.099> vitamin<00:01:53.909> supplements<00:01:54.509> once

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
will need some vitamin supplements once

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.100 
will need some vitamin supplements once
again<00:01:55.579> if<00:01:56.579> you've<00:01:56.819> undergone<00:01:57.359> any<00:01:57.689> kind<00:01:57.989> of

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
again if you've undergone any kind of

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.699 
again if you've undergone any kind of
surgery

00:01:58.699 --> 00:01:58.709 
surgery

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:01.459 
surgery
that's<00:01:59.189> against<00:02:00.030> rest<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.569> body<00:02:00.780> so

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
that's against rest of the body so

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.080 
that's against rest of the body so
that's<00:02:01.619> when<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.219> will<00:02:02.429> see<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.879> you're

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
that's when you will see that you're

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.309 
that's when you will see that you're
losing<00:02:03.509> hair<00:02:03.750> again

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
losing hair again

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:07.789 
losing hair again

you find that the person is losing a lot

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.140 
you find that the person is losing a lot
of<00:02:13.049> hair<00:02:13.290> that<00:02:13.920> condition<00:02:14.549> is<00:02:14.700> known<00:02:15.030> as
