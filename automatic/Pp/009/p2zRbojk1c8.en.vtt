00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.290 

and<00:00:00.120> excited<00:00:00.719> about<00:00:00.829> my<00:00:01.829> quad<00:00:02.669> now<00:00:02.939> because

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
and excited about my quad now because

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.840 
and excited about my quad now because
it's<00:00:03.570> all<00:00:03.720> tuned<00:00:04.020> in<00:00:04.259> it<00:00:04.980> turns<00:00:05.279> out<00:00:05.460> the

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
it's all tuned in it turns out the

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.860 
it's all tuned in it turns out the
differential<00:00:06.569> rate<00:00:07.220> parameter<00:00:08.389> was<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.630> key

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
differential rate parameter was the key

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.060 
differential rate parameter was the key
to<00:00:10.040> UM<00:00:11.269> making<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.389> fly<00:00:12.480> really<00:00:12.719> well<00:00:13.070> huh

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
to UM making it fly really well huh

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.099 
to UM making it fly really well huh
who'd<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.639> thunk<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:15.059> was<00:00:15.420> messing<00:00:15.630> with<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.929> P

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
who'd a thunk I was messing with the P

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.500 
who'd a thunk I was messing with the P
is<00:00:16.139> forever<00:00:16.650> but<00:00:17.609> differential<00:00:18.330> made<00:00:18.480> a

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
is forever but differential made a

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.720 
is forever but differential made a
haunted<00:00:19.170> difference<00:00:20.180> so<00:00:21.180> here<00:00:21.600> she<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:24.170> I

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
haunted difference so here she is and I

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.029 
haunted difference so here she is and I
tried<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:26.849> new<00:00:27.119> camera<00:00:27.390> mount<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.750> have<00:00:27.930> a

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
tried this new camera mount I have a

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:34.209 
tried this new camera mount I have a
parrot<00:00:29.039> or<00:00:29.189> not<00:00:29.760> parrot<00:00:30.439> Tarot<00:00:32.239> two<00:00:33.239> axis

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
parrot or not parrot Tarot two axis

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.119

gimbal<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.870> I'm<00:00:36.870> going<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.020> mount<00:00:37.200> but<00:00:37.530> it's

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
gimbal that I'm going to mount but it's

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.490 
gimbal that I'm going to mount but it's
just<00:00:38.370> temporary<00:00:38.670> but<00:00:39.629> if<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.050> ever<00:00:40.079> took<00:00:40.320> any

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
just temporary but if you ever took any

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.880 
just temporary but if you ever took any
engineering<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:42.110> spring<00:00:43.110> dampen<00:00:43.469> our<00:00:43.559> system

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
engineering the spring dampen our system

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.119 
engineering the spring dampen our system
is<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.129> best<00:00:44.510> for<00:00:45.739> vibrating<00:00:46.739> any<00:00:46.860> kind<00:00:47.100> of

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
is the best for vibrating any kind of

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.299 
is the best for vibrating any kind of
dampening<00:00:48.260> or<00:00:49.260> canceling<00:00:49.739> out<00:00:49.829> any<00:00:49.980> type<00:00:50.280> of

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
dampening or canceling out any type of

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.160 
dampening or canceling out any type of
vibration<00:00:51.379> so<00:00:52.460> these<00:00:53.460> pads<00:00:53.789> are<00:00:54.170> actually

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
vibration so these pads are actually

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.040 
vibration so these pads are actually
knives<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.500> damp<00:00:55.710> air<00:00:56.329> damper<00:00:57.329> dampener

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
knives a damp air damper dampener

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.049 
knives a damp air damper dampener
whatever<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.530> then<00:00:59.219> these<00:00:59.340> are<00:00:59.550> another

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
whatever and then these are another

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.819 
whatever and then these are another
Springs<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:01.199> actually<00:01:01.530> works<00:01:01.710> really

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
Springs and that actually works really

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.850 
Springs and that actually works really
well<00:01:02.210> there's<00:01:03.379> damper<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.409> top<00:01:04.710> on<00:01:04.949> bottom<00:01:05.070> and

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
well there's damper on top on bottom and

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:14.420 
well there's damper on top on bottom and
it<00:01:07.860> actually<00:01:08.670> works<00:01:09.060> like<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> champ<00:01:10.369> mm<00:01:13.430> so

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
it actually works like a champ mm so

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.050 
it actually works like a champ mm so
I've<00:01:14.820> got<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:17.150> defibrillator<00:01:19.460> base<00:01:20.460> piece

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
I've got that defibrillator base piece

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.780 
I've got that defibrillator base piece
for<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.540> SK<00:01:21.900> 450<00:01:23.540> frame<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:26.280> long<00:01:26.490> legs

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
for the SK 450 frame and the long legs

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.179 
for the SK 450 frame and the long legs
and<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.299> dead<00:01:27.450> cat<00:01:27.659> conversion<00:01:28.189> obviously

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
and the dead cat conversion obviously

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.640 
and the dead cat conversion obviously
and<00:01:29.579> moved<00:01:30.240> one<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:31.490> PC<00:01:32.490> boards<00:01:32.759> up<00:01:32.909> top<00:01:33.150> to

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
and moved one of the PC boards up top to

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.920 
and moved one of the PC boards up top to
amount<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.740> battery<00:01:35.009> in<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.250> middle<00:01:35.490> and

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
amount the battery in the middle and

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.550 
amount the battery in the middle and
running<00:01:36.930> at<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.110> PM<00:01:37.439> 2.5<00:01:39.020> and<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.140> can<00:01:40.290> see<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
running at a PM 2.5 and you can see the

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.039 
running at a PM 2.5 and you can see the
GPS<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.310> telemetry<00:01:41.520> there<00:01:41.939> along<00:01:42.750> with<00:01:42.780> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
GPS and telemetry there along with the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.249 
GPS and telemetry there along with the
minim<00:01:43.380> OSD<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:44.360> a<00:01:46.369> 600<00:01:47.960> milliwatt<00:01:48.960> video

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
minim OSD and a 600 milliwatt video

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.660 
minim OSD and a 600 milliwatt video
transmitter<00:01:49.909> going<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.090> back<00:01:52.640> with<00:01:53.640> a

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
transmitter going in the back with a

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.560 
transmitter going in the back with a
skew<00:01:53.939> planner<00:01:54.149> antenna<00:01:54.509> on<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.829> so<00:01:56.570> yeah

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
skew planner antenna on it so yeah

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.690 
skew planner antenna on it so yeah
really<00:01:57.899> happy<00:01:58.200> with<00:01:58.350> how<00:01:58.380> it's<00:01:58.590> running<00:01:58.710> um<00:02:00.380> so

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
really happy with how it's running um so

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.300 
really happy with how it's running um so
the<00:02:04.219> defibrillator<00:02:05.390> like<00:02:06.390> board<00:02:06.750> has<00:02:07.530> traces

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
the defibrillator like board has traces

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.520 
the defibrillator like board has traces
in<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.819> route<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.330 

go<00:02:12.590> signal<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:13.310> power<00:02:14.709> so<00:02:15.709> you<00:02:15.770> don't<00:02:16.130> have<00:02:16.220> to

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
go signal and power so you don't have to

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.220 
go signal and power so you don't have to
run<00:02:16.490> the<00:02:16.580> wires<00:02:16.730> everywhere<00:02:16.940> you<00:02:17.240> just<00:02:17.270> learn

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
run the wires everywhere you just learn

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.710 
run the wires everywhere you just learn
them<00:02:18.350> into<00:02:18.590> these<00:02:18.709> little<00:02:18.770> plugs<00:02:19.250> on<00:02:19.819> the

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
them into these little plugs on the

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:28.000 
them into these little plugs on the
board<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.760> that<00:02:22.760> works<00:02:22.910> really<00:02:23.030> well<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:27.230> the

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
board and that works really well the the

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.210 
board and that works really well the the
defibrillator<00:02:28.580> board<00:02:28.850> acts<00:02:29.030> as<00:02:29.209> the<00:02:30.220> power

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
defibrillator board acts as the power

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.059 
defibrillator board acts as the power
distribution<00:02:31.580> board<00:02:32.030> as<00:02:32.180> well<00:02:32.330> and<00:02:32.600> it<00:02:32.810> has<00:02:33.020> a

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
distribution board as well and it has a

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.630 
distribution board as well and it has a
5<00:02:34.069> volt<00:02:34.100> and<00:02:34.520> 12<00:02:35.030> volt<00:02:35.239> regulator<00:02:35.600> in<00:02:36.110> it<00:02:36.230> which

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
5 volt and 12 volt regulator in it which

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.449 
5 volt and 12 volt regulator in it which
is<00:02:37.640> supposedly<00:02:38.030> supposed<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.630> clean<00:02:38.870> up<00:02:39.459> like

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
is supposedly supposed to clean up like

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.780 
is supposedly supposed to clean up like
motor<00:02:40.730> noise<00:02:41.000> and<00:02:41.270> isolate<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:42.160> AV<00:02:43.160> power

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
motor noise and isolate the AV power

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.930 
motor noise and isolate the AV power
system<00:02:44.300> from<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:45.160> motor<00:02:46.160> power<00:02:46.400> system<00:02:46.790> and

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
system from the motor power system and

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.870 
system from the motor power system and
it<00:02:47.120> actually<00:02:47.330> does<00:02:47.630> a<00:02:47.660> pretty<00:02:47.720> good<00:02:47.900> job<00:02:48.019> I

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
it actually does a pretty good job I

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.600 
it actually does a pretty good job I
didn't<00:02:49.880> see<00:02:49.970> any<00:02:50.420> motor<00:02:50.570> noise<00:02:51.340> it's<00:02:52.340> happy

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
didn't see any motor noise it's happy
