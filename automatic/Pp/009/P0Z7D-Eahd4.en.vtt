getting about that the first part today
is<00:00:12.630> discussing<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.530> technology<00:00:14.070> of<00:00:14.099> the

line of scrimmage so much excitement
associated<00:00:18.600> with<00:00:18.750> football<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.140> watching<00:00:19.740> it

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
associated with football and watching it

associated with football and watching it
these<00:00:19.980> days<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.670> we<00:00:20.760> take<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.060> for<00:00:21.210> granted

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
these days and we take it for granted

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.790 
these days and we take it for granted
what's<00:00:21.720> there<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.080> we<00:00:22.140> really<00:00:22.380> enjoyed<00:00:22.680> it

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
what's there and we really enjoyed it

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.200 
what's there and we really enjoyed it
yellow<00:00:22.920> line<00:00:23.130> don't<00:00:23.340> we<00:00:23.430> that's<00:00:23.850> right

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
yellow line don't we that's right

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.670 
yellow line don't we that's right
I<00:00:24.240> was<00:00:24.510> actually<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.840> game<00:00:25.019> two<00:00:25.230> years<00:00:25.439> ago

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
I was actually the game two years ago

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.290 
I was actually the game two years ago
and<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.310> person<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.670> front<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.910> me<00:00:26.970> kind<00:00:27.240> of

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
and the person in front of me kind of

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.700 
and the person in front of me kind of
leaned<00:00:27.480> over<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.900> person<00:00:28.170> sitting<00:00:28.349> says

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
leaned over to the person sitting says

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.589 
leaned over to the person sitting says
hey<00:00:28.920> where's<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.369> yellow<00:00:29.490> line<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.420> think

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
hey where's the yellow line and I think

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.420 
hey where's the yellow line and I think
that<00:00:30.720> we've<00:00:30.810> become<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.380> accustomed<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:31.980> what

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
that we've become so accustomed to what

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.799 
that we've become so accustomed to what
really<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.880> pretty<00:00:33.030> complex<00:00:33.480> piece<00:00:33.690> of

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
really is a pretty complex piece of

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.720 
really is a pretty complex piece of
technology<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.530> we've<00:00:35.100> become<00:00:35.430> very

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
technology that we've become very

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.280 
technology that we've become very
dependent<00:00:36.000> on<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.660> kind<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.840> see<00:00:37.020> where

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
dependent on that to kind of see where

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.260 
dependent on that to kind of see where
you<00:00:37.649> know<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.980> ball<00:00:38.489> carrier<00:00:38.820> needs<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.149> get

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
you know the ball carrier needs to get

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.459 
you know the ball carrier needs to get
but<00:00:39.600> there's<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.899> lot<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.320> goes<00:00:40.350> into

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
but there's a lot that goes into

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.049 
but there's a lot that goes into
rendering<00:00:41.040> absolutely<00:00:41.610> let's<00:00:41.820> talk<00:00:41.940> about

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
rendering absolutely let's talk about

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.360 
rendering absolutely let's talk about
the<00:00:42.210> beginning<00:00:42.540> where<00:00:42.750> did<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:42.960> all<00:00:43.079> begin<00:00:43.370> and

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
the beginning where did it all begin and

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.040 
the beginning where did it all begin and
then<00:00:44.640> bring<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.090> where<00:00:45.210> we<00:00:45.300> are<00:00:45.329> now<00:00:45.420> it

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
then bring this to where we are now it

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.750 
then bring this to where we are now it
started<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.350> September<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.739> 98<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.250> pro<00:00:47.520> game

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
started in September of 98 in a pro game

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.790 
started in September of 98 in a pro game
as<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.329> Bengals<00:00:48.750> Ravens<00:00:49.110> game<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.739> was

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
as a Bengals Ravens game and that was

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.779 
as a Bengals Ravens game and that was
the<00:00:49.920> first<00:00:50.070> time<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.489> made<00:00:50.579> its<00:00:50.700> debut

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
the first time that it made its debut

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.670 
the first time that it made its debut
and<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.420> viewers<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.870> course<00:00:51.899> loved<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.530> and

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
and the viewers of course loved it and

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.340 
and the viewers of course loved it and
so<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.160> company<00:00:53.430> named<00:00:53.670> sports<00:00:53.940> vision<00:00:54.420> starts

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
so a company named sports vision starts

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.080 
so a company named sports vision starts
providing<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:55.890> service<00:00:56.129> for<00:00:56.579> all<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
providing that service for all of the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.389 
providing that service for all of the
major<00:00:57.239> media<00:00:58.079> outlets<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.800> when<00:00:59.100> they<00:00:59.190> first

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
major media outlets and when they first

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.880 
major media outlets and when they first
did<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.940> was<00:01:00.090> revolutionary<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:01.260> actually

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
did it it was revolutionary to actually

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.399 
did it it was revolutionary to actually
paint<00:01:02.190> something<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.730> screen<00:01:03.080> during<00:01:04.080> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
paint something on the screen during the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.800 
paint something on the screen during the
action<00:01:04.860> while<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.070> ploy<00:01:05.400> was<00:01:05.700> going<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.240> it

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
action while the ploy was going and it

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.359 
action while the ploy was going and it
required<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.290> whole<00:01:07.530> bunch<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.890> technology<00:01:08.280> to

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
required a whole bunch of technology to

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.010 
required a whole bunch of technology to
make<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.640> happen<00:01:08.760> but<00:01:09.150> viewers<00:01:09.479> became<00:01:09.869> very

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
make that happen but viewers became very

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.690 
make that happen but viewers became very
dependent<00:01:10.439> on<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.770> really<00:01:10.979> clamored<00:01:11.549> for

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
dependent on it and really clamored for

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.039 
dependent on it and really clamored for
more<00:01:11.880> now<00:01:12.180> there's<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> lot<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.600> goes<00:01:12.659> into<00:01:12.840> it

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
more now there's a lot that goes into it

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.330 
more now there's a lot that goes into it
like<00:01:13.140> you're<00:01:13.290> saying<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.650> starts<00:01:13.950> before<00:01:14.100> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
like you're saying it starts before the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.980 
like you're saying it starts before the
game<00:01:14.610> explain<00:01:14.970> what<00:01:15.119> happens<00:01:15.509> at<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> football

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
game explain what happens at a football

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.270 
game explain what happens at a football
field<00:01:16.110> before<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.470> game<00:01:16.590> even<00:01:16.650> starts<00:01:17.040> well

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
field before the game even starts well

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.679 
field before the game even starts well
every<00:01:17.490> football<00:01:17.759> field<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.060> unique<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.540> has<00:01:18.570> a

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
every football field is unique it has a

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.539 
every football field is unique it has a
crown<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.500> for<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.710> water<00:01:19.890> will<00:01:20.040> drain<00:01:20.070> off

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
crown to it for the water will drain off

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.280 
crown to it for the water will drain off
and<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.299> what<00:01:21.600> they<00:01:21.689> do<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.930> they<00:01:21.990> come<00:01:22.110> into<00:01:22.229> a

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
and so what they do is they come into a

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.800 
and so what they do is they come into a
3d<00:01:22.680> model<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.880> field<00:01:24.090> before<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.479> game<00:01:24.659> so

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
3d model of the field before the game so

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.420 
3d model of the field before the game so
they<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.110> crown<00:01:25.350> correct<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.070> they

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
they have the crown correct and they

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.640 
they have the crown correct and they
grab<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.360> color<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.049> field<00:01:28.229> every<00:01:28.470> field

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
grab the color of the field every field

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.710 
grab the color of the field every field
has<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.799> different<00:01:29.100> color<00:01:29.280> based<00:01:29.579> on<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.909> type

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
has a different color based on the type

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.600 
has a different color based on the type
of<00:01:30.750> surface<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.799> then<00:01:31.979> but<00:01:32.250> when<00:01:32.460> they

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
of surface it is and then but when they

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.179 
of surface it is and then but when they
have<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.119> they<00:01:33.509> can<00:01:33.720> take<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.470> render

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
have that they can take that and render

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.030 
have that they can take that and render
the<00:01:35.640> field<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.110> computer<00:01:37.470> model<00:01:37.650> chroma

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
the field and a computer model chroma

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.770 
the field and a computer model chroma
key<00:01:38.220> technology<00:01:38.729> chroma<00:01:39.000> key<00:01:39.119> exactly<00:01:39.570> just

key technology chroma key exactly just

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.660 
key technology chroma key exactly just
like<00:01:39.810> we<00:01:40.020> use<00:01:40.170> here<00:01:40.409> for<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.860> for<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.520> weather

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
like we use here for the for the weather

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.639 
like we use here for the for the weather
they<00:01:42.180> take<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.509> color<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.960> grass<00:01:43.170> and

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
they take the color of the grass and

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.200 
they take the color of the grass and
then<00:01:43.799> they<00:01:43.979> know<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.640> they<00:01:44.759> are<00:01:44.880> going<00:01:45.030> to

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
then they know that they are going to

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.609 
then they know that they are going to
render<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.659> yellow<00:01:45.840> line<00:01:46.079> on<00:01:46.110> top<00:01:46.470> of

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
render the yellow line on top of

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.770 
render the yellow line on top of
anything<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.610> color<00:01:47.939> when<00:01:48.689> it

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
anything that is that color when it

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.719 
anything that is that color when it
first<00:01:48.990> came<00:01:49.229> out<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:50.220> took<00:01:50.340> like<00:01:50.520> seven

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
first came out it took like seven

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.569 
first came out it took like seven
computers<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> staff<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.899> four<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:53.100> do<00:01:53.280> that

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
computers and a staff of four to do that

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.020 
computers and a staff of four to do that
and<00:01:54.020> it<00:01:55.020> was<00:01:55.200> very<00:01:55.229> very<00:01:55.649> complex<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.790> very

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
and it was very very complex and very

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.429 
and it was very very complex and very
problematic<00:01:57.479> but<00:01:57.600> now<00:01:57.780> they've<00:01:58.020> got<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.290> down

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
problematic but now they've got it down

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.380 
problematic but now they've got it down
to<00:01:58.469> they<00:01:58.710> say<00:01:58.860> one<00:01:59.100> computer<00:01:59.520> per<00:01:59.549> camera<00:02:00.090> and

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
to they say one computer per camera and

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.389 
to they say one computer per camera and
a<00:02:00.630> single<00:02:00.899> operator<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.590> again<00:02:02.159> speaking

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
a single operator and again speaking

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.130 
a single operator and again speaking
about<00:02:02.909> talk<00:02:03.090> about<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.299> cameras<00:02:03.659> involved

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
about talk about the cameras involved

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.109 
about talk about the cameras involved
there<00:02:04.290> are<00:02:04.350> about<00:02:04.530> three<00:02:04.890> per<00:02:05.280> game<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.939> used

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
there are about three per game that used

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.580 
there are about three per game that used
this<00:02:06.299> has<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.509> correct<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:07.049> have<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.200> camera<00:02:07.500> at

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
this has a correct you have a camera at

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.740 
this has a correct you have a camera at
each<00:02:07.710> 20<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.340> then<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.759> camera<00:02:09.060> at<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.239> 50<00:02:09.569> and

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
each 20 and then a camera at the 50 and

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.470 
each 20 and then a camera at the 50 and
what<00:02:10.259> will<00:02:10.379> happen<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.480> operator

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
what will happen is is the operator

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
what will happen is is the operator
sitting<00:02:12.840> there

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
sitting there

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.290 
sitting there
he<00:02:13.620> sees<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.040> ball<00:02:14.220> on<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.580> field<00:02:14.730> he<00:02:15.180> will

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
he sees the ball on the field he will

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.580 
he sees the ball on the field he will
click<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.690> ball<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.140> then<00:02:16.410> he'll

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
click the ball and then he'll

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.260 
click the ball and then he'll
right-click<00:02:17.130> where<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.400> first<00:02:17.610> down<00:02:17.880> marker

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
right-click where the first down marker

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.140 
right-click where the first down marker
should<00:02:18.900> be<00:02:19.080> if<00:02:19.770> it's<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.100> new<00:02:20.340> first<00:02:20.640> down<00:02:20.880> he

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
should be if it's a new first down he

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.580 
should be if it's a new first down he
can<00:02:21.270> click<00:02:21.420> little<00:02:21.600> button<00:02:21.780> puts<00:02:21.960> it<00:02:22.080> 10<00:02:22.260> yards

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
can click little button puts it 10 yards

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.500 
can click little button puts it 10 yards
out<00:02:22.770> from<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.610> ball<00:02:23.850> and<00:02:24.150> that's<00:02:24.330> one<00:02:24.480> of

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
out from the ball and that's one of

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.060 
out from the ball and that's one of
course<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:25.020> you<00:02:25.170> know<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.470> line<00:02:25.710> may<00:02:25.920> be<00:02:25.950> a

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
course that you know the line may be a

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.200 
course that you know the line may be a
little<00:02:26.280> bit<00:02:26.460> different<00:02:26.880> than<00:02:27.000> when<00:02:27.120> they

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
little bit different than when they

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.660 
little bit different than when they
stretch<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.600> chains<00:02:27.840> out<00:02:28.050> so<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:29.190> he<00:02:29.550> will

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
stretch the chains out so that he will

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.490 
stretch the chains out so that he will
do<00:02:29.850> that<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.330> then<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.480> tells<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:30.990> you<00:02:31.380> know

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
do that and then that tells you you know

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.360 
do that and then that tells you you know
where<00:02:31.680> it's<00:02:31.770> going<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:31.920> be<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.130> then<00:02:32.220> that's

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
where it's going to be and then that's

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.010 
where it's going to be and then that's
what<00:02:32.490> shows<00:02:32.700> up<00:02:32.940> on<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.450> screen<00:02:33.570> other

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
what shows up on the screen other

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.320 
what shows up on the screen other
cameras<00:02:34.530> like<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.770> Skycam<00:02:35.280> may<00:02:35.850> or<00:02:35.970> may<00:02:36.120> not

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
cameras like the Skycam may or may not

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.910 
cameras like the Skycam may or may not
be<00:02:36.480> tied<00:02:36.690> into<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.230> system<00:02:37.500> depending<00:02:37.890> on

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
be tied into that system depending on

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.199 
be tied into that system depending on
how<00:02:38.040> much<00:02:38.190> technology<00:02:38.430> they<00:02:38.820> want<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.030> bring

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
how much technology they want to bring

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.910 
how much technology they want to bring
to<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:39.600> game<00:02:39.750> so<00:02:40.050> you'll<00:02:40.260> notice<00:02:40.470> certain

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
to the game so you'll notice certain

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.560 
to the game so you'll notice certain
camera<00:02:41.130> angles<00:02:41.490> won't<00:02:41.940> have<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.150> yellow<00:02:42.390> line

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
camera angles won't have a yellow line

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.810 
camera angles won't have a yellow line
but<00:02:42.870> those<00:02:43.050> two<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.590> three<00:02:44.070> always<00:02:44.250> will<00:02:44.550> and

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
but those two and three always will and

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.910 
but those two and three always will and
you<00:02:45.240> know<00:02:45.300> it<00:02:45.600> has<00:02:45.750> come<00:02:45.959> so<00:02:46.140> far<00:02:46.170> since<00:02:46.650> it

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
you know it has come so far since it
