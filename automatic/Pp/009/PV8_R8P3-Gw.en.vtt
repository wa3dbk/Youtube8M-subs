position and a good fighting opportunity

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.009 
position and a good fighting opportunity
in<00:00:43.859> the<00:00:44.010> game<00:00:44.250> but<00:00:45.239> nonetheless<00:00:45.420> let's<00:00:45.870> get

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019 
in the game but nonetheless let's get

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:47.990 
in the game but nonetheless let's get
into<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.260> here<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.649> when<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.100> saw<00:00:47.370> Queen<00:00:47.609> to<00:00:47.760> h4

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
into it here so when I saw Queen to h4

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.430 
into it here so when I saw Queen to h4
I'm<00:00:48.120> not<00:00:48.269> too<00:00:48.449> sure<00:00:48.629> what<00:00:48.809> my<00:00:48.930> opponent<00:00:49.170> was

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
I'm not too sure what my opponent was

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.430 
I'm not too sure what my opponent was
thinking<00:00:50.690> possibly<00:00:51.690> he<00:00:51.809> was<00:00:51.930> looking<00:00:52.199> at<00:00:52.289> his

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
thinking possibly he was looking at his

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.189 
thinking possibly he was looking at his
Bishop<00:00:52.739> here<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.100> b7<00:00:53.519> his<00:00:54.210> night<00:00:54.449> on<00:00:54.660> f5<00:00:55.140> and

Bishop here on b7 his night on f5 and
his<00:00:55.559> knight<00:00:55.769> on<00:00:55.949> d5<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.940> he<00:00:57.449> thought<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.809> by

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
his knight on d5 and he thought that by

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.900 
his knight on d5 and he thought that by
bringing<00:00:58.050> his<00:00:58.410> Queen<00:00:58.649> down<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.250> h4<00:00:59.640> he<00:00:59.760> can

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
bringing his Queen down to h4 he can

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.759 
bringing his Queen down to h4 he can
launch<00:01:00.149> some<00:01:00.390> kind<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.690> rapid<00:01:01.079> attack<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.620> my

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
launch some kind of rapid attack on my

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.070 
launch some kind of rapid attack on my
castle<00:01:02.250> position<00:01:02.640> especially<00:01:03.239> once<00:01:03.690> his<00:01:03.870> dark

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
castle position especially once his dark

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.170 
castle position especially once his dark
square<00:01:04.320> Bishop<00:01:04.350> here<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:04.949> captured<00:01:05.400> on<00:01:05.580> III

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
square Bishop here is captured on III

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.420 
square Bishop here is captured on III
but<00:01:07.080> nonetheless<00:01:07.260> by<00:01:07.650> moving<00:01:07.890> his<00:01:08.010> Queen<00:01:08.310> to

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
but nonetheless by moving his Queen to

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.580 
but nonetheless by moving his Queen to
h4<00:01:08.760> he<00:01:08.940> created<00:01:09.330> kind<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.690> tactical<00:01:10.200> problem

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
h4 he created kind of a tactical problem

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.890 
h4 he created kind of a tactical problem
for<00:01:10.740> himself<00:01:11.090> it<00:01:12.090> seemed<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.479> me<00:01:12.570> like<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.840> was

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
for himself it seemed to me like it was

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.810 
for himself it seemed to me like it was
just<00:01:13.140> an<00:01:13.259> overly<00:01:13.740> aggressive<00:01:14.280> move<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.670> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
just an overly aggressive move in the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.030 
just an overly aggressive move in the
position<00:01:15.320> especially<00:01:16.320> because<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:16.829> have<00:01:17.009> a

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
position especially because I have a

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.390 
position especially because I have a
beautiful<00:01:17.549> bishop<00:01:18.150> pair<00:01:18.329> here<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.810> III<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.890> e2

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
beautiful bishop pair here on III in e2

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.030 
beautiful bishop pair here on III in e2
also<00:01:21.240> my<00:01:21.390> queen<00:01:21.689> here<00:01:21.930> on<00:01:22.049> d<00:01:22.229> 2<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.439> supporting

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
also my queen here on d 2 is supporting

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.800 
also my queen here on d 2 is supporting
the<00:01:23.130> dark<00:01:23.310> square<00:01:23.579> Bishop<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.149> now<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.570> have

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
the dark square Bishop and now I have

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.929 
the dark square Bishop and now I have
firm<00:01:25.140> control<00:01:25.560> over<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.070> dark<00:01:26.310> squares<00:01:26.640> and

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
firm control over the dark squares and

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.789 
firm control over the dark squares and
the<00:01:27.149> light<00:01:27.329> square<00:01:27.659> diagonals<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.470> area

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
the light square diagonals in the area

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.190 
the light square diagonals in the area
so<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:29.820> queen<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.479> little<00:01:30.899> bit<00:01:31.020> isolated

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
so this queen is a little bit isolated

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.649 
so this queen is a little bit isolated
doesn't<00:01:31.860> have<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.009> lot<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.250> support<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:33.479> more

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
doesn't have a lot of support but more

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.940 
doesn't have a lot of support but more
importantly<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.259> doesn't<00:01:34.560> have<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> lot<00:01:34.920> of

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
importantly it doesn't have a lot of

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.859 
importantly it doesn't have a lot of
escape<00:01:35.430> square<00:01:35.700> as<00:01:35.790> if<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.000> were<00:01:36.149> to<00:01:36.299> attack<00:01:36.570> it

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
escape square as if I were to attack it

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.929 
escape square as if I were to attack it
so<00:01:37.680> what<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.829> played<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.340> position<00:01:38.700> was<00:01:38.850> I

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
so what I played in the position was I

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.749 
so what I played in the position was I
play<00:01:39.149> Bishop<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.750> g5<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:41.340> course<00:01:41.579> that's

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
play Bishop to g5 and of course that's

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.030 
play Bishop to g5 and of course that's
attacking<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.420> Queen<00:01:42.719> but<00:01:43.409> more<00:01:43.590> importantly

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
attacking the Queen but more importantly

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.740 
attacking the Queen but more importantly

together so in order to handle that I

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.140 
together so in order to handle that I
would<00:02:46.500> play<00:02:46.680> something<00:02:47.070> like<00:02:47.100> Bishop<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.730> f1

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.060 
would play something like Bishop to f1
and<00:02:48.420> then<00:02:48.870> my<00:02:48.990> opponent<00:02:49.440> can<00:02:49.530> now<00:02:49.709> bring<00:02:49.920> in

I would have to play something like
Queen<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.400> e2<00:02:56.900> but<00:02:57.900> nonetheless<00:02:58.080> my<00:02:58.530> opponent

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
has a very workable position in fact

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.470 
has a very workable position in fact
quality<00:03:01.950> has<00:03:02.100> been<00:03:02.310> reached<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:02.820> it's<00:03:03.060> you

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
quality has been reached and it's you

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.470 
quality has been reached and it's you
know<00:03:03.510> very<00:03:04.470> slightly<00:03:05.000> favoring<00:03:06.000> black<00:03:06.239> in

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
know very slightly favoring black in

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.930 
know very slightly favoring black in
this<00:03:06.630> position<00:03:07.200> notnot<00:03:08.190> it<00:03:08.370> by<00:03:08.520> a<00:03:08.550> huge<00:03:08.910> margin

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
this position notnot it by a huge margin

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.760 
this position notnot it by a huge margin
of<00:03:09.450> course<00:03:09.720> I<00:03:09.870> can<00:03:10.020> mean<00:03:10.140> white<00:03:10.320> can<00:03:10.560> still

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
of course I can mean white can still

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.979 
of course I can mean white can still
have<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:10.950> good<00:03:11.160> game<00:03:11.340> from<00:03:11.580> this<00:03:11.760> position<00:03:11.989> but

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
have a good game from this position but

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.270 
have a good game from this position but
it<00:03:13.110> was<00:03:13.200> definitely<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.680> lot<00:03:13.800> better<00:03:13.980> than

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
it was definitely a lot better than

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.030 
it was definitely a lot better than
playing<00:03:14.520> Queen<00:03:14.820> to<00:03:15.060> h4<00:03:15.660> so<00:03:16.620> I<00:03:16.650> thought<00:03:16.860> that

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
playing Queen to h4 so I thought that

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.650 
playing Queen to h4 so I thought that
that<00:03:17.130> was<00:03:17.250> interesting<00:03:17.820> to<00:03:17.970> take<00:03:18.120> a<00:03:18.180> look<00:03:18.420> at

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
that was interesting to take a look at

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.900 
that was interesting to take a look at
so<00:03:19.140> if<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.380> saw<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.620> move<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:20.160> punish<00:03:20.760> the

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
so if you saw the move to punish the

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.390 
so if you saw the move to punish the
opponent<00:03:21.330> after<00:03:21.420> clean<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.930> h4<00:03:22.410> by<00:03:23.010> playing

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
opponent after clean to h4 by playing
