00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
the axe at all it's really slow it's a

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.010 
the axe at all it's really slow it's a
lot<00:02:29.610> slower<00:02:29.760> than<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.120> club<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.510> gives<00:02:30.930> you

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
lot slower than the club it gives you

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.890 
lot slower than the club it gives you
distance<00:02:31.520> but<00:02:32.520> it's<00:02:32.730> just<00:02:33.030> too<00:02:33.090> slow<00:02:33.540> for<00:02:33.570> my

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
distance but it's just too slow for my

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.180 
distance but it's just too slow for my
liking<00:02:34.140> really<00:02:34.890> it's<00:02:35.550> just<00:02:36.050> yeah<00:02:37.050> it's<00:02:37.709> iffy

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
liking really it's just yeah it's iffy

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.460 
liking really it's just yeah it's iffy
it<00:02:38.820> does<00:02:39.030> more<00:02:39.209> damage<00:02:39.269> and<00:02:39.780> everything<00:02:40.200> but

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
it does more damage and everything but

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.470 
it does more damage and everything but
it's<00:02:41.130> just<00:02:41.489> not<00:02:41.519> worth<00:02:41.850> it<00:02:41.970> in<00:02:42.090> my<00:02:42.120> opinion

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
it's just not worth it in my opinion

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.540 
it's just not worth it in my opinion
because<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.530> mean<00:02:43.680> if<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:43.950> really<00:02:43.980> want<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.400> do

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
because I mean if you really want to do

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.780 
because I mean if you really want to do
some<00:02:44.730> damage<00:02:44.940> you<00:02:45.300> can<00:02:45.450> just<00:02:46.190> use<00:02:47.190> shout<00:02:47.519> art

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
some damage you can just use shout art

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.140 
some damage you can just use shout art
