00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:34.860

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:45.989
 baked cloves and sugar crystal august 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.149
 to make this recipe you need 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.040
 a work I'm using pumpkin pumpkin 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.640
 but you can use any kind of 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.770
 pumpkin 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.780
 but it's not worth zucchini I'm going to cook 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.129
 my name cro waves but also can 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.020
 do in the water I'll take the part of 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.370
 on her 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.370
 the stu 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.830
 if you are a child ask for an adult 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.460
 The battle was hard but I got to take it. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.170
 the head here of the mouth 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.170
 so now just take the seeds 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.530
 I've already taken them all excellent now I go 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.270
 give a little 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.860
 I like to pierce her skin before 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.880
 put the microwave not trying to 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.130
 danger of splodge there is just put the 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.380
 back cover and carry micro waves of 10 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.850
 15 minutes but this will all depend 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.869
 of your micro ons 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.970
 may not be less or more in the 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.530
 bomb already cooked I'll know if she 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.650
 is at the point of being ended with a garfinho 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.290
 yesterday it is very soft, it's the same as 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.509
 if you had made the same pot 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.770
 A memory that you make in the pan 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.660
 with water 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.350
 You have to draw all the water because 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.840
 otherwise it will not work with the longing 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.070
 now just shave I'm going to use 300 grams 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.660
 of pulp 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.790
 so if you want you can buy it on 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.030
 market already applied but I will speak to 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.920
 you the amount in cups also without 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.360
 then add the 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.489
 condensed milk 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.980
 if you want you can add butter 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.570
 or margarine to brighten but as 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.650
 will pass later 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:39.560
 Our point is not to condition the 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.660
 pumpkin reminds you that if you do 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.030
 water with water has to dry 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.590
 laden is 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.049
 now just mix it all up well 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.700
 down until starting to peel off the bottom 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.700
 same same joke 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.900
 I'm going to add the dye but it's 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.480
 optional you only if you step and you do not have 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.990
 a certain amount depends on the color you 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.990
 do you want 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.310
 already arrived at the point you can see that already 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.860
 peel off the bottom of the pan 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.900
 it took about 15 minutes and 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.220
 now just dump a plate and take 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.440
 up to completely seal surrounds 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.870
 after the sweet ice cold and there's a 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.930
 karma a little bit of margarine the same 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:30.680
 makes the normal brigadier get a 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.110
 A little bit of candy in rolling this dossier 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.480
 It's fine, it's very soft. 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.220
 but if you want and firmer you 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.900
 can add a tablespoon of 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.060
 wheat flour in preparation 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:48.650
 then just go here in CT and crystal 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:49.670
 I'll spit it out with grave but it's 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.520
 optional 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.670
 quantity will depend on the size 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.290
 You make your candy is if you want. 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.020
 can also serve in the cup as the 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.030
 spoon and now I'm going to finish 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.350
 rest and then show you how 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.100
 does it make him look like 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:09.620
 a little pumpkin and now to stay 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.120
 it's just making the links with the 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.340
 priest had mounted a little of 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:18.040
 margarine to look like a 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.040
 pumpkin and enjoy its value 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.130

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.900
 accented pumpkin so if you like 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.760

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.440

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.860

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.860
 Softer 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:05:04.620

00:04:49.580 --> 00:05:06.510

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:18.360
