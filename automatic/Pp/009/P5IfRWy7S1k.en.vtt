00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.610 

and<00:02:22.570> I'll<00:02:22.690> go<00:02:22.780> ahead<00:02:22.870> and<00:02:22.960> close<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.440> third

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
and I'll go ahead and close the third

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.560 
and I'll go ahead and close the third
one<00:02:23.830> a<00:02:23.860> little<00:02:23.980> bit<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.460> hear<00:02:27.360> I'm<00:02:28.360> going<00:02:28.480> to

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
one a little bit to hear I'm going to

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.480 
one a little bit to hear I'm going to
look<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:28.840> see<00:02:29.080> again<00:02:29.410> you<00:02:29.950> moved<00:02:30.220> a<00:02:30.370> little

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
look and see again you moved a little

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.940 
look and see again you moved a little
bit<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:32.620> we'll<00:02:32.770> go<00:02:32.890> ahead<00:02:32.920> and<00:02:33.190> pinch<00:02:33.820> these

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
bit so we'll go ahead and pinch these

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.260 
bit so we'll go ahead and pinch these
and<00:02:35.950> you<00:02:36.070> want<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.280> get<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.400> real<00:02:36.580> tight<00:02:36.880> fit<00:02:37.240> so

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
and you want to get a real tight fit so

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.930 
and you want to get a real tight fit so
it's<00:02:37.540> really<00:02:37.750> pinched<00:02:38.170> against<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.620> blank

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
it's really pinched against the blank

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.220 
it's really pinched against the blank
otherwise<00:02:39.940> your<00:02:40.180> blank<00:02:40.420> will<00:02:40.570> move<00:02:40.720> around<00:02:40.990> a

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
otherwise your blank will move around a

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.740 
otherwise your blank will move around a
little<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:43.750> larger<00:02:44.590> of<00:02:44.800> the<00:02:44.970> frames<00:02:45.970> the

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
little the larger of the frames the

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.750 
little the larger of the frames the
blank<00:02:47.020> tends<00:02:47.320> to<00:02:47.470> fit<00:02:47.680> in<00:02:47.800> there<00:02:47.980> quite<00:02:48.340> tight

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
blank tends to fit in there quite tight

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.710 
blank tends to fit in there quite tight
the<00:02:49.570> smaller<00:02:49.870> ones<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:51.670> moves<00:02:52.000> around<00:02:52.210> just<00:02:52.630> a

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
the smaller ones it moves around just a

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.300 
the smaller ones it moves around just a
little<00:02:52.750> bit<00:02:53.110> until<00:02:53.290> of<00:02:53.620> course<00:02:53.650> you<00:02:54.070> pinch

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
little bit until of course you pinch

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:01.430 
little bit until of course you pinch
those<00:02:54.520> prongs<00:02:54.820> tighter<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:59.500> there<00:02:59.680> we<00:02:59.770> go

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
those prongs tighter and there we go

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.720 
those prongs tighter and there we go
once<00:03:02.440> you<00:03:02.620> have<00:03:02.770> your<00:03:02.890> blank<00:03:03.190> inside<00:03:03.430> the

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
once you have your blank inside the

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.190 
once you have your blank inside the
frame<00:03:04.000> you<00:03:04.420> want<00:03:04.600> to<00:03:04.690> think<00:03:04.840> of<00:03:04.900> it<00:03:05.050> as<00:03:05.170> a

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
frame you want to think of it as a

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.560 
frame you want to think of it as a
finished<00:03:05.590> piece<00:03:05.890> you<00:03:06.700> want<00:03:06.910> to<00:03:07.000> reopen<00:03:07.180> the

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
finished piece you want to reopen the

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.510 
finished piece you want to reopen the
prongs<00:03:07.810> again<00:03:08.260> it's<00:03:08.980> just<00:03:09.190> a<00:03:09.340> way<00:03:09.490> of

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
prongs again it's just a way of

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.760 
prongs again it's just a way of
weakening<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:10.480> metal<00:03:10.750> if<00:03:10.930> you<00:03:11.020> open<00:03:11.410> them<00:03:11.560> and

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
weakening the metal if you open them and

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.070 
weakening the metal if you open them and
close<00:03:11.980> them<00:03:12.120> over<00:03:13.120> again<00:03:13.420> think<00:03:13.810> of<00:03:13.930> this<00:03:14.020> as

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
close them over again think of this as

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.920 
close them over again think of this as
it's<00:03:14.830> in<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.130> frame<00:03:15.370> it<00:03:15.910> looks<00:03:16.060> great<00:03:16.360> it's

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
it's in the frame it looks great it's

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:24.750 
it's in the frame it looks great it's
ready<00:03:17.200> for<00:03:17.410> you<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.590> wear

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.819
