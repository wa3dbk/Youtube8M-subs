 just the why of this video so 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.960
 you are interested girls and 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.640
 girls as I say it's going to be 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.230
 a challenge that will be turned around 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.350
 linking v10 ie around 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.370
 Indian products as I had to quote 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.980
 all the virtues 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.170
 in the previous video we will use 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.850
 of it really to bring health 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.450
 to your hair the volume of the length 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.220
 etc. 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.770
 and it is a challenge girls who will 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.020
 last exactly three months so the 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.910
 challenge will start for me in everything 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.190
 case personally on May 10th on Sunday 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.800
 so jim is the Sunday who with whom will 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.290
 end on Sunday August 2nd 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.330
 why three months because everything 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.830
 I just think that's the 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.080
 time needed for your hair 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.430
 for because the hair react to 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.750
 powders come to the hands 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.370
 and all that and we saw a 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.260
 difference so three months I find that 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.940
 it's very good week I think 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.830

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.110
 at ten very cool days very important in 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.330
 any case for me the health of the hair 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.310
 challenge it goes through the care you do not 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.110
 can never have hair in 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.910
 health and therefore hair that grows so 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.560
 you do not take care so that's it 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.880
 why I wanted it to be 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.800
 second rule and the second rule that 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.970

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.830
 do not know I remind you it's 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.080
 simply a moon band followed by a 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.090

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.709

 week twice a week it is 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.100
 really a minimum if you do it 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.020
 three times a week you can 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.340
 four times a week you can 5 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.920

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.900
 like you want 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.910
 but at least really twice a 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.800
 fourth of the rules of this challenge the 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.170
 girls it's going to be just that 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.650
 to drink at least 1 liter of water per 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.709
 day 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.540
 as we already know, hydrate his body 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.280
 her hair excuse me from the outside 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.690
 that's fine but the failures of 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.670
 the interior is even better 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.620
 so we will try to see some water and 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.080
 we will try to see at least a liter 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.220
 per day during all this challenge I 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.810
 think we'll really see the difference 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.239
 hair ion but also on our 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.190

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:15.430
 of the girls challenge it's going to be everything 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.489
 simply to avoid any heat 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.870
 direct we will avoid using too much in 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.850
 any case of direct heat 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.830
 personally I agree 3-2 because 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.510
 ie a joker a month in 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.590

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.630
 try to really limit 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.220
 the use of direct heat are 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.889

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.250
 test her hair from 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.050
 snoring brushes of things that make 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.790

 wanted to add and that it will be 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.260
 perfectly optional 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.640

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.430
 food supplement to his 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.600
 daily diet so me 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.190

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.780
 vote for the brewer's yeast I 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.640

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:11.979
 it's up to you 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.510

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.410

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.840
 direct heat is the last of 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.880
 rules which is optional is that 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.350

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.540
 dietary supplement 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.580
 so here are the girls you know everything we 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.810
 start of course the challenge by 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.570
 a photo is always better for 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.669
 able to see the front after because we 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.930
 does not necessarily realize the state 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:23.220
 of our hair how they grow 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.840
 when you do not take a picture 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.910
 so I already took a picture I 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.200
 cut my spikes last week 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.370
 so never benefited to take a 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.440
 photo I will try to post you 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:34.970
 in full screen so that you see to 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.970
 what is the hair like right now 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:42.990
 and so that's my starting point for me 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:45.509
 take a picture if you also
