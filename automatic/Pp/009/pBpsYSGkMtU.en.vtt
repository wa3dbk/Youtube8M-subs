00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.980
 hello swami diman and today's mod 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.500
 adds a real radius to the game 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.390
 radio in the game I'm serious here it is 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.660
 beautiful valentine's radio here it is 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.430
 of the red and the other is not me 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.140
 It seems very suitable for but 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.029
 it does not matter bear above such a sake 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.820
 the main thing that she plays and you now 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.289
 hear the music that you take it even here 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.719
 You can change it to and 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:39.360
 the food was clicked and it changes listen 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:41.670
 other music play date mine from me 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.530
 I will not change everything I take it for now 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.960
 I'll tell you about it really enough 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.090
 cool seems to me a long time such mods 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.469
 not enough to get bored in the log say 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.860
 why can you just buy this radio 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.270
 ruler windows and turn on the game play 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.460
 but it seems so cool to me 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.579
 quite particularly he falls for 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.609
 servers for seraphi many mods will go but 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.619
 this one especially yes now and now 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.270
 important question because from that site with 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.400
 which I downloaded there was a lot 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.560
 comments a lot of comments on 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.330
 about the fact that where are they for sake where 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.619
 she goes for admin you're a bitch 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.390
 there is no such discharge and so on but water 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.570
 I'll find it, just give it another way though 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.810
 Long those the most terrible found for this 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.530
 you go into the tools and still such 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.710
 here they will see a burn for example 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.780
 shows you assume and which 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.150
 these radios are what you have by default 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.750
 let it be easy enough for you 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.090
 fell 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.850
 degree here you will find radio 7 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.470
 radio is more precisely about the so-called mines 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.170
 here and here this red radio but to 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.940
 Sorry 1 mana cool and here you are 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.940
 take bet let's say on this table 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:57.590
 I put that to be as there will be Chinese 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.450
 yes that's it but what about this radical one 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.860
 trick is that you can add your music 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.450
 let's show how 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.429
 so in order to put your 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.610
 music you would have you go to the folder 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:09.830
 addons found on the radio mod and go here in 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.160
 this folder then here in this folder in this 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.709
 this 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.510
 and then you see here these are about Egypt and 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.019
 there is the same muse which time we have 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.890
 plays and so to change let's say I'm in 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:23.330
 As an example, take this music and 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.280
 let's say delete any other this 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.720
 Do I have to delete it 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.380
 this one under water 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.040
 I delete it and put this one so that 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.750
 she is with us 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.000
 activated in the game you need then 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.760
 just rename it too in dvoechku 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.700
 here so now she will play you with 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.380
 a place that has been previously well here and 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.570
 I explained everything about how to put this 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.120
 music until it is enough to go into this 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.920
 folder here and when naming is required 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.530
 forget perry minutes for those numbers that 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.640
 you replaced because if you don't 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.070
 rename it you have not a fig 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.600
 it will turn out right now but I will not for now 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.640
 what awards does he really play 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.620
 simple and sad do not turn off so 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.260
 I probably will not play yet 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.480
 the essence yes here and now I have here 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.800
 finger man for asking such a question on 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.590
 In lichku wrote in 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.140
 to the front on the channel then what jimmy buy from 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.940
 you still have a flyer on you all the reviews 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.190
 Review mods to mods yes indeed 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.510
 I will have letsplay but for now 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.790
 time and hour will not have me as a 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.560
 Now I have problems with such a microphone 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.530
 no microphone is normal because more 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.240
 I record the sea even by us microphone he 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.970
 this is the microphone which is now recorded 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.190
 this moment it suits only for me 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.560
 it seems for reviews for you playoffs he 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:38.960
 no way because when shooting letplay 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.820
 on the subway of 2004, the words will be waiting 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.830
 just awful when revised 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.370
 I didnâ€™t become my own way of forest bracketing 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:49.010
 do something here or a tooth on the juices of Kirov 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.650
 wrote down what was well, just buy 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.020
 scary damn yes how could I learn this 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.790
 but still they won't remove it 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.490
 With slender I also had problems when 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.830
 slenderman last described as i 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:04.270
 passed slumber and yes I just have here 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.770
 terrible here but it doesn't matter yes in general 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.330
 the main thing is that you still have a review of mods 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.920
 like the only thing glad you 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.860

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.410
 Further, well, well, in general, that's all 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.459
 I want to say about fashion before 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.609
