in<00:03:47.670> certain<00:03:47.910> libraries<00:03:48.390> let's<00:03:48.600> put<00:03:48.750> it<00:03:48.810> that

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
in certain libraries let's put it that

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.960 
in certain libraries let's put it that
way<00:03:48.959> that<00:03:49.410> doesn't<00:03:49.769> sound<00:03:49.920> like<00:03:50.430> a<00:03:50.459> good<00:03:50.579> thing

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
way that doesn't sound like a good thing

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.300 
way that doesn't sound like a good thing
to<00:03:51.150> say<00:03:51.450> but<00:03:52.049> if<00:03:52.200> you're<00:03:52.320> into<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.650> geeky<00:03:53.070> show

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
to say but if you're into a geeky show

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.590 
to say but if you're into a geeky show
and<00:03:53.549> you<00:03:53.670> want<00:03:53.880> to<00:03:53.940> watch<00:03:54.060> a<00:03:54.150> geeky<00:03:54.420> show

and you want to watch a geeky show
chances<00:03:55.079> are<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.290> public<00:03:55.620> library<00:03:55.799> has<00:03:56.100> it

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
chances are the public library has it

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.280 
chances are the public library has it
because<00:03:56.549> most<00:03:56.730> libraries<00:03:57.030> are<00:03:57.540> run<00:03:57.780> by<00:03:57.810> people
