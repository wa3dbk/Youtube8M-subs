00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.800 
can't leach it and it's not really worth
the<00:03:05.550> effort<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:06.090> try<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:06.810> do<00:03:07.050> so<00:03:07.320> easy

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.600 

separately<00:03:12.810> using<00:03:12.960> the<00:03:13.140> electric<00:03:13.440> suit<00:03:13.680> and

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
separately using the electric suit and

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:21.860 
separately using the electric suit and
I'm<00:03:14.760> guessing<00:03:15.090> this<00:03:15.180> web<00:03:15.420> will<00:03:15.450> rebuild<00:03:15.870> it

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.930 

I've<00:03:22.409> also<00:03:22.650> noticed<00:03:22.950> that<00:03:23.370> in<00:03:23.459> his<00:03:23.580> weakened

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
I've also noticed that in his weakened

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.600 
I've also noticed that in his weakened
state<00:03:24.120> Superman<00:03:24.810> isn't<00:03:25.190> exactly<00:03:26.190> building

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
state Superman isn't exactly building

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:37.240 
state Superman isn't exactly building
things<00:03:26.819> quickly

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.040

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
all right then Superman that we saved in

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.900
