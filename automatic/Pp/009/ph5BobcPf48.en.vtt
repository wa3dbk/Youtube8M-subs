over<00:03:11.040> all<00:03:11.070> around<00:03:11.820> pretty<00:03:12.060> epic<00:03:12.240> then<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.410> the

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
over all around pretty epic then of the

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.890 
over all around pretty epic then of the
box<00:03:14.220> sets<00:03:14.580> we<00:03:14.760> have<00:03:14.880> green<00:03:15.210> toys<00:03:15.510> shelled

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
box sets we have green toys shelled

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.320 
box sets we have green toys shelled
soldiers<00:03:16.890> so<00:03:17.490> this<00:03:17.640> is<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.880> set<00:03:18.090> that<00:03:18.120> the

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
soldiers so this is the set that the

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.330 
soldiers so this is the set that the
soldiers<00:03:18.720> would<00:03:18.840> come<00:03:18.900> in<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:19.440> it<00:03:19.860> I<00:03:20.070> think

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
soldiers would come in and it I think

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.550 
soldiers would come in and it I think
it's<00:03:20.460> like<00:03:20.610> there's<00:03:20.820> a<00:03:20.880> tank<00:03:21.300> or<00:03:21.570> a<00:03:21.630> car<00:03:22.260> in<00:03:22.470> the

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
it's like there's a tank or a car in the

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.010 
it's like there's a tank or a car in the
back<00:03:22.770> and<00:03:23.070> a<00:03:23.550> couple<00:03:23.580> of<00:03:23.940> mini<00:03:24.180> turrets<00:03:24.690> and

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
back and a couple of mini turrets and

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.320 
back and a couple of mini turrets and
rocket<00:03:25.410> launchers<00:03:25.830> so<00:03:26.610> they<00:03:26.760> have<00:03:26.910> that<00:03:27.090> just

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
rocket launchers so they have that just

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.790 
rocket launchers so they have that just
that<00:03:27.450> little<00:03:27.690> set<00:03:27.840> of<00:03:27.960> all<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.200> soldiers<00:03:28.620> and

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
that little set of all the soldiers and

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.270 
that little set of all the soldiers and
what<00:03:28.950> they<00:03:29.070> can<00:03:29.250> do<00:03:29.400> so<00:03:29.640> that<00:03:29.790> looks<00:03:30.000> cool<00:03:30.180> and

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
what they can do so that looks cool and
