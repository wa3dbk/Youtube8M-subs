00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.240 

we've<00:00:00.690> already<00:00:00.870> spoken<00:00:01.410> about<00:00:01.620> a<00:00:01.770> couple<00:00:02.040> ways

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
we've already spoken about a couple ways

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.760 
we've already spoken about a couple ways
that<00:00:02.310> we<00:00:02.820> can<00:00:02.970> get<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.629> flux<00:00:04.110> through<00:00:04.470> this

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
that we can get the flux through this

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.099 
that we can get the flux through this
loop<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.130> change<00:00:05.819> and<00:00:06.210> we<00:00:06.270> can<00:00:06.299> just<00:00:06.629> define

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
loop to change and we can just define

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.610 
loop to change and we can just define
flux<00:00:07.770> again<00:00:08.130> right<00:00:08.670> here<00:00:09.150> flux<00:00:09.510> is<00:00:09.750> magnetic

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
flux again right here flux is magnetic

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.839 
flux again right here flux is magnetic
field<00:00:11.000> dotted<00:00:12.000> into<00:00:12.780> area<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.740> that's<00:00:14.490> the

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
field dotted into area and that's the

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.630 
field dotted into area and that's the
same<00:00:15.089> thing<00:00:15.420> as<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:16.230> magnetic<00:00:16.890> field<00:00:17.160> times

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
same thing as the magnetic field times

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.029 
same thing as the magnetic field times
the<00:00:17.880> area<00:00:18.029> times<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.720> cosine<00:00:19.199> of<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:20.010> angle

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
the area times the cosine of the angle

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.150 
the area times the cosine of the angle
between<00:00:20.400> them<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.330> also<00:00:21.570> know<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.800> if

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
between them and you also know that if

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:31.099 
between them and you also know that if
there<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.930> change<00:00:25.890> in<00:00:26.400> flux<00:00:27.680> and<00:00:30.109> some

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
there is a change in flux and some

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.630 
there is a change in flux and some
amount<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.470> time<00:00:31.650> then<00:00:32.099> you're<00:00:32.219> going<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.520> get

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
amount of time then you're going to get

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.310 
amount of time then you're going to get
an<00:00:32.790> induced<00:00:33.120> voltage<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.809> there<00:00:33.930> also<00:00:34.079> has<00:00:34.290> to

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
an induced voltage and there also has to

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.420 
an induced voltage and there also has to
be<00:00:34.550> negative<00:00:35.550> n<00:00:36.320> multiplied<00:00:37.320> in<00:00:37.649> there<00:00:38.160> let's

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
be negative n multiplied in there let's

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.319 
be negative n multiplied in there let's
see<00:00:38.520> if<00:00:38.579> we<00:00:38.640> can<00:00:38.760> slip<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.300> there

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
see if we can slip that in there

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.530 
see if we can slip that in there
negative<00:00:39.750> n<00:00:40.170> times<00:00:40.649> D<00:00:41.070> Phi<00:00:41.100> DT<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:42.180> should<00:00:42.390> be<00:00:42.510> a

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
negative n times D Phi DT it should be a

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.569 
negative n times D Phi DT it should be a
derivative<00:00:42.840> really<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:44.190> can<00:00:44.399> use

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
derivative really and you can use

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.400 
derivative really and you can use
sometimes<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.270> magnetic<00:00:45.750> fields<00:00:46.020> not<00:00:46.200> going

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
sometimes the magnetic fields not going

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.799 
sometimes the magnetic fields not going
to<00:00:46.500> be<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.800> uniform<00:00:47.760> everywhere<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.690> use

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
to be a uniform everywhere you can use

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.840 
to be a uniform everywhere you can use
the<00:00:48.960> average<00:00:49.079> magnetic<00:00:49.829> field<00:00:50.100> here<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.579> find

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
the average magnetic field here to find

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.639 
the average magnetic field here to find
the<00:00:51.210> flux<00:00:51.480> going<00:00:51.690> through<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.140> loop<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:52.350> if

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
the flux going through the loop so if

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.709 
the flux going through the loop so if
it's<00:00:52.829> really<00:00:53.219> big<00:00:53.489> here<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:53.850> zero<00:00:54.270> here<00:00:54.390> you

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
it's really big here and zero here you

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.560 
it's really big here and zero here you
could<00:00:55.199> find<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.039> average<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.579> work<00:00:57.420> with

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
could find the average and work with

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.889 
could find the average and work with
that<00:00:57.600> that'd<00:00:57.930> be<00:00:58.020> fine<00:00:58.489> we<00:00:59.489> talked<00:00:59.730> about

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
that that'd be fine we talked about

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.420 
that that'd be fine we talked about
changing<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.989> magnetic<00:01:01.230> field<00:01:01.530> by<00:01:01.800> what

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
changing the magnetic field by what

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.619 
changing the magnetic field by what
changing<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.789> flux<00:01:03.000> by<00:01:03.149> change<00:01:03.449> in<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
changing the flux by change in the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.119 
changing the flux by change in the
magnetic<00:01:03.840> field<00:01:04.140> like<00:01:04.409> bringing<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.799> magnet

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
magnetic field like bringing a magnet

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.920 
magnetic field like bringing a magnet
near<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.460> or<00:01:05.640> magnet<00:01:06.150> out<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.510> we're<00:01:06.659> having

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
near it or magnet out of it we're having

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.080 
near it or magnet out of it we're having
the<00:01:07.320> loop<00:01:07.590> itself<00:01:07.950> leave<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.490> magnetic<00:01:08.880> field

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
the loop itself leave the magnetic field

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.300 
the loop itself leave the magnetic field
or<00:01:09.270> enter<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:10.080> could<00:01:10.260> also<00:01:10.439> change<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
or enter it you could also change the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.179 
or enter it you could also change the
area<00:01:11.520> if<00:01:11.939> this<00:01:12.299> loop<00:01:12.540> gets<00:01:12.750> smaller<00:01:13.229> if<00:01:13.740> the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
area if this loop gets smaller if the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.890 
area if this loop gets smaller if the
loop<00:01:14.369> gets<00:01:14.520> smaller<00:01:14.909> then<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.299> flux<00:01:15.570> through

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
loop gets smaller then the flux through

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.539 
loop gets smaller then the flux through
it<00:01:16.610> excuse<00:01:17.610> me<00:01:17.850> will<00:01:17.970> decrease<00:01:19.280> so<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.340> want<00:01:20.490> to

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
it excuse me will decrease so I want to

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.460 
it excuse me will decrease so I want to
think<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.790> clever<00:01:21.000> way<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.659> showing<00:01:22.439> that

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
think of a clever way of showing that

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.969 
think of a clever way of showing that
and<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.890> need<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.250> light<00:01:23.759> bulb<00:01:23.970> here<00:01:24.720> light<00:01:25.439> bulb

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
and I need a light bulb here light bulb

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.149 
and I need a light bulb here light bulb
and<00:01:27.049> here<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.170> I'm<00:01:28.530> gonna<00:01:28.740> ask<00:01:28.829> Newton<00:01:29.100> to

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
and here it is I'm gonna ask Newton to

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.469 
and here it is I'm gonna ask Newton to
hang<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.579> hang<00:01:30.000> on<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.270> for<00:01:30.299> me

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
hang on to that hang on to it for me

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.069 
hang on to that hang on to it for me
okay

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
okay

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.200 
okay
there<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.070> he's<00:01:32.520> gonna<00:01:32.670> hang<00:01:32.909> on<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.090> that

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
there so he's gonna hang on to that

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.149 
there so he's gonna hang on to that
light<00:01:33.390> bulb<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.960> we<00:01:34.079> got<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> wire<00:01:34.530> coming<00:01:34.950> up

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
light bulb and we got a wire coming up

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.080 
light bulb and we got a wire coming up
here<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:36.450> wire<00:01:36.740> coming<00:01:37.740> up<00:01:37.920> here<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.700> this

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
here and a wire coming up here and this

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.050 
here and a wire coming up here and this
is<00:01:39.240> actually<00:01:39.860> up<00:01:40.860> it's<00:01:41.369> very<00:01:41.610> important<00:01:42.030> that

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
is actually up it's very important that

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.630 
is actually up it's very important that
that's<00:01:42.299> up<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.840> then<00:01:43.049> gravity<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:44.100> pointing

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
that's up and then gravity is pointing

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.410 
that's up and then gravity is pointing
that<00:01:45.329> direction<00:01:45.860> all<00:01:46.860> right<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.520> I'm<00:01:47.820> going<00:01:48.240> to

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
that direction all right so I'm going to

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.600 
that direction all right so I'm going to
I'm<00:01:49.290> going<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.619> tell<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.920> there<00:01:50.159> are<00:01:50.369> two

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
I'm going to tell you there are two

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.310 
I'm going to tell you there are two
things<00:01:50.970> going<00:01:51.450> on<00:01:51.570> here<00:01:51.630> first<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.200> all

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
things going on here first of all

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.380 
things going on here first of all
there's<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.890> magnetic<00:01:53.430> field<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
there's a magnetic field and the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.840 
there's a magnetic field and the
magnetic<00:01:54.509> field<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:55.290> going<00:01:56.009> out<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.640> page

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
magnetic field is going out of the page

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.200 
magnetic field is going out of the page
lots<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.869> lots<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.350> magnetic<00:01:58.740> field<00:01:59.219> but<00:01:59.790> some

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
lots and lots of magnetic field but some

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.789 
lots and lots of magnetic field but some
what's<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.689> magnetic<00:02:01.200> field<00:02:01.409> draw<00:02:01.740> the

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
what's a magnetic field draw the

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.190 
what's a magnetic field draw the
magnetic<00:02:02.250> field<00:02:02.399> with<00:02:02.579> me<00:02:02.729> go<00:02:03.000> on<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.840> maybe

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
magnetic field with me go on and maybe

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.660 
magnetic field with me go on and maybe
there's<00:02:04.439> magnetic<00:02:04.799> field<00:02:04.950> out<00:02:05.130> here<00:02:05.159> too

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
there's magnetic field out here too

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.490 
there's magnetic field out here too
just<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.149> we're<00:02:06.360> convinced<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:07.259> there's

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
just so we're convinced that there's

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.559 
just so we're convinced that there's
uniform<00:02:07.979> magnetic<00:02:08.310> field<00:02:08.610> all<00:02:09.090> over<00:02:09.479> the

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
uniform magnetic field all over the

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.670 
uniform magnetic field all over the
place<00:02:09.869> magnetic<00:02:10.530> field<00:02:10.860> magnetic<00:02:11.160> field

place magnetic field magnetic field

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.899 
place magnetic field magnetic field
there<00:02:12.980> we<00:02:13.129> are<00:02:13.840> now<00:02:14.840> I've<00:02:14.959> got<00:02:15.170> this<00:02:15.290> clever

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:15.909 
there we are now I've got this clever

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.729 
there we are now I've got this clever
contraption<00:02:16.909> that<00:02:17.329> I<00:02:17.359> can<00:02:17.629> mount<00:02:17.900> on<00:02:18.230> these

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
contraption that I can mount on these

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.660 
contraption that I can mount on these
wires<00:02:19.099> that<00:02:19.459> are<00:02:19.519> vertically<00:02:20.269> up<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:20.569> it<00:02:21.170> is<00:02:21.319> a

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
wires that are vertically up and it is a

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.599 
wires that are vertically up and it is a
cylinder<00:02:22.930> and<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.739> cylinder<00:02:24.769> is<00:02:25.280> going<00:02:25.430> to<00:02:25.489> be

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:25.609 
cylinder and the cylinder is going to be

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:29.259 
cylinder and the cylinder is going to be
here<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.269> it<00:02:26.390> conducts<00:02:26.870> electricity<00:02:27.140> I<00:02:28.269> mean

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
here and it conducts electricity I mean

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.030 
here and it conducts electricity I mean
only<00:02:29.480> if<00:02:29.719> you've<00:02:29.810> got<00:02:29.959> electricity<00:02:30.290> can<00:02:30.590> to

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
only if you've got electricity can to

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.129 
only if you've got electricity can to
conduct<00:02:31.370> through<00:02:31.579> it<00:02:31.700> but<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.359> the<00:02:32.659> key<00:02:32.870> point

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:33.139 
conduct through it but the the key point

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:37.660 
conduct through it but the the key point
is<00:02:33.379> this<00:02:33.859> wire<00:02:34.250> goes<00:02:35.230> through<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.680> touches

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
is this wire goes through and touches

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.800 
is this wire goes through and touches
the<00:02:37.909> cylinder<00:02:38.450> so<00:02:38.689> this<00:02:39.019> cylinder<00:02:39.290> is<00:02:39.620> solid

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
the cylinder so this cylinder is solid

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.849 
the cylinder so this cylinder is solid
and<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:44.090> will<00:02:44.329> want<00:02:44.599> to<00:02:44.750> slide<00:02:45.349> because

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
and it will want to slide because

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.879 
and it will want to slide because
gravity<00:02:46.400> is<00:02:46.430> acting<00:02:47.030> down<00:02:47.450> on<00:02:47.900> it<00:02:48.169> so<00:02:48.680> there

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:48.889 
gravity is acting down on it so there

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:50.949 
gravity is acting down on it so there
are<00:02:49.010> a<00:02:49.069> few<00:02:49.370> ways<00:02:49.549> we<00:02:49.849> can<00:02:50.060> look<00:02:50.090> at<00:02:50.389> this<00:02:50.510> but

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
are a few ways we can look at this but

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.360 
are a few ways we can look at this but
one<00:02:51.169> thing<00:02:51.409> that's<00:02:51.560> really<00:02:51.829> cool<00:02:52.010> get<00:02:52.220> by<00:02:52.310> the

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
one thing that's really cool get by the

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.929 
one thing that's really cool get by the
way<00:02:52.489> noon

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:52.939 
way noon

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.309 
way noon
one<00:02:53.150> thing<00:02:53.329> that's<00:02:53.419> really<00:02:53.599> cool<00:02:53.870> is<00:02:54.079> this

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
one thing that's really cool is this

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.750 
one thing that's really cool is this
light<00:02:54.620> bulb<00:02:54.919> will<00:02:55.430> light<00:02:55.849> as<00:02:56.650> this<00:02:57.650> bar<00:02:58.010> Falls

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
light bulb will light as this bar Falls

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
light bulb will light as this bar Falls
and<00:02:59.180> in<00:02:59.689> fact<00:03:00.639> the<00:03:01.639> bar<00:03:01.879> will<00:03:02.120> speed<00:03:02.569> up

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
and in fact the bar will speed up

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.990 
and in fact the bar will speed up
because<00:03:03.319> initially<00:03:03.650> there<00:03:04.040> is<00:03:04.069> no<00:03:04.340> force<00:03:04.730> on

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
because initially there is no force on

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.059 
because initially there is no force on
it<00:03:05.389> except<00:03:05.840> for<00:03:05.989> the<00:03:06.049> force<00:03:06.260> of<00:03:06.409> gravity<00:03:06.769> but

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
it except for the force of gravity but

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.559 
it except for the force of gravity but
it<00:03:07.189> will<00:03:07.310> soon<00:03:07.579> reach<00:03:07.909> a<00:03:08.060> terminal<00:03:08.329> velocity

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
it will soon reach a terminal velocity

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.280 
it will soon reach a terminal velocity
and<00:03:09.230> we'll<00:03:09.319> think<00:03:09.469> about<00:03:09.650> that<00:03:09.769> for<00:03:10.219> a<00:03:10.250> minute

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
and we'll think about that for a minute

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.170 
and we'll think about that for a minute
we<00:03:12.290> could<00:03:12.500> in<00:03:12.650> fact<00:03:12.680> find<00:03:13.129> its<00:03:13.700> terminal

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
we could in fact find its terminal

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.530 
we could in fact find its terminal
velocity<00:03:15.760> probably<00:03:16.760> will<00:03:16.909> depend<00:03:17.269> on<00:03:17.359> the

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
velocity probably will depend on the

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.050 
velocity probably will depend on the
resistance<00:03:18.139> of<00:03:18.409> the<00:03:18.590> light<00:03:18.829> bulb<00:03:19.069> let's<00:03:19.849> see

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
resistance of the light bulb let's see

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.089 
resistance of the light bulb let's see
if<00:03:20.150> we<00:03:20.299> can<00:03:20.419> get<00:03:20.599> ourselves<00:03:20.959> an<00:03:21.470> R<00:03:21.650> right<00:03:21.889> there

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
if we can get ourselves an R right there

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:27.039 
if we can get ourselves an R right there
all<00:03:22.280> right<00:03:22.459> now<00:03:23.859> if<00:03:24.859> the<00:03:25.340> bar<00:03:25.609> is<00:03:25.849> falling<00:03:26.599> then

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
all right now if the bar is falling then

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.979 
all right now if the bar is falling then
the<00:03:27.229> area<00:03:27.680> is<00:03:27.949> changing<00:03:28.090> and<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.359> area<00:03:29.780> is

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
the area is changing and the area is

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.349 
the area is changing and the area is
changing<00:03:30.019> in<00:03:30.799> a<00:03:31.040> complicated<00:03:31.879> way<00:03:32.030> I<00:03:32.060> don't

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
changing in a complicated way I don't

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:33.819 
changing in a complicated way I don't
want<00:03:32.510> to<00:03:32.569> go<00:03:32.629> through<00:03:32.840> this<00:03:32.959> really<00:03:33.260> carefully

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
want to go through this really carefully

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.159 
want to go through this really carefully
right<00:03:34.010> now<00:03:34.159> but<00:03:34.609> I<00:03:34.639> guess<00:03:35.090> my<00:03:35.239> first<00:03:35.479> point<00:03:35.840> is

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:36.169 
right now but I guess my first point is

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:40.869 
right now but I guess my first point is
the<00:03:36.709> velocity<00:03:37.430> of<00:03:37.459> the<00:03:38.030> charges<00:03:38.810> in<00:03:39.109> this<00:03:40.069> rod

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 
the velocity of the charges in this rod

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:45.039 
the velocity of the charges in this rod
is<00:03:41.859> down<00:03:42.879> so<00:03:43.879> we<00:03:44.180> don't<00:03:44.329> even<00:03:44.389> have<00:03:44.540> to<00:03:44.780> look<00:03:44.930> at

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
is down so we don't even have to look at

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.080 
is down so we don't even have to look at
in<00:03:45.290> terms<00:03:45.319> of<00:03:45.680> lenses<00:03:46.220> law<00:03:46.430> yet<00:03:46.790> we'll<00:03:46.970> do

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
in terms of lenses law yet we'll do

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.909 
in terms of lenses law yet we'll do
lenses<00:03:47.479> lawn<00:03:47.689> next<00:03:47.930> I'm<00:03:48.349> going<00:03:48.620> to<00:03:48.680> look<00:03:48.739> at<00:03:48.889> a

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:48.919 
lenses lawn next I'm going to look at a

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:50.770 
lenses lawn next I'm going to look at a
totally<00:03:49.340> old<00:03:49.519> school<00:03:49.729> there<00:03:50.299> are<00:03:50.479> charges

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
totally old school there are charges

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.809 
totally old school there are charges
here<00:03:51.290> and<00:03:51.439> they're<00:03:51.769> moving<00:03:52.159> in<00:03:52.340> a<00:03:52.669> magnetic

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
here and they're moving in a magnetic

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.740 
here and they're moving in a magnetic
field<00:03:53.180> so<00:03:53.629> as<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:54.079> rod<00:03:54.290> Falls<00:03:54.819> the<00:03:55.819> charges<00:03:56.449> go

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
field so as the rod Falls the charges go

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.170 
field so as the rod Falls the charges go
down<00:03:57.169> and<00:03:57.590> which<00:03:58.040> charges<00:03:58.459> are<00:03:58.699> free<00:03:58.819> to<00:03:59.030> move

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
down and which charges are free to move

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.849 
down and which charges are free to move
is<00:03:59.419> it<00:03:59.629> the<00:03:59.750> positive<00:03:59.900> charges<00:04:00.470> or<00:04:00.739> the

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
is it the positive charges or the

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.619 
is it the positive charges or the
negative<00:04:01.159> charges<00:04:01.459> course<00:04:02.269> it<00:04:02.479> is<00:04:02.599> the

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629 
negative charges course it is the

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:05.199 
negative charges course it is the
negatives<00:04:03.169> but<00:04:03.229> we<00:04:04.129> could<00:04:04.340> consider<00:04:04.669> well

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
negatives but we could consider well

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:06.460 
negatives but we could consider well
let's<00:04:05.449> do<00:04:05.569> it<00:04:05.659> let's<00:04:05.870> do<00:04:05.959> the<00:04:06.019> negatives<00:04:06.379> I'm

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
let's do it let's do the negatives I'm

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.289 
let's do it let's do the negatives I'm
going<00:04:06.650> to<00:04:06.709> take<00:04:06.859> my<00:04:07.099> left<00:04:07.370> hand<00:04:07.519> and<00:04:08.060> I'm<00:04:08.180> going

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
going to take my left hand and I'm going

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.780 
going to take my left hand and I'm going
to<00:04:08.359> say<00:04:08.449> the<00:04:08.599> velocity<00:04:09.109> is<00:04:09.319> down<00:04:10.099> and<00:04:10.459> I'm

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
to say the velocity is down and I'm

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.270 
to say the velocity is down and I'm
going<00:04:10.909> to<00:04:10.939> say<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.329> magnetic<00:04:11.959> field<00:04:12.379> is<00:04:12.650> out

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
going to say the magnetic field is out

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.399 
going to say the magnetic field is out
so<00:04:13.729> I<00:04:13.759> have<00:04:13.849> to<00:04:13.939> do<00:04:14.030> this<00:04:14.150> so<00:04:14.780> the<00:04:14.900> force<00:04:15.139> on<00:04:15.319> the

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:15.409 
so I have to do this so the force on the

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:17.259 
so I have to do this so the force on the
negative<00:04:15.680> charges<00:04:15.949> will<00:04:16.220> be<00:04:16.340> that<00:04:16.609> direction

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
negative charges will be that direction

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.129 
negative charges will be that direction
let's<00:04:17.900> label<00:04:18.320> that<00:04:19.130> so<00:04:19.820> I'm<00:04:20.060> saying<00:04:20.419> the<00:04:20.690> force

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
let's label that so I'm saying the force

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.110 
let's label that so I'm saying the force
on<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:22.820> electron

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
on the electron

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.230 
on the electron
so<00:04:24.720> which<00:04:24.930> direction<00:04:25.290> will<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.560> current<00:04:25.980> go

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
so which direction will the current go

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.790 
so which direction will the current go
well<00:04:27.240> the<00:04:27.360> current<00:04:27.690> wants<00:04:28.320> to<00:04:28.470> go<00:04:28.590> wait<00:04:28.770> a

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
well the current wants to go wait a

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.500 
well the current wants to go wait a
second<00:04:29.310> is<00:04:29.430> this<00:04:29.610> wire<00:04:29.820> moving<00:04:30.120> the<00:04:30.210> magnetic

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
second is this wire moving the magnetic

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.909 
second is this wire moving the magnetic
field<00:04:30.750> no<00:04:30.930> is<00:04:31.139> this<00:04:31.410> wire<00:04:31.590> moving<00:04:31.860> the

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
field no is this wire moving the

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:32.510 
field no is this wire moving the
magnetic<00:04:32.250> field

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
magnetic field

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.950 
magnetic field
no<00:04:32.700> is<00:04:33.000> this<00:04:33.150> wire<00:04:33.330> moving<00:04:33.570> the<00:04:33.630> magnetic

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
no is this wire moving the magnetic

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.110 
no is this wire moving the magnetic
field<00:04:34.260> no<00:04:34.590> but<00:04:35.040> the<00:04:35.160> force<00:04:35.430> on<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:35.669> electrons

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
field no but the force on the electrons

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.050 
field no but the force on the electrons
is<00:04:36.330> that<00:04:36.630> direction<00:04:37.080> and<00:04:37.410> so<00:04:37.980> they<00:04:38.340> want<00:04:38.790> a

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
is that direction and so they want a

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.510 
is that direction and so they want a
current<00:04:39.810> to<00:04:40.050> be<00:04:40.169> going<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.830> opposite

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
current to be going the opposite

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.300 
current to be going the opposite
direction<00:04:41.700> so<00:04:42.660> I'll<00:04:42.900> say<00:04:43.380> that<00:04:43.800> a<00:04:43.830> current

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
direction so I'll say that a current

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.180 
direction so I'll say that a current
will<00:04:44.700> go<00:04:44.730> this<00:04:45.300> direction<00:04:45.950> through<00:04:46.950> the

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
will go this direction through the

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.970 
will go this direction through the
circuit<00:04:47.760> let's<00:04:48.510> see<00:04:48.660> if<00:04:48.750> we<00:04:48.900> can<00:04:49.080> maybe<00:04:49.560> gloss

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
circuit let's see if we can maybe gloss

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.040 
circuit let's see if we can maybe gloss
over<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.460> whole<00:04:50.610> fact<00:04:50.850> the<00:04:51.150> protons<00:04:51.780> aren't

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
over the whole fact the protons aren't

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.450 
over the whole fact the protons aren't
moving<00:04:52.169> the<00:04:52.350> electrons<00:04:52.590> are<00:04:52.919> moving<00:04:52.950> and<00:04:53.310> say

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
moving the electrons are moving and say

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.129 
moving the electrons are moving and say
something<00:04:53.820> like<00:04:53.910> what<00:04:54.419> if<00:04:54.570> we<00:04:54.780> say<00:04:54.960> the

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
something like what if we say the

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:56.960 
something like what if we say the
velocity<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:55.770> protons<00:04:56.220> is<00:04:56.430> also<00:04:56.760> down

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
velocity the protons is also down

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.090 
velocity the protons is also down
because<00:04:57.330> all<00:04:57.630> of<00:04:57.690> this<00:04:58.229> wire<00:04:58.470> is<00:04:58.650> moving<00:04:58.950> down

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
because all of this wire is moving down

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.010 
because all of this wire is moving down
and<00:04:59.310> then<00:04:59.639> we<00:04:59.760> say<00:04:59.910> the<00:05:00.030> magnetic<00:05:00.479> field<00:05:00.780> is

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
and then we say the magnetic field is

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.260 
and then we say the magnetic field is
out<00:05:01.350> of<00:05:01.410> the<00:05:01.590> page<00:05:01.770> and<00:05:02.190> I'm<00:05:02.760> using<00:05:02.910> my<00:05:03.090> right

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
out of the page and I'm using my right

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.270 
out of the page and I'm using my right
hand<00:05:03.540> and<00:05:03.780> I<00:05:03.840> see<00:05:04.050> that<00:05:04.169> the<00:05:04.290> force<00:05:04.560> on<00:05:04.800> the

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
hand and I see that the force on the

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.920 
hand and I see that the force on the
protons<00:05:05.700> is<00:05:05.910> that<00:05:06.060> direction<00:05:06.389> and<00:05:06.630> we<00:05:06.780> could

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
protons is that direction and we could

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.930 
protons is that direction and we could
pretend<00:05:07.260> Benjamin<00:05:07.710> Franklin<00:05:08.040> style<00:05:08.310> that<00:05:08.850> the

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
pretend Benjamin Franklin style that the

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.310 
pretend Benjamin Franklin style that the
protons<00:05:09.300> are<00:05:09.450> moving<00:05:09.720> and<00:05:10.080> we'll<00:05:10.169> get<00:05:10.260> a

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
protons are moving and we'll get a

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.590 
protons are moving and we'll get a
current<00:05:10.680> also<00:05:10.889> that's<00:05:11.729> counterclockwise<00:05:12.150> as

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
current also that's counterclockwise as

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.840 
current also that's counterclockwise as
the<00:05:13.560> current<00:05:13.950> though<00:05:14.190> is<00:05:14.430> counterclockwise

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
the current though is counterclockwise

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.969 
the current though is counterclockwise
you<00:05:15.479> see<00:05:15.960> that<00:05:16.380> the<00:05:16.470> current<00:05:16.800> is<00:05:16.889> going

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
you see that the current is going

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.070 
you see that the current is going
through<00:05:17.340> a<00:05:17.400> resistor<00:05:17.850> and<00:05:18.030> you<00:05:18.090> can<00:05:18.630> find<00:05:18.930> the

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
through a resistor and you can find the

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.740 
through a resistor and you can find the
power<00:05:19.290> of<00:05:19.710> that<00:05:20.520> circuit<00:05:21.000> it's<00:05:21.180> going<00:05:21.389> to<00:05:21.450> be<00:05:21.540> I

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
power of that circuit it's going to be I

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.580 
power of that circuit it's going to be I
squared<00:05:22.320> times<00:05:22.680> R<00:05:23.100> isn't<00:05:23.580> it<00:05:23.760> oh<00:05:23.880> I<00:05:24.750> squared

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
squared times R isn't it oh I squared

squared times R isn't it oh I squared
times<00:05:25.919> R<00:05:26.160> and<00:05:26.520> the<00:05:27.180> current<00:05:27.840> has<00:05:28.289> something<00:05:28.800> to

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
times R and the current has something to

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.830 
times R and the current has something to
do<00:05:28.979> with<00:05:29.010> the<00:05:29.250> force<00:05:29.460> on<00:05:29.669> the<00:05:29.760> electrons<00:05:30.270> but

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
do with the force on the electrons but

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.360 
do with the force on the electrons but
that's<00:05:31.320> fine<00:05:31.560> that's<00:05:31.770> fine<00:05:31.919> we'll<00:05:32.160> go<00:05:32.250> into

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
that's fine that's fine we'll go into

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.400 
that's fine that's fine we'll go into
more<00:05:32.520> detail<00:05:32.820> later<00:05:33.030> I<00:05:33.300> just<00:05:33.780> want<00:05:33.900> to<00:05:33.960> touch

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
more detail later I just want to touch

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.600 
more detail later I just want to touch
on<00:05:34.620> these<00:05:34.800> sorts<00:05:35.039> of<00:05:35.100> things<00:05:35.160> to<00:05:35.400> show<00:05:35.550> you

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
on these sorts of things to show you

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.150 
on these sorts of things to show you
what's<00:05:35.940> awesome<00:05:36.150> about<00:05:36.419> this<00:05:36.630> situation

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
what's awesome about this situation

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.120 
what's awesome about this situation
there<00:05:38.160> will<00:05:38.340> be<00:05:38.370> a<00:05:38.430> force<00:05:38.820> upward<00:05:39.690> on<00:05:39.990> the<00:05:40.860> rod

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
there will be a force upward on the rod

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.029 
there will be a force upward on the rod
because<00:05:42.060> of<00:05:42.360> the<00:05:42.510> fact<00:05:42.780> that<00:05:42.960> it's<00:05:43.260> using

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
because of the fact that it's using

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:45.770 
because of the fact that it's using
energy<00:05:44.490> to<00:05:44.520> light<00:05:44.880> the<00:05:45.060> light<00:05:45.210> bulb<00:05:45.450> so<00:05:45.630> we'll

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
energy to light the light bulb so we'll

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.150 
energy to light the light bulb so we'll
talk<00:05:45.900> about<00:05:46.140> that<00:05:46.260> more<00:05:46.440> detail<00:05:46.770> later<00:05:46.919> my

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
talk about that more detail later my

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.180 
talk about that more detail later my
next<00:05:47.610> thing<00:05:48.390> to<00:05:48.660> discuss<00:05:49.110> what<00:05:49.770> do<00:05:49.830> I<00:05:49.919> want<00:05:50.100> to

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
next thing to discuss what do I want to

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.800 
next thing to discuss what do I want to
say<00:05:50.340> I<00:05:50.550> think<00:05:50.910> I<00:05:51.210> wanted<00:05:51.479> to<00:05:51.570> say<00:05:51.750> something

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
say I think I wanted to say something

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.159 
say I think I wanted to say something
about<00:05:52.370> shoot<00:05:53.370> it<00:05:53.490> escapes<00:05:53.880> me<00:05:54.000> know<00:05:54.840> we<00:05:55.050> can

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.169 
about shoot it escapes me know we can

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:56.719 
about shoot it escapes me know we can
come<00:05:55.320> up<00:05:55.350> with<00:05:55.470> something<00:05:55.770> to<00:05:55.950> say<00:05:55.979> what<00:05:56.700> I

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
come up with something to say what I

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:00.290 
come up with something to say what I
want<00:05:57.150> to<00:05:57.360> say<00:05:57.690> is<00:05:58.100> that<00:05:59.100> we<00:05:59.340> can<00:05:59.520> also<00:05:59.789> view

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
want to say is that we can also view

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.230 
want to say is that we can also view
this<00:06:00.479> as<00:06:00.690> the<00:06:00.750> area<00:06:01.139> decreasing<00:06:02.070> so<00:06:02.580> if<00:06:02.729> I<00:06:02.910> say

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
this as the area decreasing so if I say

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.500 
this as the area decreasing so if I say
that<00:06:03.690> the<00:06:04.080> loop<00:06:04.410> sees<00:06:05.010> less<00:06:05.370> and<00:06:05.669> less<00:06:05.970> flux

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
that the loop sees less and less flux

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.190 
that the loop sees less and less flux
coming<00:06:06.990> this<00:06:07.680> way<00:06:08.100> we'll<00:06:08.520> call<00:06:08.700> it<00:06:08.850> out

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.200 
coming this way we'll call it out

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.110 
coming this way we'll call it out
there's<00:06:10.200> less<00:06:10.500> and<00:06:10.680> less<00:06:10.770> flux<00:06:11.280> out<00:06:11.460> of<00:06:11.550> the

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
there's less and less flux out of the

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.000 
there's less and less flux out of the
loop<00:06:12.300> the<00:06:12.690> loop<00:06:12.870> will<00:06:13.080> try<00:06:13.289> to<00:06:13.320> make<00:06:13.770> a

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.010 
loop the loop will try to make a

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.909 
loop the loop will try to make a
magnetic<00:06:14.789> field<00:06:15.150> that<00:06:15.690> reminds<00:06:16.320> itself<00:06:16.710> of

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
magnetic field that reminds itself of

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:18.680 
magnetic field that reminds itself of
that<00:06:16.950> hamburger<00:06:17.520> it<00:06:17.700> was<00:06:17.850> once<00:06:18.120> eating<00:06:18.570> it

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
that hamburger it was once eating it

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.840 
that hamburger it was once eating it
reminds<00:06:19.260> itself<00:06:19.590> of<00:06:19.800> the<00:06:19.979> field<00:06:20.220> that<00:06:20.669> is

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:20.850 
reminds itself of the field that is

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.640 
reminds itself of the field that is
pointing<00:06:21.270> out<00:06:21.360> that<00:06:21.630> it<00:06:21.750> used<00:06:21.900> to<00:06:22.050> have<00:06:22.260> it

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
pointing out that it used to have it

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.340 
pointing out that it used to have it
wants<00:06:22.919> to<00:06:23.039> get<00:06:23.190> that<00:06:23.430> field<00:06:23.789> back<00:06:24.270> so<00:06:24.900> it<00:06:25.020> makes

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:25.350 
wants to get that field back so it makes

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.550 
wants to get that field back so it makes
a<00:06:25.590> current<00:06:26.130> in<00:06:26.310> a<00:06:26.610> direction<00:06:27.210> that<00:06:27.389> will<00:06:27.810> give

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
a current in a direction that will give

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.800 
a current in a direction that will give
it<00:06:28.740> back<00:06:28.979> the<00:06:29.550> field<00:06:29.820> that<00:06:30.060> it's<00:06:30.180> losing<00:06:30.450> and

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
it back the field that it's losing and

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.779 
it back the field that it's losing and
that<00:06:31.169> is<00:06:31.380> right-hand-rule<00:06:32.099> secret<00:06:32.520> watch<00:06:32.640> it

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:32.789 
that is right-hand-rule secret watch it

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:35.750 
that is right-hand-rule secret watch it
that<00:06:33.300> direction<00:06:33.510> counterclockwise<00:06:34.409> also<00:06:35.159> two

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:35.760 
that direction counterclockwise also two

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.750 
that direction counterclockwise also two
ways<00:06:36.060> to<00:06:36.419> justify<00:06:36.810> a<00:06:37.229> counter

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:37.760 
ways to justify a counter

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.820 
ways to justify a counter
clockwise<00:06:38.030> current<00:06:38.390> as<00:06:38.660> the<00:06:39.170> rod<00:06:39.320> is<00:06:39.470> falling

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:39.830 
clockwise current as the rod is falling

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.830 
clockwise current as the rod is falling
the<00:06:40.250> next<00:06:40.550> video<00:06:40.790> will<00:06:41.060> go<00:06:41.180> into<00:06:41.390> more<00:06:41.540> detail

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 
the next video will go into more detail
