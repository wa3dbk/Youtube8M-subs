 fifty meters with her husband 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:19.249
 he changes counted on talking about that 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:20.849
 which fifty Roma 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:23.699

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.130

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.100
 she's one of the girls

 for this type of mission 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.340
 the scene was defused 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.340
 he would have in the past 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.080
 the Virgin 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.910

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.780
 been built for fifteen days they will be affixed on their screens 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.740
 violence always leads the tournament for me I'm not referring to the report 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.310
 to the other information yet this information from the Parisian and then there 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.579
 it's a lot more serious anyway 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.129
 percent because the Parisian claims for those who were controlled by 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.439
 message bias of my years to the point that the economy 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.819
 why we also talk about the weather in the series since 

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:12.500
 the announced of his grandmother 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.610
 in the team we knew how to do it because it hurts I just thought 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.920
 it can be managed 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.970
 the storm is the manifestation we laughed a lot of lille michel bastos on 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.159
 judicial convictions this summer at the Cannes festival and will release what 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.749
 I'm going to do bartender is pretty clear and net the euro had dropped at icon dead 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.010
 in the room we hope not 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.010
 I have a great vga 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.460
 the 33 children you are somebody of money not at all these 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.770
 girls who says that 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.100
 the man 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.259
 the phone is all the time tonight that all the migrants in the Parisian 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.600
 he will exercise first example 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.820
 for example a tactician you do not have me while his career is not me 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.970
 alain joyandet had never had a complaint from the state by 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.550
 interim after departure 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.140
 apart from the fact it will not be different 72 euros 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.969
 seems obvious to me no but what is this story then 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:12.170
 but it's sluts who have nothing else to say about her car this 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.170
 year of lovers turned away from its margins thanks to journalists at 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.549
 Paris 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.290
 among journalists and it may seem paradoxical in the street is 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.589
 for example a slut too I do not know if it's true it's not true that the 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:26.529
 comparison be accomplished it's a slut the dummy
