00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.290 
from the last clip where I showed you a

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.380 
from the last clip where I showed you a
more<00:00:14.590> efficient<00:00:15.040> way<00:00:15.160> to<00:00:15.190> do<00:00:15.430> push-ups<00:00:15.760> you

end of the deadlift okay a lot of people

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.420 
end of the deadlift okay a lot of people
over<00:00:24.310> pull<00:00:24.610> this<00:00:24.790> position<00:00:25.440> in<00:00:26.440> an<00:00:26.950> attempt<00:00:27.340> to

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
over pull this position in an attempt to

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.340 
over pull this position in an attempt to
get<00:00:27.640> to<00:00:27.700> lockout<00:00:28.240> you<00:00:28.690> don't<00:00:28.869> need<00:00:29.050> to<00:00:29.170> do<00:00:29.320> that

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.350 
get to lockout you don't need to do that

we<00:00:29.590> were<00:00:29.680> looking<00:00:29.980> for<00:00:30.190> more<00:00:30.300> efficiency<00:00:31.300> in

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
we were looking for more efficiency in

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.030 
we were looking for more efficiency in
the<00:00:31.539> movement<00:00:31.960> okay<00:00:32.470> and<00:00:32.739> that's<00:00:32.949> the

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
the movement okay and that's the

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.439 
the movement okay and that's the
shortest<00:00:33.550> distance<00:00:33.730> between<00:00:33.970> two<00:00:34.420> points

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:34.449 
shortest distance between two points

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:37.229 
shortest distance between two points
it's<00:00:35.320> a<00:00:35.350> straight<00:00:35.770> line<00:00:35.980> position<00:00:36.160> and<00:00:36.640> Ryan's

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
it's a straight line position and Ryan's

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.000 
it's a straight line position and Ryan's
going<00:00:37.390> to<00:00:37.480> show<00:00:37.600> you<00:00:37.660> first<00:00:37.989> off<00:00:38.230> the<00:00:38.860> way

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
going to show you first off the way

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.759 
going to show you first off the way
typically<00:00:39.760> people<00:00:40.660> pull<00:00:41.080> this<00:00:41.199> position<00:00:41.620> once

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
typically people pull this position once

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:43.619 
typically people pull this position once
they<00:00:41.949> get<00:00:42.070> to<00:00:42.190> the<00:00:42.309> knees<00:00:42.489> that's<00:00:43.210> when<00:00:43.479> the

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
they get to the knees that's when the

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:45.930 
they get to the knees that's when the
form<00:00:43.900> breaks<00:00:44.140> down<00:00:44.320> and<00:00:44.710> they<00:00:44.949> over<00:00:45.460> pull<00:00:45.729> that

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
form breaks down and they over pull that

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.850 
form breaks down and they over pull that
movement<00:00:46.479> okay<00:00:46.870> where<00:00:47.050> they<00:00:47.140> hyper<00:00:47.350> send<00:00:47.739> that

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
movement okay where they hyper send that

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.009 
movement okay where they hyper send that
lower<00:00:48.040> back<00:00:48.280> slightly<00:00:48.580> or<00:00:49.000> disengage<00:00:49.750> the

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
lower back slightly or disengage the

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:51.930 
lower back slightly or disengage the
glutes<00:00:50.290> okay<00:00:50.920> when<00:00:51.070> you<00:00:51.129> hyper<00:00:51.309> extend<00:00:51.760> here

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
glutes okay when you hyper extend here
