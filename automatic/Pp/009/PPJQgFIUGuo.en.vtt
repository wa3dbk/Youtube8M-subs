youngwritersworkshops.com and i'm going
to<00:00:03.750> talk<00:00:03.959> about<00:00:04.640> some<00:00:05.640> of<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.790> disadvantages

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
to talk about some of the disadvantages

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.640 
to talk about some of the disadvantages
of<00:00:06.750> computers<00:00:07.529> in<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.950> classroom<00:00:09.530> you<00:00:10.530> know

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
of computers in the classroom you know

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.959 
of computers in the classroom you know
that<00:00:10.889> both<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.429> advantages<00:00:11.700> and

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
that both the advantages and

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.990 
that both the advantages and
disadvantages<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:13.790> computers<00:00:14.790> in<00:00:14.910> the

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
disadvantages of computers in the

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.720 
disadvantages of computers in the
classroom<00:00:15.089> aren't<00:00:15.630> very<00:00:15.780> well<00:00:15.960> documented<00:00:16.730> so

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
classroom aren't very well documented so

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.920 
classroom aren't very well documented so
it's<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.940> little<00:00:18.060> bit<00:00:18.240> difficult<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.690> make<00:00:18.900> a

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
it's a little bit difficult to make a

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.460 
it's a little bit difficult to make a
really<00:00:20.330> well<00:00:21.330> supported<00:00:21.510> case<00:00:22.050> in<00:00:22.289> either

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
really well supported case in either

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.560 
really well supported case in either
direction<00:00:22.680> but<00:00:23.189> there<00:00:23.369> are<00:00:23.490> some<00:00:23.789> just

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
direction but there are some just

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.420 
direction but there are some just
practical<00:00:25.199> disadvantages<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.310> using

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
practical disadvantages of using

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.910 
practical disadvantages of using
computers<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.840> classroom<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.859> I

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
computers in the classroom that I

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.089 
computers in the classroom that I
thought<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.189> could<00:00:29.310> outline<00:00:30.150> for<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.099> one

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
thought I could outline for you and one

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.930 
thought I could outline for you and one
of<00:00:32.219> them<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.960> that<00:00:34.010> teacher<00:00:35.010> preparation<00:00:35.489> to

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
of them is that teacher preparation to

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.660 
of them is that teacher preparation to
use<00:00:36.320> computers<00:00:37.320> effectively<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.309> pretty

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
use computers effectively is pretty

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.760 
use computers effectively is pretty
spotty<00:00:38.969> there<00:00:39.570> may<00:00:39.690> be<00:00:39.719> some<00:00:40.110> teachers<00:00:40.290> who

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
spotty there may be some teachers who

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.100 
spotty there may be some teachers who
have<00:00:40.969> done<00:00:41.969> some<00:00:42.390> training<00:00:42.660> or<00:00:42.930> really

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
have done some training or really

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.000 
have done some training or really
thought<00:00:43.320> thought<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.920> through<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:45.000> have<00:00:46.010> come

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
thought thought it through and have come

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.340 
thought thought it through and have come
up<00:00:47.129> with<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.340> good<00:00:47.750> logistical<00:00:48.750> plan<00:00:48.960> for<00:00:49.230> how

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
up with a good logistical plan for how

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.779 
up with a good logistical plan for how
to<00:00:49.379> teach<00:00:49.770> with<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.039> computer<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.700> the

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
to teach with a computer in the

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.209 
to teach with a computer in the
classroom<00:00:50.910> or<00:00:51.449> with<00:00:51.600> several<00:00:51.899> computers<00:00:52.379> but

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
classroom or with several computers but

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.590 
classroom or with several computers but
in<00:00:53.370> general<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.969> isn't<00:00:54.239> something<00:00:54.449> that

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
in general this isn't something that

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.000 
in general this isn't something that
teachers<00:00:54.989> had<00:00:55.170> as<00:00:55.350> part<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.620> their<00:00:55.770> training

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
teachers had as part of their training

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.979 
teachers had as part of their training
specific<00:00:56.730> special<00:00:57.270> e<00:00:57.329> teachers<00:00:57.629> who<00:00:57.780> have

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
specific special e teachers who have

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.220 
specific special e teachers who have
been<00:00:58.140> teaching<00:00:58.289> for<00:00:58.469> quite<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.800> while<00:00:59.039> so<00:01:00.230> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
been teaching for quite a while so the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.830 
been teaching for quite a while so the
you<00:01:01.620> may<00:01:01.859> be<00:01:01.920> finding<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:02.969> teacher<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.719> may

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
you may be finding that teacher you may

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.179 
you may be finding that teacher you may
find<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.140> teachers<00:01:04.500> aren't<00:01:04.710> very<00:01:05.100> well

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
find that teachers aren't very well

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.240 
find that teachers aren't very well
prepared<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.820> teach<00:01:06.360> with<00:01:06.600> technology

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
prepared to teach with technology

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.940 
prepared to teach with technology
another<00:01:08.250> disadvantage<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.450> if<00:01:09.950> there's

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
another disadvantage is that if there's

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.100 
another disadvantage is that if there's
an<00:01:11.100> internet-connected<00:01:11.960> computer<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:13.049> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
an internet-connected computer in the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.270 
an internet-connected computer in the
classroom<00:01:13.340> maybe<00:01:14.340> opening<00:01:15.650> students<00:01:16.650> to

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
classroom maybe opening students to

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.530 
classroom maybe opening students to
inappropriate<00:01:18.150> material<00:01:19.850> or<00:01:20.850> even<00:01:20.880> just

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
inappropriate material or even just

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.440 
inappropriate material or even just
overwhelming<00:01:22.229> material<00:01:22.799> students<00:01:23.450> aren't

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
overwhelming material students aren't

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.510 
overwhelming material students aren't
always<00:01:24.570> equipped<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.439> do<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.619> web<00:01:25.890> search<00:01:25.920> and

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
always equipped to do a web search and

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.850 
always equipped to do a web search and
make<00:01:26.670> sense<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.240> results<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.740> can

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
make sense of the results and so it can

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.890 
make sense of the results and so it can
be<00:01:28.950> overwhelming<00:01:29.659> so<00:01:30.659> without<00:01:31.140> some<00:01:31.680> specific

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
be overwhelming so without some specific

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.160 
be overwhelming so without some specific
supports<00:01:34.070> an<00:01:35.090> internet-enabled<00:01:36.170> computer

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
supports an internet-enabled computer

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.679 
supports an internet-enabled computer
can<00:01:37.950> be<00:01:37.979> overwhelming<00:01:38.790> in<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:38.939> classroom<00:01:39.479> and

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
can be overwhelming in the classroom and

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.929 
can be overwhelming in the classroom and
potentially<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.350> little<00:01:40.500> bit<00:01:40.710> dangerous

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.270 

another<00:01:45.079> disadvantage<00:01:46.079> as<00:01:46.500> computers<00:01:47.070> can

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
another disadvantage as computers can

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.649 
another disadvantage as computers can
waste<00:01:47.460> time<00:01:48.140> you<00:01:49.140> can<00:01:49.710> end<00:01:50.130> up<00:01:50.630> having<00:01:51.630> to

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
waste time you can end up having to

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.200 
waste time you can end up having to
compete<00:01:52.049> with<00:01:52.320> really<00:01:53.310> interesting<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.149> not

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
compete with really interesting but not

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.260 
compete with really interesting but not
very<00:01:54.890> effective<00:01:55.890> software<00:01:56.159> for<00:01:56.909> students

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
very effective software for students

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.429 
very effective software for students
attention<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:58.790> my<00:01:59.790> my<00:02:00.360> advice<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.990> choose

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
attention so my my advice is to choose

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.230 
attention so my my advice is to choose
software<00:02:01.890> really<00:02:02.130> carefully<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.090> do

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
software really carefully that you do

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.319 
software really carefully that you do
have<00:02:03.450> on<00:02:03.600> your<00:02:03.780> computers<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.439> your<00:02:04.469> classroom

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
have on your computers in your classroom

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.580 
have on your computers in your classroom
come<00:02:06.329> up<00:02:06.450> with<00:02:06.630> some<00:02:07.049> really<00:02:07.200> good<00:02:07.350> strategies

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
come up with some really good strategies

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.969 
come up with some really good strategies
for<00:02:08.250> using<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.759> internet<00:02:09.470> if<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.619> are<00:02:10.830> going

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
for using the internet if you are going

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.670 
for using the internet if you are going
to<00:02:11.039> be

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
to be

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.509 
to be
using<00:02:11.859> an<00:02:12.420> internet-enabled<00:02:13.739> computer<00:02:14.739> make

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
using an internet-enabled computer make

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.780 
using an internet-enabled computer make
sure<00:02:15.549> that<00:02:15.969> you<00:02:16.569> have<00:02:16.780> some<00:02:17.409> way<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.370> keep

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
sure that you have some way to keep

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.069
