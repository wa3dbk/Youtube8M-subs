their flexibility for the future which

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.280 
their flexibility for the future which
is<00:02:49.730> why<00:02:49.850> I<00:02:49.880> think<00:02:50.180> is<00:02:50.269> the<00:02:50.420> most<00:02:50.540> important<00:02:51.080> of

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
is why I think is the most important of

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.740 
is why I think is the most important of
course<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.580> Lakers<00:02:52.880> are<00:02:53.000> in<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.150> transition

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
course the Lakers are in the transition

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.479 
course the Lakers are in the transition
phase<00:02:53.930> right<00:02:54.140> now<00:02:54.200> so<00:02:54.980> there's<00:02:55.160> not<00:02:55.310> much<00:02:55.459> you

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
phase right now so there's not much you

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.380 
phase right now so there's not much you
could<00:02:55.700> do<00:02:55.819> about<00:02:55.850> that<00:02:56.590> however<00:02:57.590> I<00:02:58.010> do<00:02:58.580> still

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
could do about that however I do still

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.570 
could do about that however I do still
have<00:02:59.450> some<00:03:00.050> hope<00:03:00.410> that<00:03:00.440> Ed<00:03:00.950> Davis<00:03:01.220> could

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
have some hope that Ed Davis could

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.210 
have some hope that Ed Davis could
succeed<00:03:02.209> especially<00:03:02.780> on<00:03:03.319> this<00:03:03.440> Laker<00:03:03.739> squad

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
succeed especially on this Laker squad

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.000 
succeed especially on this Laker squad
because<00:03:04.880> currently<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:06.200> power<00:03:06.440> forwards<00:03:06.890> we

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
because currently the power forwards we

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.540 
because currently the power forwards we
have<00:03:07.250> on<00:03:07.489> our<00:03:07.519> roster<00:03:07.819> is<00:03:08.739> Julius<00:03:09.739> Randle<00:03:10.310> and

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
have on our roster is Julius Randle and

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.229 
have on our roster is Julius Randle and
oh<00:03:11.330> look<00:03:11.959> at<00:03:12.380> Davis<00:03:12.920> so<00:03:13.579> he's<00:03:13.730> gonna<00:03:13.850> get<00:03:14.030> a

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
oh look at Davis so he's gonna get a

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.840 
oh look at Davis so he's gonna get a
good<00:03:14.660> amount<00:03:14.840> of<00:03:15.200> minutes<00:03:15.470> maybe<00:03:15.850> possibly

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
good amount of minutes maybe possibly

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.360 
good amount of minutes maybe possibly
possibly<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:17.930> this<00:03:18.170> is<00:03:18.350> a<00:03:18.380> huge<00:03:18.860> bold

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
possibly and this is a huge bold

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.460 
possibly and this is a huge bold
prediction<00:03:20.030> it<00:03:20.690> could<00:03:20.840> be<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:21.049> most<00:03:21.200> of<00:03:21.380> his

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
prediction it could be the most of his

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.880 
prediction it could be the most of his
career<00:03:21.650> guys<00:03:22.010> and<00:03:22.390> if<00:03:23.390> that<00:03:23.930> happens<00:03:24.140> I<00:03:24.500> see<00:03:24.680> at
