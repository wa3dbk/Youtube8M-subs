something I'm going to sharpen a blade

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.259 
something I'm going to sharpen a blade
right<00:00:26.279> now<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.670> show<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:26.880> guys<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.240> mean

that's I think that's the best way to

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.550 
that's I think that's the best way to
explain<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.300> cheap<00:00:30.779> old<00:00:31.019> wooden

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
explain this is a cheap old wooden

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.060 
explain this is a cheap old wooden
handle<00:00:32.130> stainless<00:00:32.730> steel<00:00:32.940> knife<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.690> have

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
handle stainless steel knife that I have

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.889 
handle stainless steel knife that I have
that<00:00:35.070> uh<00:00:35.130> we<00:00:35.940> have<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.329> kitchen<00:00:36.510> but<00:00:36.809> it

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
that uh we have in the kitchen but it

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:48.799 
that uh we have in the kitchen but it
doesn't<00:00:37.170> get<00:00:37.290> easier<00:00:37.469> but<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.219> mean<00:00:47.809> that's

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
doesn't get easier but I mean that's

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.369 
doesn't get easier but I mean that's
dull<00:00:49.649> ok<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.270> want<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.660> make<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.050> very

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
dull ok and I want to make this a very

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.029 
dull ok and I want to make this a very
clear<00:00:52.949> but<00:00:53.390> I'm<00:00:54.390> going<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.629> put<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:54.960> down

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
clear but I'm going to put this down

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:09.020 
clear but I'm going to put this down
take<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.190> blade<00:01:07.130> so<00:01:08.130> I'm<00:01:08.310> up<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.490> ceramic

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
take the blade so I'm up the ceramic

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.730 
take the blade so I'm up the ceramic
doing<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.299> couple<00:01:09.630> but<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:10.170> feel<00:01:10.470> like<00:01:10.590> I've

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
doing a couple but I feel like I've

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.260 
doing a couple but I feel like I've
taken<00:01:10.950> off<00:01:11.220> enough<00:01:11.460> metal<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.790> start<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.150> new

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
taken off enough metal to start a new

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.310 
taken off enough metal to start a new
edge<00:01:16.189> and<00:01:17.189> already<00:01:17.549> now<00:01:18.080> another<00:01:19.080> piece<00:01:19.290> of

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
edge and already now another piece of

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.200 
edge and already now another piece of
paper<00:01:20.689> still<00:01:21.689> not<00:01:21.900> cutting<00:01:22.909> it's<00:01:23.909> gotten<00:01:24.180> a

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
paper still not cutting it's gotten a

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.270 
paper still not cutting it's gotten a
little<00:01:24.330> bit<00:01:24.570> sharper<00:01:24.960> not<00:01:25.140> much<00:01:25.409> but<00:01:25.830> I've<00:01:26.070> got

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
little bit sharper not much but I've got

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:39.150 
little bit sharper not much but I've got
another<00:01:26.520> truck

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.850 

now<00:01:40.160> we're<00:01:40.400> to<00:01:40.550> fight<00:01:40.790> it<00:01:40.940> with<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.180> ceramics

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
now we're to fight it with the ceramics

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:54.960 
now we're to fight it with the ceramics
and<00:01:42.860> you<00:01:43.040> can<00:01:43.220> hear<00:01:43.460> it<00:01:43.490> cleaning<00:01:43.910> up<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.240> edge

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.670 

well<00:01:55.970> I<00:01:56.120> find<00:01:56.450> it<00:01:56.600> it's<00:01:56.840> a<00:01:56.990> lot<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.200> trick<00:01:57.530> to

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
well I find it it's a lot the trick to

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.430 
well I find it it's a lot the trick to
it<00:01:57.740> is<00:01:57.830> the<00:01:58.010> one<00:01:58.040> or<00:01:58.670> two<00:01:58.850> last<00:01:59.210> times<00:01:59.600> on<00:01:59.960> the

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
it is the one or two last times on the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.100 
it is the one or two last times on the
other<00:02:00.790> side<00:02:01.790> tonight<00:02:02.000> oh<00:02:02.560> yeah<00:02:04.240> now<00:02:05.240> let's

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.450 
other side tonight oh yeah now let's
take<00:02:06.290> off<00:02:06.440> these<00:02:06.590> metal<00:02:06.890> files<00:02:07.070> because<00:02:07.370> I

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
take off these metal files because I

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.370 
take off these metal files because I
like<00:02:07.670> my<00:02:07.850> cases<00:02:08.270> and<00:02:08.480> my<00:02:08.570> mom<00:02:08.780> will<00:02:08.929> beat<00:02:09.140> me<00:02:09.260> up

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
like my cases and my mom will beat me up

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
if I do that that is paper being cut by

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.060 
if I do that that is paper being cut by
this<00:02:25.670> doubled<00:02:26.300> knife<00:02:26.570> but<00:02:27.170> yeah<00:02:27.350> look<00:02:27.740> I<00:02:27.920> mean

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
this is a razor sharp right now but you

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.720 
this is a razor sharp right now but you
guys<00:02:32.720> saw<00:02:33.110> what<00:02:33.500> it<00:02:33.590> was<00:02:33.620> doing<00:02:33.950> a<00:02:34.280> minute<00:02:34.520> ago

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
guys saw what it was doing a minute ago

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.420 
guys saw what it was doing a minute ago
it<00:02:34.970> could<00:02:35.420> not<00:02:35.750> slice<00:02:36.410> this<00:02:36.680> caper<00:02:36.950> there<00:02:37.310> was

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
it could not slice this caper there was

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.490 
it could not slice this caper there was
no<00:02:37.730> way<00:02:37.970> in<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.240> world<00:02:38.360> thought<00:02:39.110> it<00:02:39.260> was<00:02:39.350> going

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
no way in the world thought it was going

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.260 
no way in the world thought it was going
to<00:02:39.530> slice<00:02:39.740> that<00:02:39.950> paper<00:02:40.250> can<00:02:40.820> I<00:02:40.910> spend<00:02:41.150> more

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
to slice that paper can I spend more

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.390 
to slice that paper can I spend more
time<00:02:41.330> in<00:02:41.510> making<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:42.080> sharp<00:02:42.320> course<00:02:42.830> I<00:02:43.010> can<00:02:43.250> I

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
time in making a sharp course I can I

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.000 
time in making a sharp course I can I
mean<00:02:43.489> I<00:02:43.580> could<00:02:43.760> put<00:02:43.910> some<00:02:44.090> really<00:02:44.300> nice<00:02:44.480> light

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
mean I could put some really nice light

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.920 
mean I could put some really nice light
slides<00:02:46.010> through<00:02:46.430> there<00:02:46.640> to<00:02:47.300> really<00:02:47.480> refine

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
slides through there to really refine
