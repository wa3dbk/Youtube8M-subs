00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:12.799
 preview would turn the psychosis of poland we end up with superior 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.449
 qatari driver 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:15.569
 so we'll see 

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:18.569
 August 1 to 10 so I put the accessories 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.659
 with the simply the school that is not the right color is only used to 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:23.460
 nothing 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.539
 you have 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.480
 and if main barrel 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.829
 below 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:30.079
 latourelle 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.079
 in one of the reactors 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.190
 we see the logos 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.560
 good for sure the color blue 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.030
 this version light not terrible it must be said that it could not be better 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.480
 recedes 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.980
 report allowed to make the choice it may be better or worse for 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.930
 have something to drink 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.930
 you have six exit landing gear 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.850
 here at roman 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.240
 maybe not a derivative of very far in the 15 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.620
 according to him 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.680
 europe where the logo here 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.680
 haversack 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.000
 so that if he possessed weapons level you can also put them 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.930
 above 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.550
 otherwise with the landing gear 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.540
 That's what happens 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.770
 and a kind of stutter afraid of you I do not know what 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.990
 contest you something for them 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.870
 the big logo in Togo 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.510
 always the logo 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.510
 at rest simply why put a star 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.330
 we will leave actors so simple and well that's a pity against small 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.970
 duel 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.380
 the landing gear here 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.380
 in the front the Germans 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.240
 so the little people design the smile once in the program is funny 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.280
 but the model rolls the exodus to dream a little 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.510
 that's why its transformation 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.210
 so we're already starting from the back 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.829
 so double hinge 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.119
 we fill 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.179
 Why 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.179
 we spread our legs 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:16.769
 we are in my alignment 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.729
 so 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:21.729
 in the landing gear it will be hard angers 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:25.999
 following a chaos the tour operators dismiss them 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:27.789
 so very simple 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:29.409
 no need to take the lead 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:32.359
 here is kÃ¼nzler want it 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:34.789
 you who were 

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:36.749
 we are in the right direction 

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:39.749
 in my alignment and then we are good 

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:42.029
 the site 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:45.059
 it is transformed so it is better to really 

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:46.789
 in vain 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:49.849
 know that if honest ken on that side the head too 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.949
 for the basin he fixes 

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:56.799
 you can put them weapons 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:57.950
 boat style 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:58.759
 moore 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:01.759
 you shoot at them 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.159
 but here too it's pretty simple and just cleared 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:09.689
 the reactors 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.769
 to learn the arms 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.059
 it's gone to discard them 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:16.219
 to actually release the legs 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:19.219
 she will resume not forgetting 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:23.379
 you shift from behind with the hinge 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.489
 you turn the basin so that it is in the right direction 

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:28.899
 we do not move away 

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:30.649
 word games 

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:32.649
 see here 

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:36.109
 the banking feet the cockpit they form a foot 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.109
 and the heavy machine gun 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.009
 yet the elbow 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:42.859
 to have it properly 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:44.459
 you see like a glove 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.989
 reactors it's not terrible no 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.300
 here one at the hinges system 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.809
 to clear the head up 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:53.049
 you click 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.879
 you turn 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:56.899
 There you go 

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:58.789
 it's a little further 

00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:02.529
 so to you have you got this theme of machine guns did a little bit of the net but 

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:04.909
 good a little bit insects 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:06.079
 spokesman 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.359
 we do not change 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:09.129
 to have this time 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.129
 the basin 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.400
 so we can also put his hand 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.099
 who do you have below zero 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:23.099
 to deal with the gones 

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:31.080
 so a bit more complex a drawing not too far so we see again 

00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:32.409
 young people 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:33.610
 you have 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.990
 here a hinge 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.990
 here 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.099
 we clear the legs when you have a stop 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:43.460
 do not force too much then 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.499
 such 

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:47.770
 behind the scenes 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.060
 see both sides 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.889
 rotate or disengage 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.060
 the heels except to lose it like that a better stability 

00:04:57.309 --> 00:05:00.309
 this spring and that side 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.180
 so 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.220
 you do not turn that it's to vote his favor you turn 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.860
 so 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.610
 he can swing over and again a hinge here 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.949
 a little peck the policeman while he does not hold any investment 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:20.249
 then mayor in person we flap 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:22.969
 it's melee for the panels on the air 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:24.689
 by the way I do not care at all 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:25.729
 good 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.889
 the morning of the nail polish I do not know to be able to 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:32.080
 Ford expects more 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.139
 the clip it would be a ravine 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:37.789
 you have good results at clips c 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:40.339
 so we have in alignment 

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:42.400
 here too 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.400
 we're done with that part 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:48.659
 save lens 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:51.870
 without actually inquiring the shoulders 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.129
 this contest is deployed 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:57.900
 on the first card 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.850
 what you have a small cargo ship that flaps its wings in there to be able to 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.800
 curly 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.809
 messi 

00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:07.969
 side forests 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:11.240
 if everything will not be better 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.629
 on track with 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:15.629
 the body part opts the head 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:17.699
 p as well 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:20.699
 he is ready 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:23.529
 gold the head 

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:25.029
 6% 

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:28.259
 as to both 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:30.369
 v more word games 

00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:33.369
 if the link 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.740
 about movements 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.039
 basilica here 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:46.039
 we find the elbow 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:48.939
 and we got you on the site 

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:51.089
 so on the most basic 

00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:54.089
 it's good it's still going to be ok again 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.089
 when everything but what 

00:06:56.089 --> 00:06:57.869
 simple anyway 

00:06:57.869 --> 00:07:00.869
 so here we go now to the combination 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.960
 good why 

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:11.589
 5 

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:12.489
 this season
