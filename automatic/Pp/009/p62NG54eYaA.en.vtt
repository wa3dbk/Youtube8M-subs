00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
forward 206 209 this one's a bit weird

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.979 
forward 206 209 this one's a bit weird
though<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.890> has<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.189> inverted<00:00:32.700> forks<00:00:33.149> so

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
though it has the inverted forks so

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.240 
though it has the inverted forks so
people<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.440> aren't<00:00:34.559> really<00:00:34.710> bike<00:00:34.980> people

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
people that aren't really bike people

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.060 
people that aren't really bike people
the<00:00:36.120> forks<00:00:36.540> are<00:00:36.630> upside<00:00:37.050> down<00:00:37.290> from<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.950> way

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
the forks are upside down from the way

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.799 
the forks are upside down from the way
they<00:00:38.280> used<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.550> do<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:39.030> puts<00:00:39.329> more<00:00:39.570> weight

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
they used to do it it puts more weight

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.360 
they used to do it it puts more weight
up<00:00:40.200> top<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.100> less<00:00:41.730> unsprung<00:00:42.360> weight<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:43.079> it's

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
up top and less unsprung weight so it's

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.590 
up top and less unsprung weight so it's
why<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.399> think<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.030> don't<00:00:45.090> know<00:00:45.239> if<00:00:45.360> I'm<00:00:45.450> right

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
why I think I don't know if I'm right

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.279 
why I think I don't know if I'm right
that's<00:00:45.840> what<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.079> think<00:00:47.450> so<00:00:48.450> yeah<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:48.989> blue
