but now he sees it he sees what's going

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.389 
but now he sees it he sees what's going
on<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.390> JYP<00:01:43.079> already<00:01:43.649> knows<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.159> gist

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
on and JYP already knows that the gist

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.760 
on and JYP already knows that the gist
is<00:01:44.549> up<00:01:44.700> there<00:01:45.090> comes<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.540> double<00:01:46.229> gate<00:01:46.470> no

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.319 
cybernetics core just yet gas was taken
though<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:50.040> he<00:01:50.159> still<00:01:50.399> has<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.700> gas<00:01:50.880> here<00:01:51.149> and

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
though so he still has the gas here and

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.819 
though so he still has the gas here and
there<00:01:51.540> we<00:01:51.630> have<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.780> cybernetics<00:01:52.409> core<00:01:52.619> and

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
there we have the cybernetics core and

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.620 
there we have the cybernetics core and
at<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.340> point<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.850> course<00:01:53.939> here<00:01:54.420> knows

at this point of course here knows

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.359 
at this point of course here knows
exactly<00:01:55.110> what<00:01:55.439> he's<00:01:55.530> up<00:01:55.680> against<00:01:55.950> he's

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
exactly what he's up against he's

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.190 
exactly what he's up against he's
dropping<00:01:56.790> his<00:01:56.820> own<00:01:57.090> cybernetics<00:01:57.689> core<00:01:57.899> but<00:01:57.990> he

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
dropping his own cybernetics core but he

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.200 
dropping his own cybernetics core but he
is<00:01:58.350> still<00:01:58.590> missing<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.430> second<00:01:59.909> gate<00:02:00.060> so

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
is still missing that second gate so

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.819 
is still missing that second gate so
it's<00:02:00.329> gonna<00:02:00.420> be<00:02:00.570> two<00:02:00.750> gateways<00:02:01.020> against<00:02:01.619> one

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
it's gonna be two gateways against one

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.469 
it's gonna be two gateways against one
and<00:02:02.280> we're<00:02:02.399> gonna<00:02:02.520> see<00:02:02.640> here<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.180> all<00:02:03.329> the

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
and we're gonna see here and all the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.060 
and we're gonna see here and all the
chronal<00:02:03.810> energy<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:04.290> we<00:02:04.409> already<00:02:04.710> saw<00:02:04.860> for

chronal energy that we already saw for

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.550 
chronal energy that we already saw for

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
and let's see how that's going to work

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.729 
and let's see how that's going to work

out micro is going to be super important

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.710 
out micro is going to be super important

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
Parliament just dies that would be

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.830 
Parliament just dies that would be
absolutely<00:02:28.130> larious<00:02:28.730> for<00:02:29.180> now<00:02:29.269> it's<00:02:29.569> going<00:02:29.780> to

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
absolutely larious for now it's going to

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.809 
absolutely larious for now it's going to
be<00:02:29.989> the<00:02:30.260> stalker<00:02:30.650> chrono<00:02:31.130> boost<00:02:31.400> that<00:02:31.519> we<00:02:31.640> see

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
be the stalker chrono boost that we see

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.280 
be the stalker chrono boost that we see
there<00:02:32.030> another<00:02:32.269> pilot<00:02:32.569> in<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.840> main<00:02:33.080> base

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
there another pilot in the main base

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.610 
there another pilot in the main base
already<00:02:33.590> being<00:02:33.890> built<00:02:34.190> here<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:34.640> we<00:02:35.360> have<00:02:35.620> JYP

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
already being built here and we have JYP

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.170 
already being built here and we have JYP
already<00:02:37.099> with<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.310> two<00:02:37.430> gates<00:02:37.670> going<00:02:37.970> for<00:02:38.120> the

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
already with the two gates going for the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.850 
already with the two gates going for the
double<00:02:38.300> stalker<00:02:38.720> here<00:02:39.080> and<00:02:39.230> that's<00:02:39.590> something

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
double stalker here and that's something

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.800 
double stalker here and that's something
that<00:02:40.130> his<00:02:40.700> opponent<00:02:41.180> just<00:02:41.299> simply<00:02:41.600> doesn't

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
that his opponent just simply doesn't

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.240 
that his opponent just simply doesn't
have<00:02:41.930> so<00:02:42.200> it's<00:02:42.350> all<00:02:42.500> going<00:02:42.709> to<00:02:42.739> be<00:02:42.799> about<00:02:42.980> how

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
have so it's all going to be about how

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.190 
have so it's all going to be about how
much<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.610> initial<00:02:43.940> units<00:02:44.269> can<00:02:44.420> do<00:02:44.600> how<00:02:44.989> much

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
much the initial units can do how much

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.780 
much the initial units can do how much
damage<00:02:45.380> double<00:02:45.890> pilon<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.340> protect<00:02:46.640> those

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
damage double pilon to protect those

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.520 
damage double pilon to protect those
structures<00:02:47.299> even<00:02:47.630> dropping<00:02:47.840> a<00:02:48.019> third<00:02:48.290> one

pretty smart play the mothership boys

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.120 
pretty smart play the mothership boys
out<00:02:50.569> there<00:02:50.600> as<00:02:50.989> well<00:02:51.170> once<00:02:51.620> it<00:02:51.769> has<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.010> energy

for photon overcharge JYP is going to be
in<00:02:54.470> some<00:02:54.650> trouble<00:02:54.680> and<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.400> problem<00:02:55.580> is<00:02:55.849> if

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
in some trouble and the problem is if

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.580 
in some trouble and the problem is if
this<00:02:56.209> doesn't<00:02:56.569> work<00:02:56.750> he's<00:02:56.989> going<00:02:57.170> to<00:02:57.230> lose<00:02:57.349> all

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
this doesn't work he's going to lose all

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.199 
this doesn't work he's going to lose all
of<00:02:57.650> these<00:02:58.040> units<00:02:58.340> at<00:02:58.519> the<00:02:58.610> front<00:02:58.849> and<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.030> game

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
of these units at the front and the game

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.940 
of these units at the front and the game
is<00:02:59.450> basically<00:02:59.720> going<00:03:00.019> to<00:03:00.080> be<00:03:00.140> over<00:03:00.410> so<00:03:00.769> he

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
is basically going to be over so he

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.100 
is basically going to be over so he
needs<00:03:01.250> to<00:03:01.489> make<00:03:01.640> this<00:03:01.819> count<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.599> he<00:03:02.750> needs<00:03:02.989> to

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
needs to make this count and he needs to

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.600 
needs to make this count and he needs to

couple of probes here at least so that's

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:46.960 
couple of probes here at least so that's
something<00:03:45.920> that<00:03:46.040> you<00:03:46.220> can<00:03:46.370> achieve<00:03:46.489> but<00:03:46.850> he

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
something that you can achieve but he

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.759 
something that you can achieve but he
