but truthfully anybody can do it just
takes<00:00:21.409> it<00:00:21.470> up<00:00:21.560> some<00:00:22.400> practice<00:00:22.939> you<00:00:23.239> know<00:00:23.679> so

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:24.679 
takes it up some practice you know so

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.040 
takes it up some practice you know so
before<00:00:25.609> I<00:00:25.789> begin<00:00:26.179> now<00:00:26.480> I'm<00:00:26.630> telling<00:00:26.839> you<00:00:26.960> how

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
before I begin now I'm telling you how

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.239 
before I begin now I'm telling you how
to<00:00:27.079> solve<00:00:27.380> it<00:00:27.640> get<00:00:28.640> it<00:00:28.759> out<00:00:28.880> a<00:00:28.909> couple<00:00:29.210> of<00:00:29.689> stuff

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:30.249 
to solve it get it out a couple of stuff

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:32.759 
to solve it get it out a couple of stuff
that<00:00:31.249> isn't<00:00:31.429> born<00:00:31.759> out<00:00:32.180> of<00:00:32.239> what<00:00:32.419> you<00:00:32.539> can

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:32.769 
that isn't born out of what you can

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:42.069 
that isn't born out of what you can
learn<00:00:33.769> how<00:00:33.949> to<00:00:34.010> solve<00:00:40.600> well<00:00:41.600> i<00:00:41.629> guess<00:00:41.899> i<00:00:42.019> would

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
learn how to solve well i guess i would

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.819 
learn how to solve well i guess i would
start<00:00:42.739> off<00:00:42.949> from<00:00:43.250> talking<00:00:43.670> about<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:44.829> color

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
start off from talking about the color

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.700 
start off from talking about the color
that<00:00:46.129> a<00:00:46.190> Rubik's<00:00:46.550> keeping<00:00:46.910> that<00:00:47.350> what<00:00:48.350> about

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
that a Rubik's keeping that what about

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.630 
that a Rubik's keeping that what about
what<00:00:49.070> about<00:00:49.100> roots<00:00:49.460> you<00:00:49.730> um<00:00:51.280> this<00:00:52.280> cube<00:00:52.489> has

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
what about roots you um this cube has

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.389 
what about roots you um this cube has
six<00:00:53.449> colors<00:00:53.809> different<00:00:54.769> colors<00:00:55.149> to<00:00:56.149> stinkups

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
six colors different colors to stinkups

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.459 
six colors different colors to stinkups
on<00:00:58.399> each<00:00:58.609> face<00:00:58.850> there<00:00:59.329> are<00:00:59.449> six<00:00:59.690> face<00:00:59.899> Oh<00:01:00.140> six

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
on each face there are six face Oh six

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.500 
on each face there are six face Oh six
colors<00:01:00.800> and<00:01:01.960> so<00:01:02.960> when<00:01:03.199> the<00:01:03.350> cupid<00:01:03.739> solve<00:01:04.010> their

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
colors and so when the cupid solve their

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.100 
colors and so when the cupid solve their
particular<00:01:05.650> color<00:01:06.650> scheme<00:01:07.250> that<00:01:07.990> through<00:01:08.990> if

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
particular color scheme that through if

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.970 
particular color scheme that through if
you<00:01:09.260> have<00:01:10.120> the<00:01:11.120> original<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.140> Rio<00:01:12.530> Rubik's

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:12.980 
you have the original the Rio Rubik's

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:19.770 
you have the original the Rio Rubik's
Cube<00:01:13.220> will<00:01:13.760> have<00:01:14.230> red<00:01:16.300> green<00:01:17.950> orange<00:01:18.950> blue

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
Cube will have red green orange blue

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.500 
Cube will have red green orange blue
yellow<00:01:22.420> what<00:01:24.040> basically<00:01:25.040> a<00:01:25.240> yellow<00:01:26.240> is

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
yellow what basically a yellow is

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.820 
yellow what basically a yellow is
opposite<00:01:27.110> white<00:01:27.580> orange<00:01:28.580> is<00:01:28.760> opposite<00:01:29.240> red

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
opposite white orange is opposite red

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.330 
opposite white orange is opposite red
blue<00:01:30.830> is<00:01:31.070> off<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.490> cream<00:01:32.530> um<00:01:33.530> they're<00:01:34.160> also

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
blue is off the cream um they're also

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.980 
blue is off the cream um they're also
another<00:01:34.930> may<00:01:35.930> another<00:01:36.380> main<00:01:36.800> scheme<00:01:37.630> and<00:01:38.630> I<00:01:38.930> is

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
another may another main scheme and I is

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.800 
another may another main scheme and I is
probably<00:01:39.410> the<00:01:39.560> Japanese<00:01:40.460> scheme<00:01:41.270> Michalek

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
probably the Japanese scheme Michalek

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.970 
probably the Japanese scheme Michalek
which<00:01:42.650> are<00:01:42.830> basically<00:01:43.160> they<00:01:43.550> swap<00:01:44.560> yellow<00:01:45.560> and

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
which are basically they swap yellow and

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.450 
which are basically they swap yellow and
blue<00:01:46.610> so<00:01:47.180> blue<00:01:47.600> is<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.930> opposite<00:01:48.500> of<00:01:48.620> white

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
blue so blue is the opposite of white

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.810 
blue so blue is the opposite of white
and<00:01:49.790> creamy<00:01:50.240> opposite<00:01:50.660> of<00:01:50.780> yellow<00:01:51.610> so<00:01:52.610> check

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
and creamy opposite of yellow so check

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.780 
and creamy opposite of yellow so check
check<00:01:53.630> check<00:01:53.660> for<00:01:53.960> what<00:01:54.410> you're<00:01:54.590> doing<00:01:55.520> in

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
check check for what you're doing in

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.990 
check check for what you're doing in
your<00:01:55.820> room<00:01:55.940> skew<00:01:56.300> by<00:01:56.780> looking<00:01:57.140> at<00:01:57.320> the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
your room skew by looking at the

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.880 
your room skew by looking at the
centerpieces<00:01:59.110> center<00:02:00.110> makes<00:02:00.290> even<00:02:00.440> a<00:02:00.590> hue<00:02:00.860> is

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
centerpieces center makes even a hue is

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.560 
centerpieces center makes even a hue is
not<00:02:01.130> stop<00:02:01.370> you<00:02:01.520> look<00:02:01.700> at<00:02:01.790> the<00:02:01.880> cemeteries<00:02:02.210> oh

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
not stop you look at the cemeteries oh

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.670 
not stop you look at the cemeteries oh
it's<00:02:03.200> going<00:02:03.320> to<00:02:03.380> be<00:02:03.440> how<00:02:03.680> how<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.580> rest<00:02:05.090> of<00:02:05.210> the

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
it's going to be how how the rest of the

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.919 
it's going to be how how the rest of the
going<00:02:05.890> to<00:02:05.950> be<00:02:06.040> color<00:02:07.020> so<00:02:08.550> also<00:02:09.550> if<00:02:09.880> that<00:02:10.750> means

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
going to be color so also if that means

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.890 
going to be color so also if that means
that<00:02:11.050> if<00:02:11.170> you're<00:02:11.320> trying<00:02:11.590> to<00:02:11.800> solve<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:13.420> you

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
that if you're trying to solve you you

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.560 
that if you're trying to solve you you
don't<00:02:14.080> want<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.380> do<00:02:14.500> like<00:02:14.940> white<00:02:15.940> face<00:02:16.270> any

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
don't want to do like white face any

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.360 
don't want to do like white face any
kind<00:02:16.780> of<00:02:16.810> do<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:16.960> yellow<00:02:17.200> face<00:02:17.470> beside<00:02:17.680> it's<00:02:18.250> not

kind of do a yellow face beside it's not

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.700 
kind of do a yellow face beside it's not
going<00:02:18.520> to<00:02:18.640> happen<00:02:18.990> it's<00:02:19.990> just<00:02:20.350> no<00:02:20.680> it's

going to happen it's just no it's

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.920 
going to happen it's just no it's
impossible<00:02:21.100> just<00:02:21.730> unless<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:22.330> rearrange<00:02:22.870> the
