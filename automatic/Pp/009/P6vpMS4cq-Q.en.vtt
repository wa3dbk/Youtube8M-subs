00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.590 
who's brave with a really good sense of
balance<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.370> they<00:02:05.729> know<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.090> circuit<00:02:06.479> like

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
balance and they know the circuit like

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.080 
balance and they know the circuit like
the<00:02:06.690> back<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:06.870> their<00:02:07.020> hand<00:02:07.290> so<00:02:07.820> yeah<00:02:08.820> they<00:02:08.970> did

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
the back of their hand so yeah they did

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.270 
the back of their hand so yeah they did
a<00:02:09.119> cracking<00:02:09.570> job<00:02:09.600> and<00:02:10.019> it's<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.830> little<00:02:11.160> bit

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
a cracking job and it's a little bit

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.460 
a cracking job and it's a little bit
different<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.790> riding<00:02:11.820> a<00:02:12.180> bike<00:02:12.390> they've<00:02:13.290> got

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
different to riding a bike they've got

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.560 
different to riding a bike they've got
to<00:02:13.590> control<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.280> momentum<00:02:14.790> of<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.090> car<00:02:15.299> but

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
to control the momentum of the car but

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.150 
to control the momentum of the car but
they've<00:02:15.720> got<00:02:15.930> good<00:02:16.350> lines<00:02:16.650> good

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
they've got good lines good

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.860 
they've got good lines good
understanding<00:02:17.459> and<00:02:17.970> most<00:02:18.299> importantly<00:02:18.780> a

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
understanding and most importantly a

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.860 
understanding and most importantly a
no-good<00:02:19.230> bravery<00:02:19.769> shaky<00:02:20.610> left<00:02:20.820> some<00:02:21.030> massive

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
no-good bravery shaky left some massive

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.780 
no-good bravery shaky left some massive
skid<00:02:22.230> marks<00:02:22.620> at<00:02:22.739> a<00:02:22.799> couple<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.250> corners<00:02:23.459> I

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
skid marks at a couple of corners I

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.210 
skid marks at a couple of corners I
think<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.420> car<00:02:24.600> some<00:02:24.900> sort<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.170> ESP<00:02:25.380> failure

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
think the car some sort of ESP failure

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.370 
think the car some sort of ESP failure
ended<00:02:26.489> up<00:02:26.610> doing<00:02:26.880> donuts<00:02:27.330> but<00:02:27.480> he's<00:02:27.989> got<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.230> bit

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
ended up doing donuts but he's got a bit

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.500 
ended up doing donuts but he's got a bit
of<00:02:28.470> previous<00:02:28.920> when<00:02:29.100> it<00:02:29.190> comes<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.580> cars<00:02:29.820> and<00:02:30.239> we

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
of previous when it comes to cars and we

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.630 
of previous when it comes to cars and we
had<00:02:30.660> heard<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:30.930> word<00:02:31.200> Lamborghini<00:02:32.070> mentioned

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
had heard the word Lamborghini mentioned

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.100 
had heard the word Lamborghini mentioned
in<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.820> couple<00:02:33.150> of<00:02:33.239> sentences<00:02:33.600> when<00:02:33.930> he<00:02:34.019> was

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
in a couple of sentences when he was

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.039 
in a couple of sentences when he was
talking<00:02:34.230> for<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.620> lad<00:02:34.799> so<00:02:35.600> yeah<00:02:36.600> I<00:02:36.660> think<00:02:36.780> he

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
talking for the lad so yeah I think he

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.140 
talking for the lad so yeah I think he
probably<00:02:37.080> did<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:37.769> quickest<00:02:38.250> lap<00:02:38.280> time<00:02:38.670> but

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
probably did the quickest lap time but

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.180 
probably did the quickest lap time but
they<00:02:39.299> all<00:02:39.450> did<00:02:39.690> well<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.170> pleasure<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:40.980> sit

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
they all did well and pleasure to sit

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.150 
they all did well and pleasure to sit
next<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.580> great<00:02:42.330> fun<00:02:42.600> I<00:02:42.840> mean<00:02:43.049> I'm<00:02:43.739> sure<00:02:43.799> if<00:02:44.070> you

experience<00:02:47.190> for<00:02:47.760> us<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.150> know<00:02:49.220> motorbikes

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
experience for us you know motorbikes

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.539 
experience for us you know motorbikes
and<00:02:50.640> race<00:02:50.790> circuits<00:02:51.269> go<00:02:51.450> together<00:02:51.630> like<00:02:51.870> I

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
and race circuits go together like I

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.979 
and race circuits go together like I
don't<00:02:53.549> know<00:02:53.640> bread<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.269> jam<00:02:54.450> for<00:02:54.510> us<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:54.959> know

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
don't know bread and jam for us you know

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.740 
don't know bread and jam for us you know
this<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.290> just<00:02:55.440> how<00:02:55.680> we<00:02:55.709> do<00:02:55.980> things<00:02:56.190> but<00:02:56.630> to<00:02:57.630> get

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
this is just how we do things but to get

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.240 
this is just how we do things but to get
the<00:02:57.810> opportunity<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:58.290> take<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.620> racetrack<00:02:58.889> and

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
the opportunity to take a racetrack and

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.440 
the opportunity to take a racetrack and
a<00:02:59.310> car<00:02:59.519> which<00:02:59.700> is<00:02:59.730> something<00:03:00.090> totally<00:03:00.239> alien

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
a car which is something totally alien

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.120 
a car which is something totally alien
and<00:03:00.989> not<00:03:01.079> only<00:03:01.169> that<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.380> good<00:03:01.590> car<00:03:01.799> as<00:03:01.950> well

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
the opposite so for us to get the

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.330 
the opposite so for us to get the
opportunity<00:03:09.500> to<00:03:09.530> drive<00:03:09.740> them<00:03:09.920> is<00:03:10.010> really

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340
