questions here in regards to fasting so

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.700 
questions here in regards to fasting so
the<00:00:40.260> first<00:00:40.530> one<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:41.269> I<00:00:42.269> trained<00:00:43.260> first<00:00:43.440> thing

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
the first one is I trained first thing

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.569 
the first one is I trained first thing
in<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.829> morning<00:00:44.250> at<00:00:44.400> 6am<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:46.309> all<00:00:47.309> I've

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
in the morning at 6am and all I've

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.259 
in the morning at 6am and all I've
learned<00:00:48.439> or<00:00:49.439> led<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.979> led<00:00:50.610> me<00:00:50.790> to<00:00:50.939> believe<00:00:50.970> that

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
learned or led to led me to believe that

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.840 
learned or led to led me to believe that
going<00:00:52.080> to<00:00:52.260> train<00:00:52.559> on<00:00:52.710> empty<00:00:53.070> stomach<00:00:53.519> would

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
going to train on empty stomach would

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.719 
going to train on empty stomach would
cure<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:55.049> body<00:00:55.290> to<00:00:55.559> consume<00:00:56.040> muscles<00:00:56.549> for

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:56.729 
cure the body to consume muscles for

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:59.000 
cure the body to consume muscles for
energy<00:00:57.119> so<00:00:57.360> basically<00:00:57.989> if<00:00:58.439> you<00:00:58.559> train<00:00:58.799> in<00:00:58.949> a

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
energy so basically if you train in a

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.759 
energy so basically if you train in a
fasted<00:00:59.460> state<00:00:59.930> your<00:01:00.930> body<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.290> going<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.439> use

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
fasted state your body is going to use

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.130 
fasted state your body is going to use
muscle<00:01:02.280> as<00:01:02.489> energy<00:01:03.299> all<00:01:03.659> right<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.080> it's

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
muscle as energy all right and it's

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.840 
muscle as energy all right and it's
going<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.379> burn<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.680> off<00:01:04.799> like<00:01:05.070> fat<00:01:05.369> all<00:01:05.670> right

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
going to burn it off like fat all right

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.060 
going to burn it off like fat all right
that's<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.600> freaking<00:01:07.140> myth<00:01:07.350> all<00:01:07.680> right<00:01:07.890> if

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
that's a freaking myth all right if

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.550 
that's a freaking myth all right if
you're<00:01:08.250> doing<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.820> correctly<00:01:09.080> okay<00:01:10.080> if<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.380> go

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
you're doing it correctly okay if you go

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.219 
you're doing it correctly okay if you go
in<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.950> you're<00:01:11.100> you're<00:01:11.850> constantly<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:13.020> low

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
in and you're you're constantly in a low

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.679 
in and you're you're constantly in a low
caloric<00:01:14.040> state<00:01:14.520> yes<00:01:14.850> your<00:01:15.119> body<00:01:15.299> will<00:01:15.509> start

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
caloric state yes your body will start

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.679 
caloric state yes your body will start
dipping<00:01:15.960> into<00:01:16.110> it's<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.770> muscle<00:01:17.579> mass<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.270> use

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
dipping into it's a muscle mass to use

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.480 
dipping into it's a muscle mass to use
as<00:01:18.840> energy<00:01:18.990> but<00:01:19.530> if<00:01:19.740> you're<00:01:19.890> fasting

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
as energy but if you're fasting

amount<00:03:50.140> of<00:03:50.320> ingredients<00:03:50.380> in<00:03:50.920> it<00:03:50.950> all<00:03:51.220> right

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
amount of ingredients in it all right

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.050 
amount of ingredients in it all right
you're<00:03:52.000> going<00:03:52.120> to<00:03:52.180> be<00:03:52.350> best<00:03:53.350> off<00:03:53.590> with<00:03:53.770> that

but<00:04:43.510> I've<00:04:43.750> never<00:04:43.990> had<00:04:44.230> to<00:04:44.320> do<00:04:44.470> this<00:04:44.500> but<00:04:44.920> that's

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
but I've never had to do this but that's

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.130 
but I've never had to do this but that's
just<00:04:45.340> my<00:04:45.520> idea<00:04:45.700> and<00:04:46.150> I<00:04:46.510> think<00:04:46.540> it<00:04:46.840> helped<00:04:47.020> you

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
out other than that you can always find

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.720 
out other than that you can always find
good<00:04:50.320> choices<00:04:50.650> at<00:04:50.980> restaurants<00:04:51.550> all<00:04:51.640> right
