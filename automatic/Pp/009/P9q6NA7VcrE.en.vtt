00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
look and so yeah to build it why just

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.560 
look and so yeah to build it why just
started<00:01:14.479> by<00:01:15.220> using<00:01:16.220> just<00:01:16.520> fence<00:01:16.729> posts<00:01:17.210> made

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
started by using just fence posts made

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.420 
started by using just fence posts made
throughout<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:19.040> entire<00:01:19.490> inside<00:01:20.240> ring<00:01:20.990> and

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
throughout the entire inside ring and

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.730 
throughout the entire inside ring and
then<00:01:22.510> outside<00:01:23.510> that<00:01:23.930> I<00:01:23.960> drew<00:01:24.229> the<00:01:24.380> outside

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
then outside that I drew the outside

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.950 
then outside that I drew the outside
ring<00:01:25.010> just<00:01:25.820> one<00:01:25.970> level<00:01:26.300> and<00:01:26.450> then<00:01:26.600> filled<00:01:26.840> it

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
ring just one level and then filled it

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.070 
ring just one level and then filled it
all<00:01:27.009> completely<00:01:28.009> in<00:01:28.220> with<00:01:28.460> fence<00:01:28.610> posts<00:01:29.080> and

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
all completely in with fence posts and

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.630 
all completely in with fence posts and
then<00:01:30.290> when<00:01:30.410> I<00:01:30.440> MC<00:01:30.710> idea<00:01:30.920> and<00:01:31.040> copy<00:01:31.190> and<00:01:31.280> pasted

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
then when I MC idea and copy and pasted

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.820 
then when I MC idea and copy and pasted
it<00:01:32.290> four<00:01:33.290> layers<00:01:33.850> and<00:01:34.850> then<00:01:35.500> for<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.590> fourth

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
it four layers and then for the fourth

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.230 
it four layers and then for the fourth
layer<00:01:37.040> i<00:01:37.280> hollowed<00:01:37.580> out<00:01:37.759> like<00:01:37.940> the<00:01:38.030> fourth

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
layer i hollowed out like the fourth

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.660 
layer i hollowed out like the fourth
layer<00:01:38.509> and<00:01:39.140> filled<00:01:39.380> it<00:01:39.500> in<00:01:39.530> with<00:01:39.619> when<00:01:40.580> the

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
layer and filled it in with when the

planks

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.730 

and<00:01:43.370> did<00:01:44.370> another<00:01:44.520> layer<00:01:44.940> above<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.260> or<00:01:46.260> fences

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
and did another layer above it or fences

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.910 
and did another layer above it or fences
down<00:01:46.950> as<00:01:47.400> railings<00:01:48.140> then<00:01:49.140> what<00:01:49.410> I<00:01:49.440> did<00:01:49.650> is<00:01:49.770> I

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
down as railings then what I did is I

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.600 
down as railings then what I did is I
made<00:01:50.160> where<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.030> fence<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.330> here<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:52.560> made<00:01:53.310> that

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
made where the fence is here I made that

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.990 
made where the fence is here I made that
sign<00:01:53.970> up<00:01:54.150> clay<00:01:54.540> on<00:01:54.990> top<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.440> then<00:01:56.370> I<00:01:56.580> copy<00:01:56.820> and

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
sign up clay on top and then I copy and

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.600 
sign up clay on top and then I copy and
pasted<00:01:57.300> it<00:01:57.390> on<00:01:57.450> MCEdit<00:01:58.050> so<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:59.040> right<00:01:59.160> to<00:01:59.460> this

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
pasted it on MCEdit so the right to this

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.660 
pasted it on MCEdit so the right to this
height<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.479> then<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.500> change<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.370> defense

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
height and then I change the defense

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.120 
height and then I change the defense
posts<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.600> it's<00:02:03.900> clay<00:02:04.140> some<00:02:04.440> obscure<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.070> i

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
posts and it's clay some obscure so i

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.280 
posts and it's clay some obscure so i
can<00:02:05.220> select<00:02:05.370> easily<00:02:05.880> but<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.570> can<00:02:06.690> do<00:02:06.810> find

them<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.500> place<00:02:07.530> on<00:02:08.009> MCEdit<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:09.209> i<00:02:09.240> found<00:02:09.450> all

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
them a place on MCEdit so i found all

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.810 
them a place on MCEdit so i found all
the<00:02:09.690> clay<00:02:09.869> based<00:02:10.320> offenses<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:11.130> then<00:02:11.730> why

them<00:02:16.620> up<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.890> this<00:02:17.160> top<00:02:17.610> block<00:02:17.820> here<00:02:18.090> they're

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
them up to this top block here they're

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.480 
them up to this top block here they're
the<00:02:18.840> limit<00:02:19.110> that<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.320> builder<00:02:19.770> can<00:02:20.070> read<00:02:20.280> so

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
the limit that the builder can read so

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.370 
the limit that the builder can read so
that's<00:02:20.700> just<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:21.000> higher<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.180> did<00:02:21.420> them<00:02:21.630> it<00:02:22.290> was

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
that's just the higher I did them it was

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.560 
that's just the higher I did them it was
convenient<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:25.200> then<00:02:25.350> I've<00:02:26.150> added<00:02:27.150> like<00:02:27.450> the

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
convenient and then I've added like the

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.050 
convenient and then I've added like the
roof<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.470> fences<00:02:28.920> on<00:02:29.010> it

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
roof and fences on it

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.350 
roof and fences on it
yeah<00:02:32.470> also<00:02:33.470> down<00:02:33.770> here<00:02:34.000> this<00:02:35.000> is<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.269> way

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
yeah also down here this is the way

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
how I'm going to do is the loops on top

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.680 
how I'm going to do is the loops on top
because<00:03:22.569> I<00:03:24.030> don't<00:03:25.030> know<00:03:25.180> how<00:03:25.420> I<00:03:25.450> could

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
because I don't know how I could

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.600 
because I don't know how I could
possibly<00:03:25.810> do<00:03:26.200> I<00:03:28.140> might<00:03:29.140> I<00:03:29.470> might<00:03:30.100> have<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.459> add

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
possibly do I might I might have to add

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.120 
possibly do I might I might have to add
a<00:03:30.640> block<00:03:31.030> so<00:03:31.390> it<00:03:31.480> looks<00:03:32.880> different<00:03:34.590> yeah<00:03:35.590> that

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
a block so it looks different yeah that

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.870 
a block so it looks different yeah that
looks<00:03:36.400> like<00:03:36.730> a<00:03:36.790> loop<00:03:37.060> and<00:03:37.330> use<00:03:38.320> that<00:03:38.760> not<00:03:39.760> sure

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
looks like a loop and use that not sure

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.760 
looks like a loop and use that not sure
what<00:03:40.000> black<00:03:40.180> I'll<00:03:40.330> do<00:03:40.450> before<00:03:40.840> but<00:03:41.140> I<00:03:41.380> don't

not sure I'm going to build it on the
same<00:04:18.239> map<00:04:18.810> so<00:04:19.080> it's<00:04:19.230> connected<00:04:19.709> but<00:04:20.450> i'm

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
same map so it's connected but i'm

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.890
