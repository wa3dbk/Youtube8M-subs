00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
at the back the bottom part the soul it

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.030 
at the back the bottom part the soul it
does<00:00:58.790> have<00:00:58.970> the<00:00:59.090> compressor<00:00:59.780> technology<00:01:00.200> at

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
does have the compressor technology at

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.400 
does have the compressor technology at
the<00:01:01.220> soul<00:01:01.489> at<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:02.360> bottom<00:01:02.630> part<00:01:02.660> and<00:01:03.050> what
