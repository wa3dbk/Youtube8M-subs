lee<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.860> saitek<00:02:24.310> is<00:02:24.520> compared<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.000> the

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
lee the saitek is compared to the

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.840 
lee the saitek is compared to the
logitech<00:02:25.600> so<00:02:25.840> if<00:02:26.770> i<00:02:26.860> take<00:02:27.040> did<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.280> good<00:02:27.400> job<00:02:27.460> as

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
logitech so if i take did a good job as

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.740 
logitech so if i take did a good job as
far<00:02:27.880> as<00:02:28.180> making<00:02:28.780> a<00:02:28.990> pretty<00:02:29.380> durable<00:02:29.620> keyboard

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
far as making a pretty durable keyboard

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.770 
far as making a pretty durable keyboard
now<00:02:31.750> there<00:02:31.930> are<00:02:31.960> some<00:02:32.050> cons<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.530> this<00:02:32.560> keyboard

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
now there are some cons to this keyboard

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.170 
now there are some cons to this keyboard
first<00:02:34.780> thing<00:02:35.020> that<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.830> tell<00:02:36.100> you<00:02:36.220> about<00:02:36.370> is<00:02:36.640> the

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
first thing that I tell you about is the

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.970 
first thing that I tell you about is the
media<00:02:37.600> display<00:02:38.080> keys<00:02:38.290> are<00:02:38.500> pretty<00:02:38.740> hard<00:02:38.920> to

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
media display keys are pretty hard to

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.060 
media display keys are pretty hard to
press<00:02:39.220> down<00:02:39.870> certainly<00:02:40.870> harder<00:02:41.170> than<00:02:41.590> the

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
press down certainly harder than the

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.700 
press down certainly harder than the
Logitech<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:42.850> of<00:02:42.910> course<00:02:43.120> on<00:02:43.270> no<00:02:44.140> logitech

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
Logitech and of course on no logitech

Logitech and of course on no logitech
fanboy<00:02:45.190> I<00:02:45.430> mean<00:02:45.640> I<00:02:45.670> like<00:02:45.850> logitech<00:02:46.300> products

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
fanboy I mean I like logitech products

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.850 
fanboy I mean I like logitech products
but<00:02:46.840> I'm<00:02:46.960> just<00:02:47.110> kind<00:02:47.260> of<00:02:47.290> giving<00:02:47.470> you<00:02:47.590> a<00:02:47.620> point

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
but I'm just kind of giving you a point

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.970 
but I'm just kind of giving you a point
of<00:02:47.920> reference<00:02:47.980> here<00:02:49.410> logitech<00:02:50.410> is<00:02:50.530> just<00:02:50.800> a<00:02:50.860> lot

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
of reference here logitech is just a lot

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.810 
of reference here logitech is just a lot
softer<00:02:51.310> to<00:02:51.790> work<00:02:51.940> with<00:02:52.620> in<00:02:53.620> terms<00:02:53.770> of<00:02:53.920> keys<00:02:54.250> and

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
softer to work with in terms of keys and

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.230 
softer to work with in terms of keys and
get<00:02:55.030> a<00:02:55.090> press<00:02:55.300> down<00:02:55.480> father<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:57.640> get<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.970> you

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
get a press down father to get the you

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.120 
get a press down father to get the you
know<00:02:58.330> key<00:02:58.570> displayed<00:02:58.960> in<00:02:59.050> the<00:02:59.110> screen<00:02:59.440> it's<00:03:00.040> a

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
know key displayed in the screen it's a

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.500 
know key displayed in the screen it's a
little<00:03:00.310> more<00:03:00.400> effort<00:03:00.580> in<00:03:00.820> terms<00:03:00.880> of<00:03:01.060> typing<00:03:01.420> as

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
little more effort in terms of typing as

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.110 
little more effort in terms of typing as
compared<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:01.990> logitech<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:03.700> other<00:03:03.880> thing

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
compared to the logitech the other thing

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.360 
compared to the logitech the other thing
you'll<00:03:04.270> notice<00:03:04.450> is<00:03:04.780> this<00:03:05.500> keyboards<00:03:06.040> a<00:03:06.130> lot

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
you'll notice is this keyboards a lot

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:14.550 
you'll notice is this keyboards a lot
louder<00:03:06.580> than<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.060> logitech

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.410 

so<00:03:15.560> if<00:03:15.860> you're<00:03:16.519> in<00:03:16.670> a<00:03:16.760> noise<00:03:17.060> sensitive

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
so if you're in a noise sensitive

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.059 
so if you're in a noise sensitive
environment<00:03:17.930> I<00:03:18.079> wouldn't<00:03:18.590> recommend<00:03:18.829> this

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
environment I wouldn't recommend this

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.589 
environment I wouldn't recommend this
keyboard<00:03:20.290> last<00:03:21.290> thing<00:03:21.560> is<00:03:21.939> well<00:03:22.939> second<00:03:23.540> last

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
keyboard last thing is well second last

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.459 
keyboard last thing is well second last
thing<00:03:24.790> this<00:03:25.790> keyboard<00:03:26.180> probably<00:03:26.780> won't<00:03:27.019> play

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:27.469 
thing this keyboard probably won't play

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:29.860 
thing this keyboard probably won't play
well<00:03:27.709> with<00:03:28.329> motherboards<00:03:29.329> that<00:03:29.480> are<00:03:29.599> older

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
well with motherboards that are older

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.309 
well with motherboards that are older
for<00:03:30.439> example<00:03:30.769> i<00:03:30.799> get<00:03:31.010> off<00:03:31.099> foxconn<00:03:31.930> socket<00:03:32.930> 939

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
for example i get off foxconn socket 939

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.479 
for example i get off foxconn socket 939
motherboard<00:03:34.840> that<00:03:35.840> i<00:03:35.870> was<00:03:36.079> using<00:03:36.319> this<00:03:36.500> saitek

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
motherboard that i was using this saitek

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.899 
motherboard that i was using this saitek
on<00:03:37.670> just<00:03:37.909> for<00:03:38.829> testing<00:03:39.829> and<00:03:40.010> i<00:03:40.069> couldn't<00:03:40.819> get

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:40.909 
on just for testing and i couldn't get

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:44.530 
on just for testing and i couldn't get
into<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.060> bias<00:03:41.299> with<00:03:41.599> it<00:03:42.099> so<00:03:43.329> let's<00:03:44.329> see<00:03:44.450> if

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
into the bias with it so let's see if

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.149 
into the bias with it so let's see if
you've<00:03:44.659> got<00:03:44.689> an<00:03:44.870> older<00:03:45.139> motherboard<00:03:45.590> probably

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 
you've got an older motherboard probably

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.429 
you've got an older motherboard probably
like<00:03:46.519> a<00:03:46.579> socket<00:03:47.000> 939<00:03:47.420> base<00:03:47.900> you<00:03:48.139> might<00:03:48.290> have

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:48.439 
like a socket 939 base you might have

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:50.949 
like a socket 939 base you might have
some<00:03:48.620> problems<00:03:49.099> with<00:03:49.370> a<00:03:50.269> keyboard<00:03:50.510> just

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
some problems with a keyboard just

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.569 
some problems with a keyboard just
getting<00:03:51.200> into<00:03:51.379> the<00:03:51.409> bias<00:03:51.680> but<00:03:51.950> it's<00:03:52.099> okay<00:03:52.370> once

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
getting into the bias but it's okay once

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.629 
getting into the bias but it's okay once
you<00:03:52.669> get<00:03:52.849> in<00:03:52.939> Windows<00:03:54.250> PCs<00:03:55.250> that<00:03:55.370> were<00:03:55.459> made

you get in Windows PCs that were made

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.009 
you get in Windows PCs that were made

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
from the last few years shouldn't have

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.809 
from the last few years shouldn't have
any<00:03:57.139> problems<00:03:57.560> with<00:03:59.590> lastly<00:04:00.590> then<00:04:01.459> comes<00:04:01.669> with

any problems with lastly then comes with

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.059 
any problems with lastly then comes with
a<00:04:01.849> one-year<00:04:02.150> warranty<00:04:02.180> I<00:04:02.750> don't<00:04:03.709> think<00:04:03.769> you're
