00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
really going to help slow that rate of

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.539 
really going to help slow that rate of
over<00:01:52.829> pronation

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
over pronation

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.480 
over pronation
and<00:01:55.329> when<00:01:55.450> you<00:01:55.509> look<00:01:55.689> at<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:55.960> last<00:01:56.710> of<00:01:57.039> the

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
and when you look at the last of the

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.160 
and when you look at the last of the
motion<00:01:57.789> control<00:01:58.030> shoe<00:01:58.060> you<00:01:58.750> can<00:01:58.840> see<00:01:59.020> that

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
motion control shoe you can see that

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.289 
motion control shoe you can see that
it's<00:01:59.289> built<00:01:59.469> on<00:01:59.560> a<00:01:59.619> very<00:01:59.979> straight<00:02:00.399> last<00:02:00.670> and

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
it's built on a very straight last and

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:02.969 
it's built on a very straight last and
that's<00:02:01.420> going<00:02:01.659> to<00:02:01.719> again<00:02:02.020> help<00:02:02.079> slow<00:02:02.829> that

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
that's going to again help slow that

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.950 
that's going to again help slow that
rate<00:02:03.189> of<00:02:03.340> over<00:02:03.549> pronation<00:02:03.729> so<00:02:04.630> these<00:02:04.750> are<00:02:04.899> the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
rate of over pronation so these are the

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.419 
rate of over pronation so these are the
