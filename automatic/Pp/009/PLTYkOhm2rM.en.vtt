00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.180
 hello guys welcome to the second 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.250
 episode behind the curtains we do 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.110
 I was doing a very fast stuff 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.600
 photo and i said it could be 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.699
 interesting to make a movie then 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.699
 I want to do a close-up she 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:25.340
 my girlfriend stefania and to do it then 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:29.060
 first of all I evaluated with the 5d 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.880
 mark ii and the 135 mm which it was 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.850
 exposure time to f4 in manner 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.530
 such that the exposure was 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.559
 underexposed by a stop and came that 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.940
 to f4 iso 160 to have the 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.739
 under - exposure of a stop I have to 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.319
 take at the same time as a fortieth of 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.829
 according to that, I placed two 

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:48.859
 flash 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:53.749
 we have a parasol with 5 80 a 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:58.120
 power of a quarter 24 mm with a medium 

00:00:53.749 --> 00:01:02.359
 above and here we have a second flash 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:05.210
 which is the 430 to a quarter of zuma power 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:08.390
 105 mm such a way that takes the 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:12.079
 head just take the hair of the 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.570
 model with a full cto above we are 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:16.310
 running away with radio triggers and then 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.880
 we are completely in manual then 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.520
 as I told you 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.259
 we shoot in this manual point me 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.500
 I position very close to do the first one 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.789
 plan to have interesting eyes 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.759
 instead of making the model look 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:30.469
 directly in the room 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:34.009
 let's get the look down 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:35.840
 and just when it's needed for 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.909
 fo in the right moment I am of the shot 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.530
 he will have to look up at that point 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.420
 immediately took the picture of 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.450
 this usually produces coupons 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.679
 results in the sense that from the eyes 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:50.240
 interesting we try to make one and 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:52.670
 let's see how a small one comes out 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.979
 technique when learned from twins 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.450
 when you are with slow times like this 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:01.999
 that a fortieth of a second than for 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:04.429
 135 mm at the limit of the blur to hold the 

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:06.369
 firm camera is appropriate for 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:08.750
 who like me in the left eye 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.480
 dominant position the car on 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.150
 shoulder and look at that point we have 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.010
 let's say a kind of natural tripod 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.960
 which is our body agree now 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.690
 they wanted to take a picture look down 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:25.220
 focus on the nearest eye 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:30.610
 this way very well and when it rises 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.610
 the look I take the picture 3 2 1 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:38.300
 et voilÃ  said that you can see what it is 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.100
 the result on the video is only a 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.050
 this point to do other tests 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.620
 see if the colors are too hot 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.030
 etc 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.580
 however, it can always be affected 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.800
 edit in post production and then 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.420
 we all have a nice shot with a 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.450
 really simple setup because the end 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.740
 an umbrella a naked flash and 2 triggers 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.740
 enough for the next episode 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:09.629
 hi guys welcome knew he knew door 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.629
 ready
