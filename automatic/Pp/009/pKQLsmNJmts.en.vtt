00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 you will have all heard at some time 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.009
 rumors or legends about videogames 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.270
 games that provoke their players 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.480
 terrible effects like attacks 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.889
 epileptic fainting memory loss or 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.960
 sometimes even the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.820
 death these rumors usually have a 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.870
 common base the most mythical video game and 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.830
 legendary of all time 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.830
 politicians 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.690
 according to the urban legend all 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.970
 starts in the city of portland that 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.010
 found in Oregon in 1981 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.300
 there were distributed a number of cases 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.830
 of copies of a new video game 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.900
 supposedly in tests by the 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.070
 company the game according to what they claimed 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.840
 have played it 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.309
 it was vector graphics and on it 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.720
 we handled a ship that fired a 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.030
 series of enemies while the phases are 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.489
 he was developing a bit like that 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.260
 puzzle one of the characteristics of 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.730
 game was that you did not drive the ship with 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.320
 the command but that 's what he was doing 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.970
 handle the screen so that the ship 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.260
 bounced off the edges of the image and 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.270
 also another of the characteristics that 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.410
 result of the game already in itself was the 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.210
 lots of lights and effects 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.040
 luminics that presented the first 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.200
 days would be all normal and all running 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.790
 However, it would be soon after 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.410
 they would begin to forge the legend more 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.410
 dark of this world 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.920
 the person who played in that game 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.729
 they referred terrible nightmares 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.680
 wake up also in the middle of the night 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.720
 plunged into complete panic and have 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.979
 uploaded memory problems besides this 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.270
 it was recorded in a terrible circle 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.580
 vicious because many of these 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.619
 players claimed to be driven to 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.149
 judge the game repeatedly without being 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.780
 able to contemplate the machine without 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.520
 toss a simple coin into it the game 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.350
 these players became very popular 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.330
 way that in a short time in the big 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.030
 videogame rooms were formed long 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.990
 queues to be able to play it the regulated of 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.509
 the people who had the opportunity 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.729
 of playing it they talked about combinations of 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.619
 some graphics that may contain 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.030
 subliminal messages also ensured 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.649
 see ghostly faces out of the corner of 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.170
 eye touring the game screen to 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.909
 an almost imperceptible speed like that 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.619
 also as subliminal messages that 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.840
 opted for suicide or for 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.030
 conformism and always in English such 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.729
 as kill your self kill you there is no 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.060
 imagination without imagination no cars no 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.700
 make you think as honor 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.319
 Peace honors apathy or everything is 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.929
 question of authority does not question the 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.239
 authority 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.349
 surrender, too, there are many stories 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.209
 that are counted regarding this machine 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.890
 eg rumor has a small 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.870
 13 years fell down while casting 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.129
 a game to this game really is not 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.840
 nothing clear although most people 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.400
 is quite skeptical about 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.170
 this topic there are quite a few people that 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.909
 they claim to have played it and several bosses of 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.980
 local videogames also claim 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:30.590
 have had this game and therefore 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.120
 had to exist but rebuild what has 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.889
 made from here is undoubtedly a 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.299
 impossible task as additional data to 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.709
 this legend had a Swedish in quite 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.150
 places being the most famous its 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.670
 appearance in the simpson chapter 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.950
 of season 18 where in the background you see 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.569
 a machine that says polybius and also 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.359
 below you see that it puts property of the 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.680
 government if you dare to play it down 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:52.120
 I leave a link that takes you to what 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.120
 it would be the recreation of the game itself
