00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.519
 We greet you! Site floristics.info offers lazy 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.800
 and tired flower growers to relax and listen to an article about the plant 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.130
 lupine and about growing it in the garden. 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.380
 How to care for lupine. Lupine care complexity 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.250
 does not represent. If you grow perennial lupins, 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.550
 the first year you have to periodically loosen the soil 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.930
 on the plot and remove the emerging weeds. Over time adults 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.280
 plants will need spud, because they gradually 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.840
 the root neck is exposed, and the lateral sockets separate. 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.250
 After five to six years of growth, old bushes will have to be removed, 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.050
 since the middle part of the bush dies and the quality 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.560
 flowering is noticeably deteriorating. Take care of the supports 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.630
 for tall lupins so that their stems do not break 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.790
 from the wind. If you want the lupins to bloom to the 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.670
 cold weather, cut off faded inflorescences, not allowing them 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.530
 to dry out. After such a manipulation, perennial species are able 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.860
 blossom twice per season. Watering lupins should be moderate, 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.890
 but spring watering should be abundant. 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.219
 Lupine fertilizer. Feeding lupins carried 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:20.350
 spring, the second year of growth, mineral fertilizers, 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.950
 not containing nitrogen: approximately 1 mÂ² of area 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.359
 up to 20 g of superphosphate and 5 g of calcium chloride. Feeding 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:34.159
 carried out every spring, until it is time to plant 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.100
 new lupins. Pests and diseases of lupine. 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.319
 During the budding period, lupine may be affected by aphids, 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:45.920
 at a later time - larvae of the germ fly and nodule 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.229
 weevils. Will have to deal with them spraying 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.920
 plant insecticides. Of diseases dangerous to 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.229
 lupine rot (gray and root), fusarium wilt, spotting 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.180
 and mosaics, fomopsis and rust. Fight disease and 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.859
 pests do not have to, if agronomic 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:09.490
 requirements for lupine, and first of all - the rules 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.230
 crop rotation: placing lupine again on the plot 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.200
 can take place only after three years. The best 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.830
 the precursor to lupine is cereal. 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.860
 How to collect lupine seeds When to collect lupine seeds. 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.350
 As soon as the lupine fruit ripens, it cracks, 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.630
 and the seeds scatter in all directions. To prevent 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.850
 of this, you need to collect the seeds when the beans turn yellow and 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.860
 just start to dry. This will have to be done selectively. 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.010
 in a few tricks. Lupine after flowering 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.060
 When the lupins blossom, around the beginning of October, 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.810
 you need to cut the stalks and leaves, collect the seeds, 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.650
 if there is such a need. Bushes of perennial lupins 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.880
 should be tucked up to cover the exposed soil 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.290
 root collar and then fall asleep for the winter 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.300
 sawdust - lupins are very cold in winter. 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.480
