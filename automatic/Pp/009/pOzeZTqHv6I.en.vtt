00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.510
 as they are once again here is color tv 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.780
 in this time this video that I always 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.429
 I forgot to do it a lot of people do not know or 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.980
 have problems being house 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:16.090
 you have to create games in different 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.500
 games then in this case we're going to 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.900
 solve that problem not usually 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.080
 occurs in traditional internet are 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.900
 those that come with the telephone line 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.630
 for this because of this we need a router 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.190
 modem 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:38.559
 tp link here I have a second is a tad 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:43.350
 of dw 8901 that serves to open ports 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.350
 different from the eternal tec trash 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.620
 then when the day to connect to 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:54.190
 your computer 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:57.970
 internet with this tad the address 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:01.280
 1968 11 then asks you 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:07.100
 usually and finally you add a 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:10.130
 virtual server server port 358 that is 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:14.570
 the port of video games then and 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.910
 pedals 192 168 12 that is the ip that 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.370
 let's use it because you have your computer 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.320
 or your safety good usually if 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.190
 they have their computers configured with 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:28.570
 an ip verifies that it is not the same 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.570
 status protocol 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:37.780
 and everything is ready we are going now to 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:42.320
 pri 63 for example 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:49.240
 settings low settings or adjustments but 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:49.240
 just that network then just 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.810
 We're taking easy custom to 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:02.060
 set up by cable because it provides 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:07.740
 to create the cable connection 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:11.569
 automatic or manual detection and is in 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.569
 your ex 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:22.050
 perhaps the numbers are 192 168 12 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:25.270
 205 numbers are 28 11 243 146 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:34.380
 recently there was automatic next 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:38.840
 use pnp activate and let's open 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.840
 the port so that it is in nothing 2 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.640
 host or host then we do the 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.050
 checks of the settings of the 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.830
 internet connection we have made 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:53.220
 right now you will see everything is done 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:57.330
 done or penepÃ© is checking and the 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.630
 kind of should be in two so you can 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.630
 be happy 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:05.480
 not available type of connection to 2 I have 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.880
 a connection of 8 mb and there is the 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.080
 proof of this is all subscribe 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.540
 share this video and like it 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:19.430
 certainly allow us to pay any 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:22.720
 doubt choose 82 to serve them 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.720
 See you in a next video
