the matter but I think it's going to be
a<00:03:04.799> normal<00:03:05.190> dinner<00:03:05.879> at<00:03:06.840> all<00:03:07.079> I<00:03:07.319> really<00:03:07.680> like<00:03:07.829> the

doesn't<00:03:27.959> look<00:03:27.989> too<00:03:28.230> bad<00:03:28.260> if<00:03:28.560> he<00:03:28.709> um<00:03:28.980> you<00:03:29.910> know

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
doesn't look too bad if he um you know

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.150 
doesn't look too bad if he um you know
it's<00:03:30.359> the<00:03:30.480> work<00:03:30.780> of<00:03:30.900> progress<00:03:31.319> of<00:03:31.440> cool<00:03:31.650> so<00:03:31.980> if

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
it's the work of progress of cool so if

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.629 
it's the work of progress of cool so if
it<00:03:32.310> changes<00:03:32.700> a<00:03:32.760> little<00:03:33.709> for<00:03:34.709> example<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.609> know

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
it changes a little for example you know

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:40.069 
it changes a little for example you know
get<00:03:36.060> a<00:03:36.269> few<00:03:36.569> textures<00:03:37.019> of<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.530> fire<00:03:38.519> or<00:03:39.079> change

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
get a few textures of the fire or change

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.240 
get a few textures of the fire or change
the<00:03:40.349> gas<00:03:41.130> because<00:03:41.549> I<00:03:41.670> know<00:03:41.730> he<00:03:42.030> didn't<00:03:42.389> change

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
the gas because I know he didn't change

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.330 
the gas because I know he didn't change
so<00:03:43.310> we<00:03:43.460> don't<00:03:43.640> have<00:03:43.790> to<00:03:43.940> look<00:03:44.090> fine<00:03:44.780> one<00:03:45.160> it<00:03:46.160> can

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
so we don't have to look fine one it can

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.060 
so we don't have to look fine one it can
