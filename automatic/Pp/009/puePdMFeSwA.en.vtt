00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.050
 with the warrior and as I do not know much about 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.200

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.630

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.539

 I am I am series trick and well I have 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.050
 a warrior raged level 85 and I'm in 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.260
 the bitumen server and well I do 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.360
 this of the goal of c thanks to the announcement 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.489
 of wow that gives you a 15 day trial 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.370
 free and I liked it and here I am helping 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.030
 to this kid with the guard so see it 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.220
 cuff starts with the pvp everything comes out 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.460
 at the top in the guardian usually the 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.219
 people are usually weapons 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.660
 but you are very dependent on the control of 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.090
 adversaries of time 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.180
 you can use action organizations without 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.640
 fears in rpp also depends on macros 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.990
 and defensive attacks for example if 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.830
 fights against a caster you always have 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.410
 that have hand reflexes spells 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.360
 It would also be very helpful to have a 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.700
 gels near or more caster next to you 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.500
 so it's not so easy for you 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.020
 mate and good is going to come out that more than 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.720
 nothing is worth it now I am telling you and a 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.280
 little bit of the pv in pv we can say that 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.850
 the blacksmith is a self-sufficient class 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.370
 that is to say to release and for good 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.440
 fight against the environment we are never going to 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.240
 We are going to need no other 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.550
 character maybe just for some 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.250
 elite missions of the most difficult and 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.070
 to tell you a little performance does not 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.460
 can perform the warrior 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.650
 we have three branches of fury talents that 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.380
 it is fury that good is branch of dps to 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.110
 just like weapons and then our branch of 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.880
 tank in which to explain you a little 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.380
 the function of the tank is the one that holds 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.229
 the blows of the monsters in the most 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.540
 the dungeons are worth only you have to see 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.310
 when you go up in level 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.380
 warrior if you like more hitting like 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.200
 more maybe receive the monsters and 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.060
 we have a little controlled vale 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.800
 you will see as you go 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.060
 advancing the role you want 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.060
 route your warrior 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.390
 and now tell us a little about how you are 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.390
 see 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.100
 well the difficulty is the difficulty of 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.510
 guard is usually not much just that in 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.000
 the moment that at the moment 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.270
 learn to your attack preferences 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.860
 you're going to start doing good dps but the 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.069
 only difficulty that has an arrangement to 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.870
 the level time to deliberate is that 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.150
 it's better that you go up kitchen and first 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.930
 help because if you want to continue 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.829
 fighting non-stop with each other 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.659
 you will always end up being left without 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.730
 health and for going to have to walk 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:52.010
 waiting for you to regenerate if that's 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.489
 very much very heavy to do that 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.780
 and good and thanks news from 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.910
 missions 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.330
 and the upstairs cooking and first 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.580
 help is to free your 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.440
 warrior that we recommend the warrior 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.970
 It can be a bit tedious at the beginning 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.740
 It's worth to release because good 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.350
 like all the evils that are those that 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.819
 They have no spells weapon and has 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.260
 little offensive but good arsenal 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.840
 as I go up levels 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.819
 you will notice an increase of your arsenal and 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.489
 a substantial improvement of the damage that 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:25.160
 you make me recommend to go up 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.920
 your warrior make them tank and 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.750
 put him in random dungeons is worth 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.910
 random dungeons join a group 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.500
 of five players from a nearby level and 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.019
 they send them a dungeon according to 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.420
 level they have if you have a warrior 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.100
 so that you can practically be all 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.410
 the time doing random dungeons 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.690
 without stopping because it is very short 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.970
 is worth the number of tanks in wow 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.970
 we remember that they can only be tanks 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.250
 those of cast the Druid warriors and 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.140
 paladins and like that of changes from 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.790
 of 55 it's worth there are only three classes 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.140
 with which you do more or less the 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.120
 competition 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.160
 and well we talked a little pelayo how 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.610
 follow warrior to high levels a little bit 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.590
 experience the challenge not good can know 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.620
 the first thing you have to decide in what 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.569
 catch guns fury otan that for me what 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.970
 second that you decide what game mode 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.830
 you like more pvp tve good that ya ya 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.079
 I explained what it was that what was each 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.940
 thing and after having chosen between 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.070
 these things is to dedicate yourself to do more 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.470
 move dungeons or old age to go 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.750
 equipping you and so go getting every time 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.210
 more and better rice and so on 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.780
 until water reached the top that 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.940
 perform 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.120
 and good if not good you will find many 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.040
 hits and the best thing is to learn macros that 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.710
 especially the pvp is what you 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.910
 will make life much easier and 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.100
 preferences here that I already talked to you 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.990
 before they make combos and 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.060
 things of those 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.169
 and good some rotation too 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.810
 prepare it for good 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:57.469
 as long as the attacks go well and 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:00.110
 to inform you about the gems and what they are 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:01.819
 jewelry so to speak seven teams in 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.469
 the armor and that you upload some 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:06.050
 characteristics such as hit rate and 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:08.060
 the critical blow expertise and mastery and 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.680
 things like that takes the guard chances of 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.590
 better you come hit index 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.729
 critical practically because if you're not going to 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.660
 start to miss many hits and 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.400
 you will lose lots of weight 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.340
 and good the salts are morras 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.920
 to be taken away with the monsters that 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.570
 with the voices that are killing and I tried 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.139
 for the badges that give you to win the 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:31.710
 times to acquire punk 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:33.270
 it's worth the warrior as a class 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.949
 initial if it is the first you play at 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.199
 wow that is probably the reason 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:38.430
 has led to see this life we ​​what 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:40.289
 we aim with four stars on 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.789
 five because we believe that good 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:43.349
 warrior is a pretty intuitive class 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:45.449
 It's worth it, apart from being the first one 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:46.590
 more we enters the eye because 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.659
 well almost everyone can do 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.949
 reality of what a warrior does without 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:51.539
 read any description and without having 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:54.330
 played before is worth a carrero carries 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:56.069
 armor sticks with the sword and little 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.409
 better is a highly recommended class 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:59.999
 for beginners and in 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:02.430
 players pros the warrior the truth that 

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:04.500
 it can be a very very good weapon so 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.360
 good nothing more to say the kids 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.120
 here concludes the first episode of the 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.439
 guide what kind of you see choose and I think 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.479
 that we are going to see pelayo and jone 

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:13.379
 next episode in the magician a greeting 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:16.189
 and until next time 

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:16.189
 see you later
