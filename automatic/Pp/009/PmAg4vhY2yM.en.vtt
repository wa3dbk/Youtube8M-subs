00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:15.500
 hello everyone guys 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.309
 df silver bra back here in the 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.380
 channel of the clan 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.189
 this time with what it will be is 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.180
 characterized in tct the mode of 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.920
 preferred by our jdf yuan 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.230
 I'll take this time to the gameplay of 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.900
 everyone against all is not a power plant 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.880
 that in all against all hunting and how 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.010
 I had brought him earlier but one 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.680
 thinks that all against all normal 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.190
 where he was using a shotgun 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:48.230
 like the tac 12 which I consider to be a rifle 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:50.270
 to pump stronger than the game even if the 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.180
 devastating bulldog we say that 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.300
 the ray opposition in second place among 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.399
 ii the strongest pump and I was staying 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.719
 trying this game strike in everyone 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.140
 against all with this weapon because 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.729
 just line quite easy and also 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.740
 because it has been a bit the week where 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.970
 I was turning all the parties on the pump 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:14.060
 in fact you also see a gameplay that does not 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.850
 I want to hope with the bulldog who 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.729
 however, you will always see tactics 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.750
 favorite team anyway that in 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.950
 I don't want to spoil anything else here 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.460
 I just let you imagine what 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.460
 it could be 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:32.180
 this I have done in all against 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.039
 all as I have already said this tac where 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.409
 he said equipped with a brake 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.630
 mouth and handle instead of 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.310
 loaded increased because maybe some 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.509
 time I know it 's a single shot rifle 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.479
 but I don't know how it gives me an impression 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:49.130
 the aim was a little too bad when 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.409
 when I took an enemy when in here 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.929
 a little too much even though I know it astern 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.929
 single shot but I don't know why 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:58.969
 put a little more to put the 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.409
 soccer here on this weapon also because 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:03.380
 not having a stable life aiming a little more 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.649
 security here then another thing that there 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.729
 he kept dt which I didn't use in this class 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.860
 concentration that many of you 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.360
 they were already laughing at it like you do 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.819
 not to use concentration on one 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.739
 any green class wanted because 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.269
 cultivated know what concentrations it is 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.120
 fundamental in all the cases 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.440
 but I am of the idea that I am 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.390
 a shotgun 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.450
 maybe concentration serves a lot of 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.290
 less than in a weapon because sincerely 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.720
 I don't see all this need 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.769
 because then at the end of 28 with a shot here 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.750
 meanwhile it has destroyed some crates of 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.400
 ammunition, I wanted to say that the 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.290
 destroyed because they bothered me for 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.569
 the headphones not because added up so many times 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.829
 some promise if he thought badly and 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:46.930
 in fact I said that in the end it is 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:48.859
 but always a personal opinion for me 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.639
 concentration on a shotgun 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:53.930
 boys that is practically useless because 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:56.299
 concentration from my point of view 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.829
 serves a bit to the long cities with a 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.930
 assault rifle maybe with one 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:03.049
 submachine gun however ita ita usa sub 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.730
 I too, however, are rifles in the end 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.900
 pump that you fell with a blow is 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.569
 however the only local always a 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.359
 close distances I could use 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.459
 another concentration is useless to others 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:15.799
 abel are always points of view though 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.750
 honestly the emotion is useless 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:22.239
 anyway and I preferred to use 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.530
 that space he wouldn't have occupied 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:28.310
 concentration with a little more why 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.500
 useful as concealment that you are a 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.900
 occultly a why dana b is a 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.959
 why 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.970
 anyway chaos is not needed but I am 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.740
 always the idea because then I am 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.870
 always the peers of the boys then 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.380
 a wine applied to the right a strategy 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.480
 that concealment should not be used 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.060
 practically never if not in three ways 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.860
 where isaac com are more frequent and more 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.570
 easy to take and then also because up 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.459
 all products with set with fi 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.920
 pretty much what the web from evil 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:00.020
 therefore precisely these three modalities 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.890
 ie frenzy Team death match 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:06.739
 all against all where I use concealment 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.830
 because I honestly don't like the idea of 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:12.500
 be displayed at the top left 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:15.709
 in the map from someone to be killed 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.870
 in series for this sa with then 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.579
 precisely the object so much in these three 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.799
 mode you don't mistake for a dabo 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.770
 please because on domain I never have 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.350
 used no other mode outside 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.870
 outside of these three then nothing 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.880
 we will also tell each other a couple of things 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.919
 anyway I did this comment 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.140
 because joy that is ill then I say 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.750
 to hurry back to the channel for 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.160
 make some other comments because a 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.590
 me sincerely the people of the voice of 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.930

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.060
 because he is very nice when joy 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.470
 make comments on them precisely 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.900
 I really hope he gets well soon 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.060

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:57.290
 o'neal comments there 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:59.810
