in<00:00:01.020> this<00:00:01.560> tutorial<00:00:01.709> I'm<00:00:02.340> going<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:02.580> cover

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:03.080 
in this tutorial I'm going to cover

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.639 
in this tutorial I'm going to cover
start<00:00:04.080> up<00:00:04.230> for<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.680> Garmin<00:00:05.180> g1000<00:00:06.180> and<00:00:06.649> we'll

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
start up for the Garmin g1000 and we'll

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.500 
start up for the Garmin g1000 and we'll
look<00:00:07.770> at<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.160> primary<00:00:08.639> flight<00:00:08.849> display<00:00:09.030> first

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
look at the primary flight display first

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.110 
look at the primary flight display first
and<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.559> multifunction<00:00:11.309> display<00:00:11.639> second

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
and the multifunction display second

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.499 
and the multifunction display second
however<00:00:13.049> on<00:00:13.490> the<00:00:14.490> actual<00:00:14.700> aircraft<00:00:14.880> they<00:00:15.360> will

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
however on the actual aircraft they will

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.410 
however on the actual aircraft they will
both<00:00:15.750> start<00:00:16.440> up<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.740> initialize

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
both start up and initialize

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.779 
both start up and initialize
simultaneously<00:00:18.920> so<00:00:19.920> let's<00:00:20.130> look<00:00:20.250> at<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.490> PFD

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
simultaneously so let's look at the PFD

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.790 
simultaneously so let's look at the PFD
first<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.660> we'll<00:00:21.750> hit<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.020> power<00:00:22.230> button<00:00:22.350> on

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
first and we'll hit the power button on

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.080 
first and we'll hit the power button on
the<00:00:22.859> top<00:00:23.010> left<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.789> bezel<00:00:25.580> now<00:00:26.580> what<00:00:26.970> I've

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
the top left of the bezel now what I've

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.880 
the top left of the bezel now what I've
done<00:00:27.240> here<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.750> I've<00:00:29.570> set<00:00:30.570> failure<00:00:31.320> modes<00:00:31.619> for

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
done here is I've set failure modes for

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.770 
done here is I've set failure modes for
all<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.219> sensors<00:00:32.669> in<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.149> simulation<00:00:33.750> just

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
all the sensors in the simulation just

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.540 
all the sensors in the simulation just
so<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.230> can<00:00:34.440> see<00:00:34.649> how<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.100> would<00:00:35.250> look

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
so you can see how it would look

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.819 
so you can see how it would look
with<00:00:36.270> all<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.600> red<00:00:36.780> x's<00:00:37.230> in<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.500> when<00:00:37.710> you

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
with all the red x's in it when you

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.880 
with all the red x's in it when you
start<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.160> up<00:00:38.280> on<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.579> actual<00:00:38.790> airplane<00:00:39.000> and

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
start it up on the actual airplane and

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.520 
start it up on the actual airplane and
basically<00:00:40.890> what<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.550> telling<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.090> is

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
basically what this is telling you is

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.930 
basically what this is telling you is
that<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.680> sensors<00:00:44.100> are<00:00:44.370> still<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
that the sensors are still in the

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.810 
that the sensors are still in the
process<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.450> calibrating<00:00:46.050> themselves<00:00:46.820> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
process of calibrating themselves the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.319 
process of calibrating themselves the
sensors<00:00:48.539> are<00:00:48.870> going<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.289> be<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:50.250> GPS<00:00:51.000> receiver

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
sensors are going to be the GPS receiver

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.930 
sensors are going to be the GPS receiver
and<00:00:52.100> that's<00:00:53.100> going<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.550> sit<00:00:53.760> there<00:00:53.879> and

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
and that's going to sit there and

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.819 
and that's going to sit there and
acquire<00:00:54.329> satellites<00:00:54.930> until<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.500> get<00:00:55.620> in

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
acquire satellites until it can get in

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.380 
acquire satellites until it can get in
accurate<00:00:56.699> position<00:00:57.600> fix<00:00:58.640> then<00:00:59.640> we<00:00:59.850> have<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
accurate position fix then we have the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.569 
accurate position fix then we have the
air<00:01:00.690> data<00:01:01.050> sensors<00:01:01.590> which<00:01:02.039> are<00:01:02.250> going<00:01:02.460> to

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
air data sensors which are going to

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.929 
air data sensors which are going to
measure<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.739> pressure<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.700> pressure

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
measure the pressure and so the pressure

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.200 
measure the pressure and so the pressure
transducers<00:01:06.750> are<00:01:06.990> going<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.490> zero<00:01:08.490> themselves

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
transducers are going to zero themselves

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.679 
transducers are going to zero themselves
so<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.350> get<00:01:10.500> accurate<00:01:11.130> readings<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
so that you get accurate readings of the

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.240 
so that you get accurate readings of the
pitot<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.470> static<00:01:14.070> values<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.890> then<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:17.040> have

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
pitot and static values and then we have

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.490 
pitot and static values and then we have
the<00:01:17.460> attitude<00:01:17.820> heading<00:01:18.509> reference<00:01:18.960> system<00:01:19.320> or

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
the attitude heading reference system or

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.660 
the attitude heading reference system or
a<00:01:19.710> ours<00:01:20.150> now<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.479> ours<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.520> going<00:01:23.520> to

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
a ours now the a ours is going to

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.380 
a ours now the a ours is going to
consist<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.600> set<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:26.119> tri<00:01:27.119> axis<00:01:27.960> orthogonal

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
consist of a set of tri axis orthogonal

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.160 
consist of a set of tri axis orthogonal
gyros<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:32.490> gyros<00:01:33.000> measure<00:01:33.299> rotation

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
gyros and the gyros measure rotation

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.700 
gyros and the gyros measure rotation
rates<00:01:35.090> they<00:01:36.090> rip<00:01:36.360> they<00:01:36.600> measure<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.079> rotation

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
rates they rip they measure the rotation

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.210 
rates they rip they measure the rotation
rates<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:38.250> board<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.390> aircraft<00:01:39.799> along<00:01:40.799> the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
rates on board the aircraft along the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.020 
rates on board the aircraft along the
direction<00:01:42.560> through<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.590> nose<00:01:43.890> through<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
direction through the nose through the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.910 
direction through the nose through the
wing<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.570> down<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.290> belly<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:47.420> so<00:01:48.920> using

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
wing and down the belly and so using

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.330 
wing and down the belly and so using
these<00:01:50.310> three<00:01:51.000> measured<00:01:51.960> rotation<00:01:52.560> rates<00:01:52.920> and

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
these three measured rotation rates and

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.600 
these three measured rotation rates and
remember<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.240> rotation<00:01:54.810> rate<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.200> going<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.470> be

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
remember a rotation rate is going to be

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.270 
remember a rotation rate is going to be
degrees<00:01:56.610> per<00:01:57.030> second

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
degrees per second

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.720 
degrees per second
we<00:01:59.000> can<00:01:59.210> plug<00:01:59.480> those<00:01:59.720> measured<00:02:00.230> values<00:02:00.730> into

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
we can plug those measured values into

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.260 
we can plug those measured values into
the<00:02:02.830> kinematic<00:02:03.830> equations<00:02:04.340> of<00:02:04.490> motion<00:02:04.850> for<00:02:05.240> a

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
the kinematic equations of motion for a

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.520 
the kinematic equations of motion for a
rigid<00:02:05.450> body<00:02:05.780> aircraft<00:02:06.970> we<00:02:07.970> mathematically

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
rigid body aircraft we mathematically

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.680 
rigid body aircraft we mathematically
integrate<00:02:09.530> those<00:02:09.710> equations<00:02:10.360> which<00:02:11.360> just

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
integrate those equations which just

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.430 
integrate those equations which just
means<00:02:11.930> we<00:02:12.140> add<00:02:12.440> them<00:02:13.100> up<00:02:13.220> over<00:02:13.520> time<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:14.440> the

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
means we add them up over time and the

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.980 
means we add them up over time and the
results<00:02:15.920> you<00:02:16.040> get<00:02:16.220> are<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:18.459> rotation<00:02:19.990> angles

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
results you get are the rotation angles

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.440 
results you get are the rotation angles
of<00:02:21.350> the<00:02:21.530> aircraft<00:02:21.950> which<00:02:22.940> will<00:02:23.120> give<00:02:23.330> you

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
of the aircraft which will give you

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.980 
of the aircraft which will give you
things<00:02:23.720> like<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.380> pitch<00:02:25.040> angle<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:26.720> yaw

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
things like the pitch angle the yaw

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.600 
things like the pitch angle the yaw
angle<00:02:27.350> and<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:29.180> roll<00:02:29.510> angle<00:02:30.130> which<00:02:31.130> can<00:02:31.459> be

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
angle and the roll angle which can be

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.570 
angle and the roll angle which can be
which<00:02:32.420> can<00:02:32.690> then<00:02:32.870> be<00:02:32.930> displayed<00:02:33.410> on<00:02:33.950> the

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
which can then be displayed on the

which can then be displayed on the
artificial<00:02:35.120> horizon<00:02:35.590> so<00:02:36.850> it's<00:02:37.850> important<00:02:38.330> to

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
artificial horizon so it's important to

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.770 
artificial horizon so it's important to
know<00:02:38.690> that<00:02:39.050> at<00:02:39.950> no<00:02:40.280> point<00:02:40.310> in<00:02:40.730> time<00:02:40.780> there

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
know that at no point in time there

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.290 
know that at no point in time there
there's<00:02:42.080> no<00:02:42.440> sensor<00:02:43.340> onboard<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.120> aircraft

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
there's no sensor onboard the aircraft

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.050 
there's no sensor onboard the aircraft
that<00:02:44.840> measures<00:02:45.320> your<00:02:45.590> bank<00:02:45.890> angle<00:02:46.340> or<00:02:46.489> your

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
that measures your bank angle or your

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.680 
that measures your bank angle or your
pitch<00:02:47.300> angle<00:02:47.540> or<00:02:48.140> your<00:02:48.500> yaw<00:02:48.709> angle<00:02:49.330> all<00:02:50.330> of

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
pitch angle or your yaw angle all of

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.520 
pitch angle or your yaw angle all of
these<00:02:50.900> are<00:02:51.520> mathematically<00:02:52.520> derived<00:02:53.530> from

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
these are mathematically derived from

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.090 
these are mathematically derived from
the<00:02:54.800> rate<00:02:55.760> at<00:02:56.180> which<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:57.380> aircraft<00:02:57.890> is

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
the rate at which the aircraft is

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.080 
the rate at which the aircraft is
pitching<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:58.940> rolling<00:02:58.970> and<00:02:59.720> banking<00:03:00.520> so<00:03:01.520> when

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
pitching and rolling and banking so when

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.390 
pitching and rolling and banking so when
you<00:03:02.239> start<00:03:02.570> the<00:03:02.720> system<00:03:02.870> up<00:03:03.260> it's<00:03:04.130> very

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
you start the system up it's very

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.460 
you start the system up it's very
important<00:03:04.850> that<00:03:04.880> you<00:03:05.239> start<00:03:05.510> it<00:03:05.660> up<00:03:05.750> where<00:03:06.170> the

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
important that you start it up where the

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.820 
important that you start it up where the

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
remove the bias these systems will

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.690 
remove the bias these systems will
become<00:03:26.540> activated<00:03:27.170> and<00:03:27.410> I<00:03:28.160> will<00:03:28.400> simulate

become activated and I will simulate
that<00:03:29.180> by<00:03:30.549> turning<00:03:31.549> back<00:03:32.450> on<00:03:32.720> all<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.920> sensors

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.270 

and<00:03:37.720> we<00:03:38.720> can<00:03:38.900> see<00:03:39.080> now<00:03:39.110> what<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:40.010> display

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
and we can see now what the display

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.369 
and we can see now what the display
would<00:03:40.519> look<00:03:40.700> like<00:03:40.879> when<00:03:41.750> we're<00:03:41.900> ready<00:03:42.110> to<00:03:42.230> go

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:42.379 
would look like when we're ready to go

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:48.150 
would look like when we're ready to go
and<00:03:43.510> start<00:03:44.510> up<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:45.560> engine<00:03:45.590> and<00:03:46.129> go<00:03:46.519> flying

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
and start up the engine and go flying

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.559 
and start up the engine and go flying
and<00:03:49.160> we<00:03:49.310> can<00:03:49.459> see<00:03:49.610> the<00:03:49.760> synthetic<00:03:50.209> vision<00:03:50.480> in

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
and we can see the synthetic vision in

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.490 
and we can see the synthetic vision in
the<00:03:50.660> background<00:03:51.080> over<00:03:51.230> here<00:03:53.170> so<00:03:54.170> now<00:03:54.290> let's

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
the background over here so now let's

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.199 
the background over here so now let's
look<00:03:54.590> at<00:03:54.830> what's<00:03:55.190> going<00:03:55.640> to<00:03:55.670> happen<00:03:56.030> when<00:03:56.180> we

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
look at what's going to happen when we

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.860 
look at what's going to happen when we
turn<00:03:56.510> on<00:03:56.660> the<00:03:56.810> multifunctional<00:03:57.709> display<00:03:58.870> here

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
turn on the multifunctional display here

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.680 
turn on the multifunctional display here
we<00:04:00.019> can<00:04:00.200> see<00:04:00.410> another<00:04:00.849> set<00:04:01.849> of<00:04:01.910> initialization

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
we can see another set of initialization

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.380 
we can see another set of initialization
routines<00:04:03.379> going<00:04:03.739> on<00:04:03.920> but<00:04:04.700> this<00:04:04.819> is<00:04:05.030> not<00:04:05.180> so

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
routines going on but this is not so

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.750 
routines going on but this is not so
much<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.720> sensors<00:04:06.260> what<00:04:06.980> the<00:04:07.099> multifunction

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
much the sensors what the multifunction

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.089 
much the sensors what the multifunction
display<00:04:08.090> is<00:04:08.390> initializing<00:04:09.200> our<00:04:09.319> databases

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
display is initializing our databases

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.120 
display is initializing our databases
and<00:04:10.640> we<00:04:11.540> can<00:04:11.690> see<00:04:11.870> we<00:04:12.019> have<00:04:12.230> here<00:04:12.470> the<00:04:12.620> database

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
and we can see we have here the database

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.750 
and we can see we have here the database
for<00:04:13.579> the<00:04:13.730> checklist<00:04:14.860> file/save<00:04:15.860> taxi

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
for the checklist file/save taxi

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.090 
for the checklist file/save taxi
we've<00:04:17.209> got<00:04:17.479> obstacles<00:04:18.519> airports<00:04:19.519> chart<00:04:20.419> data

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
we've got obstacles airports chart data

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.020 
we've got obstacles airports chart data
so<00:04:22.100> these<00:04:22.220> are<00:04:22.370> all<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:22.580> things<00:04:22.760> that<00:04:22.850> you're

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
so these are all the things that you're

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.090 
so these are all the things that you're
going<00:04:23.120> to<00:04:23.180> see<00:04:23.330> on<00:04:23.419> the<00:04:23.510> map<00:04:23.690> and<00:04:23.990> it's<00:04:24.770> mostly

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
going to see on the map and it's mostly

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.719 
going to see on the map and it's mostly
getting<00:04:25.460> these<00:04:25.550> from<00:04:25.820> the<00:04:26.740> SD<00:04:27.740> card<00:04:28.010> which<00:04:28.520> you

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.659 
primary flight display it's important

that you understand what's going on but

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.250 
that you understand what's going on but
it's<00:05:07.880> nothing<00:05:08.270> complicated<00:05:08.599> once<00:05:09.080> you

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
it's nothing complicated once you

it's nothing complicated once you

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
understand the fundamentals so that's

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.270 
understand the fundamentals so that's
all<00:05:11.690> there<00:05:11.810> is<00:05:11.840> to<00:05:12.169> it<00:05:12.289> and<00:05:12.470> it's<00:05:12.889> really<00:05:13.039> that

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
all there is to it and it's really that
