if you notice there when I felt like

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.650 
if you notice there when I felt like
from<00:00:56.470> a<00:00:56.560> pretty<00:00:57.220> great<00:00:57.460> distance<00:00:58.060> a<00:00:58.300> lot<00:00:58.630> of

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
from a pretty great distance a lot of

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.390 
from a pretty great distance a lot of
particle<00:00:59.080> effects<00:00:59.350> kind<00:00:59.590> of<00:00:59.650> splash<00:00:59.980> it<00:01:00.220> from

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
particle effects kind of splash it from

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.480 
particle effects kind of splash it from
the<00:01:00.490> ground<00:01:00.610> that<00:01:00.790> shows<00:01:01.150> their<00:01:01.450> kind<00:01:02.410> of<00:01:02.500> how

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:03.490 
the ground that shows their kind of how

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.179 
the ground that shows their kind of how
much<00:01:03.940> damage<00:01:04.299> I<00:01:04.750> guess<00:01:04.960> you<00:01:05.170> do<00:01:05.379> to<00:01:05.710> wear<00:01:05.920> to

much damage I guess you do to wear to
yourself<00:01:06.520> from<00:01:06.700> for<00:01:06.909> language<00:01:07.270> so<00:01:07.360> the<00:01:07.479> bigger

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
yourself from for language so the bigger

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.649 
yourself from for language so the bigger
the<00:01:07.750> splash<00:01:08.110> the<00:01:08.530> bigger<00:01:08.890> the<00:01:08.979> damage<00:01:09.659> let's

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
the splash the bigger the damage let's

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.930 
the splash the bigger the damage let's
head<00:01:10.840> over<00:01:10.870> here<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:12.340> where<00:01:12.550> there's<00:01:12.820> some

really cool new kind of interesting

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.170 
really cool new kind of interesting
blocks<00:01:14.830> first<00:01:15.280> off<00:01:15.460> I'm<00:01:15.700> going<00:01:15.790> to<00:01:15.880> point<00:01:16.000> out

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
blocks first off I'm going to point out

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.170 
blocks first off I'm going to point out
this<00:01:16.390> this<00:01:17.230> is<00:01:17.530> packed<00:01:18.040> ice<00:01:18.310> and<00:01:18.760> there<00:01:18.940> is<00:01:19.060> no

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
this this is packed ice and there is no

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.210 
this this is packed ice and there is no
craft<00:01:19.390> recipe<00:01:19.810> for<00:01:19.960> this<00:01:20.050> at<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.290> moment<00:01:20.320> but

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
craft recipe for this at the moment but

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.469 
craft recipe for this at the moment but
I<00:01:21.280> believe<00:01:21.490> that<00:01:21.550> it's<00:01:22.000> gonna<00:01:22.120> be<00:01:22.270> just<00:01:22.390> a

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
I believe that it's gonna be just a

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.330 
I believe that it's gonna be just a
bunch<00:01:22.630> of<00:01:22.690> ice<00:01:22.870> like<00:01:23.710> on<00:01:23.830> top<00:01:23.860> of<00:01:24.159> each<00:01:24.250> other

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
bunch of ice like on top of each other

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.490 
bunch of ice like on top of each other
or<00:01:24.550> something<00:01:24.729> but<00:01:25.030> it<00:01:25.210> is<00:01:25.360> just<00:01:25.630> normal<00:01:26.229> ice

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
or something but it is just normal ice

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.899 
or something but it is just normal ice
but<00:01:26.740> you<00:01:26.830> can't<00:01:27.130> see<00:01:27.400> through<00:01:27.700> and<00:01:27.820> that's

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
but you can't see through and that's

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.910 
but you can't see through and that's
pretty<00:01:28.240> much<00:01:28.330> the<00:01:28.450> only<00:01:28.600> difference<00:01:29.260> looks

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
pretty much the only difference looks

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.899 
pretty much the only difference looks
pretty<00:01:30.040> cool<00:01:30.250> I<00:01:30.310> guess<00:01:30.400> them<00:01:30.670> they're<00:01:30.790> gonna

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
pretty cool I guess them they're gonna

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.700 
pretty cool I guess them they're gonna
be<00:01:31.030> using<00:01:31.270> that<00:01:31.360> and<00:01:31.600> maybe<00:01:31.960> a<00:01:32.050> new<00:01:32.200> biome<00:01:32.590> or

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
be using that and maybe a new biome or

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.290 
be using that and maybe a new biome or
something<00:01:33.040> which<00:01:33.190> air<00:01:33.370> may<00:01:33.550> look<00:01:33.700> around<00:01:34.000> for

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
something which air may look around for

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.570 
something which air may look around for
yeah<00:01:35.140> but<00:01:35.470> let's<00:01:35.560> let's<00:01:35.979> have<00:01:36.159> a<00:01:36.190> look<00:01:36.370> at<00:01:36.490> all

hmm<00:03:37.790> that's<00:03:38.510> pretty<00:03:38.780> cool<00:03:38.990> so<00:03:39.890> let's<00:03:40.040> get<00:03:40.220> a

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
hmm that's pretty cool so let's get a

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
I guess they do different they're kind

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.960 
I guess they do different they're kind
of<00:03:55.670> different<00:03:56.030> amounts<00:03:56.540> of<00:03:56.950> them<00:03:57.950> of<00:03:58.760> like

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
of different amounts of them of like

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.180 
of different amounts of them of like
healthy<00:03:59.450> stuff<00:03:59.720> what<00:03:59.990> the<00:04:00.080> hell<00:04:00.230> water

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.000 
particles and all that kind of jan's
kind<00:04:02.990> of<00:04:03.050> flopping<00:04:03.470> around<00:04:04.150> maybe<00:04:05.150> I<00:04:05.240> do<00:04:05.360> i<00:04:06.010> do

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
kind of flopping around maybe I do i do

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.430 
kind of flopping around maybe I do i do
I<00:04:07.070> shoot<00:04:07.280> for<00:04:07.550> the<00:04:07.670> water<00:04:08.030> particles<00:04:08.660> another

I shoot for the water particles another

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.960 
I shoot for the water particles another
cool<00:04:09.590> changed<00:04:09.980> is<00:04:10.130> actually<00:04:10.640> that<00:04:10.760> you<00:04:10.820> can

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
cool changed is actually that you can

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.400 
cool changed is actually that you can
put<00:04:11.090> a<00:04:11.120> fishing<00:04:11.450> rod<00:04:11.570> in<00:04:11.840> an<00:04:11.990> enchantment

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
put a fishing rod in an enchantment

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.630 
put a fishing rod in an enchantment
table<00:04:12.560> and<00:04:13.010> it<00:04:13.640> can<00:04:13.820> open<00:04:14.030> them<00:04:14.300> like<00:04:14.780> up<00:04:15.110> the

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
table and it can open them like up the

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.830 
table and it can open them like up the
chances<00:04:16.640> of<00:04:16.700> actually<00:04:16.970> catching<00:04:17.600> something

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
chances of actually catching something

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.590 
chances of actually catching something
so<00:04:18.200> let's<00:04:18.380> do<00:04:18.620> that<00:04:18.970> skipped<00:04:19.970> enchantment

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
so let's do that skipped enchantment

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.320 
so let's do that skipped enchantment
table<00:04:20.630> boom<00:04:21.560> and<00:04:21.980> let's<00:04:22.520> get<00:04:22.700> some<00:04:22.970> bookie

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
table boom and let's get some bookie

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.000 
table boom and let's get some bookie
bookshelves

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
bookshelves

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.530 
bookshelves
and<00:04:26.010> we're<00:04:26.130> going<00:04:26.280> to<00:04:26.310> enchant<00:04:26.700> this<00:04:26.970> like<00:04:27.330> a

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
and we're going to enchant this like a

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.000 
and we're going to enchant this like a
mofo<00:04:28.230> so<00:04:28.860> let's<00:04:29.040> place<00:04:29.640> this<00:04:29.820> down<00:04:30.060> here

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
mofo so let's place this down here

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.710 
mofo so let's place this down here
bookshelves<00:04:32.010> all<00:04:32.400> around<00:04:34.490> to<00:04:35.490> get<00:04:36.480> all<00:04:36.600> the

max enchantments going never 30s let's

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.650 
max enchantments going never 30s let's
go<00:04:42.410> let's<00:04:43.410> get<00:04:43.590> this<00:04:43.800> and<00:04:44.190> now<00:04:44.730> we<00:04:44.790> have<00:04:45.150> a<00:04:45.180> blue

kind of fishing Lutz there's like junk
treasure<00:04:50.430> and<00:04:51.290> food<00:04:52.290> or<00:04:52.620> something<00:04:53.070> hey<00:04:53.370> crap

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
treasure and food or something hey crap

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.790 
treasure and food or something hey crap
that's<00:04:53.940> a<00:04:54.000> big<00:04:54.300> thing<00:04:54.330> yeah<00:04:55.140> so<00:04:55.290> as<00:04:55.650> you<00:04:55.740> can

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
that's a big thing yeah so as you can

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.840 
that's a big thing yeah so as you can
see<00:04:55.920> it<00:04:56.010> doesn't<00:04:56.220> actually<00:04:56.340> show<00:04:56.490> like<00:04:56.820> a

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
see it doesn't actually show like a

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.850 
see it doesn't actually show like a
proper<00:04:57.060> Chapman<00:04:57.510> just<00:04:57.660> show<00:04:57.810> this<00:04:57.960> blue<00:04:58.380> so

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
proper Chapman just show this blue so

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.440 
proper Chapman just show this blue so
I'm<00:04:58.919> guessing<00:04:59.070> that<00:04:59.310> means<00:04:59.430> it's<00:04:59.700> pretty

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
I'm guessing that means it's pretty

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.240 
I'm guessing that means it's pretty
likely<00:05:00.690> to<00:05:00.990> catch<00:05:01.169> something<00:05:01.530> good<00:05:01.919> maybe

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
likely to catch something good maybe

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.659 
likely to catch something good maybe
some<00:05:02.490> treasure<00:05:02.820> and<00:05:03.440> then<00:05:04.440> maybe<00:05:04.620> maybe<00:05:05.250> my

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
some treasure and then maybe maybe my

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.300 
some treasure and then maybe maybe my
pick<00:05:05.880> up<00:05:06.000> like<00:05:06.180> an<00:05:06.300> old<00:05:06.450> boot<00:05:06.840> who<00:05:07.740> knows<00:05:07.950> so<00:05:08.280> I

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
pick up like an old boot who knows so I

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.740 
pick up like an old boot who knows so I
gotta<00:05:08.669> chill<00:05:08.940> here<00:05:09.090> for<00:05:09.120> a<00:05:09.270> minute<00:05:09.419> and<00:05:09.630> I

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
gotta chill here for a minute and I

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.060 
gotta chill here for a minute and I
gotta<00:05:09.900> come<00:05:09.990> back<00:05:10.110> as<00:05:10.320> soon<00:05:10.560> as<00:05:10.620> I<00:05:10.860> catch

yeah<00:05:34.290> I<00:05:34.440> think<00:05:34.530> that<00:05:35.250> is<00:05:35.430> pretty<00:05:35.640> much

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
yeah I think that is pretty much

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.730 
yeah I think that is pretty much
everything<00:05:36.540> for<00:05:36.780> this<00:05:36.870> air<00:05:37.169> for<00:05:37.470> this<00:05:37.590> little

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
everything for this air for this little

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.550 
everything for this air for this little
update<00:05:38.100> now<00:05:38.250> nothing<00:05:38.610> was<00:05:38.850> listed<00:05:39.360> on<00:05:39.510> the<00:05:39.600> mo

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560

Jang<00:05:40.830> site<00:05:41.040> for<00:05:41.190> the<00:05:41.250> updated<00:05:41.640> they<00:05:41.760> try<00:05:42.000> to

Jang site for the updated they try to

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.150 
Jang site for the updated they try to
keep<00:05:42.210> things<00:05:42.360> secret<00:05:42.630> yeah<00:05:43.200> but<00:05:43.800> I<00:05:43.830> think<00:05:44.040> this

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
keep things secret yeah but I think this

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.950 
keep things secret yeah but I think this
is<00:05:44.220> one<00:05:44.490> of<00:05:44.520> the<00:05:44.669> coolest<00:05:45.090> snapshots

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960

is one of the coolest snapshots
especially<00:05:46.590> because<00:05:46.740> it's<00:05:46.890> because<00:05:47.880> of<00:05:47.910> the

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
especially because it's because of the

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.480 
especially because it's because of the

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
needed a big update on the terrain

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.719 
needed a big update on the terrain
