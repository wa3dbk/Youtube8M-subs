the<00:00:05.700> current<00:00:06.180> installed<00:00:06.680> it's<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:07.919> very<00:00:08.430> easy

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
the current installed it's a very easy

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:32.990 
the current installed it's a very easy

we're<00:00:33.600> hosting<00:00:34.050> for<00:00:34.590> Dakota<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.250> need

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
we're hosting for Dakota so you need

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.760 
we're hosting for Dakota so you need
that<00:00:35.670> encoder<00:00:36.240> that's<00:00:36.870> crucial<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.470> getting

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
that encoder that's crucial and getting

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.590 
that encoder that's crucial and getting
in<00:00:38.070> making<00:00:38.520> sure<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.760> have<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> line<00:00:39.330> here

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
in making sure you have a line here

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.700 
in making sure you have a line here
which<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.260> why

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710

for me be rubbish probably be rubbish it

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.140 
for me be rubbish probably be rubbish it
actually<00:00:59.040> that's<00:01:00.040> very<00:01:00.430> right<00:01:00.610> that<00:01:00.670> seems

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150

actually that's very right that seems
like<00:01:01.360> the<00:01:01.480> reason<00:01:01.600> why<00:01:01.840> I<00:01:01.870> go<00:01:02.140> with<00:01:02.290> my

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
like the reason why I go with my

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.980 
like the reason why I go with my
protecting

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.950 

I'd<00:01:06.140> say<00:01:06.530> this<00:01:06.710> those<00:01:06.950> aren't<00:01:07.250> American

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
I'd say this those aren't American

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.440 
I'd say this those aren't American
justice<00:01:08.960> your<00:01:09.140> table<00:01:09.909> that's<00:01:10.909> quite<00:01:11.149> it<00:01:11.299> is

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
justice your table that's quite it is

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:39.130 
justice your table that's quite it is
quite<00:01:11.750> loud

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.590 

come<00:01:39.830> somebody<00:01:40.220> you<00:01:40.430> can<00:01:40.580> run<00:01:40.760> a<00:01:40.790> 1080p

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
come somebody you can run a 1080p

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.770 
come somebody you can run a 1080p
screaming<00:01:42.409> so<00:01:43.250> you<00:01:43.310> have<00:01:43.580> a<00:01:43.610> much<00:01:44.300> much<00:01:44.510> better

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
screaming so you have a much much better

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.500 
screaming so you have a much much better
than<00:01:44.990> console<00:01:45.610> console<00:01:46.610> experience<00:01:47.360> is

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
than console console experience is

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.490 
than console console experience is
something<00:01:47.690> like<00:01:47.960> starter<00:01:49.990> I'm<00:01:50.990> gonna<00:01:51.140> already

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
something like starter I'm gonna already

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.080 
something like starter I'm gonna already
hey<00:01:51.680> I'm<00:01:51.890> saying<00:01:52.130> there's<00:01:52.520> no<00:01:52.640> lots<00:01:52.820> of<00:01:52.909> time

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
hey I'm saying there's no lots of time

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.660 
hey I'm saying there's no lots of time
sitting<00:01:53.300> it's<00:01:53.510> very<00:01:53.720> bright<00:01:53.900> show<00:01:54.670> that's

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
sitting it's very bright show that's

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:10.470 
sitting it's very bright show that's
great

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:10.480 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.190 

manually<00:02:11.480> from<00:02:11.600> between<00:02:12.080> 4<00:02:12.440> and<00:02:13.510> 20<00:02:14.510> megabits

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
manually from between 4 and 20 megabits

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.940 
manually from between 4 and 20 megabits
per<00:02:15.380> second

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
per second

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.860 
per second
obviously<00:02:16.370> it's<00:02:16.910> time<00:02:17.090> for<00:02:17.270> frame<00:02:17.480> rate<00:02:17.690> so

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
obviously it's time for frame rate so

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.240 
obviously it's time for frame rate so
you<00:02:17.960> can<00:02:18.170> actually<00:02:18.470> do<00:02:18.590> an<00:02:18.650> automatic<00:02:18.920> frame

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
you can actually do an automatic frame

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.680 
you can actually do an automatic frame
rate<00:02:19.400> or<00:02:19.520> even<00:02:19.550> lock<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.180> frame<00:02:20.330> rate<00:02:20.510> on<00:02:20.600> the

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
rate or even lock the frame rate on the

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.240 
rate or even lock the frame rate on the
tablet<00:02:21.020> so<00:02:21.050> you<00:02:21.170> can<00:02:21.230> lock<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:21.650> over<00:02:21.950> to<00:02:22.130> your

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
tablet so you can lock it over to your

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.630 
tablet so you can lock it over to your
locket<00:02:22.550> at<00:02:23.000> 16<00:02:24.040> you<00:02:25.040> can<00:02:25.070> have<00:02:25.310> different

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
locket at 16 you can have different

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.840 
locket at 16 you can have different
settings<00:02:25.670> for<00:02:26.120> so<00:02:26.750> say<00:02:26.959> if<00:02:27.020> I<00:02:27.080> connected<00:02:27.470> over

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
settings for so say if I connected over

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.600 
settings for so say if I connected over
Athena<00:02:28.850> as<00:02:28.970> well<00:02:29.680> you<00:02:30.680> obviously<00:02:30.770> have<00:02:31.220> a<00:02:31.250> much

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
Athena as well you obviously have a much

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.490 
Athena as well you obviously have a much
higher<00:02:31.910> bandwidth<00:02:32.420> bitrate<00:02:32.870> available<00:02:33.380> to

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
higher bandwidth bitrate available to

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.020 
higher bandwidth bitrate available to
you<00:02:33.740> and<00:02:33.920> so<00:02:34.010> you're<00:02:34.220> free<00:02:34.490> you<00:02:34.580> should<00:02:34.730> really

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
you and so you're free you should really

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.480 
you and so you're free you should really
have<00:02:35.240> obviously<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.080> maximum<00:02:36.530> quality

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
have obviously the maximum quality

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.910 
have obviously the maximum quality
locked<00:02:38.209> yeah<00:02:38.810> every<00:02:39.110> time<00:02:39.230> you<00:02:39.320> connect<00:02:39.650> and

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
locked yeah every time you connect and

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.920 
locked yeah every time you connect and
obviously<00:02:40.250> when<00:02:40.340> you're<00:02:40.400> roaming<00:02:40.850> that<00:02:41.540> is

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
obviously when you're roaming that is

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.510 
obviously when you're roaming that is
much<00:02:42.320> more<00:02:42.530> variable<00:02:42.800> so<00:02:43.190> if<00:02:43.280> you<00:02:43.340> have<00:02:43.489> a

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
much more variable so if you have a

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.490 
much more variable so if you have a
rubbish<00:02:43.850> connection<00:02:44.300> somewhere<00:02:44.540> you<00:02:45.200> can<00:02:45.380> if

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
rubbish connection somewhere you can if

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.020 
rubbish connection somewhere you can if
you<00:02:45.620> want<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:45.860> you<00:02:46.040> can<00:02:46.190> go<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:46.550> optimize<00:02:47.000> it

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
you want to you can go and optimize it

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.790 
you want to you can go and optimize it
for<00:02:47.239> much<00:02:47.540> of<00:02:47.690> run<00:02:47.870> lower<00:02:48.110> for<00:02:48.530> a<00:02:48.560> lower

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
for much of run lower for a lower

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.430 
for much of run lower for a lower
maximum<00:02:49.070> bitrate<00:02:49.520> to<00:02:49.820> guarantee<00:02:50.209> a<00:02:50.540> high

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
maximum bitrate to guarantee a high

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.400 
maximum bitrate to guarantee a high
input<00:02:51.830> speed<00:02:52.040> as<00:02:52.250> well
