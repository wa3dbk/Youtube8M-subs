 well you know I've been a while 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.890
 without a computer because I had 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.779
 spoiled a piece but I already have the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.490

 Junior joba we are playing 2 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.620

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.850
 good start for this all because 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.830
 let's see what is going to happen to him 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.600
 very strange we see that he will go here 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.550
 by the means of king pulls a c4 does not pass 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.350
 nothing recharges with the scavenger pulls one 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.850
 the enemy and it bounces on his head 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.220
 we have found the rubber man what 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.140
 we see in slow motion who is bouncing the 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.740
 c4 in the head and it goes towards the sky 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.740
 amazing 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.899
 in position number 9 we have a bart 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.730
 simpson Burgos is playing mad 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.620
 Whites 2 The gameplay bounces bounces 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.570
 we see that the first one headed 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.680
 highlighted only a few seconds remain 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.149
 starting this has tried 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.520
 celebrate it then tried to make a 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:11.759
 click on pretty cool and right on the 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.509
 last tenth they humiliate him and the 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:17.549
 incredible game and we 're going to the post 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.770
 number 8 where mario jm is located 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.000
 playing white 2 with the ballista and 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.320
 let's see what is going to have the same 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.429
 lucky me with the road to ball 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.860
 ballista because this sniper 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:27.569
 It really is that she is very fucking and regular 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.860
 we see that he sees two enemies shoots one 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:30.960
 room here market shoots a 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.459
 second time a second hit marquez that to 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.229
 Through the enemy fails the shot knows 

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:36.360
 that is there tucked in again makes another 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.130
 hit market and avant you see it again 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.110
 there in the background he shoots again fails 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.090
 the shot shot again another hit market 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.340
 already go 4 recharge until you do not believe it 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.590
 he sees him again he shoots him but this time 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.750
 they kill him and it's really amazing 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.069
 it does not surprise me at all the reaction that 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.229
 he had after he was killed 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:55.130
 because he's a sniper that really 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.200
 It gives a lot of disgust 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.869
 and in the position number 7 is a 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.070
 of 9 998 that is playing whites 2 and 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.259
 let's see what the 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.759
 wonderful fellow on duty we see that 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.500
 is going to throw a pineapple where there is action in 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.060
 the map rotates the pineapple sticks it to 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.050
 partner and not fellow mate 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.050
 fellow mate 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.200
 and we go straight to position number 6 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.239
 where you find points English or 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.739
 go white 2 on the green map and 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.989
 we see that he is going to see an enemy kills him 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.459
 with the 94 pick up the chapita will see a 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.590
 enemy more to the bottom still has left 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.019
 enough life but the enemy kills him 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.640
 with a grenade from pm when I still had 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.640
 Pretty life is really impressive 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.780
 and we go to position number 5 where 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.640
 it's found 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.620
 how do you pronounce that we see that it is 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.420
 playing the redemption network and it's 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.040
 visiting the enemies and we will be 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.990
 a little stealthy let's prepare here 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.459
 some dynamite charges and I'm going to 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.140
 launch stealthily to be able to 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.700
 kill them and do not detect me from 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.410
 where I have thrown it prepared the 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.910
 dynamite I am loading it I am loading it 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.260
 I'm loading, come, let's help her 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.650
 let's throw it away let's throw it away let's 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.650
 throw it 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.110
 take fail you're dead 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.430
 and at number 4 we have back 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:08.689
 back petit that is playing white 2 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.879
 the game mode search and destroy 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:12.230
 only one enemy remains and deactivate 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.640
 the bomb we see that he is trying to kill 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.409
 the enemy with the sniper what 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.849
 it ends up killing and right now it only remains 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:19.099
 deactivate the pump, there are still many 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.049
 seconds but since this is not the type 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.310
 of people who hesitate when 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.829
 they have time that they trust that 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.750
 they say come let's try to vacillate 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.040
 enemy to show them that oh look we are 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.450
 better than you look what we 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.370
 we can allow to do and you do not 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.840
 because we are better look look look what 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.040
 well I know how to handle the sniper bs 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.450
 now the crossbow fired the bomb 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.790
 I still have time to deactivate 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.859
 but I'm going to deactivate like in exchange for 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.260
 gun no longer gives me time 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:44.810
 forget yourself because you're going to die friend you're going to 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.819
 dying that happens to you for hesitating and in the 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.959
 placed number 3 we have a bayer lp 98 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.459
 let's see who is playing black 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.260
 bears and many stitches will happen 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.239
 the same moment takes lightning attack 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.819
 reappears mos reappear reappears 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.019
 as mommy silverstone come reappears me 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.250
 I think both stitches that can 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.980
 happen to us has already happened a lot in very 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.910
 little time but but an enemy hunter 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.560
 no no no no you can not come for me no 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.000
 and in position number 2 we have the 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.220
 term and hoarse that is playing at 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.570
 smackdown vs raw 2013 and we will see that 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.160
 these are from the videos that to me 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.990
 they like that strange things happen 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.160
 in this game we see that he will grab the 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.450
 enemy will put it on the 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.709
 protections and will try to make a 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.150
 flip back to throw it 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.160
 against the table and the enemy 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.570
 mysteriously the body stretches like 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.950
 if it were a wait for you or the 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.840
 physical of this cause is very well 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.760
 made clear yes but this does not end 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.280
 here we are going to see what is going to take the super 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.840
 ladder is that this mega thrashed and it 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.190
 is going to put on prancing with the 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.030
 enemy here the enemy starts to give 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:40.360
 of hosts and will throw our uncle to 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.950
 ring and let's see that seven does not 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.110
 may be happening these physics are 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.910
 failing a bit this is not real that is 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.430
 Say and that this is the game of 2013 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.930
 is the last one and we will see that here 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.220
 now it rises as if nothing good 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.250
 be in the ring here nothing has happened 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.690
 now the enemy falls because yes because 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.840
 he's an asshole and he's exactly what 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.000
 same 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.500
 and in the position number 1 we have a mini 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 hard and boy who is playing black ops 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.040
 2 and the strangest thing will happen 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.470
 that I have never seen in this game 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.150
 it really is something awesome that 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.040
 I've never seen it on any other channel 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.050
 we see that the ally is going to request a 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.419
 help package and well this is 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.740
 waiting for him and the ally is already like 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.540
 suspecting a little that this one can 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.949
 try to steal the package we see that it 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.360
 put under the package to make a 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:22.070
 little the fool but you already know that in this 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.020
 game there is no damage per pack but what 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.050
 cojones has passed has died that has 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.910
 thrown the package but what the fuck and this 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.290
 the wizard is carried away because if now 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.750
 let's see in third person is 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.280
 really flippant let's see that the 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.620
 ally nothing is going to reappear turns the 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.180
 package with our boy who has 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.740
 sent the video is there in little then 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.030
 hesitating saying the subject 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.620
 steal the package I'm going to do a little 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.750
 the fool and you know that in this game 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.030
 the packages do not have ally damage but 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.280
 it falls on him and the ally he shot 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.289
 the package being away from the package 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.729
 really awesome I never before 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:55.310
 I had seen it and this one takes a clouds 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:57.040
 to free because if it really is that 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.140
 deserves your number one 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.940
 and good kids with this last click 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.890
 concludes the monthly top 20 of July 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.390
 2013 in the description of this video 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.160
 you will have all the channels in the order 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.960

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.600
 channels and if you like your content then 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.070

 well I remind you to participate in 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.280

 send me your clips per message 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.370
 private have to be in 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.500
 Hidden privacy setting or 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.150
 public do not emmys me in configuration 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.890

 I can see them too I remind you that 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:26.440
 I can not do this series 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.150
 weekly because I do not get the 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.470
 number of clips needed to do it 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.180
 I mean, I could do it for a few 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.440
 weeks but then there would be some 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.420
 weeks when I could not do it 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.190
 because I do not get the eclipse number 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.960
 as I say and I also ask you please 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.150
 Do not send me your clicks with 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.800
 music neither commented nor annotated 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.540
 and please do not be gameplays 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.550
 whole send me only the clip 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:47.340
 trimmed once trimmed 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.360
 Well I know you put some cameras 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.950
 different from the cinema mode so that 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.840
 be a bit more juicy and it is already and not 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.550
 you have to do anything else as I say 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.650
 I hope you liked it in voting the 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.480
 video if you liked it for more tops and 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.810

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.810
