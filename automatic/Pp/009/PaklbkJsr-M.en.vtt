00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.800
 fertilizers 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.170
 fertilizer is a natural or synthetic chemical substance or mixture used 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.439
 to enrich the soil and promote plant growth 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.380
 plants do not need complex compounds of the type of vitamins or 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.920
 the essential amino acids in human nutrition as they synthesize all 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.150
 those that need 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.070
 they only require a dozen chemical elements 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.270
 that must be presented in a form that the plant can absorb 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.460
 within this limitation 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.460
 nitrogen for example can be administered with equal effectiveness in 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.229
 nit form nitrate ammonia compounds pure ammonia 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.130
 most people know very 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.430
 little about the use of fertilizers and therefore do not know how to really 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.570
 food arrive at their tables 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.150
 this is no surprise since every day that passes - people are 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.210
 engaged in agriculture not only in our country 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.110
 but all over the world 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.030
 this reality makes when the use of fertilizers is questioned 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.900
 commercial, there is usually a lot of ignorance in the assertions that 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.730
 are made today there are formations about the truth and in some cases they are 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.150
 lies of interested people 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.810
 but the unfortunate thing is that many people believe in these 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.470
 information 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.870
 The following data was obtained and adapted from a panel of experts in the 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.920
 Recently organized material by potash corp 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.909
 one of the most important companies in the production and marketing of 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.720
 fertilizers in the world 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.240
 commercial fertilizers are chemical products harmful to the environment 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.240
 ambient 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.820
 wildlife and people 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.050
 Realities 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.340
 The fertilizer contains nutrients of natural origin that the plants need 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.329
 to grow and produce food 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:16.349
 the nutrients contained in the fertilizers are the same nutrients 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.249
 that contain the foods that we consume and the same that we have in 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:22.019
 our bodies 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.579
 the fertilizers are not toxic 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:25.540
 actually 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.150
 these are present in the ground we walk on and in the air we breathe 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:33.699
 myth organic agriculture does not use fertilizers 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:35.729
 Realities 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:38.729
 in organic agriculture if fertilizers are used 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:40.829
 but in the form of manure 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.099
 compost 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.859
 etc. The nutrients contained in the fertilizers are the same 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.319
 be these organic or commercial 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.929
 organic agriculture protects the environment and wildlife 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:57.149
 while conventional agriculture does not protect them 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:59.359
 Realities 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.290
 in any type of agriculture 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.109
 be it organic or conventional 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.760
 efficient and responsible use of commercial fertilizers does not 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:10.149
 No harm to the environment and wildlife 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:13.659
 the quantity and quality of food produced with agriculture 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:14.909
 conventional 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.379
 has allowed the population to eat properly 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.580
 millions of additional tasks would be necessary to grow to feed the 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.609
 world if we go to a single system of organic methods and we would produce 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.549
 less food 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.329
 8th to mention the efficient and responsible use of fertilizers 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:36.919
 It was made by
