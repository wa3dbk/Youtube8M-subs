the river on boot lake and so you can
see<00:00:34.629> that<00:00:34.780> side<00:00:34.989> of<00:00:35.109> the<00:00:35.170> screen<00:00:35.440> and<00:00:35.710> it's<00:00:35.829> on

see that side of the screen and it's on

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.520 
see that side of the screen and it's on
our<00:00:36.010> right<00:00:36.399> so<00:00:36.789> we're<00:00:36.940> going<00:00:37.059> downstream<00:00:37.570> but

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
our right so we're going downstream but

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.560 
our right so we're going downstream but
to<00:00:38.679> get<00:00:38.800> to<00:00:38.980> the<00:00:39.100> to<00:00:39.579> the<00:00:39.670> cut<00:00:39.820> through<00:00:40.059> but

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
to get to the to the cut through but

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.810 
to get to the to the cut through but
4.18<00:00:41.410> coming<00:00:41.890> downstream<00:00:42.250> when<00:00:42.460> we<00:00:42.609> talk<00:00:42.789> of

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
4.18 coming downstream when we talk of

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.030 
4.18 coming downstream when we talk of
lake<00:00:43.140> then<00:00:44.140> over<00:00:44.350> there<00:00:44.500> down

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.260 

because<00:00:49.040> there's<00:00:49.250> a<00:00:49.310> narrow<00:00:49.550> passage<00:00:50.120> it's

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
because there's a narrow passage it's

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.360 
because there's a narrow passage it's
about<00:00:50.450> 15<00:00:50.930> feet<00:00:51.140> wide<00:00:51.350> and

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.520 

for<00:00:54.850> most<00:00:54.970> folks<00:00:55.300> is<00:00:55.510> passable<00:00:55.960> anything

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
for most folks is passable anything

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.010 
for most folks is passable anything
under<00:00:56.860> 30<00:00:57.130> feet<00:00:57.460> they<00:00:58.300> don't<00:00:58.510> draw<00:00:58.750> more<00:00:58.960> than

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
under 30 feet they don't draw more than

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.870 
under 30 feet they don't draw more than
three<00:00:59.380> feet<00:00:59.680> should<00:01:00.250> we<00:01:00.370> don't<00:01:00.520> go<00:01:00.670> through

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
three feet should we don't go through

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.370 
three feet should we don't go through
here<00:01:01.090> when<00:01:01.239> the<00:01:01.330> legs<00:01:01.510> all<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:01.720> way<00:01:01.870> up

Watauga so we're entering from the

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.050 
Watauga so we're entering from the
downstream<00:01:17.170> side<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:18.580> we<00:01:18.670> see<00:01:18.850> somebody

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.640 

it's<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.150> ideal<00:01:28.540> entering<00:01:29.080> to<00:01:29.170> cut<00:01:29.350> through

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
it's the ideal entering to cut through

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.270 
it's the ideal entering to cut through
is<00:01:30.160> when<00:01:30.850> you<00:01:30.940> get<00:01:31.120> into<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.600> no<00:01:32.380> return<00:01:32.860> point

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
is when you get into the no return point

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.670 
is when you get into the no return point
on<00:01:33.490> college<00:01:33.940> if<00:01:34.900> you<00:01:35.080> give<00:01:35.230> your<00:01:35.380> horn<00:01:35.590> a

Watauga river and we've slid into it
from<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.680> other<00:02:43.860> side<00:02:44.960> when<00:02:45.960> you<00:02:46.050> going

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
from the other side when you going

from the other side when you going
through<00:02:46.350> this<00:02:46.470> way<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.740> just<00:02:47.010> have<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.310> know

through this way you just have to know

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.980 
through this way you just have to know
that<00:02:47.460> rocks<00:02:47.910> over<00:02:48.240> on<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.450> other<00:02:48.480> side<00:02:48.840> of<00:02:48.870> the

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
that rocks over on the other side of the

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.930 
that rocks over on the other side of the
boat<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:49.980> I'm<00:02:50.130> trying<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.400> stay<00:02:50.580> about<00:02:50.790> two

plenty<00:02:53.100> of<00:02:53.459> room<00:02:53.670> on<00:02:54.350> the<00:02:55.350> other<00:02:55.500> side<00:02:55.940> if

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
plenty of room on the other side if

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.690 
plenty of room on the other side if
you're<00:02:57.120> in<00:02:57.180> a<00:02:57.240> pontoon<00:02:57.630> boat<00:02:58.280> it's<00:02:59.280> really<00:02:59.670> a

no-brainer

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.270 
no-brainer
usually<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.200> boater<00:03:01.620> trimmed<00:03:01.920> all<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.190> way

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
usually the boater trimmed all the way

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.180 
usually the boater trimmed all the way

through this slot back in the old days

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.510 
through this slot back in the old days
so<00:03:11.690> I<00:03:12.690> would<00:03:13.380> not<00:03:13.560> recommend<00:03:13.770> that

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
so I would not recommend that

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.710 
so I would not recommend that
pretty<00:03:14.910> dangerous<00:03:15.090> is<00:03:15.360> pretty<00:03:15.570> dangerous

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
pretty dangerous is pretty dangerous

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.530 
pretty dangerous is pretty dangerous
little<00:03:16.140> feet<00:03:16.700> as<00:03:17.700> we<00:03:17.850> go<00:03:17.940> through<00:03:18.209> here<00:03:18.390> that

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
little feet as we go through here that

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.449 
little feet as we go through here that
rock<00:03:18.810> that<00:03:19.170> we<00:03:19.290> want<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.500> miss<00:03:19.709> is<00:03:20.040> right<00:03:20.280> over

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
rock that we want to miss is right over

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.360 
rock that we want to miss is right over
there<00:03:20.700> on<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.850> left

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
there on the left

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.850 
there on the left

so this is the narrow shallow spot bring

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.800 
so this is the narrow shallow spot bring

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
the island to cut through so popular

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.560 
the island to cut through so popular

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570
