00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
deactivated and it's still edge you see

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.870 
deactivated and it's still edge you see
the<00:01:53.990> preferences<00:01:54.710> if<00:01:54.920> I<00:01:55.040> only<00:01:55.220> put<00:01:55.780> wcdma<00:01:57.640> okay

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.150 

it<00:02:01.880> won't<00:02:02.600> get<00:02:02.780> anything<00:02:03.410> no<00:02:04.340> service<00:02:04.910> you<00:02:05.060> see

it won't get anything no service you see

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.630 
it won't get anything no service you see
so<00:02:07.160> the<00:02:07.880> wcdma<00:02:08.690> is<00:02:09.229> not<00:02:09.649> compatible<00:02:10.070> with<00:02:10.460> this

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
so the wcdma is not compatible with this

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.780 
so the wcdma is not compatible with this
phone<00:02:10.940> even<00:02:11.570> if<00:02:11.930> I<00:02:12.110> asked<00:02:12.590> him<00:02:12.740> many<00:02:12.800> times<00:02:13.190> if

the processor one second let me see if I

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:12.520 
the processor one second let me see if I

I'll<00:04:24.259> go<00:04:24.500> in<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:24.830> benchmark<00:04:25.699> right<00:04:25.940> now<00:04:26.710> to

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
I'll go in the benchmark right now to

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.850 
I'll go in the benchmark right now to
show<00:04:28.039> you<00:04:29.139> that<00:04:30.139> it's<00:04:30.349> not<00:04:30.440> what<00:04:30.830> he<00:04:30.919> said

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
show you that it's not what he said

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.210 
show you that it's not what he said
here's<00:04:33.860> the<00:04:34.039> device<00:04:34.400> info<00:04:35.590> so<00:04:36.590> you<00:04:37.009> see

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
here's the device info so you see

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:43.779 
here's the device info so you see
dual-core<00:04:38.000> rmv<00:04:39.160> v7<00:04:40.720> possessor<00:04:41.979> neon<00:04:42.979> so<00:04:43.580> it's

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
dual-core rmv v7 possessor neon so it's

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:45.999 
dual-core rmv v7 possessor neon so it's
not<00:04:43.940> even<00:04:44.240> what<00:04:44.389> he<00:04:44.479> told<00:04:44.690> me<00:04:44.900> that<00:04:45.169> it<00:04:45.979> was

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
not even what he told me that it was

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:48.219 
not even what he told me that it was
it's<00:04:46.759> a<00:04:46.849> dual-core<00:04:47.389> instead<00:04:47.720> of<00:04:47.810> a<00:04:47.930> quad-core

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
it's a dual-core instead of a quad-core

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.570 
it's a dual-core instead of a quad-core
so<00:04:48.889> he's<00:04:49.610> really<00:04:50.210> a<00:04:50.449> bad<00:04:50.930> seller<00:04:51.380> he<00:04:52.190> told<00:04:52.430> me

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
so he's really a bad seller he told me

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.260 
so he's really a bad seller he told me
dual-core<00:04:53.240> CPU<00:04:53.990> and<00:04:54.789> something<00:04:55.789> that<00:04:55.820> is<00:04:56.060> not

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
dual-core CPU and something that is not

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.740 
dual-core CPU and something that is not
what's<00:04:57.080> supposed<00:04:57.169> to<00:04:57.650> be<00:04:58.000> and<00:04:59.000> here's<00:04:59.360> he<00:04:59.570> the

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
what's supposed to be and here's he the

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:05.740 
what's supposed to be and here's he the
edge<00:04:59.930> I<00:05:00.409> never<00:05:01.370> got<00:05:01.580> 3g<00:05:03.340> and<00:05:04.340> the<00:05:05.030> dick<00:05:05.419> button

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
edge I never got 3g and the dick button

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.700 
edge I never got 3g and the dick button
almost<00:05:06.259> doesn't<00:05:06.590> work<00:05:07.659> also<00:05:08.659> last<00:05:09.229> but<00:05:09.470> not
