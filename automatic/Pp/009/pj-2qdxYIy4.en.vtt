00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.080
Well, it's December.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.780
So, that means...

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.880
any number of things.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.400
But as far as I'm concerned,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.260
that means Christmas video games.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.520
So, we're gonna get going.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.200
And play some

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.540
Christmas games here on Lazy Game Reviews.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.040
[electronic version of "Little Drummer Boy"]

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.420
[fizz, sip]

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.540
Aahhh!

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.500
When you think of Christmas,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.020
thoughts often turn to the Santa Claus story.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.900
You know, bearded fat guy wearing a jumpsuit,

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.400
breaking into houses while everybody's asleep,

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.700
stealing their food,

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.780
and hopefully bringing a surprise or two for the children.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.220
Not to mention all of that "watching you while you sleep"

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.180
and "knowing everything you do" and stuff.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.700
You know, Santa's pretty much a creepy ex-con

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.660
who just slightly cleaned up his act once on parole,

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.320
now that I think about it.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.320
Anyways, the Santa story should make
an awesome arcade video game, right?

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.360
What with all the visiting as many houses as you can

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.700
and delivering presents before the night ends.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.720
Well, that's exactly what Special Delivery:
Santa's Christmas Chaos is all about.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.300
Play the role of old St. Nick himself,

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.060
and your task is to do all of the
good deeds you can before you die.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.400
This is on the Atari 8-bit computers,
but also came on the Sinclair Spectrum

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.940
and C64.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.360
Gameplay remains much the same on each version.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.680
Only the graphics and sound are changed a bit.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.380
You start off playing Santa in his sleigh–

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.920
strangely, it looks like it's without any reindeer–

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.460
and the takeoff on his journey from
his elf sweatshop at the North Pole.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.920
This section is a simple side-scrolling area

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.100
where you have to collect the
presents which fall from the sky,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.000
dropped by supernatural beings with halos.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.260
Yeah, I have no idea why angels are
dropping presents from the lower atmosphere.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.700
Maybe he worked all the elves to death.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.600
Collect as many presents as
you can without hitting anything,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.420
and if you do, the present that was
falling will disappear into the ether.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.440
It's gonna be mostly clouds and
mountains getting in your way.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.140
And you'll lose the present that is falling,

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.900
or slow down if you so much
as get near the wrong pixel.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.620
Once the other-worldly beings
tire of throwing down gifts to you,

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.660
you can land on larger houses and
proceed to climb down the chimney.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.380
And deck the halls, man, who knew
chimneys were so complex inside.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.340
There's multiple ladders leading downward,

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.200
flames coming up from the
bottom that will burn you alive

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.620
and snowballs falling from
above that can also kill you.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.340
Once you reach the bottom, you'll
extinguish the family's source of heat

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.020
and infiltrate their house.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.460
Once inside, it takes a very new perspective.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.600
Almost isometric looking, but not quite.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.100
You'll need to stealthily drop the gift under the tree,

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.060
get the key and then leave through the locked front door

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.580
without waking anybody up.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.160
I guess Santa can't climb up ladders, only down them.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.480
Somewhat creepily, there are evil zombie
children who are waling around the house,

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.680
opening and closing doors behind them.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.360
Supposedly, they're sleepwalking,

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.720
but calling them zombies is much more enjoyable.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.300
Really adds to that whole Christmas spirit.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.360
If you touch them, they will make you explode.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.240
Now that is freakin' awesome.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.380
If at any point along the way you touch
any of these obstacles inside the house,

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.000
you will leave that place and go on to the next one.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.880
I guess Santa's coming down and be
like, "Okay, ho ho, Merry Christmas!"

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.860
And then something happens and he's
like, "Ah, screw that, you ain't gettin' crap!"

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:40.920
And he just leaves.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.340
Who knew Santa's job was so
stressful, not to mention deadly.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.940
Hope he has good insurance.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.480
There are other houses which are
too small to go down the chimney,

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.780
so you'll have to drop presents like
bombs into their chimney stack instead.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.600
The gameplay gets harder as it goes along, of course,

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.980
and it just loops between the different house types.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.080
Sometimes, though, instead of angels,
you'll get demons dropping presents instead.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.940
And you'll want to avoid those since Satanic minions

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.200
aren't really into the whole Christmas thing.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.120
They will take away what presents you have gained

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.860
if you touch one of their evil droppings.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.660
You know, I like Special Delivery.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.380
It's relatively simple and quickly and
progressively gets more difficult as you go along.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.820
That's jut what it should be. I mean,
I'm a fan of '80s-style arcade games,

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.880
and this one has all the points of making it a good one:

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.040
limited lives

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.080
and time,

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.520
a bunch of items to get,

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.400
varying enemies to learn,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.080
the goal of earning points,

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.340
solid gameplay and a bizarre plot.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.040
The controls are very tight

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.160
and only when on the ladders did
I really run into much of a problem.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.840
Sometimes it just seemed to lag a little bit

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.620
and you ended up getting toasted.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.980
But really, there's not much
wrong with the game at all,

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.860
and it's one of the earliest
Christmas games that I know of.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.460
So, for some different retro Christmas entertainment,

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.560
you may want to check out
Special Delivery on the Atari 8-bit

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.300
or one of the other 8-bit computers that it's on.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.580
It is indeed chaos of the Christmas variety.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.640
But it's short-lived fun arcade chaos,

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.520
which is just the way I like it.
