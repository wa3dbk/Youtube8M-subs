00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.060
 Servus people welcome to a new one 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.160
 video our tokio travel start 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.480
 essential security controls and 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.410
 By now we are in duty free 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.969
 Area 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.350
 I think even a passport control 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.869
 in front of us are also relatively well in the 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.480
 time still rail strike and then 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.730
 driving with the train and sugar 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.590
 belated and and we have it 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.920
 We made it on time at the airport 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.040
 arrived suitcase delivered everything drum 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.600
 and turn on and nice if he is still one 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.260
 bit hungry in any case 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.370
 to eat something else 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.910
 you definitely want to stay in 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.230
 VIP area a bit shopping in addition 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.700
 I probably did not know 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.970
 alcohol was not there always been more 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.190
 exotic 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.350
 So I do not really need anything then 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.190
 because of the prices it takes 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.050
 that's nothing great 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.200
 maybe a little chocolate for 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.990
 take the flight or so but well me 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.030
 definitely have such a hunger somehow 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.450
 Here's a sandwich or something 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.450
 to pick something 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.100
 You could also like burger king 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.660
 Holiday since you can only in any case 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.850
 a little bit more I have here now 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.960
 nobody saw no citizen 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.700
 brother but maybe behind the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.720
 passport controls the screen no 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.729
 have accordingly then goes on 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.110
 from frankfurt to istanbul have one 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.040
 stay a bit and at some point 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.040
 at night it goes on 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.080
 tokio in total i believe in 20 hours in 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.390
 the 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.330
 In the air, I think so around the turn 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.880
 not quite but very long 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:51.250
 long but yes 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.490
 what needs that must therefore continue 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.490
 it's 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.230
 to say that in genetic long ago 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.690
 should begin 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.810
 but it does not have that yet 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.810
 Yes 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.520
 Here we go 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.420
 and 4 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.420
 this 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.209
 Now the have heard that Roddick 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.209
 finally starts 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.380
 half an hour late accordingly 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.380
 the bears are going 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.360
 the snake 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.160
 the people stretch occurs since 1 go 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.770
 it goes in the direction 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.600
 we have not arrived yet 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.350
 really we have our stopover 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.110
 competed 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.240
 namely in istanbul ataturk airport 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.880
 By the way, very very nice airport 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.260
 so i wish that 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.810
 it's all right and so 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.959
 beautifully constructed the four areas he is 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.640
 enormously beautiful, there is a huge selection 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.819
 Things that you can buy all the way 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.999
 different in frankfurt 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:04.670
 We have two hours here 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:09.969
 Stay and then it works 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:14.239
 the direction of tokyo will be eleven hours 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:17.930
 flew my life and have easy 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.939
 and feel good because I am 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.409
 never flew so long ago but what 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:24.019
 fashion instead of mother I'm really happy 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:25.790
 on tokyo we already have a few 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.889
 people also hit tokyo 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:32.359
 fly with the interest found and 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:34.159
 even a japanese yano means he plays 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:36.620
 soccer near stuttgart 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:38.959
 because Dorndorf maybe know that 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.109
 one or the other of you pretty nice 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:46.340
 young guy and even next to us in the 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:48.620
 plane and possibly will have 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.840
 already met someone in japan 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.590
 We're on tour with it a bit 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.790
 will go 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.010
 that's definitely cool with 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:04:00.810
 being on the move is one 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:03.120
 yes enormously good thing now even one 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.240
 Maybe I'll come back 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:11.000
 grow at star 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:13.430
 the latte or something and will be quite 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.960
 important fact now, however, to 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.550
 But then we will be a sweatpants 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.560
 wear because for the eleven hours 

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:21.650
 I really need something comfortable 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.320
 many are in tokyo at last 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.050
 landed after eleven hours flight was 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.710
 extremely exhausting that eleven hours in the 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.660
 plane 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.580
 I do not want to be a mimosa now but 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.200
 that does not work on the bones 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.540
 you can not say otherwise but 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.490
 we flew turkish trouble and 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.380
 the service was really very good 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.710
 So I can only really airline 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.750
 recommend that is not for nothing three 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.760
 or four times in a row europe 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.140
 So the best airline has become fast 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.900
 pot in any case 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:53.120
 and now that we are in the marita am 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.720
 airport now have our money here 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.570
 changed 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.230
 the big thing would be good now 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.690
 did not think 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.090
 usually the course is at the airport 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.190
 a little bit worse and 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.949
 then we have several options like 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.980
 we go to tokyo in the city 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.820
 you can come with various 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.020
 fast trains we have now 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.449
 decided for bus because it is easy 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:18.110
 Cheap is only 1000 yen that is 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:21.050
 converted to 78 euros and the ride 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:24.100
 takes 60 to 70 minutes and we have 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:28.190
 We also have a three days 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:30.860
 subway ticket got something on offer here 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.590
 that is brand new i had myself 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:36.229
 read in a bit earlier 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.340
 the underground mediensysteme troupe is a 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:38.690
 bit complicated because of it 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.950
 There are different companies 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:45.100
 not like Germany where it is 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:49.160
 somehow equal to the rmv or the 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:51.169
 hwb or kvg and so on and so forth 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:55.669
 are in different associations in the 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:58.910
 there are two regions and you have to 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:01.600
 always buy single tickets I thought 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.919
 but now there are new ones 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.690
 ticket with the one stop the complete 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:07.070
 through a system 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.980
 from the different ones 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:12.460
 operators and they are also unlimited 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:16.730
 So you can drive the whole day 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:18.110
 Twice three days tickets brought and 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.970
 that is really good because it is 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.940
 just not that complicated 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.590
 I hope you can follow me and ours 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.440
 bus is coming with us right now 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:30.110
 drive into the city 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:31.760
 tocio centralstation and from it 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.670
 then either walk or go 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.430
 then take the metro to our 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.230
 hotel and then we look what we got 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:44.550
 In the evening, we'll be there 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:48.720
 bit of jetlag actually with us now 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:51.660
 i believe 14 o'clock it should be in now 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.930
 Germany and we have 21 here 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:57.360
 clock would have to look something like that 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:07:02.600
 the time difference of nine hours 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:05.670
 and accordingly we will see if we 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:10.610
 wake up a bit longer during the night 

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:14.130
 stay up and get up for the morning though 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:16.460
 to all not further blogs us 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:19.460
 make us first on the way direction 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.460
 Tokyo
