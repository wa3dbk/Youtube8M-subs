coins<00:03:19.980> before<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.550> team<00:03:20.730> of<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:20.910> season<00:03:21.300> I

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
coins before the team of the season I

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.870 
coins before the team of the season I
would<00:03:21.960> recommend<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:22.560> go<00:03:22.710> by<00:03:22.950> and<00:03:23.220> both<00:03:23.550> team

would recommend you go by and both team
the<00:03:24.030> season<00:03:24.390> is<00:03:24.570> just<00:03:24.600> around<00:03:25.020> the<00:03:25.200> corner<00:03:25.650> and

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
the season is just around the corner and

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.680 
the season is just around the corner and
with<00:03:26.340> it<00:03:26.520> just<00:03:26.760> around<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.090> corner<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.480> Hulk

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
with it just around the corner and Hulk

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.750 
with it just around the corner and Hulk
definitely<00:03:28.470> a<00:03:28.500> shoo-in<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:29.010> get<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.250> team<00:03:29.550> of<00:03:29.670> the
