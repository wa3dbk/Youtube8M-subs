00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.479 
is there literature it's him that's
actually<00:02:39.680> why<00:02:39.800> I<00:02:39.830> did<00:02:39.980> it<00:02:40.040> this<00:02:40.130> was<00:02:40.280> kind<00:02:40.459> of

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
actually why I did it this was kind of

00:02:40.489 --> 00:03:00.090 
actually why I did it this was kind of
mobile<00:02:40.730> iterating<00:02:50.110> I'm<00:02:51.110> totally<00:02:51.470> alliterated

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.229 

let's<00:03:01.100> hear<00:03:01.220> some<00:03:01.370> of<00:03:01.400> this<00:03:01.519> ghetto<00:03:01.760> ice<00:03:01.970> this

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
let's hear some of this ghetto ice this

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.070 
let's hear some of this ghetto ice this
is<00:03:02.360> the<00:03:02.480> ice<00:03:02.600> that<00:03:02.840> melted<00:03:03.290> into<00:03:03.440> a<00:03:03.560> big<00:03:03.769> old

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
is the ice that melted into a big old

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:11.699 
is the ice that melted into a big old
melted<00:03:06.080> thing<00:03:08.019> you<00:03:09.019> put<00:03:09.140> in<00:03:09.230> a<00:03:09.290> bag<00:03:09.470> melts<00:03:10.370> down

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
melted thing you put in a bag melts down

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.810 
melted thing you put in a bag melts down
so<00:03:12.709> here's<00:03:12.920> her<00:03:13.450> actually<00:03:14.450> makes<00:03:14.600> a<00:03:14.690> lock<00:03:15.820> root

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
so here's her actually makes a lock root

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.880 
so here's her actually makes a lock root
beer<00:03:17.090> float<00:03:17.720> I<00:03:17.930> suppose<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.230> pirate's<00:03:18.709> float

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
beer float I suppose a pirate's float

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.289 
beer float I suppose a pirate's float
would<00:03:19.010> be<00:03:19.239> mainly<00:03:20.239> a<00:03:20.480> small<00:03:21.320> amount<00:03:21.620> of<00:03:22.299> other

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
would be mainly a small amount of other

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.650 
would be mainly a small amount of other
things<00:03:23.690> on<00:03:23.900> top<00:03:23.930> of<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.200> root<00:03:24.320> beer<00:03:24.470> right

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
things on top of the root beer right

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.210 
things on top of the root beer right
yeah<00:03:26.690> but<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.320> ice<00:03:27.440> cream<00:03:27.680> is<00:03:27.799> typically<00:03:28.160> a

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
yeah but the ice cream is typically a

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.710 
yeah but the ice cream is typically a
less<00:03:28.549> quantity<00:03:29.030> than<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.269> root<00:03:29.420> beer<00:03:29.570> in<00:03:29.660> this

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
less quantity than the root beer in this

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.979 
less quantity than the root beer in this
case<00:03:30.100> that's<00:03:31.100> true<00:03:31.400> I<00:03:32.859> think<00:03:33.859> we<00:03:33.950> have<00:03:34.070> more<00:03:34.310> of

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
case that's true I think we have more of

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.420 
case that's true I think we have more of
the<00:03:35.989> goody-goodies<00:03:36.560> and<00:03:36.769> less<00:03:36.859> of<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.130> actual

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
the goody-goodies and less of the actual

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.900 
the goody-goodies and less of the actual
soda<00:03:38.709> so<00:03:39.709> it's<00:03:39.799> boring<00:03:40.130> to<00:03:40.250> look<00:03:40.370> at<00:03:40.549> kind<00:03:40.880> of

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
soda so it's boring to look at kind of

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.270 
soda so it's boring to look at kind of
figured<00:03:41.209> that<00:03:41.239> was<00:03:41.570> gonna<00:03:41.690> happen<00:03:42.109> because<00:03:42.280> it

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
figured that was gonna happen because it

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.180 
figured that was gonna happen because it
is<00:03:43.400> just<00:03:43.670> coke<00:03:43.940> but<00:03:44.890> sometimes<00:03:45.890> she's<00:03:46.070> gonna

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
is just coke but sometimes she's gonna

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:52.820 
is just coke but sometimes she's gonna
make<00:03:46.400> a<00:03:46.430> soda<00:03:46.609> based<00:03:46.790> recipe

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.700 

it<00:03:53.830> makes<00:03:54.010> me<00:03:54.160> go<00:03:54.250> argh

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
it makes me go argh

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:02.690 
it makes me go argh
nothing<00:03:56.710> girls<00:03:57.000> no<00:03:58.000> um<00:03:58.570> it's<00:04:00.930> gonna<00:04:01.930> actually
