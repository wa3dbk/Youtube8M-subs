important in English language and when

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.390 
important in English language and when
we<00:00:14.460> are<00:00:14.580> actually<00:00:14.790> saying<00:00:15.269> English<00:00:15.630> language

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
we are actually saying English language

we are actually saying English language
what<00:00:17.400> we<00:00:17.609> have<00:00:17.730> what<00:00:18.090> we<00:00:18.270> mean<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.890> uh<00:00:20.000> how<00:00:21.000> to

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
what we have what we mean is uh how to

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.670 
what we have what we mean is uh how to
use<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.810> language<00:00:23.180> when<00:00:24.180> we<00:00:24.330> are<00:00:24.689> using<00:00:25.470> a

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
use the language when we are using a

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.380 
use the language when we are using a
language<00:00:25.890> when<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.580> works<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:28.519> we<00:00:29.519> always<00:00:29.789> use

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
language when it works and we always use

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.240 
language when it works and we always use
the<00:00:31.109> words<00:00:31.380> which<00:00:31.800> we<00:00:31.980> know<00:00:33.770> after<00:00:34.770> we

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
the words which we know after we

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.010 
the words which we know after we
understand<00:00:38.250> these<00:00:38.460> words<00:00:40.010> we<00:00:41.010> can<00:00:41.690> name<00:00:42.690> them

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
understand these words we can name them

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.630 
understand these words we can name them
and<00:00:43.730> we<00:00:44.730> can<00:00:45.000> actually<00:00:45.649> put<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.950> in-depth

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
and we can actually put in the in-depth

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.700 
and we can actually put in the in-depth
put<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.239> sentence<00:00:49.039> which<00:00:50.090> they<00:00:51.090> make<00:00:51.710> sense

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
put in a sentence which they make sense

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.090 
put in a sentence which they make sense
and<00:00:53.239> in<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.809> sentence<00:00:55.730> they<00:00:56.730> function<00:00:57.239> and

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
and in that sentence they function and

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.040 
and in that sentence they function and
before<00:00:59.100> we<00:00:59.430> see<00:00:59.789> them<00:01:00.000> functioning<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:00.960> a

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
before we see them functioning in a

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.520 
before we see them functioning in a
sentence<00:01:01.559> we<00:01:02.340> cannot<00:01:02.699> actually<00:01:03.229> describe<00:01:04.229> or

word in English as I have said or I have
explained<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.260> our<00:01:13.920> previous<00:01:14.369> lessons<00:01:16.790> we

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
explained it in our previous lessons we

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.100 
explained it in our previous lessons we
cannot<00:01:19.130> say<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.340> meaning<00:01:20.729> or<00:01:20.909> we<00:01:21.840> cannot

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
cannot say the meaning or we cannot

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.399 
cannot say the meaning or we cannot
determine<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:23.400> meaning<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.970> word<00:01:24.409> unless

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
determine the meaning of a word unless

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.740 
determine the meaning of a word unless
we<00:01:26.250> see<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.360> sentence<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.850> we<00:01:29.850> see<00:01:30.509> it

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
we see it in a sentence and we see it

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.340 
we see it in a sentence and we see it
functioning<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.680> sentence<00:01:33.079> most<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
functioning in that sentence most of the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.539 
functioning in that sentence most of the
times<00:01:34.650> when<00:01:35.250> language<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.270> started<00:01:37.220> let<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.369> be

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
times when language is started let it be

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.499 
times when language is started let it be
a<00:01:38.850> child<00:01:39.540> who<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.290> learning<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.979> language

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
a child who is learning the language

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.230 
a child who is learning the language
from<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.630> beginning<00:01:43.049> or<00:01:43.340> from<00:01:44.340> his<00:01:44.759> mother's

from the beginning or from his mother's
tank<00:01:45.680> where<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.710> child<00:01:47.070> learns<00:01:47.840> starts<00:01:48.840> from

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
tank where the child learns starts from

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.660 
tank where the child learns starts from
the<00:01:49.880> names<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.329> we<00:01:51.540> know<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.280> that<00:01:53.280> child

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
the names that we know and that child

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.459 
the names that we know and that child
learns<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.780> names<00:01:56.119> which<00:01:57.119> we<00:01:57.329> call<00:01:57.570> an<00:01:57.840> in

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
learns the names which we call an in

learns the names which we call an in
grammar<00:01:59.000> nouns<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:02.250> nouns<00:02:02.490> are<00:02:02.880> parts<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.360> the

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
grammar nouns the nouns are parts of the

grammar nouns the nouns are parts of the
speech<00:02:04.369> which<00:02:05.369> we<00:02:05.549> are<00:02:05.640> learning<00:02:07.190> what<00:02:08.190> they

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
speech which we are learning what they

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.890 
speech which we are learning what they
are<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.940> how<00:02:09.840> we<00:02:09.899> use<00:02:10.379> them<00:02:11.300> today<00:02:12.300> in<00:02:12.720> our

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
are and how we use them today in our

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.590 
are and how we use them today in our
lesson

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
lesson

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.630 
lesson
today<00:02:15.600> our<00:02:16.050> lessons<00:02:16.710> about<00:02:17.070> parts<00:02:17.850> of<00:02:17.940> speech

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
today our lessons about parts of speech

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:26.020 
today our lessons about parts of speech
what's<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.820> parts<00:02:21.150> of<00:02:21.300> speech<00:02:22.190> we<00:02:23.190> speak<00:02:23.610> and

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.650 

we<00:02:27.030> have<00:02:27.330> different<00:02:28.110> parts<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.710> speech<00:02:29.660> for

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
we have different parts of speech for

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.960 
we have different parts of speech for
example<00:02:31.200> when<00:02:32.130> we<00:02:32.280> are<00:02:32.310> talking<00:02:32.840> we<00:02:33.840> use<00:02:34.080> nouns

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
example when we are talking we use nouns

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.210 
example when we are talking we use nouns
we<00:02:35.970> use<00:02:36.000> pronouns<00:02:37.670> we<00:02:38.670> use<00:02:38.910> adjectives<00:02:40.010> we<00:02:41.010> use

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
we use pronouns we use adjectives we use

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.840 
we use pronouns we use adjectives we use
conjunctions<00:02:42.260> we<00:02:43.260> use<00:02:43.560> prepositions<00:02:46.550> we<00:02:47.550> use

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
conjunctions we use prepositions we use

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.030 
conjunctions we use prepositions we use
exclamation<00:02:48.510> marks<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:50.790> soul<00:02:51.650> so<00:02:52.650> these

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
exclamation marks and the soul so these

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.900 
exclamation marks and the soul so these
are<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.459> main<00:02:54.090> parts<00:02:54.540> of<00:02:54.660> speech<00:02:55.020> and

connecting these parts of a speech we

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.840 
connecting these parts of a speech we
always<00:03:00.690> get<00:03:01.130> our<00:03:02.780> sentences<00:03:03.780> or<00:03:04.850> statements
