want to reset the down feed we could

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.680 
want to reset the down feed we could
watch<00:02:48.620> it<00:02:48.650> stroke<00:02:49.160> a<00:02:49.190> little<00:02:49.460> bit

right<00:02:53.290> now<00:02:53.440> it's<00:02:53.620> sparking<00:02:54.100> out<00:02:54.250> but<00:02:54.720> we'll

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
right now it's sparking out but we'll

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:08.200 
right now it's sparking out but we'll
reset<00:02:56.490> reset<00:02:57.490> the<00:02:57.610> machine<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:58.180> zero

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:14.850 

and<00:03:08.660> each<00:03:09.560> cross<00:03:10.400> pass<00:03:12.250> of<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.430> saddle<00:03:13.910> the

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
and each cross pass of the saddle the

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.370 
and each cross pass of the saddle the
head<00:03:15.860> will<00:03:15.950> feed<00:03:16.190> down<00:03:16.570> however<00:03:17.570> much<00:03:18.020> you<00:03:18.200> set

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
head will feed down however much you set

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:37.960

upon

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.820 

so<00:03:38.540> that's<00:03:38.840> the<00:03:39.140> machine<00:03:41.680> hopefully<00:03:42.680> you'll

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
so that's the machine hopefully you'll

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.940 
so that's the machine hopefully you'll
think<00:03:42.860> it's<00:03:43.220> as<00:03:43.400> good<00:03:43.460> as<00:03:43.700> we<00:03:43.820> do<00:03:43.970> and<00:03:44.710> if<00:03:45.710> you'd

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
think it's as good as we do and if you'd

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.140 
think it's as good as we do and if you'd
