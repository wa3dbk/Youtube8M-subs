animation<00:01:12.000> lowercase<00:01:12.869> B<00:01:13.970> so<00:01:14.970> erase<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.720> jelly

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
animation lowercase B so erase the jelly

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.530 
animation lowercase B so erase the jelly
bean<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.520> replace<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.670> with<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.880> lowercase<00:01:18.210> B

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.660 
bean and replace that with a lowercase B
and<00:01:18.770> then<00:01:19.770> you're<00:01:19.920> going<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.100> want<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.430> move

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
and then you're going to want to move

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:30.050 
and then you're going to want to move
this<00:01:21.830> to<00:01:22.830> system<00:01:23.400> media<00:01:26.479> system<00:01:28.189> media<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:30.030> I

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
this to system media system media so I

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.960 
this to system media system media so I
had<00:01:30.360> tried<00:01:30.659> another<00:01:31.170> one<00:01:31.380> earlier<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.729> didn't

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
had tried another one earlier it didn't

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.800 
had tried another one earlier it didn't
work<00:01:33.090> very<00:01:33.119> well<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.479> I'll<00:01:33.659> delete<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.140> one

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
work very well so I'll delete that one

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.550 
work very well so I'll delete that one
yep<00:01:37.759> we'll<00:01:38.759> need<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.090> mount<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.320> click

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
yep we'll need to mount that so click

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.620 
yep we'll need to mount that so click
that<00:01:40.710> little<00:01:40.860> button<00:01:41.070> there<00:01:41.450> before<00:01:42.450> we<00:01:42.540> can

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
that little button there before we can

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.010 
that little button there before we can
do<00:01:42.720> anything<00:01:42.750> in<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.259> system<00:01:43.740> folder<00:01:45.020> okay

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
do anything in the system folder okay

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.240 
do anything in the system folder okay
and<00:01:46.170> then<00:01:46.259> we'll<00:01:46.380> paste<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.860> one<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.159> we

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
and then we'll paste the one that we

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.999 
and then we'll paste the one that we
just<00:01:47.280> grabbed<00:01:47.820> from<00:01:48.090> our<00:01:48.240> SD<00:01:48.540> card<00:01:48.810> now<00:01:49.560> all<00:01:49.890> we
