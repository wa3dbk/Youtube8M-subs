OS X so we know about this because of a

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.700 
OS X so we know about this because of a
second<00:00:38.670> generation<00:00:39.230> development<00:00:40.230> kit<00:00:40.500> and

second generation development kit and

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.889 
second generation development kit and
there<00:00:41.489> have<00:00:41.640> been<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.820> few<00:00:41.910> thing<00:00:42.239> screenshots

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
there have been a few thing screenshots

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.420 
there have been a few thing screenshots
so<00:00:43.110> check<00:00:43.290> out<00:00:43.440> operate<00:00:43.770> gaming<00:00:44.070> tech<00:00:44.219> and

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
so check out operate gaming tech and

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.299 
so check out operate gaming tech and
I'll<00:00:44.489> place<00:00:44.730> them<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.149> there<00:00:45.510> but<00:00:46.410> we're<00:00:47.160> not

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
I'll place them on there but we're not

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.799 
I'll place them on there but we're not
quite<00:00:47.489> sure<00:00:47.640> whether<00:00:48.239> you're<00:00:48.420> going<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.690> be

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
quite sure whether you're going to be

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.979 
quite sure whether you're going to be
able<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.320> use<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.010> other<00:00:50.190> OS<00:00:51.090> functions<00:00:51.780> on

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
able to use the other OS functions on

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.010 
able to use the other OS functions on
the<00:00:52.739> ps4<00:00:53.100> much<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.449> could<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.899> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
the ps4 much like you could on the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.510 
the ps4 much like you could on the
PlayStation<00:00:55.530> 3<00:00:55.559> way<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.980> course<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.370> could

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
PlayStation 3 way of course you could

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.400 
PlayStation 3 way of course you could
install<00:00:56.969> an<00:00:57.270> operating<00:00:57.420> system<00:00:58.140> onto<00:00:58.230> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
install an operating system onto the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.010 
install an operating system onto the
console<00:00:58.890> it's<00:00:59.730> unlikely<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.570> you'll<00:01:00.870> be

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
console it's unlikely that you'll be

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.619 
console it's unlikely that you'll be
able<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.320> do<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.739> simply<00:01:02.070> because<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:03.090> the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
able to do that simply because of the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.390 
able to do that simply because of the
security<00:01:04.199> concerns<00:01:04.559> maybe<00:01:04.920> if<00:01:05.070> they<00:01:05.220> can

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
security concerns maybe if they can

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.120 
security concerns maybe if they can
better<00:01:05.580> lock<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:05.939> down<00:01:06.390> or<00:01:07.140> suffix<00:01:07.619> similar

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
better lock it down or suffix similar

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.370 
better lock it down or suffix similar
but<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.400> course<00:01:08.610> as<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.909> said<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.049> moment

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
but of course as I said just a moment

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.500 
but of course as I said just a moment
ago<00:01:10.470> there<00:01:10.799> were<00:01:10.950> massive<00:01:11.520> security<00:01:11.820> concerns

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
ago there were massive security concerns

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.940 
ago there were massive security concerns
and<00:01:12.720> certainly<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.020> course<00:01:13.080> removed<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.860> from

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
and certainly of course removed it from

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.429 
and certainly of course removed it from
the<00:01:14.100> ps3<00:01:14.369> if<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.360> update<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.840> because<00:01:16.320> they

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
the ps3 if you update it because they

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.080 
the ps3 if you update it because they
were<00:01:16.500> worried<00:01:16.830> about<00:01:16.890> piracy<00:01:17.549> as<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.850> turns

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
were worried about piracy as it turns

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.660 
were worried about piracy as it turns
out<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.390> course<00:01:18.420> ps3<00:01:19.229> piracy<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.310> still<00:01:20.490> pretty

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
out of course ps3 piracy is still pretty

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.140 
out of course ps3 piracy is still pretty
prevalent<00:01:21.060> regardless<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.580> when<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.729> boot<00:01:23.939> up

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
prevalent regardless so when you boot up

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.190 
to see an ever access to now a lot of
the<00:02:02.610> stuff<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.060> actually<00:02:03.149> runs<00:02:03.600> on<00:02:03.810> Linux

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
the stuff that actually runs on Linux

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.100 
the stuff that actually runs on Linux
can<00:02:04.619> actually<00:02:04.979> run<00:02:05.219> on<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> freebsd<00:02:06.509> they<00:02:07.049> do

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
can actually run on a freebsd they do

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.990 
can actually run on a freebsd they do
share<00:02:07.500> some<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.959> base

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
share some of the base

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.160 
share some of the base
similarities<00:02:12.000> anyway<00:02:12.510> but<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.780> can<00:02:12.930> actually

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
similarities anyway but you can actually

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.340 
similarities anyway but you can actually
use<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.470> built-in<00:02:14.160> compatibility<00:02:15.120> layer<00:02:15.390> so

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
use a built-in compatibility layer so

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.960 
use a built-in compatibility layer so
what<00:02:16.470> exactly<00:02:16.620> can<00:02:16.950> run<00:02:17.280> on<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:17.640> well<00:02:17.850> the

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
what exactly can run on this well the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.240 
what exactly can run on this well the
Linux<00:02:18.300> compatibility<00:02:19.050> there<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.830> can<00:02:20.010> use

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
Linux compatibility there you can use

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.610 
Linux compatibility there you can use
stuff<00:02:20.550> like<00:02:20.670> even<00:02:20.970> Adobe<00:02:21.480> Acrobat<00:02:23.060> matte<00:02:24.060> all

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620

and bobs of course that's not really an

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.690 
and bobs of course that's not really an
issue<00:02:37.140> for<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.620> PlayStation<00:02:38.160> 4<00:02:38.190> but<00:02:38.580> it's

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
issue for the PlayStation 4 but it's

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.420 
issue for the PlayStation 4 but it's
still<00:02:38.850> quite<00:02:39.090> nice<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.540> see<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:40.170> would<00:02:40.950> not<00:02:41.220> be

still quite nice to see I would not be

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.010 
still quite nice to see I would not be
surprised<00:02:41.820> at<00:02:41.970> all<00:02:42.120> if<00:02:42.180> we're<00:02:42.480> gonna<00:02:42.600> see<00:02:42.870> this
