00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.869 
stuff if I can't do much and now we have
a<00:02:58.590> saddle<00:02:58.889> so<00:02:59.159> now<00:02:59.280> we<00:02:59.340> can<00:02:59.489> actually<00:02:59.579> have<00:02:59.849> a

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
a saddle so now we can actually have a

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.970 
a saddle so now we can actually have a
horse<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.329> stuff<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:01.079> we<00:03:01.169> have<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.319> subtle<00:03:01.799> and

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
horse and stuff so we have a subtle and

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.099 
horse and stuff so we have a subtle and
a<00:03:02.040> horse<00:03:02.250> so<00:03:02.819> we<00:03:02.909> could<00:03:03.060> do<00:03:03.150> that<00:03:03.299> and<00:03:03.840> as<00:03:04.019> you

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
a horse so we could do that and as you

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:05.330 
a horse so we could do that and as you
can<00:03:04.260> see<00:03:04.290> you<00:03:04.620> already<00:03:04.829> sporting<00:03:05.099> their

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
can see you already sporting their

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.189 
can see you already sporting their
horses<00:03:05.579> as<00:03:05.849> you<00:03:06.449> come<00:03:06.569> all<00:03:06.689> the<00:03:06.810> way<00:03:06.840> up<00:03:06.930> here

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:07.199 
horses as you come all the way up here

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:09.459 
horses as you come all the way up here
if<00:03:07.409> you<00:03:07.680> because<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.400> obviously<00:03:08.519> see<00:03:08.909> it<00:03:09.000> and

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:09.469 
if you because you obviously see it and

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:12.170 
if you because you obviously see it and
the<00:03:10.469> Mesa<00:03:10.680> biome<00:03:10.980> is<00:03:11.280> that<00:03:11.579> way<00:03:11.730> so<00:03:11.790> that<00:03:11.969> gives

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
the Mesa biome is that way so that gives

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.580 
the Mesa biome is that way so that gives
you<00:03:12.299> a<00:03:12.359> sense<00:03:12.540> of<00:03:12.689> scale<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.019> there's<00:03:13.439> like<00:03:13.560> a

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
you a sense of scale and there's like a

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.280 
you a sense of scale and there's like a
bigger<00:03:13.889> one<00:03:14.069> there<00:03:14.280> so<00:03:15.030> if<00:03:15.090> we<00:03:15.209> go<00:03:15.359> to<00:03:15.419> the
