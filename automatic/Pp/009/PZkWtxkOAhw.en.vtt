00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello my review today mix banker 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.870
 imagine eyes narrow slightly 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.420
 it has absolutely nothing with the if that 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.360
 Germans do which if I at least 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.410
 to have understood the text we are 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.570
 not hopes or vegetables or else 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.180
 nominal stuff 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:30.449
 it's about a love story 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.529
 the games of the men is playing the 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.890
 today's time 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.540
 and only that saw life except humans 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.270
 exist even more pierer 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.550
 they are next to the time 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.280
 customized 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.200
 yes it I should have said 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.080
 that stefan k 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.850
 I buy today is therefore a very 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:01:00.090
 another lack of review as usual if he 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.580
 Of course I would buy a book as a book 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.030
 has show 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:08.760
 than to find him where to buy which ones 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.110
 stronger it minimized in the comments to 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.110
 could write 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.980
 further I have to say this is 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.960
 he knows one of my top that is 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:27.440
 just because of the story because I have 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:31.300
 about 50 to 100 times that read 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.300
 in contrast to 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:43.430
 Apple has the option of his 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:46.960
 there is a lack of a new channel, too 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.960
 some here some 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:55.380
 until now it was absolutely the absolute one 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.380
 had best read of all 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:02.110
 it's all right with the drama and 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.110
 with the life story just 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.740
 that is also the special thing about it 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:13.080
 water cooler is simply nearly papers 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:16.770
 actually say yes about that 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.250
 People are standing because of my revenge 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.980
 opinion, simply 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.390
 more supernatural and just better of 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.530
 biology gentleman are better than that 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.750
 people here just in small 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.810
 come before groups and what they from the 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.340
 people are being discriminated against and with 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.459
 that family does not really care 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.280
 but you have to become families 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.910
 stood best even manga 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.020
 read through 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.440
 the time is one 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:53.730
 he needed getting used to but then did 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.220
 was so located over time 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.600
 actually quite interesting because he 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:03.210
 changes from the detailed as is typical 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.660
 comicstar libyan folk stone then in 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.000
 the childlike 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.450
 back to the detailed that is 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.270
 keep changing one another 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.430
 Pluspunkt is just that completely colored 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:21.560
 is not like the typical lack 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:24.380
 black and yes man i can for 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.800
 all who like to read love stories 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:30.340
 This is the coating of this 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:38.140
 not so critical bit maybe 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:40.280
 but packed with nice drama and yes 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.830
 I can only recommend that 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.630
 It's not that cheap or bad either 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.810
 because a few cut or something 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.840
 I do not need to worry about that 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.370
 at least I feel that way 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.290
 otherwise that would be my side too 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.600
 be it from me 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.170
 I thank you for watching and until 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.170
 next time
