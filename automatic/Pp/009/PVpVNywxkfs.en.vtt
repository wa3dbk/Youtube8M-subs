went toe-to-toe in this and let's be

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:43.350 
went toe-to-toe in this and let's be
real<00:02:42.940> here

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
real here

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.760 
real here
you<00:02:43.510> don't<00:02:43.660> go<00:02:43.750> toe-to-toe<00:02:43.990> with<00:02:44.230> Optimus

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
you don't go toe-to-toe with Optimus

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.410 
you don't go toe-to-toe with Optimus
Prime<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.010> expect<00:02:45.460> to<00:02:45.490> win<00:02:45.580> unless<00:02:45.910> you're

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420

all the Nemesis and I can just see
Megatron's<00:02:54.490> face<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:55.180> see<00:02:55.420> her<00:02:55.630> just<00:02:55.840> hit<00:02:55.960> the

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
Megatron's face to see her just hit the

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.840 
Megatron's face to see her just hit the
windshield<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.590> he<00:02:56.650> was<00:02:56.739> like<00:02:56.860> slowly<00:02:57.520> puts

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
windshield and he was like slowly puts

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.460 
windshield and he was like slowly puts
the<00:02:57.970> windshield<00:02:58.330> wiper<00:02:58.480> on<00:02:58.750> like<00:02:58.989> getting<00:02:59.230> a

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
the windshield wiper on like getting a

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.979 
the windshield wiper on like getting a
bug<00:02:59.680> off<00:02:59.890> the<00:03:00.130> windshield<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:00.910> after<00:03:01.780> being

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
bug off the windshield and after being

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.650 
bug off the windshield and after being
wiped<00:03:02.320> off<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.800> windshield<00:03:03.070> like<00:03:03.370> a<00:03:03.400> bug<00:03:03.790> she

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
wiped off the windshield like a bug she

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.380 
wiped off the windshield like a bug she
did<00:03:04.840> not<00:03:05.110> return<00:03:05.500> to<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.709> ship<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.310> so<00:03:06.910> not

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
did not return to the ship and so not

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.199 
did not return to the ship and so not
much<00:03:07.570> is<00:03:07.750> known<00:03:08.020> from<00:03:08.320> her<00:03:08.470> after<00:03:08.709> that<00:03:09.130> so<00:03:09.970> we

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
much is known from her after that so we

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.150 
much is known from her after that so we
can<00:03:10.360> only<00:03:10.450> guess<00:03:10.900> maybe<00:03:11.350> she<00:03:11.560> just<00:03:11.739> got<00:03:11.860> sick

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
can only guess maybe she just got sick

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.290 
can only guess maybe she just got sick
of<00:03:12.310> Starscream<00:03:13.650> so<00:03:14.650> we<00:03:14.800> are<00:03:14.920> up<00:03:15.070> by<00:03:15.250> 200<00:03:16.180> in

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
of Starscream so we are up by 200 in

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.960 
of Starscream so we are up by 200 in
this<00:03:16.480> one<00:03:16.720> so<00:03:17.290> come<00:03:17.530> on<00:03:17.739> Autobots<00:03:18.340> your

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
outnumbering us and you're losing to a

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.100 
outnumbering us and you're losing to a
bunch<00:03:20.890> of<00:03:21.010> girls<00:03:21.640> and<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:22.690> reason<00:03:22.900> I<00:03:22.959> said

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
bunch of girls and the reason I said

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.600 
bunch of girls and the reason I said
that<00:03:23.170> is<00:03:23.320> I<00:03:23.440> saw<00:03:23.650> a<00:03:23.680> bunch<00:03:23.950> of<00:03:24.040> different<00:03:24.370> slip

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
that is I saw a bunch of different slip

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.630 
that is I saw a bunch of different slip
screws<00:03:24.880> in<00:03:25.180> this<00:03:25.390> match<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:26.050> I<00:03:26.680> think<00:03:26.739> there

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
screws in this match and I think there

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.940 
screws in this match and I think there
one<00:03:27.940> is<00:03:28.060> right<00:03:28.300> next<00:03:28.570> to<00:03:28.660> me<00:03:28.810> looks<00:03:29.200> identical

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
one is right next to me looks identical

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.050 
one is right next to me looks identical
and<00:03:32.950> then<00:03:33.070> you<00:03:33.160> see<00:03:33.280> you<00:03:33.370> back<00:03:33.580> in<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.790> free

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.310 
and then you see you back in the free
kill<00:03:34.270> tree<00:03:34.450> and<00:03:34.750> then<00:03:34.900> there's<00:03:35.080> always<00:03:35.200> a
