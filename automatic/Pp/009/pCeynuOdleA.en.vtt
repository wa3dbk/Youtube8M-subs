00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
the film so I just get the 50 pack on
Amazon<00:01:16.049> for<00:01:17.119> $35<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.360> think<00:01:18.570> my<00:01:18.720> friend<00:01:19.049> did<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
Amazon for $35 I think my friend did the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.630 
Amazon for $35 I think my friend did the
math<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.130> was<00:01:20.250> 67<00:01:20.909> cents<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.420> photo<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.650> I

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
math that it was 67 cents a photo and I

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.390 
math that it was 67 cents a photo and I
think<00:01:23.939> that's<00:01:24.570> actually<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:25.350> better<00:01:25.680> deal<00:01:26.070> than

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
think that's actually a better deal than

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.030 
think that's actually a better deal than
the<00:01:27.390> old<00:01:27.570> Polaroids<00:01:27.930> because<00:01:28.530> they'd<00:01:28.710> be<00:01:28.770> like

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
the old Polaroids because they'd be like

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.819 
the old Polaroids because they'd be like
big<00:01:29.310> squares<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.420> they'd<00:01:31.170> be<00:01:31.229> about<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.530> dollar

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
big squares and they'd be about a dollar

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.520 
big squares and they'd be about a dollar
more<00:01:32.250> per<00:01:32.280> photo<00:01:32.790> but<00:01:33.360> anyways<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.170> photos

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.550 
love how they're physical and I love the
border<00:04:40.819> and<00:04:41.270> there<00:04:41.719> is<00:04:41.840> a<00:04:41.870> space<00:04:42.229> for<00:04:42.259> you<00:04:42.530> to

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
border and there is a space for you to

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.230 
border and there is a space for you to
write<00:04:42.650> on<00:04:42.919> them<00:04:43.099> I<00:04:43.310> personally<00:04:43.849> like<00:04:43.969> it<00:04:44.000> when

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
write on them I personally like it when

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.510 
write on them I personally like it when
there's<00:04:44.449> nothing<00:04:44.990> written<00:04:45.439> on<00:04:45.740> it<00:04:45.919> and<00:04:46.069> it's

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
there's nothing written on it and it's

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.189 
there's nothing written on it and it's
just<00:04:46.610> plain<00:04:46.879> white<00:04:47.090> I<00:04:47.150> think<00:04:47.449> I'm<00:04:47.780> not<00:04:47.930> sure<00:04:48.169> I

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
just plain white I think I'm not sure I

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.529 
just plain white I think I'm not sure I
like<00:04:48.319> it<00:04:48.439> so<00:04:48.979> this<00:04:49.189> cannot<00:04:49.550> zoom<00:04:50.000> you<00:04:50.300> can't

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
like it so this cannot zoom you can't

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:52.510 
like it so this cannot zoom you can't
zoom<00:04:50.599> in<00:04:50.990> zoom<00:04:51.020> out<00:04:51.439> anything<00:04:51.949> like<00:04:52.069> that

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
zoom in zoom out anything like that

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.390 
zoom in zoom out anything like that
it's<00:04:52.639> a<00:04:53.030> pretty<00:04:53.330> simple<00:04:53.949> camera<00:04:54.949> it<00:04:55.159> works

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
it's a pretty simple camera it works

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.959 
it's a pretty simple camera it works
really<00:04:56.150> really<00:04:56.360> well<00:04:56.780> it<00:04:57.469> actually<00:04:58.190> it's<00:04:58.520> not

00:04:58.959 --> 00:04:58.969 
really really well it actually it's not

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:00.700 
really really well it actually it's not
very<00:04:59.240> blurry<00:04:59.629> what<00:04:59.900> I've<00:04:59.990> noticed<00:05:00.199> is<00:05:00.590> it

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
very blurry what I've noticed is it

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.379 
very blurry what I've noticed is it
actually<00:05:01.009> gets<00:05:01.159> kind<00:05:01.460> of<00:05:01.520> more<00:05:01.729> blurry<00:05:01.969> on<00:05:02.210> the

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:02.389 
actually gets kind of more blurry on the

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:04.959 
actually gets kind of more blurry on the
cloud<00:05:02.840> effect<00:05:03.080> if<00:05:03.800> you<00:05:04.219> wanted<00:05:04.610> more<00:05:04.759> of<00:05:04.819> like

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:04.969 
cloud effect if you wanted more of like

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:08.619 
cloud effect if you wanted more of like
a<00:05:05.000> blurry<00:05:05.479> kind<00:05:06.139> of<00:05:06.259> misty<00:05:06.979> photo<00:05:07.280> it's<00:05:07.969> really

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:08.629 
a blurry kind of misty photo it's really

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:11.170 
a blurry kind of misty photo it's really
really<00:05:08.960> good<00:05:09.250> focusing<00:05:10.250> I<00:05:10.460> know<00:05:10.580> that<00:05:10.909> when<00:05:11.150> I

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
really good focusing I know that when I

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.029 
really good focusing I know that when I
took<00:05:11.479> a<00:05:11.509> photo<00:05:11.780> close-up<00:05:12.259> of<00:05:12.349> some<00:05:12.530> daisies

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 
took a photo close-up of some daisies

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:16.119 
took a photo close-up of some daisies
he'll<00:05:13.250> show<00:05:13.520> you<00:05:13.580> it<00:05:14.300> did<00:05:14.750> not<00:05:14.960> focus<00:05:15.500> very

00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:16.129 
he'll show you it did not focus very

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:19.420 
he'll show you it did not focus very
well<00:05:16.370> on<00:05:17.120> them<00:05:17.750> but<00:05:18.319> it's<00:05:18.469> still<00:05:18.590> really<00:05:18.979> cute

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
well on them but it's still really cute

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.740 
well on them but it's still really cute
I<00:05:19.759> still<00:05:20.000> like<00:05:20.120> the<00:05:20.210> way<00:05:20.300> it<00:05:20.360> looks<00:05:20.539> it<00:05:20.719> just

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
I still like the way it looks it just

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.200 
I still like the way it looks it just
didn't<00:05:21.199> focus<00:05:21.710> super<00:05:22.279> super<00:05:22.520> well<00:05:22.699> that's

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
didn't focus super super well that's

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.689 
didn't focus super super well that's
probably<00:05:23.449> because<00:05:23.629> I<00:05:23.960> was<00:05:24.110> too<00:05:24.259> close<00:05:24.680> I<00:05:25.430> would

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:25.699 
probably because I was too close I would

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:28.089 
probably because I was too close I would
definitely<00:05:26.360> suggest<00:05:26.539> this<00:05:27.050> it<00:05:27.409> comes<00:05:27.680> with<00:05:27.919> a

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:28.099 
definitely suggest this it comes with a

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:28.480 
definitely suggest this it comes with a
strap

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
strap
