00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 good greetings well taking advantage of that 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.960
 the serious ones passed here on my house 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.780
 now let's take a look at 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.780
 these armed helicopters and here they are 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.600
 well this is one of the little ones is 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.759
 those who came back in sight not 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.299
 I know about armament but when I open the door 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:16.700
 While this might appear something is 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.190
 the first the first three do not 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.860
 I managed to record but according to me they were 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.409
 same this east that belongs to the 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.440
 first five if you see weapons 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:30.619
 they seem to be small projectiles a 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.049
 missile type I do not know in front it looks like a 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.640
 metra a machine gun equal when opening 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.530
 the door could have anything 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.110
 inside but still with that armament 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.929
 They could cope with one of his 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.780
 helicopters that they take out in the movies 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:47.119
 or not, it does not seem too small to have the 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.640
 possibility of maneuvering to avoid 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.530
 some good projectile and then I look 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.810
 this cloud you see how is that of the 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.759
 imagination or that you do not find 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.039
 ways in the clouds good there is a 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.289
 possibility is like a big snake 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.659
 it looks like it's going to gobble up the 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.759
 helicopter that has opposite no 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.110
 They may also appear as sides 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:10.509
 it says like a side view of a skull 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.880
 macabre garlic pretended to find like 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.590
 as a more lost face he had half 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.110
 forced and good there are the 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.190
 helicopters and what do you think if what 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.190
 arm or not arm 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.980
 Well, here are the helicopters 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.709
 of the air force I do not say that they are 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.860
 the best or the worst these 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.840
 I do not know if we have better I do not know but 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.239
 you who know we will have something more 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.579
 modern who would simply like 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.650
 know it so I like it and if I already know 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:33.610
 you know then comment and in any way 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.610
