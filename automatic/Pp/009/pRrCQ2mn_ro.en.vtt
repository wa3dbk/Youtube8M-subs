on<00:04:25.520> the<00:04:25.640> side<00:04:25.910> because<00:04:26.680> once<00:04:27.680> you<00:04:27.890> cut<00:04:28.160> the

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
on the side because once you cut the

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.250 
on the side because once you cut the
lace<00:04:29.080> you're<00:04:30.080> going<00:04:30.410> to<00:04:30.650> need<00:04:30.890> to<00:04:31.190> be<00:04:31.340> able<00:04:31.370> to

little curl into it like I said it is

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.060 
little curl into it like I said it is
heat<00:04:55.730> friendly<00:04:56.330> so<00:04:56.570> you<00:04:56.630> know<00:04:56.960> as<00:04:57.170> yourself<00:04:57.920> a

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
heat friendly so you know as yourself a

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.190 
heat friendly so you know as yourself a
little<00:04:58.190> bit<00:04:58.400> of<00:04:58.520> curls<00:04:58.850> it<00:04:59.120> was<00:04:59.600> kind<00:04:59.810> of<00:04:59.960> hot

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
little bit of curls it was kind of hot

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.830 
little bit of curls it was kind of hot
in<00:05:00.230> the<00:05:00.500> bathroom<00:05:01.070> I'm<00:05:01.550> so<00:05:01.880> that's<00:05:02.300> the<00:05:02.570> reason

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
in the bathroom I'm so that's the reason

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.180 
in the bathroom I'm so that's the reason
why<00:05:02.870> the<00:05:03.020> lighting<00:05:03.470> is<00:05:03.590> a<00:05:03.620> little<00:05:03.860> bit<00:05:03.980> dim

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
why the lighting is a little bit dim

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.400 
why the lighting is a little bit dim
because<00:05:05.060> I<00:05:05.090> had<00:05:05.420> to<00:05:05.570> turn<00:05:05.780> off<00:05:05.960> all<00:05:06.200> those

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
because I had to turn off all those

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.260 
because I had to turn off all those
bright<00:05:06.710> lights<00:05:06.740> that<00:05:07.250> were<00:05:07.400> surrounding<00:05:07.730> me

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
bright lights that were surrounding me

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.660 
bright lights that were surrounding me
just<00:05:08.990> because<00:05:09.170> I<00:05:09.470> was<00:05:09.620> really<00:05:10.010> not<00:05:10.190> trying<00:05:10.520> to

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.670 
just because I was really not trying to

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.360 
just because I was really not trying to
sweat<00:05:10.910> out<00:05:10.970> too<00:05:11.270> much<00:05:11.420> of<00:05:11.600> my<00:05:11.720> own<00:05:11.750> hair<00:05:12.370> but

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
sweat out too much of my own hair but

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.840 
sweat out too much of my own hair but
the<00:05:13.850> hair<00:05:14.120> curls<00:05:14.690> really<00:05:15.530> really<00:05:15.860> easy<00:05:16.160> I

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
the hair curls really really easy I

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.210 
the hair curls really really easy I
would<00:05:17.600> not<00:05:17.840> suggest<00:05:18.230> I<00:05:18.710> wouldn't<00:05:19.100> suggest

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
would not suggest I wouldn't suggest

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.300 
would not suggest I wouldn't suggest
holding<00:05:20.000> it<00:05:20.330> on<00:05:20.510> for<00:05:20.720> too<00:05:20.870> long<00:05:21.050> a<00:05:21.350> barrel<00:05:22.040> curl

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
holding it on for too long a barrel curl

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.220 
holding it on for too long a barrel curl
is<00:05:22.580> always<00:05:22.970> the<00:05:23.120> best<00:05:23.150> thing<00:05:23.540> for<00:05:23.750> when<00:05:24.110> you

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
is always the best thing for when you

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.340 
is always the best thing for when you
are<00:05:24.260> actually<00:05:25.330> curling<00:05:26.330> synthetic<00:05:26.840> hair<00:05:27.050> but

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
for the most part it does curl really

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.750 
for the most part it does curl really
really<00:05:30.530> easy<00:05:30.740> and<00:05:31.010> I<00:05:31.100> just<00:05:31.310> want<00:05:31.490> to<00:05:31.580> put<00:05:31.730> a

little bit of loose curls in it just to
see<00:05:34.280> how<00:05:34.970> it<00:05:35.000> takes<00:05:35.630> to<00:05:35.870> heat<00:05:36.730> all<00:05:37.730> right

didn't have much time to curl it only

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.660 
didn't have much time to curl it only
because<00:05:51.590> I<00:05:51.620> have<00:05:51.920> a<00:05:51.950> few<00:05:52.130> minutes<00:05:52.280> left<00:05:52.490> on

because I have a few minutes left on
this<00:05:52.820> memory<00:05:53.180> card<00:05:53.420> but<00:05:53.990> you<00:05:54.170> get<00:05:54.320> the<00:05:54.380> jest<00:05:54.710> of

this memory card but you get the jest of
it<00:05:54.950> all<00:05:55.160> it<00:05:55.430> does<00:05:55.850> take<00:05:56.120> you<00:05:56.150> in<00:05:56.570> it's<00:05:57.050> a<00:05:57.230> really

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
it all it does take you in it's a really

it all it does take you in it's a really
really<00:05:57.740> easy<00:05:58.040> to<00:05:58.280> curl<00:05:58.520> wig<00:05:58.760> I<00:05:58.910> think<00:05:58.940> the<00:05:59.240> best

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.450 
really easy to curl wig I think the best

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.780 
really easy to curl wig I think the best
way<00:05:59.630> to<00:05:59.780> curl<00:06:00.410> any<00:06:00.710> synthetic<00:06:01.160> wig<00:06:01.580> is<00:06:01.760> a

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:01.790 
way to curl any synthetic wig is a

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.330 
way to curl any synthetic wig is a
sprint<00:06:02.180> a<00:06:02.390> little<00:06:02.960> cool<00:06:03.140> water<00:06:03.530> on<00:06:03.830> them<00:06:04.100> and

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:04.340 
sprint a little cool water on them and

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.820 
sprint a little cool water on them and
then<00:06:04.610> use<00:06:05.090> your<00:06:05.120> curling<00:06:05.540> iron<00:06:05.810> for<00:06:06.350> like<00:06:06.500> ten

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
then use your curling iron for like ten

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.740 
then use your curling iron for like ten
to<00:06:06.860> twenty<00:06:07.310> seconds<00:06:07.790> and<00:06:08.000> count<00:06:08.210> to<00:06:08.360> ten<00:06:08.660> to

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750

twenty<00:06:08.990> seconds<00:06:09.350> this<00:06:09.770> is<00:06:09.920> how<00:06:10.040> it<00:06:10.160> always

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.280 
twenty seconds this is how it always

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.880 
twenty seconds this is how it always
worked<00:06:10.730> for<00:06:10.910> me<00:06:11.030> with<00:06:11.210> any<00:06:11.480> kind<00:06:11.810> of<00:06:12.080> curling

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:12.890 
worked for me with any kind of curling

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.010 
worked for me with any kind of curling
iron<00:06:13.040> flat<00:06:13.370> irons<00:06:13.700> do<00:06:13.910> work<00:06:14.120> well<00:06:14.390> but<00:06:14.690> I<00:06:14.750> think

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
iron flat irons do work well but I think

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.570 
iron flat irons do work well but I think
like<00:06:15.110> a<00:06:15.170> regular<00:06:15.470> barrel<00:06:15.800> crolla<00:06:16.250> what<00:06:16.490> the

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
like a regular barrel crolla what the

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.000 
like a regular barrel crolla what the
temperature<00:06:17.090> control<00:06:17.540> is<00:06:17.810> always<00:06:18.140> best<00:06:18.410> when

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.010 
temperature control is always best when

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.900 
temperature control is always best when
using<00:06:19.460> a<00:06:19.580> synthetic<00:06:20.590> wig<00:06:21.590> so<00:06:22.340> for<00:06:22.670> the<00:06:22.760> most

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:22.910 
using a synthetic wig so for the most

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.080 
using a synthetic wig so for the most
part<00:06:23.210> this<00:06:23.450> is<00:06:23.510> Evelyn<00:06:24.110> I<00:06:24.320> do<00:06:25.160> think<00:06:25.640> that<00:06:25.820> it

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
part this is Evelyn I do think that it

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.700 
part this is Evelyn I do think that it
really<00:06:26.120> can<00:06:26.540> use<00:06:26.720> some<00:06:26.960> cones<00:06:27.200> on<00:06:27.440> the<00:06:27.470> side

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
really can use some cones on the side

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.590 
really can use some cones on the side
especially<00:06:28.070> if<00:06:28.490> you're<00:06:28.640> going<00:06:29.000> to<00:06:29.180> cut<00:06:29.390> the
