haven't been posting as usual anyway I'm
back<00:00:16.220> even<00:00:17.220> added<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.580> microphone<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.420> my

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
back even added a microphone to my

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.500 
back even added a microphone to my
camera<00:00:19.020> which<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.410> thought<00:00:19.680> was<00:00:20.039> working<00:00:20.580> as<00:00:20.789> I

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
camera which I thought was working as I

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.450 
camera which I thought was working as I
was<00:00:21.660> recording<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.320> video<00:00:22.470> they're<00:00:22.890> talking

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
was recording the video they're talking

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.570 
was recording the video they're talking
but<00:00:23.730> actually<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:25.130> had<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> few<00:00:26.400> technical

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
but actually I had a few technical

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.609 
but actually I had a few technical
difficulties<00:00:27.269> with<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:27.900> we'll<00:00:28.109> we'll

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
difficulties with that so we'll we'll

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.650 
difficulties with that so we'll we'll
try<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:28.980> work<00:00:29.010> on<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:30.390> get<00:00:30.630> that

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
try and work on that and get that

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.840 
try and work on that and get that
working<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.260> little<00:00:31.380> bit<00:00:31.560> better

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
working a little bit better

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.020 
working a little bit better
I<00:00:32.880> guess<00:00:33.570> my<00:00:33.719> goal<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.380> better<00:00:35.280> talk<00:00:35.700> during

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
I guess my goal is to better talk during

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.940 
I guess my goal is to better talk during
my<00:00:36.149> training<00:00:36.390> sessions<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.140> way<00:00:37.440> when<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.710> get

insight into my trainings so guys in
today's<00:00:49.739> training<00:00:50.219> I'm<00:00:50.640> doing<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.710> session

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
today's training I'm doing a session

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.540 
today's training I'm doing a session
with<00:00:53.100> all<00:00:53.129> three<00:00:53.699> lifts<00:00:54.890> bench<00:00:55.890> squat<00:00:56.160> and

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
with all three lifts bench squat and

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.369 
with all three lifts bench squat and
deadlift<00:00:58.010> so<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.039> received<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.550> question<00:01:00.379> which

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
deadlift so I received a question which

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.870 
deadlift so I received a question which
was<00:01:01.680> how<00:01:02.120> often<00:01:03.120> should<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.780> train<00:01:04.880> your

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
was how often should you train your

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.740 
was how often should you train your
bench<00:01:06.180> squat<00:01:06.570> deadlift<00:01:07.909> now<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.210> that's<00:01:09.510> a

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
bench squat deadlift now that that's a

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.899 
bench squat deadlift now that that's a
very<00:01:10.020> open-ended<00:01:10.650> question<00:01:11.430> but<00:01:11.729> I'm<00:01:11.820> gonna

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
very open-ended question but I'm gonna

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.190 
very open-ended question but I'm gonna
do<00:01:12.150> my<00:01:12.180> best<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.659> answer<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.140> here<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:15.200> believe

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
do my best to answer it here I believe

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.130 
do my best to answer it here I believe
you<00:01:16.409> should<00:01:16.439> train<00:01:17.040> these<00:01:17.369> three<00:01:17.820> lifts<00:01:18.270> as

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
you should train these three lifts as

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.700 
you should train these three lifts as
often<00:01:19.830> as<00:01:20.070> need<00:01:20.549> be<00:01:20.659> you<00:01:21.659> know<00:01:21.840> depending<00:01:22.530> on

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
often as need be you know depending on

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.520 
often as need be you know depending on
where<00:01:22.950> you're<00:01:23.570> you<00:01:24.570> know<00:01:24.689> you're<00:01:24.900> Max's<00:01:25.350> are

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
where you're you know you're Max's are

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.630 
where you're you know you're Max's are
currently<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.479> what<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.630> want<00:01:27.840> them<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.290> be

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
currently and what you want them to be

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.870 
currently and what you want them to be
you<00:01:29.640> know<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.000> future<00:01:30.210> basically<00:01:30.860> and<00:01:31.880> by

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
you know in the future basically and by

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.530 
you know in the future basically and by
that<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.119> mean<00:01:33.450> if<00:01:33.780> you're<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.200> great<00:01:34.500> squatter

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
that I mean if you're a great squatter

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.850 
that I mean if you're a great squatter
you<00:01:36.540> know<00:01:36.689> you're<00:01:36.930> already<00:01:37.140> squatting<00:01:37.619> three

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
you know you're already squatting three

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.700 
you know you're already squatting three
four<00:01:38.130> times<00:01:38.369> body<00:01:38.610> weight<00:01:39.140> then<00:01:40.140> probably<00:01:40.619> you

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
four times body weight then probably you

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.520 
four times body weight then probably you
don't<00:01:40.829> need<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.159> really<00:01:41.310> focus<00:01:41.610> on<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.150> lift

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
don't need to really focus on that lift

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.990 
don't need to really focus on that lift
but<00:01:43.530> maybe<00:01:43.740> if<00:01:43.950> you're<00:01:44.100> only<00:01:44.250> bitching<00:01:44.790> one

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
but maybe if you're only bitching one

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.480 
but maybe if you're only bitching one
times<00:01:45.240> body<00:01:45.540> weight<00:01:45.799> then<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.829> probably<00:01:47.189> need

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
times body weight then you probably need

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.639 
times body weight then you probably need
to<00:01:47.520> focus<00:01:47.970> more<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.840> if<00:01:49.439> you're<00:01:49.619> a

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
to focus more on that and if you're a

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.260 
to focus more on that and if you're a
great<00:01:49.890> squatter<00:01:50.280> your<00:01:50.490> deal<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.880> probably

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
great squatter your deal is probably

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.609 
great squatter your deal is probably
pretty<00:01:51.450> decent<00:01:52.159> so<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.189> would<00:01:53.579> start<00:01:53.850> out<00:01:54.619> you

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
pretty decent so I would start out you

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.450 
pretty decent so I would start out you
know<00:01:55.770> focusing<00:01:56.310> on<00:01:56.430> your<00:01:56.610> bench<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:58.460> possibly

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
know focusing on your bench and possibly

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.130 
know focusing on your bench and possibly
even<00:01:59.549> your<00:01:59.790> deadlift<00:02:00.180> if<00:02:00.299> it's<00:02:00.479> not<00:02:00.659> too<00:02:00.930> good

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
even your deadlift if it's not too good

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:09.350 
even your deadlift if it's not too good
but<00:02:01.530> mainly<00:02:02.430> on<00:02:02.729> your<00:02:02.880> bench<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:04.820> I<00:02:05.820> think<00:02:08.360> you

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
but mainly on your bench and I think you

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.180 
but mainly on your bench and I think you
know<00:02:09.479> high<00:02:09.660> frequency<00:02:10.170> training<00:02:10.649> can<00:02:10.890> work

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
know high frequency training can work

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.020 
know high frequency training can work
for<00:02:11.459> that

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
for that

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.630 
for that
you<00:02:12.420> know<00:02:12.569> basically<00:02:13.050> where<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.069> train<00:02:14.370> one

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
you know basically where you train one

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.630 
you know basically where you train one
lifts<00:02:14.940> three<00:02:15.209> or<00:02:15.330> four<00:02:15.510> times<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:16.050> week<00:02:16.640> think

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
lifts three or four times a week think

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.510 
lifts three or four times a week think
it's<00:02:17.850> like<00:02:18.030> 50<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:19.140> 85<00:02:19.560> percent<00:02:20.160> of<00:02:20.220> your<00:02:20.400> one

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
it's like 50 to 85 percent of your one

that in the past and had you know very
good<00:02:28.440> results<00:02:28.890> with<00:02:29.100> it<00:02:30.830> there<00:02:31.830> is<00:02:31.860> also<00:02:32.190> other

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
good results with it there is also other

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.350 
good results with it there is also other
programs<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:33.239> you<00:02:33.360> can<00:02:33.660> do<00:02:33.890> there's<00:02:35.090> was<00:02:36.090> it

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
shite go yeah Shaco however you want to

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.130 
shite go yeah Shaco however you want to
pronounce<00:02:40.020> it<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.800> it<00:02:41.520> actually<00:02:42.140> combines

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
pronounce it and it actually combines

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.440 
pronounce it and it actually combines
pretty<00:02:43.860> much<00:02:44.390> you're<00:02:45.390> almost<00:02:46.850> not<00:02:47.850> all<00:02:48.090> three

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
pretty much you're almost not all three

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.140 
pretty much you're almost not all three
lives<00:02:48.690> daily<00:02:49.019> but<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.890> do<00:02:50.070> them<00:02:50.250> very<00:02:50.280> often<00:02:51.060> I

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
lives daily but you do them very often I

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.660 
lives daily but you do them very often I
think<00:02:51.480> around<00:02:51.780> at<00:02:52.320> least<00:02:52.590> three<00:02:53.519> or<00:02:53.610> four

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
think around at least three or four

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.009 
think around at least three or four
times<00:02:53.850> a<00:02:54.300> week<00:02:55.700> I've<00:02:56.700> done<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.150> as<00:02:57.300> well<00:02:57.330> you

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
times a week I've done that as well you

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.259 
times a week I've done that as well you
know<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.440> lot<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.069> these<00:02:59.280> things<00:02:59.580> I<00:02:59.730> did<00:03:00.000> you

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
know a lot of these things I did you

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.820 
know a lot of these things I did you
know<00:03:00.390> when<00:03:00.569> I<00:03:00.600> first<00:03:00.840> started<00:03:01.230> powerlifting

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
know when I first started powerlifting

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.970 
know when I first started powerlifting
about<00:03:02.130> four<00:03:02.430> or<00:03:02.519> five<00:03:02.670> years<00:03:02.970> ago<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.980> you

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
about four or five years ago and you

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.150 
about four or five years ago and you
know<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.280> got<00:03:05.519> good<00:03:05.550> results<00:03:06.180> with<00:03:06.300> them<00:03:06.540> and

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
know I got good results with them and

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.979 
know I got good results with them and
why<00:03:08.160> because<00:03:08.819> like<00:03:09.000> I<00:03:09.120> said<00:03:09.330> it<00:03:09.480> was<00:03:09.569> four<00:03:09.900> or

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
why because like I said it was four or

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.559 
why because like I said it was four or
five<00:03:10.019> years<00:03:10.170> ago<00:03:10.440> I<00:03:10.890> was<00:03:11.459> a<00:03:11.519> beginner<00:03:12.000> I<00:03:12.300> was

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
five years ago I was a beginner I was

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.600 
five years ago I was a beginner I was
just<00:03:12.810> starting<00:03:13.230> out<00:03:13.319> and<00:03:14.190> we're<00:03:14.370> just

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
just starting out and we're just

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.569 
just starting out and we're just
starting<00:03:14.760> out<00:03:15.180> I<00:03:15.540> think<00:03:16.290> pretty<00:03:16.590> much<00:03:16.709> any

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
starting out I think pretty much any

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.910 
starting out I think pretty much any
program<00:03:18.269> that<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:18.630> do<00:03:18.989> is<00:03:19.260> going<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.560> yield

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
program that you do is going to yield

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.270 
program that you do is going to yield
you<00:03:20.930> pretty<00:03:21.930> decent<00:03:22.380> results<00:03:24.650> okay<00:03:25.650> so<00:03:25.680> once

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
you pretty decent results okay so once

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.550 
you pretty decent results okay so once
you<00:03:26.400> reach<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.910> intermediate<00:03:27.750> stage<00:03:28.079> range

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
you reach the intermediate stage range

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.240 
you reach the intermediate stage range
as<00:03:28.950> an<00:03:29.100> lifter<00:03:29.600> at<00:03:30.600> this<00:03:30.870> point<00:03:31.140> I<00:03:31.200> think<00:03:31.500> you

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
as an lifter at this point I think you

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.830 
as an lifter at this point I think you
know<00:03:32.400> you're<00:03:32.670> gonna<00:03:32.820> have<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.150> be<00:03:33.299> a<00:03:33.329> bit<00:03:33.660> more

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
know you're gonna have to be a bit more

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.890 
know you're gonna have to be a bit more
selective<00:03:34.079> in<00:03:34.620> your<00:03:34.829> training<00:03:35.430> as<00:03:36.390> of<00:03:36.660> course

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
selective in your training as of course

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.860 
selective in your training as of course
you've<00:03:37.170> gotten<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.500> lot<00:03:37.650> stronger<00:03:38.630> so<00:03:39.630> then<00:03:39.840> I

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
you've gotten a lot stronger so then I

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.900 
you've gotten a lot stronger so then I
think<00:03:40.290> this<00:03:40.709> is<00:03:40.950> for<00:03:41.250> myself<00:03:41.400> personally

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
think this is for myself personally

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.430 
think this is for myself personally
that's<00:03:42.390> when<00:03:42.600> I<00:03:42.630> started<00:03:43.109> kind<00:03:43.350> of

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
that's when I started kind of

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.770 
that's when I started kind of
experimenting<00:03:44.130> with<00:03:44.340> different<00:03:44.780> training

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
experimenting with different training

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.870 
experimenting with different training
programs<00:03:45.810> out<00:03:46.440> there<00:03:46.680> such<00:03:46.980> as<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.190> small<00:03:47.609> all

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
programs out there such as the small all

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.099 
programs out there such as the small all
four<00:03:48.390> I<00:03:49.109> was<00:03:49.739> psycho<00:03:50.640> cycle<00:03:51.329> and<00:03:51.600> then<00:03:51.780> there's

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
four I was psycho cycle and then there's

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.199 
four I was psycho cycle and then there's
the<00:03:52.350> you<00:03:53.040> know<00:03:53.160> juggernaut<00:03:53.700> method

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
the you know juggernaut method

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.990 
the you know juggernaut method

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
three lifts one time weekly now why they

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.550 
three lifts one time weekly now why they
can<00:05:37.370> do<00:05:37.490> that<00:05:37.700> maybe<00:05:37.910> muscle<00:05:38.450> memory<00:05:38.840> you<00:05:39.380> know

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
can do that maybe muscle memory you know

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.250 
can do that maybe muscle memory you know
maybe<00:05:39.800> they're<00:05:40.130> you<00:05:41.120> know<00:05:41.270> it<00:05:41.780> could<00:05:41.990> be<00:05:42.080> any

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
maybe they're you know it could be any

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.750 
maybe they're you know it could be any
number<00:05:42.530> of<00:05:42.560> reason<00:05:42.920> as<00:05:43.040> to<00:05:43.070> why<00:05:43.220> that<00:05:43.550> works

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
number of reason as to why that works

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.570 
number of reason as to why that works
for<00:05:43.970> them<00:05:44.150> but<00:05:44.570> the<00:05:44.720> point<00:05:44.960> is<00:05:45.170> is<00:05:45.410> that<00:05:45.580> it

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
for them but the point is is that it

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.950 
for them but the point is is that it
just<00:05:46.880> shows<00:05:47.060> that<00:05:47.360> once<00:05:47.570> you<00:05:47.720> reach<00:05:47.930> that

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
just shows that once you reach that

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.370 
just shows that once you reach that
elite<00:05:48.440> stage<00:05:48.770> you<00:05:49.550> have<00:05:49.580> to<00:05:49.730> really<00:05:50.120> look

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
elite stage you have to really look

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.920 
elite stage you have to really look
individually<00:05:51.380> at<00:05:51.650> your<00:05:51.920> lips<00:05:52.160> and<00:05:52.490> decide
