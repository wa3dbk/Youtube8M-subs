00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.240
 very good measures dimension 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.519
 ghana this is a short video for 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.820
 show them how to make tails in white 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.230
 because we can take what we need 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.500
 to make white chocolate vega no 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.350
 we are how much it was that we have weighed 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.680
 100 grams without grams of butter 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.869
 Cocoa I buy it here in a drugstore 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.810
 risk box you look where you can 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.670
 buy it where they live let's look 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.669
 a spoonful that will be more or less than 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.800
 12 to 15 grams of soy milk powder 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.380
 if it can also be another milk powder 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.910
 for example oatmeal or from which 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.860
 get but more soy milk 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.110
 let's go back to special bag 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.780
 we will also use 50 grams of sugar 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.149
 impalpable or icing sugar of this 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.160
 and a teaspoon of vanilla essence 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.980
 try that the essence of vanilla be 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.290
 transparent so you do not give them 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.690
 ruin the color of chocolate and let's 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.149
 need a piece of oven paper 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.440
 Butter paper is also called and what 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.390
 what we are going to do is melt 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.820
 our chocolate how can they do it 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.070
 every 20 seconds served only in 20 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.500
 seconds to minimum minimum the microwave and 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.659
 they lower it they watch it stir it a little 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.390
 the Chinese put it back in order not to 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.570
 go through because that happens very quickly what 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.320
 let's put to melt in bain-marie and 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.320
 with steam 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.750
 ah 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.830
 will open as the cocoa butter begins 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.830
 to beat quickly 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:40.870
 this these two ingredients the sugar 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:43.000
 and the soy milk powder we're going to 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:47.080
 put them together if they do not want to throw 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:52.070
 Sugar can be agave 100 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:55.220
 milliliters of agave or 100 milliliters of 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.830
 of corn honey or rice honey by 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.250
 example 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.250
 yes 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.980
 the drops of vanilla essence 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.290
 good once it's melted 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.290
 and let's take the other mix 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.950
 you have to dissolve well if you do not go to 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.950
 be cliques 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:43.100
 good and now let's move on 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.100
 the mold can use the one that wants 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.200
 very well now we let it cool nothing 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.600
 more that boludez is to make chocolate 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.650
 white very well here we have then 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.850
 It's cold our white chocolate 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.060
 before it gets cold it's all good 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.450
 write you hit whatever you want we are going to 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.450
 prove it 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.090
 terrific it's not convenient that you a 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.280
 liquid sweetener like agave because the 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.550
 impalpable sugar after a little 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.900
 it is noticeable but it is very good 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.310
 thanks for looking at vegan dimension 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.310
