for<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:17.270> ccd<00:00:18.270> camera<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:19.310> yeah<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.960> would<00:00:21.960> be

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
for a ccd camera and yeah it would be

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.370 
for a ccd camera and yeah it would be
really<00:00:22.560> nice<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:24.180> good<00:00:24.830> improvement<00:00:25.939> for

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
next thing is the plate fuselage the big

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.570 
next thing is the plate fuselage the big
fuselage<00:01:05.939> actually<00:01:06.590> on<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.650> pictures<00:01:08.369> you

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
fuselage actually on the pictures you

fuselage actually on the pictures you
can<00:01:08.760> see<00:01:09.030> how<00:01:09.540> much<00:01:09.840> space<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
can see how much space is in the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.700 
can see how much space is in the
fuselage<00:01:12.799> this<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.979> not<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.600> fossil<00:01:15.600> it's<00:01:16.409> a

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
fuselage this is not a fossil it's a

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.969 
fuselage this is not a fossil it's a
five-set<00:01:17.479> five<00:01:18.479> sev<00:01:20.360> five<00:01:21.360> thousand<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.080> yeah

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
five-set five sev five thousand and yeah

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.179 
five-set five sev five thousand and yeah
it<00:01:23.189> fits<00:01:24.049> without<00:01:25.049> any<00:01:26.360> problems<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:28.189> yet

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
simply shows you how big the fuselage is

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.280 
simply shows you how big the fuselage is
the<00:01:33.950> skid<00:01:34.950> plates<00:01:35.189> are<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.939> next<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:37.020> can

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
the skid plates are the next you can

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.520 
the skid plates are the next you can
land<00:01:37.770> on<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.520> belly<00:01:38.759> without<00:01:39.479> problems<00:01:40.140> would

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
land on the belly without problems would

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.660 
land on the belly without problems would
without<00:01:41.250> whipping<00:01:42.210> off<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:43.369> bottom<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
without whipping off the bottom of the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.719 
without whipping off the bottom of the
fuselage<00:01:45.149> because<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:46.229> have<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.710> nice<00:01:47.070> skid

plates and here you see the biggest

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.990 
plates and here you see the biggest
improvement<00:01:51.479> on<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:52.049> big<00:01:52.350> three<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.640> wing

prevent<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:11.980> autopilot<00:03:12.980> or<00:03:14.530> batteries<00:03:15.530> from

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
prevent the autopilot or batteries from

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.420 
prevent the autopilot or batteries from
overheating<00:03:19.359> ventilation<00:03:20.359> is<00:03:20.630> always<00:03:21.139> nice

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
overheating ventilation is always nice

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.390 
overheating ventilation is always nice
the<00:03:22.430> stripes<00:03:23.030> on<00:03:23.299> the<00:03:23.540> wings<00:03:23.810> for<00:03:24.739> a<00:03:25.010> better

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
the stripes on the wings for a better

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.520 
the stripes on the wings for a better
visibility<00:03:26.359> a<00:03:27.430> nice<00:03:28.430> idea<00:03:28.970> but<00:03:29.120> I<00:03:29.840> don't<00:03:30.260> know

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
visibility a nice idea but I don't know

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.870 
visibility a nice idea but I don't know
if<00:03:30.859> these<00:03:31.280> tribes<00:03:31.940> are<00:03:32.560> really<00:03:33.880> helpful

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
if these tribes are really helpful

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.220 
if these tribes are really helpful
especially<00:03:35.530> in<00:03:36.530> my<00:03:36.739> case<00:03:36.799> because<00:03:37.750> in<00:03:38.750> most

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
especially in my case because in most

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:47.650 
especially in my case because in most
cases<00:03:39.650> i<00:03:40.069> am<00:03:40.250> flying<00:03:41.620> between<00:03:43.930> 250<00:03:44.930> and<00:03:46.660> 350

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
cases i am flying between 250 and 350

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.360 
cases i am flying between 250 and 350
meters<00:03:48.230> high<00:03:48.470> and<00:03:48.709> in<00:03:49.549> this<00:03:50.090> case<00:03:50.419> I<00:03:50.870> believe<00:03:51.709> I

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
meters high and in this case I believe I

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.920 
meters high and in this case I believe I
can't<00:03:53.060> see<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:54.319> stripes<00:03:54.919> I<00:03:55.430> can<00:03:56.060> only<00:03:56.299> see<00:03:56.750> the

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
can't see the stripes I can only see the

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.949 
can't see the stripes I can only see the
shape<00:03:59.930> of<00:04:00.290> the<00:04:00.319> fuselage<00:04:01.160> because<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:02.630> pig

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
shape of the fuselage because the pig

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.550 
shape of the fuselage because the pig
sooie<00:04:03.109> is<00:04:03.349> not<00:04:03.769> the<00:04:04.480> biggest<00:04:05.480> plane<00:04:05.900> yeah<00:04:06.319> but

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
sooie is not the biggest plane yeah but

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.240 
sooie is not the biggest plane yeah but
this<00:04:07.549> is<00:04:07.880> only<00:04:08.150> a<00:04:08.359> personal<00:04:09.139> thing<00:04:09.319> the<00:04:09.889> second

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
this is only a personal thing the second

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.009 
this is only a personal thing the second
thing<00:04:10.430> i<00:04:10.700> really<00:04:11.180> like<00:04:11.359> on<00:04:11.959> the<00:04:13.000> wings<00:04:14.000> are<00:04:14.419> the

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
thing i really like on the wings are the

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.750 
thing i really like on the wings are the
flaps<00:04:15.290> they<00:04:16.160> help<00:04:16.459> you<00:04:16.760> to<00:04:17.030> catch<00:04:17.479> familes<00:04:18.140> and

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
flaps they help you to catch familes and

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.120 
flaps they help you to catch familes and
stay<00:04:19.760> a<00:04:20.060> lot<00:04:20.780> longer<00:04:21.159> in<00:04:22.159> the<00:04:22.190> air

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
stay a lot longer in the air

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.380 
stay a lot longer in the air
and<00:04:23.540> they<00:04:24.540> also<00:04:24.930> help<00:04:25.410> you<00:04:25.650> to<00:04:25.730> to<00:04:26.730> start

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
and they also help you to to start

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.870 
and they also help you to to start
because<00:04:28.320> they<00:04:29.540> increases<00:04:30.540> the<00:04:30.990> lift<00:04:31.950> the<00:04:32.370> next

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
because they increases the lift the next

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.440 
because they increases the lift the next
thing<00:04:33.180> are<00:04:33.540> the<00:04:33.990> hinges<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.830> hinges<00:04:35.250> are

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
thing are the hinges the hinges are

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.230 
thing are the hinges the hinges are
pretty<00:04:36.450> good<00:04:36.780> no<00:04:37.140> problems<00:04:37.800> so<00:04:38.040> far<00:04:38.220> with<00:04:38.910> the

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
pretty good no problems so far with the

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.280 
pretty good no problems so far with the
big<00:04:39.690> three<00:04:40.050> no<00:04:40.530> problems<00:04:41.100> with<00:04:41.400> the<00:04:42.020> Pixlr<00:04:43.020> to

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
big three no problems with the Pixlr to

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.940 
big three no problems with the Pixlr to
really<00:04:43.920> nice<00:04:44.160> in<00:04:44.490> opposite<00:04:45.420> to<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:46.260> hinges

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
really nice in opposite to the hinges

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.430 
really nice in opposite to the hinges

on on the end of this video all videos
are<00:04:57.410> linked<00:04:58.410> the<00:04:58.830> space<00:04:59.550> for<00:05:00.060> the<00:05:00.180> prop<00:05:00.450> is

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
are linked the space for the prop is

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.950 
are linked the space for the prop is
even<00:05:01.740> enough<00:05:02.130> for<00:05:02.400> a<00:05:02.580> 9-inch<00:05:03.210> pop<00:05:03.540> if<00:05:03.750> you

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
even enough for a 9-inch pop if you

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.490 
even enough for a 9-inch pop if you
mount<00:05:04.470> the<00:05:04.980> small<00:05:05.430> C&amp;C<00:05:06.210> parts<00:05:06.750> motor<00:05:07.170> mount

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
mount the small C&amp;C parts motor mount

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.700 
mount the small C&amp;C parts motor mount
which<00:05:07.890> I<00:05:08.070> really<00:05:08.640> really<00:05:09.480> recommend<00:05:10.290> because

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
which I really really recommend because

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.430 
which I really really recommend because
the<00:05:11.070> motor<00:05:11.280> mount<00:05:11.580> is<00:05:11.820> cheap<00:05:12.240> and<00:05:12.450> durable<00:05:13.170> and

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
the motor mount is cheap and durable and

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.300 
the motor mount is cheap and durable and
allows<00:05:13.950> you<00:05:14.130> to<00:05:14.370> go<00:05:14.880> with<00:05:15.450> within<00:05:16.260> nine<00:05:17.040> inch

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
allows you to go with within nine inch

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.190 
allows you to go with within nine inch
prop<00:05:17.730> up<00:05:18.120> to<00:05:18.840> I<00:05:19.170> believe<00:05:19.850> 11-inch<00:05:20.850> prop<00:05:21.360> the

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
prop up to I believe 11-inch prop the

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.460 
prop up to I believe 11-inch prop the
next<00:05:22.620> big<00:05:23.160> improvement<00:05:24.000> is<00:05:24.180> the<00:05:24.480> easy<00:05:24.840> access

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
next big improvement is the easy access

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.560 
next big improvement is the easy access
to<00:05:26.180> the<00:05:27.180> rear<00:05:27.630> after<00:05:27.930> hell<00:05:28.260> yeah<00:05:28.770> this<00:05:29.390> for<00:05:30.390> me

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
to the rear after hell yeah this for me

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.370 
to the rear after hell yeah this for me
this<00:05:30.840> this<00:05:31.380> is<00:05:31.620> one<00:05:32.250> of<00:05:32.550> the<00:05:32.940> biggest

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
this this is one of the biggest

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.300 
this this is one of the biggest
improvements<00:05:35.120> believed<00:05:36.590> improved<00:05:37.590> wing

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
improvements believed improved wing

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.360 
improvements believed improved wing
attachment<00:05:39.030> yeah<00:05:39.630> we<00:05:39.990> have<00:05:40.230> also<00:05:40.710> asked<00:05:41.220> if

attachment yeah we have also asked if
what<00:05:41.700> and<00:05:42.260> many<00:05:43.260> carbon<00:05:43.920> stripes<00:05:44.340> to<00:05:44.910> prevent

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
what and many carbon stripes to prevent

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:51.320 
what and many carbon stripes to prevent
unwanted<00:05:47.090> wing<00:05:48.090> wing<00:05:48.930> flex<00:05:49.920> and<00:05:50.310> yeah<00:05:51.000> pretty

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
unwanted wing wing flex and yeah pretty

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.880 
unwanted wing wing flex and yeah pretty
nice<00:05:51.600> I<00:05:51.870> believe<00:05:52.650> this<00:05:53.100> plane<00:05:53.490> will<00:05:54.480> fly

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
nice I believe this plane will fly

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.260 
nice I believe this plane will fly
really<00:05:55.890> good<00:05:56.130> the<00:05:56.430> last<00:05:56.670> thing<00:05:56.880> I<00:05:57.030> have<00:05:57.240> to
