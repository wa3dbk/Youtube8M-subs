like that without giving you credit

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.509 
like that without giving you credit
which<00:02:23.599> is<00:02:23.750> really<00:02:23.989> annoying<00:02:24.260> but<00:02:24.890> it's<00:02:25.340> very

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
which is really annoying but it's very

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:26.800 
which is really annoying but it's very
unlikely<00:02:25.790> that<00:02:26.180> somebody<00:02:26.480> would<00:02:26.780> actually

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
unlikely that somebody would actually

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.679 
unlikely that somebody would actually
take<00:02:27.530> your<00:02:27.739> work<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:28.359> reproduce<00:02:29.359> it<00:02:29.569> on<00:02:29.629> a

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:29.689 
take your work and reproduce it on a

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:31.720 
take your work and reproduce it on a
mass<00:02:29.989> scale<00:02:30.019> and<00:02:30.709> try<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:31.159> get<00:02:31.310> away<00:02:31.549> with

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
mass scale and try and get away with

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.000 
mass scale and try and get away with
that<00:02:33.639> so<00:02:34.659> in<00:02:35.659> reality<00:02:36.349> there's<00:02:36.799> really

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
that so in reality there's really

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.670 
that so in reality there's really
nothing<00:02:37.430> you<00:02:37.579> can<00:02:37.790> do<00:02:37.969> about<00:02:38.299> people<00:02:39.290> stealing

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
nothing you can do about people stealing

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.490 
nothing you can do about people stealing
your<00:02:39.859> images<00:02:40.489> on<00:02:40.760> that<00:02:40.939> small<00:02:41.299> scale<00:02:41.659> and<00:02:41.959> at

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
your images on that small scale and at

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.500 
your images on that small scale and at
first<00:02:42.680> that<00:02:43.370> used<00:02:43.549> to<00:02:43.670> bother<00:02:43.849> me<00:02:44.060> that<00:02:44.359> people

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
first that used to bother me that people

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.740 
first that used to bother me that people
did<00:02:44.870> that<00:02:45.049> and<00:02:45.290> then<00:02:45.680> I<00:02:45.709> realized<00:02:46.159> that<00:02:46.750> you

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
did that and then I realized that you

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.610 
did that and then I realized that you
know<00:02:47.840> once<00:02:48.019> I<00:02:48.139> got<00:02:48.290> over<00:02:48.319> the<00:02:48.590> initial

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
know once I got over the initial

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.800 
know once I got over the initial
discomfort<00:02:49.370> of<00:02:49.700> that<00:02:49.909> of<00:02:50.150> knowing<00:02:50.659> that

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
discomfort of that of knowing that

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.539 
discomfort of that of knowing that
people<00:02:51.049> were<00:02:51.139> doing<00:02:51.439> that

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
people were doing that

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.000 
people were doing that
you<00:02:53.419> know<00:02:53.540> those<00:02:53.750> people<00:02:53.959> aren't<00:02:54.379> gonna<00:02:54.859> be

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
you know those people aren't gonna be

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.640 
you know those people aren't gonna be
buying<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.459> originals<00:02:55.970> anyway<00:02:56.419> and<00:02:56.689> and<00:02:57.169> if

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
buying the originals anyway and and if

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.830 
buying the originals anyway and and if
you<00:02:57.709> think<00:02:57.950> about<00:02:58.129> it<00:02:58.310> it's<00:02:58.459> a<00:02:58.689> compliment<00:02:59.689> of

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
you think about it it's a compliment of

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.649 
you think about it it's a compliment of
sorts<00:03:00.200> that<00:03:00.409> somebody<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:02.000> likes<00:03:02.239> your<00:03:02.450> work

sorts that somebody you likes your work

enough to print it out or whatever and

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
what harm are they really doing you know

high quality prints of
work<00:04:27.710> that<00:04:28.280> would<00:04:28.460> be<00:04:28.640> good<00:04:29.450> enough<00:04:29.570> to<00:04:29.900> sell

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
so what I do is I just make sure that

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.180 
so what I do is I just make sure that
the<00:04:34.130> images<00:04:34.520> I<00:04:34.610> post<00:04:34.910> online<00:04:35.240> are<00:04:35.840> fairly<00:04:36.770> low

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
the images I post online are fairly low

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.950 
the images I post online are fairly low
resolution<00:04:37.220> so<00:04:37.970> that<00:04:38.150> if<00:04:38.390> someone<00:04:38.570> tried<00:04:38.930> to

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
resolution so that if someone tried to

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.140 
resolution so that if someone tried to
print<00:04:39.440> it<00:04:39.560> on<00:04:39.710> a<00:04:39.740> large<00:04:39.980> scale<00:04:40.370> it<00:04:40.580> wouldn't

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
print it on a large scale it wouldn't

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.780 
print it on a large scale it wouldn't
look<00:04:41.360> good<00:04:41.420> but<00:04:42.380> you<00:04:42.680> know<00:04:42.890> large<00:04:43.160> enough<00:04:43.460> so

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
look good but you know large enough so

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.910 
look good but you know large enough so
that<00:04:43.820> people<00:04:44.020> can<00:04:45.020> see<00:04:45.290> the<00:04:45.530> work<00:04:45.770> I<00:04:46.660> think<00:04:47.920> at

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
that people can see the work I think at

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.550 
that people can see the work I think at
least<00:04:49.130> my<00:04:49.310> personal<00:04:49.790> rule<00:04:49.940> of<00:04:50.060> thumb<00:04:50.270> is<00:04:50.570> no

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
least my personal rule of thumb is no

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.400 
least my personal rule of thumb is no
larger<00:04:52.040> than<00:04:52.300> 600<00:04:53.300> pixels<00:04:53.720> in<00:04:53.900> any<00:04:54.050> dimension

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
larger than 600 pixels in any dimension

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.260 
larger than 600 pixels in any dimension
I<00:04:54.860> think<00:04:55.400> that's<00:04:55.550> what<00:04:55.730> I<00:04:55.760> have<00:04:56.000> on<00:04:56.120> my<00:04:56.150> website

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
I think that's what I have on my website

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.200 
I think that's what I have on my website
and<00:04:57.010> that<00:04:58.010> seems<00:04:58.250> to<00:04:58.430> work<00:04:58.580> out<00:04:58.790> well<00:04:58.940> for<00:04:58.970> me

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
and that seems to work out well for me

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.440 
and that seems to work out well for me
some<00:04:59.540> people<00:04:59.870> do<00:05:00.250> add<00:05:01.250> a<00:05:01.310> watermark<00:05:01.820> like<00:05:02.300> they

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
some people do add a watermark like they

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.690 
some people do add a watermark like they
use<00:05:02.630> Photoshop<00:05:03.260> or<00:05:03.590> something<00:05:03.980> to<00:05:04.220> put<00:05:04.670> a

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
use Photoshop or something to put a

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.090 
use Photoshop or something to put a
watermark<00:05:05.090> across<00:05:05.630> each<00:05:05.960> painting<00:05:06.290> with

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
watermark across each painting with

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.480 
watermark across each painting with
their<00:05:07.340> name<00:05:07.670> or<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:08.750> copyright<00:05:09.230> like<00:05:09.680> across

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
their name or the copyright like across

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.610 
their name or the copyright like across
the<00:05:10.670> center<00:05:11.030> of<00:05:11.210> the<00:05:11.360> of<00:05:11.570> the<00:05:11.840> painting<00:05:12.290> and<00:05:12.440> I

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
the center of the of the painting and I

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.900 
the center of the of the painting and I
think<00:05:13.100> that's<00:05:13.280> way<00:05:13.850> too<00:05:13.930> distracting<00:05:14.930> and<00:05:15.910> you

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
think that's way too distracting and you

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.610 
think that's way too distracting and you
want<00:05:17.090> people<00:05:17.240> to<00:05:17.360> see<00:05:17.720> the<00:05:17.870> actual<00:05:18.200> painting

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
want people to see the actual painting

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.650 
want people to see the actual painting
and<00:05:18.740> what<00:05:18.890> it<00:05:19.010> looks<00:05:19.160> like<00:05:19.430> so<00:05:19.730> I<00:05:19.760> wouldn't<00:05:20.480> do

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
and what it looks like so I wouldn't do

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.680 
and what it looks like so I wouldn't do
the<00:05:20.900> watermarks<00:05:21.500> personally<00:05:22.130> but<00:05:22.820> you<00:05:23.180> can<00:05:23.420> if

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
the watermarks personally but you can if

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.630 
the watermarks personally but you can if
that<00:05:23.870> makes<00:05:24.080> you<00:05:24.320> comfortable<00:05:24.920> I<00:05:25.250> think<00:05:25.280> it's

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
that makes you comfortable I think it's

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.340 
that makes you comfortable I think it's
still<00:05:25.880> better<00:05:26.090> than<00:05:26.210> not<00:05:26.600> putting<00:05:26.990> your<00:05:27.170> work

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
still better than not putting your work

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.570 
still better than not putting your work
out<00:05:27.800> there<00:05:27.920> at<00:05:28.280> all<00:05:28.400> out<00:05:29.180> of<00:05:29.360> fear<00:05:30.370> that's<00:05:31.370> not

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
out there at all out of fear that's not

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.159 
out there at all out of fear that's not
to<00:05:31.760> say<00:05:31.910> you<00:05:31.940> shouldn't<00:05:32.300> protect<00:05:32.750> yourself
