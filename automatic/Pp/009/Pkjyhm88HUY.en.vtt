00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.570
 Friday a new compilation with 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.560
 better in applications for 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.700
 smartphones 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.650
 guys and we're going to start with a 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.480
 application for the most kitchens of the 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.950
 house an application called nestle 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.320
 kitchen is completely free 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.720
 available for them and for android with 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.270
 which we will be able to find more than 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.810
 2,000 recipes and what I like the most 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.970
 of 400 recipes videos to see how 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.010
 cook then in real time any 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.960
 thing is not very good just to choose 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.940
 the recipe will be able to see the video the 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.070
 difficulty in preparing it for the time 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.989
 you need the kilocalories that you have 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.420
 the ingredients to have it all 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.190
 prepared and so cooking very cool things 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.930
 now that we are in the middle of summer so 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.030
 less here in Spain I know that out there 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.770
 some are not yet in summer but 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.570
 Well the truth is that there are recipes for 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.130
 all tastes and for summer there are things 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.050
 very cool like this around here coffee 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.629
 creamy system inside has to be 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.460
 pretty good guys if you are lovers of 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.960
 the kitchen is an application that we 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.089
 can miss and sacrifice them that 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.240
 You can filter to find any 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.160
 kind of recipes good guys girls 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.960
 just come to me is a new 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.340
 application that is called the go launcher 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.200
 as the popular application launcher 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.000
 of android is something completely 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.490
 different guys 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.350
 we will be able to put shortcuts in 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.870
 the notification center is a widget 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.280
 in the end do not notice that I have these 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.790
 put fixed that we can 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.740
 add contacts applications settings 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.810
 access to web pages and such not by 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.910
 example, what are we going to give to 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.260
 edit and I from here and notice that 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.540
 I have the design to the code that we most 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.430
 links in dotcom but note that 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.080
 I could avoid the icon from here 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.790
 agreement could make a 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.860
 photography take a photo from the gallery 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.960
 take a picture of never a contact and 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.399
 such no and good thing about this is that it is 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.140
 a widget that is integrated here in the 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.509
 notifications center and I like 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.690
 especially because of course to put 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.430
 applications I already have the springboard 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.690
 but of course I was very much called 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.820
 attention to put for example here 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.890
 shortcuts to web pages 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.660
 webpages that I visited the most but not 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.220
 good you can put applications what 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.709
 you want guys or contacts that 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.630
 it's pretty interesting we have 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.610
 also a new application that 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.230
 polar flame available for this is that 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.550
 just arrived at the app store and good 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.230
 is the photo editing application 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.239
 but I like it especially because it 's 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.630
 very powerful we have on the one hand to fix 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.030
 what art filters 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.950
 of modern feel the most popular and 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.120
 from here then we are going to be able to go to a 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.850
 little art 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.960
 the black and white these I like 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.160
 especially but we have lots of 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.930
 filters to improve our 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.880
 photographs do not notice that one thing 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.890
 I really like it is that you from here 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.450
 you are going to see a little bit the history of 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.370
 everything that you have modified 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.470
 in case you want to go back I do not want 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.670
 if I want to go back to the filter 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.770
 that applied before then I can do it 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.570
 from here I can import or make 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.610
 photographs and then later I can 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.010
 share the things that I like a lot 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.870
 I'm going to be able of course to cut back but 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.690
 also from here I will be able to adjust in 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.700
 a certain area because the filter 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.920
 it looks more or less like you're seeing 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.860
 let's give it done or here to fix 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.740
 that we can edit it with this type 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.970
 of lines not to adjust a little bit that 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.350
 the filter appears in an area 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.610
 determined and then already to finish 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.470
 guys tell you that here we have the 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.240
 very powerful editing options too 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.220
 we have the color option with all 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.980
 these options we have the option of light 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.810
 also and by the end all the adjustments 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.370
 edition for photographs but one 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.250
 pretty curious because we 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.080
 So from swayze hit we will be able to 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.060
 adjust everything in a pretty way 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.290
 Quick guys is a great application 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.989
 to edit your photographs 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.099
 Summertime and leave them very nice guys 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.660
