to reproduce we're seeing massively over
fished<00:02:36.500> areas<00:02:37.030> in<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.540> 40<00:02:39.200> plus<00:02:39.410> years<00:02:39.650> I've

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
fished areas in the 40 plus years I've

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.060 
fished areas in the 40 plus years I've
been<00:02:40.040> studying<00:02:40.220> oceans<00:02:40.990> I've<00:02:41.990> seen<00:02:42.410> some

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
been studying oceans I've seen some

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.090 
been studying oceans I've seen some
really<00:02:43.280> bad<00:02:43.610> things<00:02:44.140> I've<00:02:45.140> seen<00:02:45.500> oceans

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
really bad things I've seen oceans

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.460 
really bad things I've seen oceans
become<00:02:46.610> so<00:02:47.230> degraded<00:02:48.230> that<00:02:48.890> it<00:02:49.250> made<00:02:49.670> me<00:02:49.880> cry

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
become so degraded that it made me cry

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.890 
become so degraded that it made me cry
underwater<00:02:51.610> through<00:02:52.610> my<00:02:52.760> mask<00:02:53.030> it<00:02:53.570> was<00:02:53.750> so

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
underwater through my mask it was so

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.800 
underwater through my mask it was so
depressing<00:02:54.130> but<00:02:55.130> it<00:02:56.000> doesn't<00:02:56.420> have<00:02:56.570> to<00:02:56.720> be

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
depressing but it doesn't have to be

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:08.250 
depressing but it doesn't have to be
that<00:02:57.020> way

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.780 

I've<00:03:08.739> also<00:03:09.129> seen<00:03:09.550> places<00:03:10.330> come<00:03:10.660> back<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:11.200> life

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
I've also seen places come back to life

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.790 
I've also seen places come back to life
because<00:03:12.790> people<00:03:13.390> care<00:03:13.720> because<00:03:14.560> they<00:03:14.739> were

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
because people care because they were

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.160 
because people care because they were
willing<00:03:15.190> to<00:03:15.640> do<00:03:16.390> something<00:03:16.870> they<00:03:17.110> were

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
willing to do something they were

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.759 
willing to do something they were
willing<00:03:17.470> to<00:03:17.800> be<00:03:17.950> creative<00:03:18.550> to<00:03:19.290> engage<00:03:20.290> others

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
willing to be creative to engage others

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.300 
willing to be creative to engage others
and<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:22.000> be<00:03:22.120> problem<00:03:22.599> solvers<00:03:23.050> not<00:03:23.800> just<00:03:24.129> to

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
and to be problem solvers not just to

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.769 
and to be problem solvers not just to
walk<00:03:24.489> away<00:03:24.840> that's<00:03:25.840> what<00:03:26.170> we<00:03:26.319> need<00:03:26.500> more
