that<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.290> guys<00:02:37.439> do<00:02:37.680> like<00:02:37.859> but<00:02:38.370> personally<00:02:38.760> I

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
that you guys do like but personally I

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.339 
that you guys do like but personally I
think<00:02:38.879> lime<00:02:39.269> green<00:02:39.569> does<00:02:39.810> look<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.019> best

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
think lime green does look the best

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.140 
think lime green does look the best
since<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.680> does<00:02:40.829> complement<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.790> pearlescent

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
since it does complement the pearlescent

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.659 
since it does complement the pearlescent
color<00:02:42.540> of<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.930> stone<00:02:43.200> silver<00:02:43.739> so<00:02:44.400> now<00:02:44.549> that

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:44.669 
color of the stone silver so now that

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:46.039 
color of the stone silver so now that
you<00:02:44.790> guys<00:02:44.879> have<00:02:44.939> the<00:02:45.209> color<00:02:45.419> of<00:02:45.569> your<00:02:45.659> car<00:02:45.870> it's

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
you guys have the color of your car it's

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.720 
you guys have the color of your car it's
time<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.349> move<00:02:46.500> on<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.889> wheels<00:02:47.129> so<00:02:47.669> I'll

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
time to move on to the wheels so I'll

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.250 
time to move on to the wheels so I'll
recommend<00:02:48.030> choosing<00:02:48.540> any<00:02:48.689> wheels<00:02:48.959> that<00:02:49.200> you

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
recommend choosing any wheels that you

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.690 
recommend choosing any wheels that you
guys<00:02:49.349> could<00:02:49.590> actually<00:02:49.620> change<00:02:50.129> the<00:02:50.250> color<00:02:50.579> of

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
guys could actually change the color of

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.670 
guys could actually change the color of
now<00:02:51.450> for<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.750> wheel<00:02:51.870> color<00:02:52.169> you<00:02:52.319> guys<00:02:52.470> can

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
now for the wheel color you guys can

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.530 
now for the wheel color you guys can
choose<00:02:52.859> any<00:02:53.159> green<00:02:53.489> but<00:02:53.730> personally<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.329> lime

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
choose any green but personally the lime

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.759 
choose any green but personally the lime
green<00:02:54.780> does<00:02:54.989> look<00:02:55.139> the<00:02:55.169> best<00:02:55.470> in<00:02:55.620> my<00:02:55.739> opinion

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
green does look the best in my opinion

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.009 
green does look the best in my opinion
and<00:02:56.430> then<00:02:56.819> to<00:02:56.969> finish<00:02:57.269> it<00:02:57.419> all<00:02:57.540> off<00:02:57.569> put<00:02:57.989> on

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
and then to finish it all off put on

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:27.910 
and then to finish it all off put on
some<00:02:58.290> green<00:02:58.469> tire<00:02:58.739> smoke

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.460 

and<00:03:29.270> from<00:03:30.270> here<00:03:30.450> I<00:03:30.480> think<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.810> paint<00:03:31.050> jobs<00:03:31.290> are

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
and from here I think the paint jobs are

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.630 
and from here I think the paint jobs are
pretty<00:03:31.650> special<00:03:31.980> because<00:03:32.459> they<00:03:32.580> were

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
pretty special because they were

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.880 
pretty special because they were
submitted<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.120> me<00:03:33.300> by<00:03:33.420> my<00:03:33.569> subscribers<00:03:34.260> so
