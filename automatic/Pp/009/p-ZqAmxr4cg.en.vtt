Irishman down in Boston they're gonna go

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.340 
Irishman down in Boston they're gonna go
crazy<00:01:05.730> so<00:01:06.270> from<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.540> business<00:01:06.720> standpoint<00:01:07.050> it

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
crazy so from a business standpoint it

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.109 
crazy so from a business standpoint it
makes<00:01:07.500> sense<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.950> think<00:01:08.610> from<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.850> conor

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
makes sense I think from a conor

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.999 
makes sense I think from a conor
mcgregor<00:01:09.600> standpoint<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:10.200> makes<00:01:10.650> some<00:01:10.829> sense

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
mcgregor standpoint it makes some sense

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.149 
mcgregor standpoint it makes some sense
too<00:01:11.369> because<00:01:11.720> is<00:01:12.720> he<00:01:12.990> ready<00:01:13.380> for<00:01:13.710> joe<00:01:13.860> sailed

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
too because is he ready for joe sailed

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.280 
too because is he ready for joe sailed
is<00:01:14.369> he<00:01:14.520> ready<00:01:14.850> at<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.299> level<00:01:15.479> because<00:01:16.110> and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
is he ready at that level because and

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.020 
is he ready at that level because and
whether<00:01:16.770> he<00:01:16.829> is<00:01:17.070> or<00:01:17.100> not<00:01:17.250> one<00:01:17.640> thing<00:01:17.820> we<00:01:17.909> know

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
whether he is or not one thing we know

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.999 
whether he is or not one thing we know
about<00:01:18.060> him<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.600> believe<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.170> he's<00:01:19.590> still

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
about him and I believe is he's still

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.399 
about him and I believe is he's still
getting<00:01:20.280> better<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.750> respect<00:01:22.020> it

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
getting better so in that respect it

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.440 
getting better so in that respect it
makes<00:01:22.619> sense<00:01:22.860> but<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:23.430> risky<00:01:23.700> business<00:01:24.270> wise

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
makes sense but it's risky business wise

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.030 
makes sense but it's risky business wise
because<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.810> know<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.320> that's<00:01:25.619> big

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
because you know that that that's big

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.160 
because you know that that that's big
business<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.729> fight<00:01:26.939> for<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.509> title<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.960> you

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
business that fight for a title and you

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.810 
business that fight for a title and you
can<00:01:28.380> definitely<00:01:28.649> lose<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.100> fight<00:01:29.399> to<00:01:29.549> Dennis

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
can definitely lose a fight to Dennis

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.060 
can definitely lose a fight to Dennis
Siver<00:01:30.000> we<00:01:30.479> really<00:01:31.170> people<00:01:31.710> really

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
Siver we really people really

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.550 
Siver we really people really

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560

and<00:01:34.799> how<00:01:35.219> physically<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.079> and<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.860> real<00:01:38.460> point

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
and how physically is and a real point

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.880 
and how physically is and a real point
that<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.299> have<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.719> kind<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.259> digest<00:01:40.710> right

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
that you have to kind of digest right

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.010

right<00:03:49.380> now<00:03:49.530> and<00:03:49.650> this<00:03:49.770> is<00:03:49.830> a<00:03:50.130> good<00:03:50.580> example

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700

over Swanson yeah I think you could be
right<00:05:34.230> and<00:05:34.500> it<00:05:34.650> definitely<00:05:34.860> if<00:05:35.220> cub<00:05:35.610> wins<00:05:35.850> this

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
right and it definitely if cub wins this

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.370 
right and it definitely if cub wins this
fight<00:05:36.210> he<00:05:36.420> definitely<00:05:36.750> should<00:05:37.020> get<00:05:37.080> one<00:05:37.140> what

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380

might<00:05:44.790> be<00:05:44.820> for<00:05:45.120> real<00:05:45.210> what<00:05:45.450> if<00:05:45.540> he<00:05:45.660> is<00:05:45.870> able<00:05:46.170> to

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
might be for real what if he is able to

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.500 
might be for real what if he is able to
be<00:05:46.680> as<00:05:46.890> great<00:05:47.490> against<00:05:47.910> the<00:05:48.000> greats<00:05:48.240> as<00:05:48.390> we

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.730 
think he might be but there's only one
spot<00:05:51.000> and<00:05:51.270> cub<00:05:51.690> swanson<00:05:51.810> earned<00:05:52.380> it<00:05:52.470> so<00:05:52.590> i<00:05:52.650> have
