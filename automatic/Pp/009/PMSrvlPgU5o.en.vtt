laid eggs and I did a lot of research so

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.500 
laid eggs and I did a lot of research so
now<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.480> know<00:00:15.630> quite<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:16.020> bit<00:00:16.109> about<00:00:16.289> everything

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
now I know quite a bit about everything

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.970 
now I know quite a bit about everything
now<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.539> don't<00:00:18.660> have<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.960> be<00:00:19.199> worried<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:19.650> I

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
now I don't have to be worried that I

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.550 
now I don't have to be worried that I
might<00:00:20.400> do<00:00:20.550> something<00:00:20.880> wrong

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
might do something wrong

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.310 
might do something wrong
so<00:00:23.100> yeah<00:00:23.310> they<00:00:23.460> laid<00:00:23.640> eggs<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.960> have<00:00:25.170> to

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
so yeah they laid eggs and I have to

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.529 
so yeah they laid eggs and I have to
separate<00:00:25.800> all<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.279> other<00:00:26.430> fish<00:00:26.760> because<00:00:27.210> they

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
separate all the other fish because they

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.169 
separate all the other fish because they
might<00:00:27.660> pose<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.930> risk<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.039> fry<00:00:29.640> once<00:00:29.970> they

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
might pose a risk to the fry once they

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.880 
might pose a risk to the fry once they
get<00:00:30.359> older<00:00:30.689> or<00:00:30.900> once<00:00:31.289> they<00:00:31.410> start<00:00:31.650> free

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
get older or once they start free

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.389 
get older or once they start free

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
in my wet dry filter I make sure that

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.479 
in my wet dry filter I make sure that
the<00:00:42.540> pump<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:42.960> have<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.320> covered<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:44.309> that

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
the pump that I have is covered so that

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.490 
the pump that I have is covered so that
um<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:45.510> know<00:00:45.629> they<00:00:45.780> don't<00:00:45.870> get<00:00:46.050> sucked<00:00:46.289> in

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
um you know they don't get sucked in

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.319 
um you know they don't get sucked in
there<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.160> I'm<00:00:47.280> filling<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.700> up<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.969> little<00:00:48.120> bit

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
there and I'm filling it up a little bit

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.090 
there and I'm filling it up a little bit
extra<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:49.050> then<00:00:49.230> I'm<00:00:49.379> gonna<00:00:49.530> also<00:00:49.649> put<00:00:49.860> an<00:00:49.950> air

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
extra and then I'm gonna also put an air

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.760 
extra and then I'm gonna also put an air
pump<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.520> there<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:50.879> there's<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:52.199> know<00:00:52.320> good

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
pump in there so there's you know good

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.340 
pump in there so there's you know good
water<00:00:53.010> movement<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:54.059> they<00:00:54.660> should<00:00:54.870> be<00:00:54.960> fine<00:00:55.199> in

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
water movement so they should be fine in

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.439 
water movement so they should be fine in
there<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.739> know<00:00:55.860> tell<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.370> fryer<00:00:56.910> are

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
there you know tell the the fryer are

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.670 
there you know tell the the fryer are
big<00:00:57.660> enough<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.699> until<00:00:59.699> they<00:00:59.850> start<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.420> know

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
big enough and until they start you know

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.599 
big enough and until they start you know
feeding<00:01:01.680> properly<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.250> they're<00:01:02.430> big<00:01:02.579> enough

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
feeding properly and they're big enough

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.920 
feeding properly and they're big enough
and<00:01:02.879> they<00:01:02.969> won't<00:01:03.149> fit<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.690> know<00:01:03.780> their

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
and they won't fit in you know their

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.840 
and they won't fit in you know their
mouth<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.400> I<00:01:06.290> don't<00:01:07.290> really<00:01:07.619> have<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
mouth so I don't really have the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.940 
mouth so I don't really have the
resources<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.720> buy<00:01:09.990> another<00:01:10.320> tank<00:01:10.650> right<00:01:10.830> now

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
resources to buy another tank right now

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.649 
resources to buy another tank right now
so<00:01:11.159> that's<00:01:11.280> my<00:01:11.520> only<00:01:11.700> option<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.210> separate

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
so that's my only option is to separate

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.000 
so that's my only option is to separate
the<00:01:12.720> fish<00:01:12.960> by<00:01:13.110> putting<00:01:13.409> them<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.710> wet<00:01:13.890> dry

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
the fish by putting them in the wet dry

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.399 
the fish by putting them in the wet dry
filter<00:01:14.479> but<00:01:15.479> don't<00:01:15.689> have<00:01:15.780> plenty<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.170> space

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
filter but don't have plenty of space

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.039 
filter but don't have plenty of space
and<00:01:16.680> plenty<00:01:16.850> of<00:01:17.850> water<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.299> like<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.750> said<00:01:18.810> I'm

chasing off another fish is the female
so<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.590> way<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.770> can<00:01:59.100> step<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.119> way<00:02:00.210> that

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
so the way I can step to the way that

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.370 
so the way I can step to the way that
you<00:02:00.719> tell<00:02:00.899> them<00:02:01.049> apart<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.590> if<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:03.380> female

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
you tell them apart is if the female

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.319 
you tell them apart is if the female
usually<00:02:04.590> has<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:04.979> little<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.880> thing<00:02:06.060> where<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
usually has a little the thing where the

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.270 
usually has a little the thing where the
eggs<00:02:06.479> come<00:02:06.689> out<00:02:06.750> are<00:02:06.960> usually<00:02:07.740> really<00:02:07.890> long

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
eggs come out are usually really long

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.980
