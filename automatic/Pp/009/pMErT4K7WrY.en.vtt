00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
the original one but it was just way too

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.780 
the original one but it was just way too
dark<00:00:32.960> for<00:00:33.079> me<00:00:33.410> so<00:00:33.830> they<00:00:33.920> contacted<00:00:34.130> me<00:00:34.580> and

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790

new<00:00:36.530> one<00:00:36.950> which<00:00:37.250> is<00:00:37.400> coming<00:00:37.610> out<00:00:37.850> in<00:00:38.150> I<00:00:38.510> think

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
new one which is coming out in I think

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.430 
new one which is coming out in I think
she<00:00:39.230> said<00:00:39.350> it<00:00:39.440> was<00:00:39.530> a<00:00:39.560> month<00:00:39.860> or<00:00:40.100> so<00:00:41.170> which<00:00:42.170> is

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
she said it was a month or so which is

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.160 
she said it was a month or so which is
even<00:00:42.829> lighter<00:00:43.070> so<00:00:44.060> hopefully<00:00:44.660> this<00:00:44.810> will<00:00:44.990> be<00:00:45.140> a

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
even lighter so hopefully this will be a

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.170 
even lighter so hopefully this will be a
little<00:00:45.380> bit<00:00:45.590> better<00:00:45.710> for<00:00:45.920> my<00:00:46.100> skin<00:00:48.100> so<00:00:49.180> yeah

stuff is still on my hand it will not
come<00:01:31.279> off<00:01:31.369> I've<00:01:31.520> tried<00:01:31.819> scrubbing<00:01:32.149> it<00:01:32.509> and

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
come off I've tried scrubbing it and

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.809 
come off I've tried scrubbing it and
it's<00:01:32.899> just<00:01:32.959> not<00:01:33.319> moving<00:01:34.600> so<00:01:35.600> that<00:01:36.079> is<00:01:36.439> the<00:01:36.819> BB

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:37.819 
it's just not moving so that is the BB

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:40.149 
it's just not moving so that is the BB
cream<00:01:37.999> it<00:01:38.899> does<00:01:39.170> look<00:01:39.439> lighter<00:01:39.740> than<00:01:40.100> the

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
cream it does look lighter than the

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:41.649 
cream it does look lighter than the
other<00:01:40.340> one<00:01:40.459> but<00:01:40.639> I'm<00:01:40.759> still<00:01:41.090> thinking<00:01:41.119> it's

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
other one but I'm still thinking it's

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.480 
other one but I'm still thinking it's
gonna<00:01:41.779> be<00:01:41.929> too<00:01:42.049> dark<00:01:42.229> for<00:01:42.380> me<00:01:42.529> because<00:01:43.219> I<00:01:43.340> am

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
gonna be too dark for me because I am

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.330 
gonna be too dark for me because I am
like<00:01:43.969> almost<00:01:44.420> white<00:01:44.719> it's<00:01:45.079> ridiculous<00:01:45.770> so<00:01:46.069> why

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
like almost white it's ridiculous so why

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.959 
like almost white it's ridiculous so why
I<00:01:46.369> am<00:01:46.729> and<00:01:47.539> so<00:01:47.959> I'm<00:01:48.139> just<00:01:48.200> gonna<00:01:48.380> get<00:01:48.649> some<00:01:48.969> in

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
I am and so I'm just gonna get some in

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:55.809 
I am and so I'm just gonna get some in
here<00:01:50.179> and<00:01:50.450> then<00:01:52.240> actually<00:01:54.249> that<00:01:55.249> doesn't<00:01:55.520> look

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:55.819 
here and then actually that doesn't look

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:02.550 
here and then actually that doesn't look
too<00:01:56.060> bad

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.240 

it<00:02:03.560> smells<00:02:04.420> bit<00:02:05.420> weird<00:02:05.660> this<00:02:06.100> it's<00:02:07.100> not

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
it smells bit weird this it's not

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.380 
it smells bit weird this it's not
unpleasant<00:02:07.820> but<00:02:08.350> it<00:02:09.350> certainly<00:02:09.740> got<00:02:09.920> the

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
unpleasant but it certainly got the

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:18.940 
unpleasant but it certainly got the
smell<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:11.690> it<00:02:16.690> so<00:02:17.690> I<00:02:17.720> think<00:02:17.840> this<00:02:18.110> is<00:02:18.260> a<00:02:18.440> much

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
smell to it so I think this is a much

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.620 
smell to it so I think this is a much
better<00:02:19.220> match<00:02:19.520> for<00:02:19.760> my<00:02:19.880> skin<00:02:19.940> than<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.450> last

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
better match for my skin than the last

good<00:03:29.270> because<00:03:30.270> that's<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.600> thing<00:03:30.780> that<00:03:30.930> I

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
good because that's the thing that I

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.290 
good because that's the thing that I
have<00:03:31.290> trouble<00:03:32.130> with<00:03:32.280> with<00:03:32.430> BB<00:03:32.790> creams<00:03:33.090> they

very<00:03:36.120> light<00:03:38.660> could<00:03:39.660> still<00:03:39.930> do<00:03:40.200> with<00:03:40.380> a<00:03:40.410> little

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.710 
very light could still do with a little

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.290 
very light could still do with a little
bit<00:03:40.860> concealer<00:03:41.730> I<00:03:41.760> think

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.949 

okay<00:04:00.230> so<00:04:00.290> there<00:04:00.709> we<00:04:00.739> go<00:04:01.599> I'm<00:04:02.599> quite<00:04:02.840> impressed

okay so there we go I'm quite impressed

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.380 
okay so there we go I'm quite impressed
with<00:04:03.200> that<00:04:03.409> actually<00:04:05.439> seems<00:04:06.439> awkward<00:04:07.390> decent

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
with that actually seems awkward decent

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.539 
with that actually seems awkward decent
for<00:04:08.540> a<00:04:08.569> BB<00:04:08.870> cream<00:04:09.140> I<00:04:09.170> think<00:04:09.500> it's<00:04:10.159> not<00:04:10.310> as<00:04:10.430> good

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
for a BB cream I think it's not as good

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.330 
for a BB cream I think it's not as good
coverage<00:04:10.969> just<00:04:11.180> say<00:04:11.450> like<00:04:11.950> biased<00:04:12.950> a<00:04:13.099> Lauder

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340

Double<00:04:13.840> Wear<00:04:14.840> anything<00:04:15.500> like<00:04:15.620> that<00:04:15.650> but<00:04:15.889> it<00:04:15.980> is

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:16.009 
Double Wear anything like that but it is

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:18.310 
Double Wear anything like that but it is
only<00:04:16.220> a<00:04:16.340> BB<00:04:16.609> cream<00:04:16.910> it<00:04:17.180> feels<00:04:17.449> lighter<00:04:17.959> on<00:04:18.289> the

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
only a BB cream it feels lighter on the
