00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.850
 then the ingredients we need 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.389
 they are very simple are exactly 3 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:18.960
 then I took a squeezed run 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.020
 a dozen oranges and I made one 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.199
 more or less a liter now I have a little 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.990
 removed a bit of nest pulp anyway 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.560
 about a liter of orange juice then 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.480
 I got some berries 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.930
 frozen because they are not found now 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.570
 fresh a generous handful and the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.170
 third ingredient is vanilla in 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.000
 powder 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.519
 I use this here from agriculture 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.460
 organic and nothing so a recipe 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:49.460
 we make it very simple immediately 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:56.360
 then what remains for us to do is 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.360
 just put the t 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:18.680
 then we add the blueberries with gina 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:22.270
 nice little vanilla about and it will be half 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.270
 headphones a little less than half a teaspoon 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.510
 now we have put everything we can 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:35.180
 then blend once we have 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:38.780
 relieved comes out is a very good e 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.780
 we filter because otherwise we say 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.690
 always too much the fault of the rancia pd 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:48.259
 that I put it in a pot 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:54.170
 large and roomy and a colander of 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:58.070
 aluminum thick meshes the blame without 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.990
 criticized by minutes of puncturing then 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.890
 once we showed the whole 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.650
 fault 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.320
 we practically have a spoon 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.590
 centered his den I must say remains 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.350
 all this beautiful and offers you the 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.320
 I would eat 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.660
 you though a sunbed in the short stand 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.370
 you can very well remove half right 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.950
 after the first made you laugh and 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:26.350
 so we can admit ours 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:29.130
 juice you have to press with the spoon if 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.130
 first his voice 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.290
 ok now we can put our the 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.290
 our aid the mug 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.930
 very well 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.890
 looks like a mess 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.740
 see let's taste 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.440
 and exquisite and truly delicious 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.070
 looks the same as his bought 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.650
 practically however this combination 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:16.090
 orange and wild berries 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:19.640
 honestly , we never totaled it 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:23.920
 then we want to put the freshness of a 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.920
 supporter prepared anyway at home by 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.110
 this martyr in all the customers 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.570
