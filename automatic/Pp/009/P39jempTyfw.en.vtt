00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
applications I'll go in to estimate mole

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.190 
applications I'll go in to estimate mole
and<00:01:35.180> I<00:01:36.180> can<00:01:36.690> basically<00:01:38.270> draw<00:01:39.270> or<00:01:39.540> thai<00:01:39.840> border

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
and it actually works so that's pretty

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.520 
and it actually works so that's pretty
amazing<00:02:17.910> for<00:02:18.360> me<00:02:18.420> what<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.810> s-pen<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.170> wasn't
