00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
for her spares and lost a little bit of

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.690 
for her spares and lost a little bit of
feel<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.329> ball<00:00:39.510> there<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.780> think<00:00:40.610> going<00:00:41.610> to

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
feel of the ball there I think going to

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.490 
feel of the ball there I think going to
come<00:00:41.879> back<00:00:42.059> apply<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.480> piece<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.750> tape<00:00:43.079> as<00:00:43.320> she

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
come back apply a piece of tape as she

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.860 
come back apply a piece of tape as she
came<00:00:43.890> through<00:00:44.129> her<00:00:44.219> backswing<00:00:44.789> appears<00:00:45.629> as<00:00:45.840> if

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
came through her backswing appears as if

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.680 
came through her backswing appears as if
she<00:00:46.170> was<00:00:46.950> going<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.280> lose<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:48.000> she<00:00:48.059> didn't

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
she was going to lose it so she didn't

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.880 
she was going to lose it so she didn't
have<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.840> tape<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.379> she<00:00:49.920> had<00:00:50.039> something<00:00:50.780> cool

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
have the tape it she had something cool

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.049 
have the tape it she had something cool
little<00:00:52.890> grip<00:00:53.129> cream<00:00:54.020> and<00:00:55.670> obviously<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.730> wise

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
little grip cream and obviously a wise

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.060 
little grip cream and obviously a wise
decision<00:00:57.350> I'd<00:00:58.350> say<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.680> takes<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.920> lot<00:00:59.010> of

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
decision I'd say that takes a lot of

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.810 
decision I'd say that takes a lot of
concentration<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.910> stop<00:01:00.440> mid<00:01:01.440> approach<00:01:01.820> well

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
concentration to stop mid approach well

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.100 
concentration to stop mid approach well
if<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.090> swing<00:01:03.359> your<00:01:03.480> ball<00:01:03.660> back<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:04.080> your

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
if you swing your ball back in your

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.170 
if you swing your ball back in your
backswing<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.860> feel<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.159> either<00:01:05.729> slip

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
backswing and you feel it either slip

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.000 
backswing and you feel it either slip
off<00:01:06.330> your<00:01:06.360> thumb<00:01:07.020> or<00:01:07.260> actually<00:01:07.619> maybe<00:01:07.890> not

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
off your thumb or actually maybe not

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.420 
off your thumb or actually maybe not
give<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.580> all<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.180> going<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.540> hang<00:01:09.750> then

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
give it all and it's going to hang then

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.830 
give it all and it's going to hang then
we<00:01:11.430> want<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.790> come<00:01:11.970> back<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.330> do<00:01:12.450> something

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
tour and I would say that probably speed

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.949 
tour and I would say that probably speed
and<00:03:16.400> ball<00:03:16.910> weights<00:03:17.180> would<00:03:17.299> have<00:03:17.360> a<00:03:17.480> lot<00:03:17.660> to<00:03:17.810> do

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
going to leave that 79 well the lanes

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.660 
going to leave that 79 well the lanes
were<00:03:26.750> a<00:03:26.780> long<00:03:27.290> well<00:03:27.560> this<00:03:27.830> week<00:03:28.070> conditioned
