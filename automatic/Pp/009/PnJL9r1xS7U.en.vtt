00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
is gonna be under an angle right about

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.370 
is gonna be under an angle right about
here<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:14.940> is<00:02:15.030> huge<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.570> it's<00:02:15.750> heavy<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.140> it's

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
here and is huge and it's heavy and it's

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:26.120 
here and is huge and it's heavy and it's
gonna<00:02:16.470> be<00:02:16.620> big<00:02:19.820> so<00:02:20.820> anyways<00:02:22.670> that's<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.850> tool<00:02:25.130> so

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
gonna be big so anyways that's a tool so

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.449 
gonna be big so anyways that's a tool so
I've<00:02:26.880> started<00:02:27.090> on<00:02:27.300> this<00:02:27.540> part<00:02:27.810> of<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:27.990> wing

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
I've started on this part of the wing

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.980 
I've started on this part of the wing
I'm<00:02:29.459> gonna<00:02:29.670> use<00:02:29.820> all<00:02:30.090> these<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.660> make<00:02:30.810> it

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
I'm gonna use all these to make it

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.440 
to find the the Lego wiring for this
which<00:02:58.530> would<00:02:58.880> obviously<00:02:59.880> make<00:03:00.300> the

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
which would obviously make the

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.880 
which would obviously make the
electricity<00:03:00.900> go<00:03:01.019> from<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.320> battery<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.620> this

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
electricity go from the battery to this

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.759 
electricity go from the battery to this
one<00:03:02.450> well<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.630> better<00:03:03.810> in<00:03:03.989> everything<00:03:04.290> who

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
one well the better in everything who

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.350 
one well the better in everything who
come<00:03:05.010> right<00:03:05.220> here<00:03:06.320> probably<00:03:07.320> in<00:03:08.280> this<00:03:08.880> area

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
come right here probably in this area

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.000 
come right here probably in this area
because<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:11.400> wing<00:03:11.580> will<00:03:11.760> be<00:03:11.790> attached<00:03:12.300> here

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
because the wing will be attached here

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.540 
because the wing will be attached here
this<00:03:14.010> will<00:03:14.190> be<00:03:14.280> cargo<00:03:14.670> bay<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:17.160> center

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
this will be cargo bay the center

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.210 
this will be cargo bay the center
landing<00:03:17.910> gear<00:03:18.030> comes<00:03:18.209> here<00:03:18.360> obviously<00:03:19.040> so<00:03:20.040> I

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
landing gear comes here obviously so I

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.800 
landing gear comes here obviously so I
have<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.430> lot<00:03:20.580> of<00:03:20.610> space<00:03:20.820> here<00:03:20.880> because<00:03:21.780> the

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
have a lot of space here because the

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.850 
have a lot of space here because the
aerodynamics<00:03:24.810> of<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:24.959> center<00:03:25.290> fuel<00:03:25.530> tank<00:03:25.709> are

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
aerodynamics of the center fuel tank are

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.530 
aerodynamics of the center fuel tank are
on<00:03:25.950> all<00:03:26.070> the<00:03:26.190> way<00:03:26.280> up<00:03:26.550> here<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:26.910> it's<00:03:27.360> a<00:03:27.420> bit

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
on all the way up here and it's a bit

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.560 
on all the way up here and it's a bit
bigger<00:03:27.810> than<00:03:28.070> whatever<00:03:32.180> and<00:03:33.180> then<00:03:33.330> from<00:03:33.480> the

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
bigger than whatever and then from the

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.949 
bigger than whatever and then from the
locking<00:03:33.870> system<00:03:34.410> thing<00:03:35.130> so<00:03:35.940> that's<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.780> thing

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
locking system thing so that's the thing

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.949 
locking system thing so that's the thing
that<00:03:37.140> actually<00:03:37.730> extends<00:03:38.730> like<00:03:38.880> this<00:03:41.959> I'm

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
that actually extends like this I'm

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.670 
that actually extends like this I'm
gonna<00:03:43.200> connect<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.769> this<00:03:43.950> -<00:03:44.250> yeah<00:03:45.380> so<00:03:46.380> local

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
gonna connect to this - yeah so local

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.420 
gonna connect to this - yeah so local
king<00:03:46.920> will<00:03:48.650> go<00:03:49.650> like<00:03:49.799> that<00:03:50.420> there<00:03:52.160> I'll<00:03:53.160> put

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
king will go like that there I'll put

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.460 
king will go like that there I'll put
one<00:03:53.580> of<00:03:53.700> these<00:03:53.820> two<00:03:54.450> wheels<00:03:54.750> things

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
one of these two wheels things

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.580 
one of these two wheels things
one<00:03:57.190> here<00:03:57.550> on<00:03:57.700> my<00:03:57.880> degree<00:03:58.180> angle<00:03:58.480> -<00:04:01.410> how<00:04:02.410> do<00:04:02.470> you

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
one here on my degree angle - how do you

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.650 
one here on my degree angle - how do you
call<00:04:02.800> it

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
call it

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.830 
call it
one<00:04:04.660> of<00:04:04.780> these<00:04:06.030> these<00:04:07.030> things<00:04:07.450> a<00:04:07.570> little<00:04:07.690> bit

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
one of these these things a little bit

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.810 
one of these these things a little bit
longer<00:04:08.190> then<00:04:09.190> they<00:04:09.490> will<00:04:09.730> be<00:04:11.400> run<00:04:12.400> through

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
longer then they will be run through

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.920 
longer then they will be run through
this<00:04:13.210> one<00:04:13.450> and<00:04:14.400> did<00:04:15.400> this<00:04:15.550> one<00:04:15.700> -<00:04:15.910> this<00:04:16.780> should

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
this one and did this one - this should

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.080 
this one and did this one - this should
be<00:04:17.019> in<00:04:17.080> a<00:04:17.170> reverse<00:04:17.470> probably<00:04:18.070> so<00:04:18.430> I<00:04:18.670> need<00:04:19.000> to

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
be in a reverse probably so I need to

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.140 
be in a reverse probably so I need to
think<00:04:19.360> of<00:04:19.450> something<00:04:19.690> for<00:04:19.810> that<00:04:20.070> um<00:04:21.070> said<00:04:21.970> that

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
think of something for that um said that

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.390 
think of something for that um said that
Lanigan<00:04:22.450> will<00:04:22.540> also<00:04:22.720> pop<00:04:22.870> down<00:04:26.070> so<00:04:27.070> that's

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
Lanigan will also pop down so that's

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:34.830 
Lanigan will also pop down so that's
pretty<00:04:27.730> much<00:04:27.880> it<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:34.090> eight<00:04:34.240> update<00:04:34.630> will

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
pretty much it the eight update will

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.530 
pretty much it the eight update will
come<00:04:35.020> this<00:04:35.650> weekend<00:04:36.220> hopefully<00:04:36.460> I<00:04:36.880> already

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
come this weekend hopefully I already

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.200 
come this weekend hopefully I already
said<00:04:37.750> last<00:04:38.200> weekend<00:04:38.650> but<00:04:38.800> I<00:04:39.120> didn't<00:04:40.120> have

I've<00:04:41.770> tried<00:04:42.370> working<00:04:42.730> on<00:04:42.790> the<00:04:42.880> landing<00:04:43.210> gear

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
I've tried working on the landing gear

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.030 
I've tried working on the landing gear
but<00:04:43.510> it<00:04:43.600> took<00:04:43.720> me<00:04:43.840> so<00:04:44.200> much<00:04:44.410> time<00:04:44.470> and<00:04:44.980> I

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
but it took me so much time and I

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.390 
but it took me so much time and I
couldn't<00:04:45.280> find<00:04:45.630> the<00:04:46.630> right<00:04:46.750> pieces<00:04:47.050> for<00:04:47.500> the

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
couldn't find the right pieces for the

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.570 
couldn't find the right pieces for the
proper<00:04:48.760> landing<00:04:49.030> gear<00:04:53.010> I'm<00:04:54.010> just<00:04:54.220> gonna<00:04:54.370> show

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
proper landing gear I'm just gonna show

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.810 
proper landing gear I'm just gonna show
you<00:04:54.610> the<00:04:55.000> wheel<00:04:55.210> size<00:04:55.510> I<00:04:55.900> used<00:04:56.820> minifigure

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
you the wheel size I used minifigure

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.890 
you the wheel size I used minifigure
that's<00:04:58.540> a<00:04:58.630> wheel<00:04:59.940> then<00:05:00.940> sits<00:05:01.270> pretty<00:05:01.570> high<00:05:01.870> on

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
that's a wheel then sits pretty high on

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.080 
that's a wheel then sits pretty high on
this<00:05:02.200> landing<00:05:02.560> gear<00:05:02.800> if<00:05:03.250> this<00:05:03.460> is<00:05:03.610> the<00:05:03.760> wing

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.310 

the<00:05:07.090> guy<00:05:07.240> will<00:05:07.419> stand<00:05:07.660> like<00:05:07.810> yeah<00:05:08.020> the<00:05:08.200> man

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
the guy will stand like yeah the man

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.490 
the guy will stand like yeah the man
will<00:05:08.440> probably<00:05:10.410> be<00:05:11.410> this<00:05:13.200> thick<00:05:14.200> white

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
will probably be this thick white

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.909 
will probably be this thick white
whatever<00:05:15.060> so<00:05:16.060> like<00:05:16.990> a<00:05:17.020> man<00:05:17.230> standing<00:05:17.770> here
