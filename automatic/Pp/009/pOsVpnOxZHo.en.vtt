00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 the long-awaited group league derby 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.810
 between the tsv altenlotheim and the 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.680
 fsg ederbringhausen Buchenberg found 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.849
 no winner 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.110
 2 2 the teams separated on the upper stream 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.580
 for the newcomer it felt 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.859
 but like a victory 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.320
 was still an hour and hour old 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.080
 the 2 0 already on the winner road 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.760
 About 600 fans gathered around 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.859
 long abstinence again a derby 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.460
 join in between the two 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.769
 to be able to 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.349
 they just said hello and was happy 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.430
 himself of the weather as a florian one 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.370
 brainstorm had 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.290
 after 150 seconds he leaves the entire 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:43.170
 get off the bench and pull away 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:46.739
 unsustainable for ricohs in the gate from what a 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.629
 state in derby by player change 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.100
 contained in the last two years 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.530
 the party special explosiveness 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.780
 so altenlotheim left it then 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.710
 captain oliver ironman the club 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.870
 direction home 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.030
 he plays with his at the fsg 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.699
 brother andy together and gets his 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.650
 father günther has already been training for one year 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.420
 previously florian heine and rené 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.830
 kleinmanns gone the other way 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.799
 they changed from ederbringhausen 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.970
 Buchenberg more altenlotheim 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.790
 Nevertheless, the fsg managed the 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.590
 group league rise almost would be them 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.070
 after 20 minutes also the compensation 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.140
 successful 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.810
 but christoph mason shot missed 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.790
 the goal is almost favorite altenlotheim 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.790
 struggled to achieve more of a goal though 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.369
 except garden try from the 25 minute 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.200
 Not much came out of it on the 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.970
 On the other hand, mario hesitated to be amert 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.329
 Shot after half an hour too long 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.119
 It was a fair game 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.380
 except for a few gruff two fights remained 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.350
 everything in the green area 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.110
 in half two, nothing happened until long 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.750
 Healing in the 62 minute came to the ball 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.700
 From a sharp angle he pulls off 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.230
 the thigh of stain and thus 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.980
 untenable for sascha 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.980
 from two to gold 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.410
 No trains of 16 meters on the long 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.780
 post over 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.490
 and in the backhaus checks the shiny 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.850
 parry ricos for a corner 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.850
 the distance 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:14.030
 everything looked after the points 10 11 and 12 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.730
 for the tsv altenlotheim from up to 77 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.130
 minute since the impartial showed up 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.410
 the eleven-meter point mario amert leaned 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.060
 beforehand backwards nils buck from the 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.370
 turn his arms around the chest of 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.080
 attacker had laid 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.599
 nevertheless a very petty one 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.480
 decision to the substitute 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:35.690
 michael ziegler did not care he does that 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.150
 1 2 Now the guests brought the crowbar 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.420
 out clearly she believes in one again 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.680
 point just before the final whistle came almost 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.959
 with his head to the ball 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.730
 one should contact the game device 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.670
 However, he is looking for something later 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.799
 on exactly balanced after 90 minutes 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.030
 He interjected a message from Andy Eisenmann 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.030
 2 2 in the mesh 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.959
 incomprehensible the compensation the school mountain 11 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.530
 should still be a standard situation 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.870
 to get 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.140
 but sascha ricos was at the bremer 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.079
 free kick on the post 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.209
 so it remained at the 2 2 over the guests 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.250
 probably overjoyed and with the 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.549
 tsv altenlotheim probably still a bit quarrel 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.549
 becomes
