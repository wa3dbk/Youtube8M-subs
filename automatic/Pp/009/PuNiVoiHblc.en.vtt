oil to fry the Cory's the holds

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.789 
oil to fry the Cory's the holds
temperature<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> key<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.780> make<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.140> Puri<00:01:43.380> so

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
temperature is a key to make the Puri so

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.100 
temperature is a key to make the Puri so
make<00:01:44.070> sure<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.490> oil<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.850> very<00:01:44.909> hot<00:01:45.299> if<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.930> oil

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
is medium or low then the buoys might

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.510 
is medium or low then the buoys might
get<00:01:48.930> soft<00:01:49.229> from<00:01:49.470> one<00:01:49.680> side<00:01:49.920> or<00:01:50.159> soft
