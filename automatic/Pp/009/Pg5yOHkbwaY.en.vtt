00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:12.020
 These are the 10 points I can do as 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.899
 somehow showed when I took to Cyprus 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:22.130
 But more for me with a reticulation of 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:25.350

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:32.490

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:35.250
 light like that and of course my 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.890
 reticulation favorite although we are all here these 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.930

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.810

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:57.509

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:01.649
