open also so what I did was I fished it
from<00:02:55.350> below<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:56.280> up<00:02:56.489> top<00:02:57.890> so<00:02:58.890> I<00:02:58.920> plug<00:02:59.280> I<00:02:59.549> plugged

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
from below to up top so I plug I plugged

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.770 
from below to up top so I plug I plugged
it<00:03:00.209> here<00:03:01.370> well<00:03:02.370> you<00:03:02.790> have<00:03:02.910> plenty<00:03:02.940> of<00:03:03.299> wire<00:03:03.540> so

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
it here well you have plenty of wire so

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.100 
it here well you have plenty of wire so
I<00:03:03.840> zip<00:03:04.140> tied<00:03:04.349> the<00:03:05.010> wire<00:03:05.450> to<00:03:06.450> make<00:03:06.599> a<00:03:06.660> nice<00:03:06.870> and

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
I zip tied the wire to make a nice and

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.839 
I zip tied the wire to make a nice and
neat<00:03:07.260> so<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.530> doesn't<00:03:07.830> dangle<00:03:08.160> down<00:03:10.760> so<00:03:11.760> I

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
neat so it doesn't dangle down so I

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.240 
neat so it doesn't dangle down so I
fished<00:03:12.360> it<00:03:12.599> behind<00:03:13.049> here<00:03:14.269> behind<00:03:15.269> over<00:03:15.780> here

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
fished it behind here behind over here

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.640 
fished it behind here behind over here
fished<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.459> up<00:03:19.579> and<00:03:20.660> then<00:03:21.660> I<00:03:21.840> was<00:03:22.019> able<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.380> fish

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
fished it up and then I was able to fish

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.080 
fished it up and then I was able to fish
it<00:03:22.859> from<00:03:23.640> up<00:03:24.380> from<00:03:25.380> through<00:03:25.590> here<00:03:25.980> well<00:03:26.910> from

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
it from up from through here well from

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.840 
it from up from through here well from
behind<00:03:27.269> here<00:03:27.540> because<00:03:27.720> I<00:03:27.810> have<00:03:27.930> this<00:03:28.079> open<00:03:28.290> and

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
behind here because I have this open and

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.030 
behind here because I have this open and
this<00:03:29.850> one<00:03:30.090> is<00:03:30.239> already<00:03:30.510> off<00:03:30.660> so<00:03:31.530> it's<00:03:31.859> like<00:03:32.010> a

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
this one is already off so it's like a

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.460 
this one is already off so it's like a
one-way<00:03:32.519> it's<00:03:33.390> really<00:03:33.780> easy<00:03:33.930> once<00:03:34.260> you<00:03:34.319> have

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
one-way it's really easy once you have

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.069 
one-way it's really easy once you have
everything<00:03:34.650> off<00:03:35.069> you'll<00:03:35.730> see<00:03:36.000> how<00:03:36.299> easy<00:03:36.690> it

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
everything off you'll see how easy it

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.530 
everything off you'll see how easy it
actually<00:03:37.440> it<00:03:37.560> is<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:37.970> then<00:03:38.970> just<00:03:39.120> plugged<00:03:39.420> it

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
actually it is and then just plugged it

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.349 
actually it is and then just plugged it
into<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:40.019> engage<00:03:40.620> and<00:03:41.010> then<00:03:41.370> that's<00:03:41.700> about<00:03:42.329> it

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
into the engage and then that's about it

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:45.410 
into the engage and then that's about it
I<00:03:42.630> haven't<00:03:43.310> you<00:03:44.310> know<00:03:44.370> I<00:03:44.459> haven't<00:03:44.639> had<00:03:45.239> any

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
I haven't you know I haven't had any

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.530 
I haven't you know I haven't had any
problems<00:03:45.810> so<00:03:45.959> far<00:03:45.989> with<00:03:46.410> it<00:03:46.440> I<00:03:47.000> don't<00:03:48.000> know<00:03:48.209> if

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
problems so far with it I don't know if

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.150 
problems so far with it I don't know if
it<00:03:48.720> gets<00:03:48.870> really<00:03:49.109> cold<00:03:49.440> if<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:49.799> causes<00:03:49.980> any

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
it gets really cold if it causes any

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.069 
it gets really cold if it causes any
problems<00:03:50.250> with<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:50.790> AC<00:03:50.940> on<00:03:51.180> all<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.870> time

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
problems with the AC on all the time

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.870 
problems with the AC on all the time
because<00:03:52.290> I'm<00:03:52.650> in<00:03:52.769> South<00:03:52.950> Florida<00:03:53.130> so<00:03:53.549> we<00:03:53.730> have

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
because I'm in South Florida so we have

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.030 
because I'm in South Florida so we have
the<00:03:54.000> AC<00:03:54.150> on<00:03:54.329> like<00:03:54.720> one<00:03:55.530> hundred<00:03:55.739> percent<00:03:55.769> of

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
the AC on like one hundred percent of

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.520 
the AC on like one hundred percent of
time<00:03:56.250> especially<00:03:56.400> in<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.850> summertime<00:03:57.120> I

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
time especially in the summertime I

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.900 
time especially in the summertime I
don't<00:03:58.530> know<00:03:58.739> if<00:03:58.920> it'll<00:03:59.069> cause<00:03:59.280> any<00:03:59.519> problems

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
don't know if it'll cause any problems

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.960 
don't know if it'll cause any problems
as<00:04:00.060> far<00:04:00.090> as<00:04:00.480> if<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:02.220> engage<00:04:02.579> will<00:04:02.790> work

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
as far as if the the engage will work

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.180 
as far as if the the engage will work
properly<00:04:03.180> in<00:04:03.569> very<00:04:03.870> extreme<00:04:04.470> cold<00:04:04.950> conditions

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
properly in very extreme cold conditions

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.479 
properly in very extreme cold conditions
I<00:04:05.760> I<00:04:06.750> don't<00:04:07.109> know<00:04:07.200> how<00:04:07.319> cold<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.739> AC<00:04:07.769> comes<00:04:08.310> out

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
I I don't know how cold the AC comes out

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.379 
I I don't know how cold the AC comes out
probably<00:04:08.760> what<00:04:09.090> 40<00:04:09.989> degrees<00:04:10.319> or<00:04:10.700> 45<00:04:11.700> no<00:04:12.090> idea

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
probably what 40 degrees or 45 no idea

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.750 
probably what 40 degrees or 45 no idea
let<00:04:13.170> me<00:04:13.260> know<00:04:13.440> if<00:04:13.709> anybody<00:04:14.190> knows<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.549> answer

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
let me know if anybody knows the answer

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.029 
let me know if anybody knows the answer
to<00:04:14.790> that<00:04:15.169> but<00:04:16.169> that's<00:04:16.229> about<00:04:16.620> it<00:04:16.680> and

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
to that but that's about it and

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.250 
to that but that's about it and
straightforward<00:04:17.850> you<00:04:18.239> just<00:04:18.450> pry<00:04:18.630> stuff<00:04:18.930> apart

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
straightforward you just pry stuff apart

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.940 
straightforward you just pry stuff apart
and<00:04:19.769> then<00:04:20.130> just<00:04:20.400> pop<00:04:20.789> them<00:04:20.940> right<00:04:21.000> back<00:04:21.269> in

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
and then just pop them right back in

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.500 
and then just pop them right back in
luckily<00:04:22.950> like<00:04:23.159> I<00:04:23.250> said<00:04:23.430> I<00:04:23.460> didn't<00:04:24.150> break<00:04:24.300> any

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
luckily like I said I didn't break any

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.840 
luckily like I said I didn't break any
of<00:04:24.630> the

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
of the

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.410 
of the
of<00:04:26.850> the<00:04:27.120> clips<00:04:27.650> they're<00:04:28.650> pretty<00:04:28.800> sturdy<00:04:29.420> just

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
of the clips they're pretty sturdy just

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.780 
of the clips they're pretty sturdy just
don't<00:04:30.660> be<00:04:30.840> afraid<00:04:31.170> to<00:04:31.380> pry<00:04:31.860> them<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:32.400> pry<00:04:32.580> them

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
don't be afraid to pry them to pry them

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:38.270 
don't be afraid to pry them to pry them
open<00:04:33.560> that's<00:04:34.560> about<00:04:34.860> it<00:04:35.270> thanks
