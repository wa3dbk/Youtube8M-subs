00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
like one of these guys um for $14.99 you

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.430 
like one of these guys um for $14.99 you
get<00:02:31.260> two<00:02:31.590> gigabytes<00:02:32.130> which<00:02:33.030> is<00:02:33.330> nothing<00:02:34.260> it's

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
get two gigabytes which is nothing it's

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.430 
get two gigabytes which is nothing it's
like<00:02:34.760> not<00:02:35.760> anything<00:02:36.480> compared<00:02:37.020> to<00:02:37.110> how<00:02:37.320> much

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
like not anything compared to how much

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.490 
like not anything compared to how much
this<00:02:37.620> is<00:02:37.800> and<00:02:37.950> it's<00:02:38.070> like<00:02:38.780> what<00:02:39.780> like<00:02:40.050> three

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
this is and it's like what like three

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.680 
this is and it's like what like three
times<00:02:40.770> more<00:02:41.130> money<00:02:41.310> for<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.790> other<00:02:41.910> ones<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:42.480> I

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
times more money for the other ones so I

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.530 
times more money for the other ones so I
really<00:02:43.260> think<00:02:43.470> it's<00:02:43.620> like<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.130> good<00:02:44.210> deals<00:02:45.210> and

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.480 
really think it's like a good deals and
that<00:02:45.600> they<00:02:45.780> really<00:02:46.050> actually<00:02:46.290> like<00:02:46.800> know<00:02:47.220> that

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
that they really actually like know that

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.670 
that they really actually like know that
not<00:02:47.760> many<00:02:47.790> people<00:02:48.120> have<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.780> like<00:02:49.320> all<00:02:49.530> this

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
not many people have a like all this

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.860 
not many people have a like all this
money<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:50.040> blow<00:02:50.130> in<00:02:50.310> servers<00:02:50.730> so<00:02:50.970> it's<00:02:51.720> a

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
money to blow in servers so it's a

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.470 
money to blow in servers so it's a
really<00:02:52.020> really<00:02:52.740> really<00:02:53.040> good<00:02:53.480> hosting
