00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
voila and I've got a very precise angle

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.400 
voila and I've got a very precise angle
that<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.520> need<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.820> match<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.050> first<00:00:40.260> thing

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
I'm going to do is start on the far side

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.150 
I'm going to do is start on the far side
and<00:00:42.420> bring<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:42.960> cut<00:00:43.260> back<00:00:43.500> towards<00:00:43.950> me<00:00:44.129> a

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
and bring the cut back towards me a

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.250 
and bring the cut back towards me a
little<00:00:44.219> bit<00:00:44.550> you've<00:00:45.120> got<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.420> really<00:00:45.719> take<00:00:46.110> the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
little bit you've got to really take the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.750 
little bit you've got to really take the
weight<00:00:46.440> off<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.920> saw<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.430> I'm<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.670> gonna

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
weight off the saw and I'm just gonna

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.910 
weight off the saw and I'm just gonna
use<00:00:47.879> my<00:00:48.030> fingers<00:00:48.660> on<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.410> other<00:00:49.559> side<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
use my fingers on the other side of the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.380 
use my fingers on the other side of the
blade<00:00:50.100> here<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.430> support<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.000> little<00:00:51.210> bit

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
blade here to support it a little bit

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.540 
blade here to support it a little bit
but<00:00:51.960> if<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.170> take<00:00:52.440> all<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.949> weight<00:00:53.129> off<00:00:53.309> the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
but if you take all the weight off the

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.430 
but if you take all the weight off the
saw<00:00:53.789> it'll<00:00:54.329> God<00:00:54.690> glide<00:00:55.469> nicely<00:00:57.140> right<00:00:58.140> there

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
saw it'll God glide nicely right there

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:07.460 
saw it'll God glide nicely right there
on<00:00:58.710> my<00:00:59.010> knife<00:00:59.309> line<00:01:04.610> and<00:01:05.810> I<00:01:06.810> just<00:01:06.840> follow<00:01:07.320> a

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
on my knife line and I just follow a

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.920 
on my knife line and I just follow a
line<00:01:07.680> back<00:01:07.950> maybe<00:01:08.430> about<00:01:08.610> half<00:01:08.880> way<00:01:09.150> I'm<00:01:09.810> gonna

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
line back maybe about half way I'm gonna

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.660 
line back maybe about half way I'm gonna
come<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.350> near<00:01:10.560> side<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.220> do<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.369> same

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
come to the near side and do the same

come to the near side and do the same
thing<00:01:12.060> take<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> weight<00:01:12.930> off<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.439> soft<00:01:14.010> Oh<00:01:15.229> a

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.980 

couple<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.220> light<00:01:20.430> cuts<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.939> get<00:01:21.030> started

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.230 

connect<00:01:30.649> those<00:01:30.799> lines<00:01:31.159> now<00:01:31.700> I've<00:01:31.850> got<00:01:32.060> that

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
connect those lines now I've got that

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.330 
connect those lines now I've got that
angle<00:01:32.600> across<00:01:32.780> the<00:01:33.020> face<00:01:33.289> I'm<00:01:33.859> paying

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
angle across the face I'm paying

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.700 
angle across the face I'm paying
attention<00:01:34.789> to<00:01:34.939> my<00:01:35.179> knife<00:01:35.479> line<00:01:35.780> down<00:01:36.229> the<00:01:36.560> edge

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
attention to my knife line down the edge

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.730 
attention to my knife line down the edge
here<00:01:37.130> and<00:01:37.369> for<00:01:37.609> a<00:01:37.850> big<00:01:38.450> and<00:01:38.810> very<00:01:39.049> precise<00:01:39.380> cut

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
here and for a big and very precise cut

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.529 
here and for a big and very precise cut
like<00:01:39.950> this<00:01:40.130> I'll<00:01:40.399> carry<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.850> knife<00:01:41.030> line<00:01:41.270> all

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
like this I'll carry the knife line all

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:48.910 
like this I'll carry the knife line all
the<00:01:41.780> way<00:01:41.810> around<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.259> board<00:01:47.709> angled<00:01:48.709> down

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
the way around the board angled down

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.980 
the way around the board angled down
it's<00:01:49.549> now<00:01:49.700> pretty<00:01:50.060> certain<00:01:50.420> I'm<00:01:50.509> following

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
it's now pretty certain I'm following

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.929 
it's now pretty certain I'm following
plumb<00:01:51.319> if<00:01:51.619> I<00:01:51.740> look<00:01:51.950> over<00:01:52.159> on<00:01:52.219> this<00:01:52.369> side<00:01:52.429> I<00:01:52.670> can

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
plumb if I look over on this side I can

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.569 
plumb if I look over on this side I can
see<00:01:53.359> that<00:01:53.659> I'm<00:01:53.780> right<00:01:54.560> on<00:01:54.740> my<00:01:54.950> line<00:01:55.189> but<00:01:55.490> I'm

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
see that I'm right on my line but I'm

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:02.469 
see that I'm right on my line but I'm
going<00:01:55.849> to<00:02:00.579> drop<00:02:01.579> that<00:02:01.640> curve<00:02:02.060> down<00:02:02.270> a<00:02:02.299> little

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
going to drop that curve down a little

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.449 
going to drop that curve down a little
bit<00:02:02.629> more<00:02:02.929> so<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:03.739> cut<00:02:03.950> is<00:02:04.069> now<00:02:04.250> established

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459 
bit more so the cut is now established

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:08.199 
bit more so the cut is now established
plumb<00:02:05.420> and<00:02:05.709> not<00:02:06.709> square<00:02:07.189> but<00:02:07.459> in<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.849> angle

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
plumb and not square but in the angle

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.999 
plumb and not square but in the angle
that<00:02:08.269> I'm<00:02:08.390> looking<00:02:08.539> for<00:02:08.750> so<00:02:09.470> I<00:02:09.530> want<00:02:09.709> to<00:02:09.739> settle

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
that I'm looking for so I want to settle

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.309 
that I'm looking for so I want to settle
in<00:02:10.250> and<00:02:10.399> make<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:10.819> saw<00:02:11.060> cut<00:02:11.420> even<00:02:12.200> though

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
in and make the saw cut even though

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.809
