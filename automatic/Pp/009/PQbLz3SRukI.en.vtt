00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.889 
hi yesterday I did my first spray
painting<00:00:03.300> job<00:00:03.710> using<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:05.450> pressure<00:00:06.450> air

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
painting job using a pressure air

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.910 
painting job using a pressure air
pressure<00:00:08.150> tank<00:00:09.150> and<00:00:12.380> there<00:00:13.380> were<00:00:13.559> things<00:00:13.769> that

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
pressure tank and there were things that

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.090 
pressure tank and there were things that
I<00:00:14.160> had<00:00:14.519> no<00:00:14.880> idea<00:00:15.089> how<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.509> set<00:00:15.780> up<00:00:15.929> so<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.800> I

to<00:00:29.369> you'll<00:00:30.300> have<00:00:30.449> your<00:00:30.990> pressure<00:00:31.230> tank<00:00:31.910> assume

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
to you'll have your pressure tank assume

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.540 
to you'll have your pressure tank assume
you<00:00:33.059> already<00:00:33.180> have<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.750> or<00:00:34.190> going<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.309> rent

have the you screw this into the top
here<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.649> you're<00:00:52.649> going<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.829> put<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.129> paint

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
here and you're going to put the paint

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.319 
here and you're going to put the paint
in<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.899> top<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.440> inside<00:00:56.340> there

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
in the top of that inside there

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.410 
in the top of that inside there
you<00:00:57.960> should<00:00:59.030> dilute<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.210> paint<00:01:01.250> and<00:01:02.420> you'll

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
you should dilute the paint and you'll

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.420 
you should dilute the paint and you'll
have<00:01:03.629> instructions<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.799> can<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.189> paint

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
have instructions on the can of paint

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.230 
have instructions on the can of paint
how<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.970> dilute<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.540> paint<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:07.409> use<00:01:07.619> here<00:01:11.030> okay

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
how to dilute the paint to use here okay

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.690 
how to dilute the paint to use here okay
so<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.810> put<00:01:12.990> your<00:01:13.020> paint<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.470> there<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.979> then

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
so you put your paint in there and then

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.179 
so you put your paint in there and then
your<00:01:17.700> tank<00:01:18.030> here<00:01:18.540> has<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.470> pressure<00:01:19.710> setting

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
your tank here has a pressure setting

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.340 
your tank here has a pressure setting
for<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.520> tank<00:01:20.790> itself<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.479> then<00:01:22.080> pressure

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
for the tank itself and then pressure

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.219 
for the tank itself and then pressure
setting<00:01:22.920> for<00:01:24.320> what<00:01:26.600> what's<00:01:27.600> going<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.869> come<00:01:28.049> up

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
setting for what what's going to come up

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.429 
setting for what what's going to come up
into<00:01:28.530> your<00:01:28.860> sprayer<00:01:29.299> okay<00:01:30.299> I'm<00:01:30.960> going<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.320> be

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
into your sprayer okay I'm going to be

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.569 
into your sprayer okay I'm going to be
spraying<00:01:31.770> at<00:01:32.009> 50<00:01:32.430> psi<00:01:33.710> so<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:35.159> have<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.369> turn

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
spraying at 50 psi so you have to turn

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.289 
spraying at 50 psi so you have to turn
this<00:01:35.729> on<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.270> make<00:01:37.020> sure<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.320> tank<00:01:37.650> pressure

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
this on and make sure the tank pressure

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.020 
this on and make sure the tank pressure
has<00:01:39.320> more<00:01:40.320> pressure<00:01:40.710> than<00:01:41.640> where<00:01:41.909> you're

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
has more pressure than where you're

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.639 
has more pressure than where you're
going<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.270> get<00:01:42.390> out<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.200> I'm<00:01:43.350> putting

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
going to get out of it so I'm putting

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.130 
going to get out of it so I'm putting
I'm<00:01:43.979> going<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.310> turn<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.759> on<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.180> get<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.810> up<00:01:46.020> to

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
I'm going to turn it on and get it up to

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:59.620 
I'm going to turn it on and get it up to
90<00:01:46.170> psi

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.420 

just<00:02:00.630> for<00:02:00.840> demonstrations<00:02:01.560> sake<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.980> got<00:02:02.160> it<00:02:02.280> up

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
just for demonstrations sake I got it up

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.420 
just for demonstrations sake I got it up
to<00:02:02.460> 80<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:05.270> actually<00:02:06.590> just<00:02:07.590> over<00:02:07.860> 60<00:02:08.280> but

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.430 
to 80 and actually just over 60 but

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.010 
to 80 and actually just over 60 but
that's<00:02:08.550> enough<00:02:08.850> and<00:02:09.000> then<00:02:09.630> you're<00:02:09.810> going<00:02:09.930> to

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
that's enough and then you're going to

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.200 
that's enough and then you're going to
adjust<00:02:10.110> this<00:02:10.730> the<00:02:11.730> pressure<00:02:12.000> here<00:02:12.570> you<00:02:14.210> open

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
adjust this the pressure here you open

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.550 
adjust this the pressure here you open
it<00:02:15.570> up<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:15.990> goes<00:02:16.110> down<00:02:16.880> tighten<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.560> it

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
it up and it goes down tighten it and it

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.310 
it up and it goes down tighten it and it
goes<00:02:19.740> up<00:02:20.070> and<00:02:20.690> set<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.440> psi<00:02:23.010> that<00:02:23.850> is

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
goes up and set it to the psi that is

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.770 
goes up and set it to the psi that is
suggested<00:02:25.610> I'm<00:02:26.610> going<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:26.970> give<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.540> link

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
suggested I'm going to give you a link
