00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.029
 too long you do not need to believe it 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.640
 just listen to me and the same thing does not happen to them 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.740
 that I was a big fan of the saga 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.380
 grand theft auto 'played all up 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.199

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.749
 but I needed to play one and it was ta 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.880
 liberty city stories I decided to go to 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:33.010
 buy psp to shop 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.790
 videogames I went to the store but 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:39.950
 the game cost 400 pesos 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.290
 250 pesos but I saw one that was 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.050
 separated from everyone else this one had 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.240
 all the red background could barely be seen 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.270
 the drawings on the cover this did not have 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.950
 price and I went to ask the seller 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.140
 how much for the game something that I 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.480
 He answered, I do not know, it's better, but I 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.580
 I think it does not work then excited 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.100
 I went to my house to try it to see its 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.080
 I arrived but it was quiet 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.850
 since my brother was asleep and not what 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.770
 wanted to 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.460
 I opened the cartridge and I was surprised 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.350
 the isro was blood red with a 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.540
 silhouette of a monitor person in 'the 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.250
 of black color doubt then with what 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:22.450
 the disk receives 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:24.790
 look for 10 with very bad condition letters 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.310
 I put it and it was the game and I opened everything right 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.590
 but at the beginning the gsp logo did not come out 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.840
 but that the games in the presentation 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.990
 they were options and I put a new game 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.420
 but it appeared the difficulty mode is 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.330
 something to give since in every basement it appears 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.119
 the difficulty mode but I put it and it was 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.170
 easy and medium says very impossible and the 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.509
 rarest of all realistic 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.689
 I studied the realistic one and when the 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:53.180
 impulse appeared a poster you want already 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.939
 Once in the game you can no longer 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.369
 leave you have to complete I did not do it 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.190
 case and press continue the worst error that 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.229
 I committed in normal direct life but the 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.539
 Tony's protagonist appeared in the first 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.310
 apartment in the background and was wearing the 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.500
 salvatore suit he used 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.220
 salvatore is therefore walking 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.650
 until the first mission but nothing 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.740
 3 many but many times until 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.080
 I stop but then the voice of the 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.120
 cabezotas vÃ­ctor looked at the screen 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.880
 with my face altered I mean very 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.400
 angry contradictions but every time 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.950
 that hit Tony shot I did not 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.990
 I felt I was not asleep, I decided to go and take 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.870
 water but could not get both hands 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:39.080
 psc could only plant one but the 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.410
 another was completely 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.410
 the functions until I get tired 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.410
 special 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.080
 to see I was still stuck to the TV I knew 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.970
 that I lost patience and I grabbed a 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.340
 stone that had and crash the stone to 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.980
 the psp but I only got to leave one 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.560
 tiny crack but I could drop the psp 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.200
 I thought it was over but not 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.350
 it was like that suddenly Tony started to move 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.790
 alone and I get to a public phone 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.580
 he grabbed the phone and put it in the 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.910
 heard suddenly my cell phone rang and with 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.830
 fear I answered and I asked who he is and with 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.290
 a very angry voice answered me 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.330
 idiot I told you I could not leave until 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.880
 complete the game to and hung but from 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.530
 Suddenly the light went out I decided to escape 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.110
 but when I got to the exit door 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.510
 it seemed that it was not as if the 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.090
 had removed but I felt that I was 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.160
 the wall but without the door I returned to my 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.220
 fourth until I decided to warn my 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.520
 brother 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.650
 but too late 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.720
 and on camera was not there was also a 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.700
 wall then it came to my head that 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.710
 the one who called me was Tony but I lost the 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.460
 calm and I started to play to free myself 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.920
 from this 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.140
 I played and played until I got to 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.180
 the last mission after overcoming the 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.790
 penultimate tony returned to another phone 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.860
 public and he called me and he answered me this is 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.170
 the last mission and if you do not surpass them by 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.210
 back when he said that and a very cry 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.490
 suddenly all of a sudden the 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.730
 windows in my room I could not breathe 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.890
 I was suffocating but I managed to overcome 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.830
 the mission but battling for the lack 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.990
 of oxygen until the light returned and the 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.510
 doors in place and the windows another 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.610
 once opened and at the start of the game but 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.880
 they called me maybe it was silly with the 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.250
 gums 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.380
 were others that I do not know who they were and I 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.950
 they answered you killed the Sicilians 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.200
 and we will kill your life bolt out 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.480
 running out and approached ones to 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.700
 others fast and they were shooting and 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.250
 I was unconscious after I woke up in 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.290
 a hospital and does not know everything that happened 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.420
 but they did not believe me I went back home and there 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.730
 was the p esp in good condition without the 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.290

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.450
 disk but I was at the now is the 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.760
 disk entry and had no other option 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.850
 more than breaking it and I threw it to the ground and 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.800
 split in two and those two sides came out 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.380
 blood but do not throw a bag and what 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.090
 I joined with the psm in me of everything that 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.070
 happened two months later I was already 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.900
 quiet 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.940
 I was at the computer when 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.950
 Suddenly the light went like that damn 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.940
 day but the computer had the 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:12.600
 screen and appeared 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.670
 and he told me that one day the peace of charging 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.640
 and he named me by my name and after 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.080
 the light came back a trope was normal and I 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.450
 I continue with the pending that the 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:25.170
 sufferings were going to kill me but whose 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:28.020
 psychiatrist without playing 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:30.000
 even with those memories of joy and not 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.760
 I can take them out of my mind and then 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.160
