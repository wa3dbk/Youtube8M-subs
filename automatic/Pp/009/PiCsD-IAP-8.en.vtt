00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
be ashamed or maybe she was worried

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.250 
be ashamed or maybe she was worried
about<00:03:18.940> what<00:03:19.300> it<00:03:19.420> was<00:03:19.540> that<00:03:19.600> you<00:03:19.750> were<00:03:19.959> going<00:03:20.170> to

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
about what it was that you were going to

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.020 
about what it was that you were going to
say<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:20.770> she<00:03:20.890> just<00:03:21.100> didn't<00:03:21.370> feel<00:03:22.000> comfortable

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
say and she just didn't feel comfortable

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.970 
say and she just didn't feel comfortable
I<00:03:22.720> think<00:03:22.959> that<00:03:23.080> maybe<00:03:23.260> there's<00:03:23.410> a<00:03:23.680> little

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
I think that maybe there's a little

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.340 
I think that maybe there's a little
glitch<00:03:24.489> in<00:03:24.820> your<00:03:24.880> relationship<00:03:25.750> if<00:03:25.930> she<00:03:26.080> felt

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
glitch in your relationship if she felt

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.990 
glitch in your relationship if she felt
like<00:03:26.440> she<00:03:26.650> couldn't<00:03:26.890> tell<00:03:27.130> you<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:27.520> like<00:03:27.880> I

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
like she couldn't tell you and like I

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.699 
like she couldn't tell you and like I
said<00:03:28.060> these<00:03:28.270> are<00:03:28.330> just<00:03:28.510> my<00:03:28.600> opinions<00:03:29.140> I<00:03:29.230> don't

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
said these are just my opinions I don't

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.229 
said these are just my opinions I don't
know<00:03:29.950> you<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:30.280> I<00:03:30.370> don't<00:03:30.610> know<00:03:30.730> your<00:03:30.910> sister

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
know you and I don't know your sister

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.280 
know you and I don't know your sister
and<00:03:31.300> I<00:03:31.360> don't<00:03:31.600> really<00:03:31.810> know<00:03:31.989> what<00:03:32.170> your

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
and I don't really know what your

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.800 
and I don't really know what your
relationship<00:03:32.470> is<00:03:32.950> but<00:03:33.250> if<00:03:33.430> you<00:03:34.239> tell<00:03:34.510> me<00:03:34.540> if

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
relationship is but if you tell me if

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.030 
relationship is but if you tell me if
you<00:03:34.900> ask<00:03:35.080> me<00:03:35.290> something<00:03:35.560> like<00:03:35.680> that<00:03:35.830> and<00:03:35.920> I'm

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
you ask me something like that and I'm

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.920 
you ask me something like that and I'm
looking<00:03:36.370> from<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.670> outside<00:03:36.790> that's<00:03:37.720> what<00:03:37.900> I

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
looking from the outside that's what I

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.330 
looking from the outside that's what I
think<00:03:38.260> that<00:03:38.440> there's<00:03:38.620> like<00:03:38.800> maybe<00:03:39.010> a<00:03:39.100> little

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
think that there's like maybe a little

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.540 
think that there's like maybe a little
glitch<00:03:39.670> in<00:03:39.940> your<00:03:40.360> relationship<00:03:41.230> and

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
glitch in your relationship and

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.770 
glitch in your relationship and
hopefully<00:03:42.550> it's<00:03:42.700> just<00:03:42.790> you<00:03:43.209> know<00:03:43.300> your<00:03:43.480> sister

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
hopefully it's just you know your sister

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.020 
hopefully it's just you know your sister
really<00:03:43.989> looks<00:03:44.290> up<00:03:44.440> to<00:03:44.500> you<00:03:44.680> and<00:03:45.010> and<00:03:45.790> maybe

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
really looks up to you and and maybe

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.310 
really looks up to you and and maybe
you're<00:03:46.239> really<00:03:46.540> successful<00:03:47.140> and<00:03:47.230> you're

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
you're really successful and you're

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.170 
you're really successful and you're
doing<00:03:47.590> good<00:03:47.739> things<00:03:48.040> and<00:03:48.190> then<00:03:48.340> she's<00:03:49.150> a

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
doing good things and then she's a

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.610 
doing good things and then she's a
little<00:03:49.390> young<00:03:49.690> she's<00:03:50.020> younger<00:03:50.290> than<00:03:50.410> you<00:03:50.590> she
