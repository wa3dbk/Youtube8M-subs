00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.669
 arrived and officially pronounced the utility efe palm responso that allows 

00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:08.660
 to the users to install the inter technology is more responsible to make use of 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.870
 she making a single click of mouse even got systems so moved from without 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.239
 need to be in the operating system 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:18.320
 This is one of the novelties that the new z68 chipset allows 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.640
 the ezeta smart response application arrived and allows users 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.320
 configure in your system in intel technology is more responsible 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.970
 fast and simple way 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.790
 formerly they configure the intel technology is more responsible supposed 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.480
 enter the bios to configure the droid system and and this implied a 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.090
 Complete restoration of the operating system 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.710
 Once the process was completed, users needed to install the 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.130
 application intel graphics managers as well as configure the intel gma technology 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.060
 Responsible 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.850
 instead it arrived and 13 tasmar response does all this automatically without 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.850
 need to follow a complex configuration process 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.129
 to check what technology offers us 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.540
 ezeta is more respond they arrived what we are going to do is perform a test of 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:08.220
 initially we will do it without activating 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.780
 the intel is more responsive 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.140
 well that way we will know the real speed of the hard disk 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.030
 to perform the tests we are going to use in the extreme 64 end and 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.030
 specifically the disk test 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.950
 once we already know the actual speed of our hard drive what are we going to 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.700
 to do is parent the most responsible interest console to activate and improve the 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.520
 performance of our hard drive 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.520
 for this we have to go to the accelerate tab 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.430
 and then 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.150
 activate acceleration 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.220
 Once this process is done, follow the steps that appear on the screen 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.720
 As you all know to be able to perform this process, it is necessary to have a disk 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.110
 solid hard 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.210
 and from a mechanical hard drive once it is activated it will go to the message as 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.080
 one volume was found 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.100
 and then go back out another message that the improved mode is 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.290
 activated 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.470
 At this point we can say that we already have our system accelerated 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:16.809
 now we are going to perform the same disk test with aÃ­da 64 xtrem 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:20.319
 but this time with intel is more responsive activated 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.739
 intel is more responsible with dinner through intelligent storage 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.139
 in block-based caching frequently used applications for 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:32.200
 improve system performance and responsiveness can be appreciated 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.890
 clearly the difference in performance offered by intel technology 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:36.579
