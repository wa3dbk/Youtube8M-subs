00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:12.389
 the look of the skate portal I am 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.089
 squirrel and welcome to the second episode 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.920
 from the series saw skaters on the first 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.080
 I do not know if the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.090
 choose the skateboard and now we go 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.560
 teach you how to ride your own skateboard 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.720
 How good is the first thing to do? 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.160
 put the sandpaper and for that we'll go 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.160
 need a stylus 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.070
 there are people who like outside lets 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.530
 from one side to the other and there 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.170
 people who like out sandpaper and direct 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.629
 talking everything at the same time I prefer 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.320
 put the boss going on one side and then 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.320
 that the other 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.810
 good after the list is pasted to 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.330
 people need to mark the edges so that 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.340
 Can we cut it then? 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.780
 left over then I'll use this one 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.780
 tool here to score the balls 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.660
 after your chic has dialed 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.200
 It will look more or less like this. 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:34.940
 so now it's just people get the stylus 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.940
 and start cutting the balls 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.650
 now it's time to heal the sandpaper put the 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.650
 screws and do the tricks 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.750
 the best way to do this is to get 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:11.840
 a screw and putting it on that side is 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:11.840
 Mark was the father on the other side. 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:21.300
 now is the time to put the trout 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.030
 I have this key that she has all the 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:30.780
 keys together and you can 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:33.060
 find her on the canon 's website is always 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.340
 good to tighten the screws alternately 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.700
 because the force is distributed 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.700
 best 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.960
 the best way to put the wheels 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:03:02.890
 and bearings is to use the trick to 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:03:06.370
 to support rolling thrust with enough 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.920
 strength will stay more or less so does 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.220
 on both sides of the caster and with 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:16.480
 all the wheels now but let's go 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:19.440
 finish by placing the 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.440
 tightening the quarter 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.450
 after you finish your lines 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.720
 should be securely attached and with a small 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.540
 space between the nut and the bearing 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.210
 Good before you start walking now. 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.290
 the skateboard settings in case I go 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.850
 Tighten the tricks 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.060
 There are people who like to leave the trick. 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.520
 very soft to make an easy curve 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.310
 in case I like to leave the trick 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.780
 very hard for him to always walk in 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:54.570
 straight as I do mine 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:56.250
 new this guys and who called that 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.610

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.990
