00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.810
 ok well, let's start cooking 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.670
 to see how it looks is very easy 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.890
 first of all we put to soak the 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.520
 Strawberries in a step with water and some boots 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.170
 of disinfectant with everything and the peduncle 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.259
 for about five minutes the 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.170
 we discovered we removed the peduncle and 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.689
 we cut them into pieces vocal size 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.689
 we put them in a bowl add the 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.729
 sugar and we started to stir at medium 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.219
 measured in about 10-15 minutes until 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.280
 you start making a kind of tube 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:02.110
 as rojito syrup once already 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.179
 makes the syrup the only thing we can 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.579
 do we serve it in a dram 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.619
 immediately put the peppers on 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.390
 a table to apply them we crush with 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.700
 the knife nothing more once so that it 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.319
 they want a little bit and we 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.840
 cup and ready 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:21.379

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:27.469
 of my sister let's try to see what 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.480
 such is also easy is the truth for 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:31.249
 me the generality of a good chef is 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.829
 when simple things but 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:36.980
 delicious as how this recipe 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:38.689
 bruno that then the surprise is that 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.000
 little touch of pepper that you are going to 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:43.609
 prove how rich I remember you ever 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.689
 that my partner interviewed rogelio fusion 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:49.400
 a joel reduction who is a super chef and 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:52.459
 he asked what was his recipe 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.949
 favorite and told you that mashed potatoes 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.019
 last llinÃ¡s for someone to say chef 

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:59.030
 that says by adepa match 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.709
 truly epic test your sucre 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.599
 for relatives as it is removed from the 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.180
 emotion even treats because it's the texture 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:08.540
 it's something divine then here the thing is 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.579
 that some pieces remain whole and is 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.260
 you can touch a whole pepper and if 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.349

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.109
