00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
for the random and videos on that one

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.550 
for the random and videos on that one
does<00:00:28.920> have<00:00:29.039> quite<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.340> bit<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.519> speed<00:00:29.990> 9.09<00:00:30.990> it

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
does have quite a bit of speed 9.09 it

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.840 
does have quite a bit of speed 9.09 it
is<00:00:31.650> neck<00:00:31.890> rub<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.369> doesn't<00:00:32.579> have<00:00:32.820> a

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
is neck rub and it doesn't have a

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.080 
is neck rub and it doesn't have a
different<00:00:33.450> ability<00:00:34.760> which<00:00:35.760> we'll<00:00:35.940> get<00:00:36.030> into

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
different ability which we'll get into

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.420 
different ability which we'll get into
here<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.600> second<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.649> that's<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.890> second

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
here in a second so that's a second

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.389 
here in a second so that's a second
skill<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:40.170> does<00:00:40.320> attack<00:00:40.620> three<00:00:41.040> meetings

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
skill and it does attack three meetings

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.830 
skill and it does attack three meetings
at<00:00:41.520> once<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:42.059> if<00:00:42.149> you're<00:00:42.239> looking<00:00:42.329> for<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.629> fast

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
at once so if you're looking for a fast

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.430 
at once so if you're looking for a fast
necro<00:00:43.350> mean<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:44.340> attacks<00:00:44.670> multiple<00:00:45.180> times

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
necro mean that attacks multiple times

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.720 
necro mean that attacks multiple times
there<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.530> go<00:00:46.649> but<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.890> gets<00:00:46.980> wound<00:00:47.340> damage

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
there you go but it gets wound damage

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.569 
there you go but it gets wound damage
instead<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.690> Life<00:00:48.989> Drain<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:49.920> there<00:00:50.309> is

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
instead of Life Drain so there is

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.430 
instead of Life Drain so there is
something<00:00:50.910> different<00:00:51.000> about<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.390> already<00:00:51.809> it

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
something different about it already it

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.900 
something different about it already it
is<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.559> legendary<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.280> do<00:00:53.430> need<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.699> for<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
is a legendary you do need it for the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.510 
is a legendary you do need it for the
bingo<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.649> you<00:00:55.649> get<00:00:55.770> something<00:00:56.100> different

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
bingo and you get something different

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.360 
bingo and you get something different
for<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.510> necro<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.710> could<00:00:58.829> actually<00:00:58.980> throw

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
for a necro so you could actually throw

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.979 
for a necro so you could actually throw
on<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.120> light<00:01:00.270> rain<00:01:00.449> if<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.629> wanted<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.960> or

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
on the light rain if you wanted to or

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.420 
on the light rain if you wanted to or
you<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.320> actually<00:01:01.440> put<00:01:01.710> on<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.829> different<00:01:02.039> war

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
you can actually put on a different war

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.859 
you can actually put on a different war
Biff<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.699> wanted<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.870> there's<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.350> but<00:01:04.920> I

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
Biff you wanted to so there's that but I

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.820 
Biff you wanted to so there's that but I
will<00:01:06.869> be<00:01:06.960> trying<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.260> out<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.530> seeing<00:01:07.650> how

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
will be trying it out and seeing how

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.609 
will be trying it out and seeing how
good<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.130> once<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.580> get<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.820> up<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:08.939> gold<00:01:09.299> and

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
good it is once I get it up to gold and

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.050 
good it is once I get it up to gold and
I<00:01:10.619> think<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.890> gold<00:01:11.100> version<00:01:11.130> looks<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.640> little

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
I think the gold version looks a little

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.130 
I think the gold version looks a little
bit<00:01:12.270> better<00:01:12.420> than<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.780> one<00:01:13.020> but<00:01:14.210> yeah<00:01:15.210> 9.09

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
bit better than this one but yeah 9.09

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.469 
bit better than this one but yeah 9.09
got<00:01:16.890> some<00:01:17.040> help<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.700> believe<00:01:18.330> they'll

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
got some help on it I believe they'll

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.870 
got some help on it I believe they'll
probably<00:01:18.930> be<00:01:19.560> putting<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.920> back<00:01:20.040> into<00:01:20.310> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
probably be putting it back into the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.990 
probably be putting it back into the
shop's<00:01:21.600> owner<00:01:21.810> later<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:23.159> only<00:01:23.369> do<00:01:23.700> need<00:01:23.909> it

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
shop's owner later you only do need it

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.719 
shop's owner later you only do need it
for<00:01:24.240> research<00:01:24.360> three<00:01:24.990> other<00:01:25.710> than<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.520> you

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
for research three other than that you

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.520 
for research three other than that you
don't<00:01:26.880> really<00:01:27.060> need<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.450> but<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:28.350> one<00:01:28.500> you

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
don't really need it but this one you

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.190 
don't really need it but this one you
actually<00:01:28.710> need<00:01:28.979> for<00:01:29.189> 1500<00:01:29.759> gold<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.420> on<00:01:30.930> each

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
actually need for 1500 gold so on each

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.620 
actually need for 1500 gold so on each
of<00:01:31.380> them<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.650> once<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.860> complete<00:01:32.130> those<00:01:32.630> then

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
of them so once you complete those then

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.179 
of them so once you complete those then
you'll<00:01:33.780> be<00:01:33.810> able<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.140> get<00:01:34.259> more<00:01:34.439> but<00:01:34.710> yeah

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
you'll be able to get more but yeah

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.620 
you'll be able to get more but yeah
that's<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.549> only<00:01:35.790> thing<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.030> needed<00:01:36.210> for<00:01:36.479> it

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
that's the only thing you needed for it

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.300 
that's the only thing you needed for it
so<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.439> was<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.590> only<00:01:37.680> reason<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.009> bought<00:01:38.159> it

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
so that was the only reason I bought it

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.420 
so that was the only reason I bought it
