00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:08.780 

yeah<00:00:06.569> I<00:00:06.629> think<00:00:06.779> about<00:00:07.259> what<00:00:07.470> is<00:00:07.830> possible<00:00:08.250> with

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
yeah I think about what is possible with

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.690 
yeah I think about what is possible with
the<00:00:08.940> Lego<00:00:09.150> figures<00:00:09.630> because<00:00:09.990> they<00:00:10.460> can't<00:00:11.460> have

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
the Lego figures because they can't have

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.240 
the Lego figures because they can't have
only<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.179> few<00:00:12.420> possibilities<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.410> move<00:00:13.650> because

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
only a few possibilities to move because

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.180 
only a few possibilities to move because
they<00:00:14.610> have<00:00:14.790> no<00:00:15.059> elbows<00:00:15.540> for<00:00:15.870> example<00:00:16.410> we<00:00:17.039> are

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
they have no elbows for example we are

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.670 
they have no elbows for example we are
always<00:00:17.310> looking<00:00:17.580> for<00:00:17.940> some<00:00:18.900> special<00:00:19.289> details

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
always looking for some special details

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.439 
always looking for some special details
in<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.039> events<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.580> for<00:00:20.789> example<00:00:21.210> Michael

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
Phelps 10,000 calorie breakfast that's

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.950 
Phelps 10,000 calorie breakfast that's
what<00:00:24.810> makes<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.970> video<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:27.300> special<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.810> think

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
challenge was to animate the gymnastics

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.900 
challenge was to animate the gymnastics
because<00:00:42.210> they<00:00:42.600> are<00:00:42.770> there<00:00:43.770> do<00:00:44.010> some<00:00:44.550> very

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
because they are there do some very

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.260 
because they are there do some very
complicated<00:00:45.450> movements<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.590> air<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.270> was

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
complicated movements in the air and was

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.690 
complicated movements in the air and was
very<00:00:48.600> hard<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.260> recreate<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:50.100> because<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.489> had

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
very hard to recreate this because I had

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.139 
very hard to recreate this because I had
to<00:00:51.090> build<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.780> very<00:00:52.079> special<00:00:52.860> construction<00:00:53.160> to

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
to build a very special construction to

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.959 
to build a very special construction to
put<00:00:54.360> them<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.840> air<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.579> yeah<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.760> was<00:00:56.940> very

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
put them in the air and yeah it was very

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.979 
put them in the air and yeah it was very
hard<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.989> do<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.579> we<00:00:59.579> buried<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.570> Olympic

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:07.989 
process in a simple way it's just taking

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:10.199 
process in a simple way it's just taking
a<00:02:08.019> picture<00:02:08.349> then<00:02:08.769> move<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.310> Lego<00:02:09.489> figure<00:02:09.910> in<00:02:10.060> a

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
a picture then move the Lego figure in a

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.750 
a picture then move the Lego figure in a
little<00:02:10.840> small<00:02:11.620> step<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:12.310> then<00:02:12.400> take<00:02:12.640> another

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
little small step and then take another

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.720 
little small step and then take another
picture<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:13.420> so<00:02:13.660> on<00:02:13.810> its<00:02:14.049> own<00:02:14.260> that<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.190> looks

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
picture and so on its own that it looks

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.869 
picture and so on its own that it looks
like<00:02:15.970> in<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.209> video<00:02:16.299> that<00:02:16.690> he's<00:02:16.900> moving<00:02:17.879> so

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
like in the video that he's moving so

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.720 
like in the video that he's moving so
the<00:02:19.120> way<00:02:19.269> that<00:02:19.629> we<00:02:20.019> will<00:02:20.230> carry<00:02:21.099> this<00:02:21.250> out<00:02:21.489> as

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
the way that we will carry this out as

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.039 
the way that we will carry this out as
well<00:02:21.959> film<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.200> hit<00:02:23.349> the<00:02:23.530> individual<00:02:24.280> Lego

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
well film the hit the individual Lego

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.349 
well film the hit the individual Lego
weights<00:02:26.049> against<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.040> green<00:02:27.250> background<00:02:27.459> I'll

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:28.359 
weights against a green background I'll

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.080 
weights against a green background I'll
take<00:02:28.690> those<00:02:28.930> into<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.470> computer<00:02:30.010> chop<00:02:30.910> them

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090
