00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.250
 hello on occasion before taking 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.590
 our pictures to print 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.200
 we want to give a special touch to 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.289
 our photographs and the program 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.050
 photoshop brings us some we are going to 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.740
 call it filters we can go 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.599
 applying to do some effects 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.599
 retro sepia types 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:37.860
 so for style we found a lot 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:40.200
 of defects that we can go using if 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.840
 we come to this tab edited here of 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.940
 down here 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.860
 if we go to where it puts query of 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:51.950
 colors here we are opened in this panel 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:54.530
 of properties and here we have three 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:59.000
 functions files 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:02.420
 abstract and link between devices 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.300
 for example we can come here to this 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.300
 little eye unfold the and we see here a 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.479
 heap of filters I mention this because 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.970
 many people do not know that we have this in 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.010
 the photo program onces of 6 with the 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.680
 which we can apply 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.510
 effects to our photographs as 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:26.530
 we see we have applied this has us 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.530
 changed the image we can apply 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.409
 we can call it filter to say it of 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:37.570
 somehow although more than filter 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:39.860
 it would be a style of photography has a few 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:44.660
 very rare names 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:47.420
 so I do not dare to speak out for 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.360
 examples said something like if to have 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.090
 three of l 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.210
 so you can get an idea this 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.820
 it would be a sepia tone more or less type 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.210
 retro but of course that would be too much 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:04.630
 strong to lower this we could 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.110
 also resort to the mask of contributions 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.420
 of mask 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:15.140
 and for example you can go working with 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.490
 some of these effects here we're going to 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.490
 put it for example in overlay 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.180
 we give to invest and as we see here 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.480
 It gives us some very good options to go 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:33.100
 working with our photographs if 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.100
 we see the arterial after 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.540
 well here we would have the result apart 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.940
 from that mask area as it had 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.570
 commented we had the abstract area 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.320
 here we also have other 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.780
 functions 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.780
 other different 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.920
 for example in turquoise and here I work 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:03.180
 we would also have others for example the 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.990
 tuxedo we could remove this for 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.990
 go playing 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.070
 and stay with what we like the most 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:23.330
 as we see this function is this let's 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.150
 call it filters that help us to 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.760
 work with our images and then 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.600
 we have the mask area with which 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:35.200
 we can give it more density to fade and 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.200
 well for the style 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.150
 well this is the tutorial that you 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.550
 I wanted to comment as you can see it's pretty 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.920
 simple but the effects of 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:50.210
 that we can get before carrying 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:52.940
 reveal are quite accepted and that 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:56.270
 It serves us well for photography and for 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.880
 fashion for weddings etc. I do not remember 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.580
 where can you find it we live here 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.130
 in this little button and consultation of colors 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:08.840
 and here we have these three functions and 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:11.240
 then work with him with a mask if 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.130
 is our desire or leave it as it is very 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.410
 very good this is the tutorial I hope that 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.740
 serve you and see you soon in the 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.740
 tutorials
