the<00:00:11.940> field<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.269> competition<00:00:13.190> here's<00:00:14.190> the

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
the field of competition here's the

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.599 
the field of competition here's the
thing<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:14.910> makes<00:00:15.120> life<00:00:15.240> so<00:00:15.660> interesting<00:00:16.609> the

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
thing that makes life so interesting the

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.880 
thing that makes life so interesting the
theory<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.119> evolution<00:00:18.510> claims<00:00:19.289> only<00:00:19.770> the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
theory of evolution claims only the

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.380 
theory of evolution claims only the
strong<00:00:20.220> shall<00:00:20.640> survive<00:00:21.500> maybe<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:22.859> maybe<00:00:23.390> so

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
strong shall survive maybe so maybe so

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.120 
strong shall survive maybe so maybe so
but<00:00:25.609> the<00:00:26.609> theory<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.090> competition<00:00:28.019> says<00:00:28.289> just

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
but the theory of competition says just

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.980 
but the theory of competition says just
because<00:00:29.519> they're<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.029> strong<00:00:30.359> doesn't<00:00:30.810> mean

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
because they're the strong doesn't mean

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.979 
because they're the strong doesn't mean
they<00:00:31.260> can't<00:00:31.529> get<00:00:31.769> their<00:00:31.980> asses<00:00:32.189> kicked<00:00:32.989> that's

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
they can't get their asses kicked that's

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.500 
they can't get their asses kicked that's
right<00:00:34.670> see<00:00:35.670> what<00:00:35.880> every<00:00:36.239> long<00:00:36.480> shot

but what the odds don't know is this
isn't<00:00:51.019> a<00:00:51.320> math<00:00:51.350> test<00:00:52.480> this<00:00:53.480> is<00:00:53.780> a<00:00:53.839> completely

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
isn't a math test this is a completely

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.380 
isn't a math test this is a completely

has a funny way of trumping logic
so<00:01:03.250> before<00:01:03.580> you<00:01:03.610> step<00:01:04.030> up<00:01:04.210> to<00:01:04.269> the<00:01:04.510> starting

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
so before you step up to the starting

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.550 
so before you step up to the starting
line<00:01:06.090> before<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:07.210> whistle<00:01:07.600> blows<00:01:07.840> and<00:01:08.170> the

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
line before the whistle blows and the

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.780 
line before the whistle blows and the

just<00:01:10.720> remember<00:01:11.260> out<00:01:11.470> here<00:01:12.040> the<00:01:12.880> results<00:01:13.360> don't

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
just remember out here the results don't

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.330 
just remember out here the results don't
always<00:01:13.780> add<00:01:14.080> up

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340

all bets are raw don't be surprised if
somebody<00:01:29.710> decides<00:01:30.250> to<00:01:30.520> flip<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.299> script<00:01:31.420> and
