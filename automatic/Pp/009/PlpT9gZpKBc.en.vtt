that's really the moisture from the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.450 
that's really the moisture from the
chestnut<00:00:33.690> as<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:33.989> roasts<00:00:34.350> will<00:00:34.890> steam<00:00:35.190> them

and you'll see that the flesh is

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.200 
and you'll see that the flesh is
actually<00:00:37.770> going<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.010> separate<00:00:38.400> and<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.699> shell

pan throw them in a 400-degree oven and
in<00:00:45.900> about<00:00:46.019> an<00:00:46.290> hour<00:00:46.470> you'll<00:00:46.949> get<00:00:47.070> some<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.370> that

we don't so much want to caramelize the
onions<00:01:13.360> as<00:01:13.840> we<00:01:13.960> just<00:01:14.140> really<00:01:14.320> want<00:01:14.470> to<00:01:14.530> get

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
bit golden are chestnuts sometimes both

the outside shell and the husk come off
together<00:01:20.710> but<00:01:21.310> more<00:01:21.550> typically<00:01:22.090> you<00:01:22.600> have<00:01:22.630> to

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
together but more typically you have to

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.630 
together but more typically you have to
peel<00:01:23.350> that<00:01:23.500> separately<00:01:23.950> they'll<00:01:24.250> give<00:01:24.430> that

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
peel that separately they'll give that

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.280 
peel that separately they'll give that
nice<00:01:24.820> flavor<00:01:25.240> but<00:01:25.540> chestnuts<00:01:25.930> also<00:01:26.200> have

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
nice flavor but chestnuts also have

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.270 
nice flavor but chestnuts also have
another<00:01:26.470> purpose<00:01:26.860> are<00:01:26.950> going<00:01:27.070> to<00:01:27.130> help

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
into this broth ladle this into a

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.040 
into this broth ladle this into a
blender<00:01:54.220> probably<00:01:54.790> about<00:01:55.450> three<00:01:55.690> quarters<00:01:55.900> of

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
blender probably about three quarters of

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.690 
blender probably about three quarters of
the<00:01:56.200> way<00:01:56.229> full<00:01:56.320> one<00:01:57.130> thing<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.370> keep<00:01:57.490> in<00:01:57.640> mind

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
the way full one thing to keep in mind

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.420 
the way full one thing to keep in mind
when<00:01:58.060> you<00:01:58.180> put<00:01:58.510> a<00:01:58.540> hot<00:01:58.840> liquid<00:01:59.110> into<00:01:59.770> a<00:02:00.100> blender

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
when you put a hot liquid into a blender

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.460 
when you put a hot liquid into a blender
and<00:02:00.729> you<00:02:00.790> turn<00:02:01.000> it<00:02:01.120> on<00:02:01.210> it<00:02:01.270> can<00:02:02.080> become

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
and you turn it on it can become

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.890 
and you turn it on it can become
explosive<00:02:02.950> and<00:02:03.460> so<00:02:03.880> you<00:02:03.940> want<00:02:04.420> to<00:02:04.510> turn<00:02:04.660> on

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
explosive and so you want to turn on

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.380 
explosive and so you want to turn on
slowly<00:02:05.380> and<00:02:05.790> usually<00:02:06.790> want<00:02:07.000> to<00:02:07.060> put<00:02:07.210> like<00:02:07.360> a

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
slowly and usually want to put like a

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.120 
slowly and usually want to put like a
towel<00:02:07.660> over<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:07.990> top<00:02:08.260> of<00:02:08.290> it<00:02:08.530> or<00:02:08.740> just<00:02:08.979> wait

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
towel over the top of it or just wait

flavors<00:02:21.489> up<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.730> little<00:02:21.940> bit<00:02:22.060> if<00:02:22.209> you're<00:02:22.360> really

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
little bit of creme fraiche and I think

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.690 
little bit of creme fraiche and I think
it's<00:02:55.660> it'll<00:02:56.410> be<00:02:56.530> wonderful<00:02:56.950> with<00:02:57.250> a<00:02:57.340> glass<00:02:57.519> of

it's it'll be wonderful with a glass of

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
your Chardonnay reserved great beautiful

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.240 
your Chardonnay reserved great beautiful
presentation<00:03:01.239> too<00:03:01.480> I<00:03:01.989> think<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.380> brandy<00:03:03.130> adds

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
presentation too I think the brandy adds

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.820 
presentation too I think the brandy adds
a<00:03:03.370> little<00:03:03.720> caramel<00:03:04.720> e<00:03:04.810> characteristic<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.800> it

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
a little caramel e characteristic to it

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.979 
a little caramel e characteristic to it
it<00:03:06.340> goes<00:03:06.730> very<00:03:06.970> well<00:03:07.120> with<00:03:07.300> the<00:03:07.540> texture<00:03:07.870> of

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
it goes very well with the texture of

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.470 
it goes very well with the texture of
the<00:03:08.080> wine<00:03:08.260> being<00:03:08.620> very<00:03:08.920> rich<00:03:09.250> I<00:03:09.670> also<00:03:09.970> very

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
the wine being very rich I also very

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.020 
the wine being very rich I also very
concentrated<00:03:10.989> and<00:03:11.440> succulent<00:03:12.010> just<00:03:12.730> like<00:03:12.880> the

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
concentrated and succulent just like the

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.600 
concentrated and succulent just like the
soup<00:03:13.239> it's<00:03:13.480> it's<00:03:13.750> a<00:03:14.110> beautiful<00:03:14.620> combination<00:03:14.890> I

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
soup it's it's a beautiful combination I

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.580 
soup it's it's a beautiful combination I
think<00:03:16.209> the<00:03:16.390> Chardonnay<00:03:16.810> reserve<00:03:17.140> having<00:03:17.500> the

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
think the Chardonnay reserve having the

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.590 
think the Chardonnay reserve having the
richness<00:03:17.769> and<00:03:18.070> texture<00:03:18.489> will<00:03:18.639> lend<00:03:19.299> itself

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
richness and texture will lend itself

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.120 
richness and texture will lend itself
well<00:03:19.690> to<00:03:19.870> a<00:03:20.079> lot<00:03:20.290> of<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:20.440> dishes<00:03:20.769> that<00:03:20.799> people

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
well to a lot of the dishes that people

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.690 
well to a lot of the dishes that people
put<00:03:21.280> on<00:03:21.340> their<00:03:21.430> table<00:03:21.910> when<00:03:22.209> winter

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
put on their table when winter

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.640 
put on their table when winter
taining<00:03:23.120> when<00:03:23.870> you<00:03:23.989> have<00:03:24.110> different<00:03:24.349> dishes

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
taining when you have different dishes

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:25.930 
taining when you have different dishes
with<00:03:24.920> a<00:03:24.950> wine<00:03:25.160> you<00:03:25.310> sort<00:03:25.489> of<00:03:25.520> see<00:03:25.640> different

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
with a wine you sort of see different

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.240 
with a wine you sort of see different
facets<00:03:26.360> of<00:03:26.480> it<00:03:26.629> and<00:03:26.780> what<00:03:27.290> I<00:03:27.319> like<00:03:27.650> about<00:03:27.680> it<00:03:27.980> is

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
facets of it and what I like about it is

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.890 
facets of it and what I like about it is
you<00:03:28.700> know<00:03:28.790> I'm<00:03:28.849> getting<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.360> richness<00:03:29.569> and

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
you know I'm getting the richness and

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.449 
you know I'm getting the richness and
the<00:03:29.989> texture<00:03:30.620> of<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.739> wine<00:03:30.890> stands<00:03:31.190> up<00:03:31.370> to

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
the texture of the wine stands up to

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.309 
the texture of the wine stands up to
that<00:03:31.550> but<00:03:31.730> also<00:03:32.239> the<00:03:32.390> sweet<00:03:32.629> potatoes<00:03:32.989> I<00:03:33.110> think

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.770 
that but also the sweet potatoes I think
for<00:03:33.860> me<00:03:34.010> at<00:03:34.190> least<00:03:34.220> sort<00:03:35.030> of<00:03:35.180> brings<00:03:35.480> up<00:03:35.629> more

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
for me at least sort of brings up more
