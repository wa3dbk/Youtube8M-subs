 I'll show you this time how you do it. 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:34.000
 to identify and remove or move 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:38.020
 perhaps files are duplicates of your 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.840
 disco is is is sometimes happens is normal 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.360
 the files and duplicating in your 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.430
 computer for n reasons 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.580
 and then to identify those files 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.489
 Manually it gets very difficult. 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:54.339

 fast but depending on the amount of 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.430
 file you are going to check it can 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.790

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.150
 options here want to move marked to the 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.640
 lily time will delete this file or 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.850
 move data files to just go 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.400
 show you in this option here you 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.770
 you have the option to create another folder and 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.680
 it will remove the file that is in 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:00.040
 duplicity of the destination folders and will 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.710
 put in this folder that you determine 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.170
 then it would be there if you want to do 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:08.020
 a prior verification of these 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.390
 files before deleting them if you want 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.990
 Do this you move them to another 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:17.530
 pass checks and then you will have the option 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:20.859
