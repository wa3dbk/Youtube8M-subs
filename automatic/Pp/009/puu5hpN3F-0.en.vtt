00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.679
 Hi everyone guys in this video 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.960
 we will talk about the production was known e 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:16.290
 of the management of the possible contents 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.970
 between the playstation 3 system e 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.720
 playstation life 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.760
 first of all you have to go to 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.530
 system settings and go to 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.530
 remote playback settings 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:34.000
 you need to register the device and vi 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.670
 a code will be given to insert in his 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.950
 time in playstation life and thanks to 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:44.920
 which the two systems will register 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:50.230
 after which we turn on our own 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:54.040
 playstation life we ​​are not here and there 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.730
 we put the usual deactivation code 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:04.329
 let's go to top here you see 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:07.930
 remote reproduction and asks us in what 

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:11.200
 so we want to connect the playstation 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.760
 life on the playstation 3 that is both with the 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.070
 private network both in Italy from what 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.010
 change that with the private network there 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.590
 we rely on our home wifi 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:27.190
 through the internet connection us 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:29.229
 we could control the playstation 3 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.570
 even outside the home 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.490
 so just connect us and there some 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.479
 other part to interact some 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:44.229
 contents of the playstation 3 of 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:47.260
 while we see home to connect with 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:53.700
 playstation 3 and in the playstation 3 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.700
 you have to go online 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.450
 remote playback 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:05.280
 and here we are, we see how in 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.789
 playstation life 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.979
 we basically have what it is 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.810
 screen 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:17.069
 indeed we can directly use the 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.959
 our playstation 3 system has from 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.120
 remote 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.930
 we can go to the store we can 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:28.650
 go talk to our friends 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:32.250
 we can use the browser and the network 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.599
 of the playstation 3 what moreover those 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.880
 so-called fairly useless windows 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.519
 because we could do directly with the 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.930
 life but we can also go and see 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:45.390
 the contents of existing in ours 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.480
 playstation 3 to see the movies e 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.799
 whatever 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.950
 when we're done we can go to 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:03:01.230
 directly as we see here turning off 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:07.980
 therefore the system we imagine of 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:09.329
 be away from home and thanks to this 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.889
 approach of won we will go 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.079
 directly turn off ours 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:16.530
 playstation 3 instead guys and if 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:19.230
 we want to go and light ours 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:26.250
 playstation 3 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:28.980
 let's go there again connect you have 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.489
 heard noise in the playstation 3 has 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.489
 lit. 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.470
 and here we are 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.080
 so we've seen how it's possible 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.270
 switch off the playstation 3 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.070
 directly from the playstation life e 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.480
 then go quietly to enjoy 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:15.670
 what are the contents of 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.940
 playstation 3 directly on our 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:23.310
 same life skin and this was the remote 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:28.240
 control regarding instead 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.790
 only 20 to a moment to close there 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.440
 we also give the playstation 3 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:36.190
 as regards the control branch is 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:40.270
 possible to play if not apparently a 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:47.440
 downloadable playstation 1 games 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:54.010
 up on the system however there are gods 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:57.520
 games that have here we are you see of 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:05:01.570
 cross controller I said there are gods 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.070
 games that you can connect thanks 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.310
 to the cross with tolder which is what 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:09.130
 see top right 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:14.200
 then sometimes do not give it appear in the cross 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:16.210
 controller is one for example I do 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.900
 the example of the little big planet game 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.610
 2 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:24.760
 I've seen from youtube videos of the 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:28.210
 chaos controller to one you can play gods 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:30.850
 playstation games not as if 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:35.830
 it was a remote screen but as if 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:40.060
 it was a real joystick like 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:42.040
 it works a little la wii ue we succeed 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:46.270
 to interact in a particular way 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:48.640
 thanks to this system of 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.590
 cross play in fencing a television 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:54.070
 we will see certain things 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:57.460
 that of the playstation life at 3 the 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:00.900
 second way to connect with the 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:05.070
 playstation vita to the playstation 3 is 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:07.360
 through content management 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.340
 if we go into our system 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.630
 playstation life to click 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:14.520
 on the application of the management of 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:20.910
 contents we are asked to connect 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.910
 the playstation system lives with the cable 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:31.120
 usl to playstation 3 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:34.090
 once we have connected the 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:41.050
 playstation 3 system life system 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:47.970
 play3 at that point it will be possible to go 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:53.890
 to select the files we have 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:58.090
 so you see that even the playstation 3 

00:06:53.890 --> 00:07:00.670
 He saw from the playstation playstation 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:05.460
 life and it is possible to go and make gods 

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:09.100
 backup directly from life plate re 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:14.670
 or from play 3 to life or go to 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:20.170
 pass files as photographs or 

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:23.980
 video images also file 

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:26.800
 mp3 music and we could go on then on 

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:30.700
 its playstation 3 system 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:33.010
 to see them for example this video is a 

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:36.570
 video I just passed by 

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.570
 playstation vita playstation 3 

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:54.470
 such as these photos that had them 

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:56.539
 in the playstation life system and this is it 

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:59.210
 once passed by darkened outlets 

00:07:56.539 --> 00:08:01.699
 alleged will remain permanently on 

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:05.690
 playstation 3 system 

00:08:01.699 --> 00:08:07.699
 I would say that from the possible integration to the 

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:10.940
 moment between playstation vita playstation 

00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:13.750
 3 is everything and see you next time 

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.750
 hello guys
