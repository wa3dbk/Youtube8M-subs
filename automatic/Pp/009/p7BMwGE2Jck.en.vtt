stuff on fire for torches and i also
have<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.229> idea<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.799> make<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.310> keep<00:01:51.200> like<00:01:52.200> one

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
have the idea to make a keep like one

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.429 
have the idea to make a keep like one
corner<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.149> goes<00:01:54.360> up<00:01:54.570> really<00:01:54.810> extra<00:01:55.290> high

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
corner that goes up really extra high

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.370 
corner that goes up really extra high
and<00:01:56.090> makes<00:01:57.090> like<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.240> tower<00:01:57.509> at<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.780> top<00:01:58.049> and

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
and makes like a tower at the top and

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.700 
and makes like a tower at the top and
that<00:01:58.890> can<00:01:59.100> set<00:01:59.430> that's<00:01:59.880> like<00:02:00.119> above<00:02:00.710> clouds

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
that can set that's like above clouds

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.499 
that can set that's like above clouds
and<00:02:02.159> just<00:02:02.340> like<00:02:02.579> be<00:02:02.759> really<00:02:03.090> tall<00:02:03.270> and

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
and just like be really tall and

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.139 
and just like be really tall and
cool-looking<00:02:04.549> so<00:02:05.549> i'll<00:02:05.670> probably<00:02:05.880> going<00:02:06.090> to

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
cool-looking so i'll probably going to

that's pretty much the room layout if
you<00:02:20.569> guys<00:02:20.690> have<00:02:20.870> any<00:02:20.959> ideas<00:02:21.319> for<00:02:22.989> rooms<00:02:23.989> I<00:02:24.170> can

all right I almost have the walls four
blocks<00:02:33.739> high<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:34.160> then<00:02:34.250> I<00:02:34.310> had<00:02:34.459> to<00:02:34.610> do<00:02:34.930> three

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
blocks high and then I had to do three

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.020 
blocks high and then I had to do three
more<00:02:35.959> to<00:02:36.560> make<00:02:36.769> it<00:02:36.950> so<00:02:37.129> i<00:02:37.160> can<00:02:37.400> have<00:02:37.580> vid<00:02:37.790> six

more to make it so i can have vid six

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.960 
more to make it so i can have vid six
high<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.390> then<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.959> one<00:02:39.170> thing<00:02:39.410> across<00:02:39.970> earth

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
high and then the one thing across earth

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:55.180 
high and then the one thing across earth
i<00:02:41.540> mean<00:02:41.690> there<00:02:41.870> since<00:02:42.079> Papa<00:02:52.000> begin<00:02:54.190> this

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
i mean there since Papa begin this

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.729 
i mean there since Papa begin this
castle<00:02:55.700> will<00:02:55.730> probably<00:02:56.090> be<00:02:56.209> my<00:02:56.739> tallest

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
structure I what might be taller than

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.289 
structure I what might be taller than
that<00:03:01.940> i'm<00:03:02.060> not<00:03:02.090> sure<00:03:03.459> hopefully<00:03:04.459> it<00:03:04.760> is<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:05.209> i

sure<00:03:26.780> what<00:03:27.049> yet<00:03:27.290> and<00:03:27.560> then<00:03:27.709> i<00:03:27.889> could<00:03:28.069> also<00:03:28.190> have

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
sure what yet and then i could also have

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.479 
sure what yet and then i could also have
it<00:03:28.700> as<00:03:28.819> like<00:03:29.000> my<00:03:29.560> youtube<00:03:30.560> background<00:03:31.190> on<00:03:31.400> my

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
it as like my youtube background on my

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.659 
it as like my youtube background on my
youtube<00:03:31.819> profile<00:03:32.510> picture<00:03:33.220> so<00:03:34.220> we<00:03:34.370> think<00:03:34.489> it's

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:34.669 
youtube profile picture so we think it's

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:36.789 
youtube profile picture so we think it's
a<00:03:34.730> good<00:03:34.819> idea<00:03:34.940> to<00:03:35.120> tell<00:03:35.450> me<00:03:35.660> and<00:03:36.290> I<00:03:36.769> will

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
a good idea to tell me and I will

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.559 
a good idea to tell me and I will
probably<00:03:37.160> do<00:03:37.430> it<00:03:39.730> so<00:03:40.730> far<00:03:40.880> like<00:03:41.090> this<00:03:41.120> update<00:03:41.540> a

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.490 
probably do it so far like this update a
lot<00:03:41.950> and<00:03:43.239> I<00:03:44.239> like<00:03:44.419> how<00:03:44.569> it's<00:03:44.720> free<00:03:45.139> and<00:03:45.349> it's

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
lot and I like how it's free and it's

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.900 
lot and I like how it's free and it's
not<00:03:45.650> doesn't<00:03:45.980> cause<00:03:46.099> money<00:03:46.430> for<00:03:46.639> each<00:03:46.730> update

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
not doesn't cause money for each update

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.870 
not doesn't cause money for each update
because<00:03:47.329> that's<00:03:48.049> really<00:03:48.349> nice<00:03:48.700> because<00:03:49.700> I
