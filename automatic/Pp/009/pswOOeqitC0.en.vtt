needs to do something and you know he
might<00:00:59.070> have<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.280> take<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.579> risk<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.910> fight

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
might have to take that risk and fight

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.849

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.810 
he hasn't shown any indication that he
wants<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.799> fight<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.280> think<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> very

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820

dangerous fight for him I think he's

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.590 
dangerous fight for him I think he's
more<00:01:10.470> skilled<00:01:10.890> as<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.670> fighter<00:01:11.970> than<00:01:12.210> Kovalev

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
more skilled as a fighter than Kovalev

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.940 
more skilled as a fighter than Kovalev

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.249 
Hopkins but me personally I feel that
award<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.970> much<00:01:21.330> more<00:01:21.540> rounded<00:01:22.049> more

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259

skilled<00:01:22.619> fighter<00:01:22.890> than<00:01:23.100> carbon<00:01:23.400> if<00:01:23.490> not<00:01:23.640> to

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
skilled fighter than carbon if not to

say<00:01:23.909> Kovalev<00:01:24.299> don't<00:01:24.509> have<00:01:24.659> skills<00:01:24.930> I've

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
say Kovalev don't have skills I've

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.740 
say Kovalev don't have skills I've
always<00:01:25.259> said<00:01:25.470> he<00:01:25.590> has<00:01:25.710> good<00:01:25.950> solid<00:01:26.280> skills<00:01:26.750> but

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
always said he has good solid skills but

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.630 
always said he has good solid skills but
I<00:01:27.990> think<00:01:28.320> Ward<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.770> one<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.280> those<00:01:29.400> fighters

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
I think Ward is one of those fighters

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.569 
I think Ward is one of those fighters
like<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.390> Floyd<00:01:31.170> Mayweather<00:01:31.619> who<00:01:32.369> has

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
like a Floyd Mayweather who has

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.490 
like a Floyd Mayweather who has
exceptional<00:01:33.540> skills<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.960> could<00:01:34.079> go<00:01:34.259> in<00:01:34.409> the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
exceptional skills you could go in the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.710 
exceptional skills you could go in the
ring<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.950> barely<00:01:35.729> gets<00:01:35.970> hit<00:01:36.210> with<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.420> clean

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
shot for an entire fight it's very hard

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.200 
shot for an entire fight it's very hard
to<00:01:39.720> do<00:01:39.990> when<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.860> guy<00:01:41.100> especially<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.909> his<00:01:42.000> last
