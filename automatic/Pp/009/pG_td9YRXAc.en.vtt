the first thing we have to do is choose

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.380 
the first thing we have to do is choose
an<00:00:18.480> ideal<00:00:19.020> location<00:00:19.260> correct<00:00:20.060> so<00:00:21.060> can<00:00:21.270> you

an ideal location correct so can you
tell<00:00:21.630> us<00:00:21.689> what<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.560> key<00:00:22.800> components<00:00:23.430> are<00:00:23.550> in<00:00:23.850> a

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
tell us what the key components are in a

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.269 
tell us what the key components are in a
perfect<00:00:24.300> location<00:00:24.600> for<00:00:24.990> rain<00:00:25.380> barrel<00:00:25.740> okay

perfect location for rain barrel okay
first<00:00:26.789> off<00:00:27.029> we<00:00:27.240> need<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.480> downspout<00:00:28.170> for<00:00:28.830> the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
first off we need a downspout for the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.320 
first off we need a downspout for the
ring<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.340> drain<00:00:29.580> into<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.939> barrel

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
ring to drain into the barrel

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.930 
ring to drain into the barrel
we<00:00:30.510> need<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.689> low<00:00:31.140> traffic<00:00:31.380> area<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.070> some

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
we need a low traffic area and some

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.670 
we need a low traffic area and some
place<00:00:33.120> where<00:00:33.300> we<00:00:33.450> can<00:00:33.630> divert<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.260> water<00:00:34.290> from

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
place where we can divert the water from

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.500 
place where we can divert the water from
the<00:00:34.770> overflow<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.460> Kim<00:00:35.670> we<00:00:35.820> have<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.180> go<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.390> our

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
the overflow so Kim we have to go to our

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.910 
the overflow so Kim we have to go to our
local<00:00:36.950> hardware<00:00:37.950> store<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.370> pick<00:00:38.460> up<00:00:38.850> some

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
local hardware store and pick up some

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.770 
local hardware store and pick up some
downspout<00:00:40.920> diverters<00:00:41.579> for<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.239> rain<00:00:42.420> barrel

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
downspout diverters for the rain barrel

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.990 
downspout diverters for the rain barrel
before<00:00:43.110> we<00:00:43.320> actually<00:00:44.010> hook<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.340> up<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:44.520> what<00:00:44.879> do

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
before we actually hook it up so what do

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.270 
before we actually hook it up so what do
we<00:00:45.059> have<00:00:45.239> here<00:00:45.660> we<00:00:45.899> have<00:00:46.110> an<00:00:46.260> aluminum<00:00:46.590> one<00:00:46.980> and

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
we have here we have an aluminum one and

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.930 
we have here we have an aluminum one and
also<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.270> plastic<00:00:48.739> flexible<00:00:49.739> one<00:00:49.920> which<00:00:50.219> would

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
also a plastic flexible one which would

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.459 
also a plastic flexible one which would
probably<00:00:51.090> work<00:00:51.629> better<00:00:51.809> because<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.350> our

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
probably work better because of our

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.680 
probably work better because of our
location<00:00:52.620> we<00:00:53.160> need<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.430> have<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.879> rain<00:00:54.360> barrel

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
location we need to have the rain barrel

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.139 
location we need to have the rain barrel

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
out a bit from the structure so what

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.840 
out a bit from the structure so what
tools<00:00:57.390> do<00:00:57.719> we<00:00:57.870> need<00:00:58.109> Kim<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.890> install<00:00:59.550> our<00:00:59.670> rain

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850

this<00:01:09.900> rain<00:01:10.710> barrel<00:01:10.920> what<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:11.340> need<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.580> do

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
this rain barrel what we need to do

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.030 
this rain barrel what we need to do
first<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.210> use<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.479> diverter<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.320> measure

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
first is use the diverter to measure

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.859
