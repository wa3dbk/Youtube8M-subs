00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
I'll meet with a game which lifts do not

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:41.300 
I'll meet with a game which lifts do not
like<00:00:38.300> why<00:00:39.300> does<00:00:39.449> every<00:00:39.719> three<00:00:40.019> or<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.440> police

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 
like why does every three or a police

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.730 
like why does every three or a police
because<00:00:41.970> their<00:00:42.180> three-year-old<00:00:42.630> it<00:00:43.380> doesn't

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:43.740 
because their three-year-old it doesn't

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.910

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
because you're three so you don't have a

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.780 
because you're three so you don't have a
list<00:00:51.090> when<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.390> was<00:00:51.510> three<00:00:51.780> they<00:00:52.410> did<00:00:52.710> know<00:00:53.100> he

list when I was three they did know he

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.570 
list when I was three they did know he
had<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.660> still<00:00:55.230> get<00:00:55.410> remember<00:00:55.800> out<00:00:55.980> exactly
