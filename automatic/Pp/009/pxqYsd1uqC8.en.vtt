00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
to be polite and it's exciting that you

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.489 
to be polite and it's exciting that you
actually<00:01:12.490> agreed<00:01:12.880> to<00:01:12.999> go<00:01:13.119> out<00:01:13.270> with<00:01:13.450> them<00:01:13.600> but

actually agreed to go out with them but
it's<00:01:14.799> really<00:01:15.399> hard<00:01:15.729> work<00:01:15.939> because<00:01:16.810> your

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:17.469 
it's really hard work because your

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:19.830 
it's really hard work because your
weight<00:01:17.859> is<00:01:18.189> completely<00:01:18.880> transferred<00:01:19.450> through

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
weight is completely transferred through

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.989 
weight is completely transferred through
them<00:01:21.029> during<00:01:22.029> braking<00:01:23.039> which<00:01:24.039> actually<00:01:24.789> makes

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:24.999 
them during braking which actually makes

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:29.789 
them during braking which actually makes
it<00:01:25.179> harder<00:01:25.209> to<00:01:25.689> break<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.810> number<00:01:29.380> one<00:01:29.529> if

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
it harder to break so number one if

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.760 
it harder to break so number one if
there<00:01:30.039> is<00:01:30.130> a<00:01:30.159> strap<00:01:30.719> and<00:01:31.719> if<00:01:31.899> it's<00:01:32.469> just<00:01:32.709> a

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
there is a strap and if it's just a

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.139 
there is a strap and if it's just a
strap<00:01:33.009> that<00:01:33.130> you've<00:01:33.279> got<00:01:33.490> if<00:01:33.609> that's<00:01:33.819> all<00:01:33.969> that

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
strap that you've got if that's all that

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.289 
strap that you've got if that's all that
you've<00:01:34.270> got<00:01:34.420> available<00:01:34.810> then<00:01:34.990> use<00:01:35.200> it<00:01:36.299> because

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
you've got available then use it because

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.330 
you've got available then use it because
it's<00:01:37.659> also<00:01:37.810> it<00:01:38.259> means<00:01:38.799> that<00:01:39.039> you're<00:01:39.249> in

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
it's also it means that you're in

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.569 
it's also it means that you're in
control<00:01:39.609> of<00:01:39.999> yourself<00:01:40.119> a<00:01:40.539> bit<00:01:40.719> more<00:01:41.399> like<00:01:42.399> on

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
control of yourself a bit more like on

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:47.459 
control of yourself a bit more like on
this<00:01:42.819> there's<00:01:45.119> there's<00:01:46.119> grab<00:01:46.419> bars<00:01:46.689> on<00:01:47.049> the

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
this there's there's grab bars on the

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:50.069 
this there's there's grab bars on the
side<00:01:47.939> it's<00:01:48.939> actually<00:01:49.299> what<00:01:49.450> I<00:01:49.479> find<00:01:49.599> more

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
side it's actually what I find more

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:52.129 
side it's actually what I find more
comfortable<00:01:50.619> because<00:01:50.829> it<00:01:51.099> then<00:01:51.249> means<00:01:51.549> that

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:52.139 
comfortable because it then means that

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:55.529 
comfortable because it then means that
your<00:01:53.139> weight<00:01:53.799> distribution<00:01:54.219> is<00:01:54.729> completely

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
your weight distribution is completely

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.370 
your weight distribution is completely
through<00:01:55.810> your<00:01:56.079> core<00:01:56.469> so<00:01:57.459> it's

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
through your core so it's

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.010 
through your core so it's
it's<00:01:58.650> basically<00:01:59.220> it<00:01:59.790> goes<00:02:00.030> through<00:02:00.360> through

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
it's basically it goes through through

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.230 
it's basically it goes through through
your<00:02:01.200> hips<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.530> through<00:02:01.710> your<00:02:01.830> ass<00:02:02.240> and

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
your hips and through your ass and

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.120 
your hips and through your ass and
that's<00:02:03.479> that's<00:02:04.140> where<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.560> want<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.860> that's

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
that's that's where you want it that's

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.740 
that's that's where you want it that's
where<00:02:05.400> you<00:02:05.490> want<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.759> be<00:02:05.820> working<00:02:06.979> so<00:02:08.750> means

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
that you you've got the the fulcrum

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.559 
that you you've got the the fulcrum
lever<00:02:15.060> effect<00:02:15.480> if<00:02:15.630> you<00:02:15.750> like<00:02:15.930> or<00:02:16.200> on<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:16.890> seesaw

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
lever effect if you like or on a seesaw

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.890 
lever effect if you like or on a seesaw
the<00:02:18.569> pivot<00:02:19.020> point<00:02:19.459> is<00:02:20.459> then<00:02:20.700> your<00:02:21.209> hips<00:02:21.450> and

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.309 
and forwards so when you're going into
braking<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:33.150> can<00:02:33.300> kind<00:02:33.569> of<00:02:33.630> like<00:02:33.780> push<00:02:34.110> your

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
braking you can kind of like push your

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.650 
braking you can kind of like push your
tummy<00:02:34.650> out<00:02:34.680> pull<00:02:35.459> your<00:02:35.610> shoulders<00:02:36.030> back<00:02:36.060> and

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
tummy out pull your shoulders back and

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.860 
tummy out pull your shoulders back and
then<00:02:37.350> that<00:02:37.860> stops<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.519> from<00:02:38.600> careering<00:02:39.600> into

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
then that stops you from careering into

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.240 
then that stops you from careering into
the<00:02:39.989> back<00:02:40.170> of<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.380> helmet<00:02:40.560> at<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:40.830> person<00:02:41.160> in

absolutely key of course there
and<00:03:03.560> you<00:03:03.740> know<00:03:03.980> you<00:03:04.730> got<00:03:05.660> someone<00:03:05.960> that's

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
and you know you got someone that's

and you know you got someone that's
trying<00:03:06.350> to<00:03:06.500> stay<00:03:06.890> up<00:03:07.100> right

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
trying to stay up right

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.060 
trying to stay up right
why<00:03:08.450> should<00:03:08.660> going<00:03:08.810> around<00:03:08.990> the<00:03:09.080> corner<00:03:09.500> you

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
why should going around the corner you

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.040 
why should going around the corner you
know<00:03:10.250> about<00:03:10.490> it<00:03:10.670> it's<00:03:10.880> really<00:03:11.090> it<00:03:11.810> can

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
know about it it's really it can

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.860 
know about it it's really it can
actually<00:03:12.410> be<00:03:12.680> quite<00:03:12.710> dangerous<00:03:13.390> but<00:03:14.390> there's

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
actually be quite dangerous but there's

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.780 
actually be quite dangerous but there's
also<00:03:15.020> another<00:03:15.200> side<00:03:15.800> to<00:03:15.830> this<00:03:16.190> which<00:03:18.790> people

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
also another side to this which people

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.570 
also another side to this which people
don't<00:03:20.060> think<00:03:20.180> about<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:20.990> that<00:03:21.980> is<00:03:22.130> if<00:03:22.340> you're

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
don't think about and that is if you're

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.050 
don't think about and that is if you're
if<00:03:23.060> you<00:03:23.450> ride<00:03:23.930> yourself<00:03:24.230> and<00:03:25.220> you<00:03:25.400> go<00:03:25.580> pillion

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
if you ride yourself and you go pillion

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.460 
if you ride yourself and you go pillion
it's<00:03:27.050> very<00:03:27.230> important<00:03:27.800> not<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.510> over<00:03:29.510> lean<00:03:30.200> it

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
it's very important not to over lean it

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.680 
it's very important not to over lean it
you<00:03:31.070> have<00:03:31.160> to<00:03:31.310> remember<00:03:31.610> that<00:03:31.910> you're<00:03:32.450> not<00:03:32.600> the

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
you have to remember that you're not the

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.430 
you have to remember that you're not the
one<00:03:32.840> taking<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.320> corner<00:03:33.770> so<00:03:34.600> might<00:03:35.600> be<00:03:35.810> that

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
one taking the corner so might be that

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.680 
one taking the corner so might be that
you<00:03:36.650> try<00:03:36.860> to<00:03:36.890> lean<00:03:37.220> in<00:03:37.490> too<00:03:37.760> much<00:03:38.090> because<00:03:38.480> you

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
you try to lean in too much because you

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.650 
you try to lean in too much because you
were<00:03:38.840> trying<00:03:39.020> to<00:03:39.730> ride<00:03:40.730> your<00:03:40.910> own<00:03:40.970> bike<00:03:41.420> or

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660

whatever and then no over again as well

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.270 
whatever and then no over again as well
but<00:03:46.580> I<00:03:46.760> still<00:03:47.150> always<00:03:47.510> try<00:03:47.930> to<00:03:47.960> stay<00:03:48.500> on<00:03:48.920> the

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
but I still always try to stay on the

bit sharp you should still be looking
where<00:04:11.780> you<00:04:11.870> go

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930

the regular stuff and then he does
anything<00:04:19.579> that's<00:04:19.880> a<00:04:19.970> bit<00:04:20.120> more<00:04:20.329> like<00:04:20.540> this

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
anything that's a bit more like this

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.320 
anything that's a bit more like this
funny<00:04:21.370> bring<00:04:22.370> yourself<00:04:22.729> on<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:22.970> inside<00:04:23.300> a

funny bring yourself on the inside a

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.090 
funny bring yourself on the inside a
little<00:04:23.539> bit<00:04:23.810> so<00:04:23.990> you<00:04:24.139> can<00:04:24.169> see<00:04:24.320> where<00:04:24.770> you're

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
little bit so you can see where you're

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:33.610 
little bit so you can see where you're
been<00:04:25.250> in<00:04:25.400> most<00:04:26.270> likely<00:04:26.720> pop<00:04:26.930> back<00:04:27.139> up<00:04:32.620> snow

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
been in most likely pop back up snow

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.340 
been in most likely pop back up snow
there<00:04:34.130> someone<00:04:34.669> just<00:04:34.880> pulled<00:04:35.120> off<00:04:35.350> without

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
there someone just pulled off without

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.129 
there someone just pulled off without
really<00:04:36.560> thinking<00:04:36.650> about<00:04:37.009> it<00:04:37.400> we<00:04:37.580> had<00:04:37.759> to<00:04:38.139> make

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
really thinking about it we had to make

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.279 
really thinking about it we had to make
some<00:04:39.350> quick<00:04:39.530> braking<00:04:40.449> and<00:04:41.449> all<00:04:41.570> I<00:04:41.690> had<00:04:41.960> to<00:04:41.990> do

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
some quick braking and all I had to do

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.560 
some quick braking and all I had to do
was<00:04:42.830> just<00:04:43.039> kind<00:04:43.310> of<00:04:43.430> like<00:04:43.580> fishing<00:04:44.120> my<00:04:44.210> bedding

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
was just kind of like fishing my bedding

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.570 
was just kind of like fishing my bedding
out<00:04:44.889> and<00:04:46.180> I'm<00:04:47.180> kind<00:04:47.960> of<00:04:48.050> fish<00:04:49.039> backwards

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
out and I'm kind of fish backwards
