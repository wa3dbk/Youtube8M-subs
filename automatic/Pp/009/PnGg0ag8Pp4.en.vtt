you unfold it just like so and flip his

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.779 
you unfold it just like so and flip his
head<00:04:38.039> up<00:04:38.419> rotate<00:04:39.419> this<00:04:39.569> up<00:04:39.780> just<00:04:39.840> like<00:04:40.289> this

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789 
head up rotate this up just like this

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:43.010 
head up rotate this up just like this
kind<00:04:41.789> of<00:04:41.849> even<00:04:42.120> that<00:04:42.270> out<00:04:42.300> level<00:04:42.810> it<00:04:42.870> out<00:04:42.960> a

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
kind of even that out level it out a

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.050 
kind of even that out level it out a
little<00:04:43.110> bit<00:04:43.349> and<00:04:43.740> look<00:04:44.130> at<00:04:44.250> the<00:04:44.310> Hat<00:04:44.490> there<00:04:44.789> you

go and at first I thought this actually
would<00:04:47.819> fold<00:04:48.090> out<00:04:48.240> a<00:04:48.270> little<00:04:48.389> bit<00:04:48.539> more<00:04:48.660> than

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
would fold out a little bit more than

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.180 
would fold out a little bit more than
even<00:04:49.020> up<00:04:49.110> but<00:04:49.229> it<00:04:49.319> doesn't<00:04:49.680> it's<00:04:49.770> just<00:04:49.830> kind<00:04:50.130> of
