00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.760
 the same thing that happens to me when I was 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.049
 in copper runs a team 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.059
 big the water is a big team 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:13.949
 they have an obligation of 70 if you're not 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.570
 champion always needs you to be a 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:17.789
 failure then the processes have to 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.100
 start well and finish the best 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.960
 way and that's what I try to look for 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.619
 now maybe in December I will not 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.170
 reach the champion 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:31.289
 this is this work and so recover a 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.350
 little what is the mystic this team I 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.790
 I am a football fan who did 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.870
 the uv in the sun time sampaoli 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.390
 then we will try 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.390
 I'm not equal to him let's try to 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.640
 generate something very similar darÃ­o saccade 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.440
 Wednesday I think if you go to a 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.550
 I work and they want to take you out and they want 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.980
 hire someone they will not have 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.070
 same day then two days before three 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.629
 days before today I assume today I am 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.290
 assuming the car what happened to the back 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.290
 it's not up to me 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.790
 it's a subject that I know of by I know 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.970
 for the information that I have 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.950
 from my president 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.300
 and we're going to try it but it's something that 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.020
 I do not compete yet because I do not 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.490
 I was hoping that with me in command 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.680
 these things do not happen 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.260
 I do not remember the saying I'm a fan of 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.060
 colo colo and another and another phrase that I said 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.060
 at the time when I was as a player 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.509
 and in memory of my father someday here 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.479
 We wanted to give that taste but not fan 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.460
 I have not much and the other is a 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.950
 technician I am very professional in what 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.140
 I do and I know perfectly well the intention 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.549
 is everything and so that's not the fan is not going 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.570
 to have to repeat itself is never what 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:49.759
 the technician needs the selection of my 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.259
 very open person to talk about it and if 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.990
 you need the eleven players that you 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.369
 go to the eleven players the problem is 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.100
 that sometimes the commitments that they have 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.630
 the institution are as important as 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.720
 what about the selection then there's 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.130
 for him for the important subject to what 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.929
 you better have to cancel the match 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.959
 for things to dismiss such bonus for 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:11.030
 tell you something but I 'm open to the 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.780
 conversation and contribute to the players 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.780
 who needs the selection
