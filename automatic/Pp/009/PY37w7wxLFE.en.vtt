engines<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.299> games<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:09.930> we<00:00:10.049> both<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.590> two

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
engines and games and we both the two

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.590 
engines and games and we both the two
together<00:00:10.980> synergistically<00:00:11.400> so<00:00:12.210> we're

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:12.600 
together synergistically so we're

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.449 
together synergistically so we're
constantly<00:00:12.900> pushing<00:00:13.350> the<00:00:13.740> state<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.309> art

we've been working with them in
particular<00:00:42.270> lately<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.140> implementing<00:00:43.560> the

Tegra<00:00:46.560> k1<00:00:47.060> the<00:00:48.060> cool<00:00:48.270> thing<00:00:48.450> about<00:00:48.540> that<00:00:48.660> is

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
Tegra k1 the cool thing about that is

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.750 
Tegra k1 the cool thing about that is
that<00:00:48.960> Unreal<00:00:49.500> Engine<00:00:49.620> 4<00:00:50.040> is<00:00:50.070> their<00:00:50.550> next

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
that Unreal Engine 4 is their next

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.610 
that Unreal Engine 4 is their next
generation<00:00:50.910> game<00:00:51.420> engine<00:00:51.809> which<00:00:52.079> exploits

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
generation game engine which exploits

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.220 
generation game engine which exploits
things<00:00:52.980> like<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.610> dx11<00:00:53.970> feature<00:00:54.360> set<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.870> now

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
things like the dx11 feature set and now

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.150 
things like the dx11 feature set and now
that<00:00:55.440> same<00:00:55.590> technology<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.130> coming<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.460> mobile

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
that same technology is coming to mobile

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.400 
that same technology is coming to mobile
so<00:00:59.160> Tegra<00:00:59.850> k1<00:00:59.880> is<00:01:00.360> our<00:01:00.480> latest<00:01:00.719> SOC<00:01:01.380> or

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
so Tegra k1 is our latest SOC or

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.290 
so Tegra k1 is our latest SOC or
system-on-a-chip<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.579> most<00:01:02.879> exciting

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
system-on-a-chip and the most exciting

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.429 
system-on-a-chip and the most exciting
thing<00:01:03.480> about<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.320> integrates

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
thing about that is that it integrates

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.410 
thing about that is that it integrates

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
features or opengl 4.4 things like

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.919 
features or opengl 4.4 things like
tessellation<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:11.999> compute<00:01:12.299> shaders<00:01:12.450> the

tessellation and compute shaders the

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:15.379 
tessellation and compute shaders the
great<00:01:13.109> thing<00:01:13.259> about<00:01:13.319> full<00:01:13.619> opengl<00:01:14.369> on<00:01:14.609> mobile

00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:15.389 
great thing about full opengl on mobile

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:17.029 
great thing about full opengl on mobile
hardware<00:01:15.539> is<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.469> take<00:01:16.590> absolutely

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
hardware is that you can take absolutely

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:18.739 
hardware is that you can take absolutely

from<00:01:21.090> here<00:01:21.270> onward<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.749> think<00:01:22.020> we're<00:01:22.139> going<00:01:22.289> to

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
from here onward I think we're going to

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.679 
from here onward I think we're going to
see<00:01:22.529> the<00:01:22.729> performance<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:23.969> feature<00:01:24.420> yet

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
see the performance on feature yet

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.779 
see the performance on feature yet

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:28.859 
and continue genera to the point where

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:30.440 
and continue genera to the point where

the differences between the platforms

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.660 
the differences between the platforms
really<00:01:30.659> blurred
