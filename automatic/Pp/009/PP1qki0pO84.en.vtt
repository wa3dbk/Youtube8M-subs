00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.090
 increasing disk space without losing 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.090
 data 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.790
 tell you this is familiar when 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.799
 on one partition of your hard disk 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.449
 there are literally the last megabytes 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:15.190
 free space on another section 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:16.900
 tens and maybe hundreds of gigabytes 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.390
 I want the free space 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.320
 drag a couple of gigovy another disk but 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.360
 nor do we want to destroy 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.620
 existing sections and create them 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.900
 to redistribute 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.720
 place on risks and as a result lose 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.910
 all data is it possible to increase the amount of 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.370
 or other disk without losing data 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.199
 The answer is yes, but only with the help 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.630
 third-party programs and this will be 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.280
 This video lesson today is dedicated to us 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.030
 learn to take free space from 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.640
 single section 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.380
 and drag it to another but at the same time 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.640
 should make a reservation to drag instead 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.710
 can only between those sections 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.050
 who are physically on one 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.970
 hard drive in my case in computer 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.800
 installed two hard drives first 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:58.270
 drive is c and d second drive is g and h 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.370
 respectively from the disk to disk c 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.140
 I can drag the place but with ease 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.680
 I can take a couple dozen gigabytes with 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.960
 disk d 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.530
 we will do that and help us 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.609
 minitool partition wizard 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.600
 I originally planned to record a video 

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:12.819
 friend's lesson program 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.219
 such as akronis or spoil indis 

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:16.840
 Manager Well, all these programs are paid 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:18.729
 pay for just 1 operation 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.649
 somehow you don't want a hard disk 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.329
 as for the pirated programs i 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.369
 Of course I can not provide them to you 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:27.219
 so I found a free alternative 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.869
 as minitool partition wizard you 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:30.549
 You can download this program by clicking 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.209
 at the address you see right now at 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.829
 its screens 

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:35.439
 either use the link under this 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:38.319
 video after downloading the program 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:40.709
 run the installer explore it 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:40.709
 instructions 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:50.490
 click further on 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.439
 set the installation path set the name in the menu 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.580
 start 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:57.659
 put a tick to create a shortcut on the worker 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:00.259
 table and go further after which 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.259
 proceed to install 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.100
 the program is installed literally in 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.929
 a few seconds leave a tick 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.229
 run the program and push the button 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.229
 finish 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.930
 we will see the main cat 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.610
 program 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.080
 scared it is not worth it all much easier 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.130
 what it seems at first glance 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.810
 we will not go into all the details 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.459
 This program and talk 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.680
 exclusive home zoom features 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.250
 before we continue must you 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.470
 warn 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.590
 operation to increase the hard partition 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.670
 drive you do at your own risk i 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.680
 I say this is not due to the fact that 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.420
 the procedure is dangerous but solely by 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.440
 the reason that you didn't accuse me later 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.510
 all mortal sins 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.550
 if everything is done correctly, everything will be 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.290
 fine but if you press where 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.050
 horrible that is probability series all 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.610
 your data again as I said 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.410
 nothing wrong with this operation 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.140
 just have to warn you that 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.760
 do everything you need to clearly follow the instructions that 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.080
 now let's get down I want 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.019
 increase disk space c 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:02.780
 i choose o from list by pressing right 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.780
 click and select the extend item 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.500
 then from this list i need 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.560
 choose the section from which we will 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.700
 take free space in my case 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.660
 there are a few not here 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.579
 marked areas 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.910
 but I don't need them because I will 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.410
 pull a place from disk d choosing it from 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.840
 this list then move 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.040
 the slider to the desired indicator 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.709
 and by default it is on 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.600
 half of the maximum value here 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.730
 indicated that place will be added to 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.510
 our disk if we offer 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.380
 this slider 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.510
 then these numbers will change from below we 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.079
 see the new size for drive c as well 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.079
 for disk d 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.890
 I can add a maximum of 65 years, but I 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:48.250
 I’ll stop at 40 I’ll set the slider to 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.250
 this value 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.739
 then click on the ok button 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.540
 our task was successfully created 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.799
 and now you need to execute it for 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.799
 this click on the apply button 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:11.730
 click on the button with us appeared 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.269
 message that tells us that 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.889
 disk d 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.540
 used at a given time and 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:16.889
 in order to continue this 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.479
 operation must close all 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.810
 applications that use this 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.810
 disk 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.720
 Unfortunately I could not find 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.760
 a program that prevents you from starting 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.980
 this operation so we will take advantage 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.020
 another option we will press the button 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.760
 restart on and then our computer 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.590
 will restart and immediately after 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.330
 the reboot will automatically open 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.030
 program me here under the silence wizard and 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.380
 finish the execution of our operation that 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.310
 press restart button and 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.310
 see what happens next 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.750
 what did the computer restart and 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:51.099
 free space transfer operations 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.639
 was successfully completed 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:55.659
 as you see my c drive has grown significantly 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:58.090
 disk volume increase procedure 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:59.830
 occurred as follows after 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.389
 restart computer batch program 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.940
 tire wizard connected before loading 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.650
 windows appeared in front of us boot 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.509
 menu of the program after which it 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.370
 set about resizing our 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:12.340
 hard drive in my case given 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.569
 the procedure took about half an hour like you 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.819
 see the result is positive 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:18.190
 we changed the size of our c drive and 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:20.639
 This is not lost files as you will see all 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.639
 files in place 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.729
