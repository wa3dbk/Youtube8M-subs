iconic<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.390> him<00:01:12.630> inside<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.290> collar<00:01:13.790> there<00:01:14.790> is

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030

these<00:01:15.509> two<00:01:15.960> lobes<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:17.000> what<00:01:18.000> they<00:01:18.119> do<00:01:18.180> is

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
these two lobes and what they do is

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.710 
these two lobes and what they do is
actually<00:01:18.689> help<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.830> lock<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.490> heel<00:01:20.729> in<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.659> you

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
actually help to lock the heel in so you

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.480 
actually help to lock the heel in so you
don't<00:01:22.140> have<00:01:22.229> any<00:01:22.290> heel<00:01:22.560> slippage<00:01:22.920> because<00:01:23.280> he

don't have any heel slippage because he

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.590 
don't have any heel slippage because he
won't<00:01:23.610> be<00:01:23.790> popping<00:01:24.150> out<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.390> shoe

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
won't be popping out of the shoe

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.749 
won't be popping out of the shoe
