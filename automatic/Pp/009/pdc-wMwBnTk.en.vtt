00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:30.699 
next I'd like to talk about voice

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.290 
next I'd like to talk about voice
leading<00:00:31.140> what<00:00:32.140> is<00:00:32.290> voice<00:00:32.470> leading<00:00:33.300> basically

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
leading what is voice leading basically

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.110

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
it's leading a voice through chord

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.750 
it's leading a voice through chord
changes<00:00:37.720> outlining<00:00:38.710> the<00:00:39.010> chord<00:00:39.040> changes<00:00:39.430> in

changes outlining the chord changes in

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.119 
changes outlining the chord changes in
your<00:00:39.910> solo<00:00:40.329> the<00:00:41.290> way<00:00:41.410> I<00:00:41.440> think<00:00:41.620> about<00:00:41.769> voice

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
your solo the way I think about voice

your solo the way I think about voice
leading<00:00:42.489> through<00:00:42.699> chords<00:00:43.059> is<00:00:43.239> is<00:00:43.540> targeting

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
leading through chords is is targeting

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.079 
leading through chords is is targeting
the<00:00:45.839> important<00:00:46.839> tones<00:00:47.230> of<00:00:47.710> each<00:00:48.400> chord<00:00:48.790> change

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.089 
the important tones of each chord change

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:50.250 
the important tones of each chord change
and<00:00:49.269> what<00:00:49.390> are<00:00:49.540> the<00:00:49.659> important<00:00:50.079> tones

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
and what are the important tones

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.850 
and what are the important tones
typically<00:00:51.129> the<00:00:51.970> 3rd<00:00:52.300> and<00:00:52.600> the<00:00:52.629> 7th<00:00:53.079> if<00:00:53.320> I<00:00:53.470> if<00:00:53.710> I

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
typically the 3rd and the 7th if I if I

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.579 
typically the 3rd and the 7th if I if I
can<00:00:54.100> build<00:00:54.430> my<00:00:54.699> lines<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:56.050> that<00:00:56.230> I'm<00:00:56.350> outlining

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
can build my lines so that I'm outlining

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.939 
can build my lines so that I'm outlining
the<00:00:57.220> 3rd<00:00:57.550> and<00:00:57.850> the<00:00:57.909> 7th<00:00:58.540> of<00:00:58.689> the<00:00:58.960> chord<00:00:59.260> you're

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
the 3rd and the 7th of the chord you're

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:01.740 
the 3rd and the 7th of the chord you're
going<00:01:00.010> to<00:01:00.189> hear<00:01:00.400> the<00:01:00.519> chord<00:01:00.790> change<00:01:01.059> so

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
going to hear the chord change so

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.049 
going to hear the chord change so
getting<00:01:02.140> back<00:01:02.320> to<00:01:02.470> an<00:01:02.589> e7<00:01:03.189> example<00:01:03.670> if<00:01:03.760> I'm<00:01:03.879> if

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
getting back to an e7 example if I'm if

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.810 
getting back to an e7 example if I'm if
I'm<00:01:04.150> trying<00:01:04.360> to<00:01:04.510> play<00:01:04.689> over<00:01:05.049> an<00:01:05.140> e7<00:01:05.590> chord

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
I'm trying to play over an e7 chord

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.350 
I'm trying to play over an e7 chord
voice<00:01:06.820> lead<00:01:07.060> my<00:01:07.210> way<00:01:07.360> through<00:01:07.630> that<00:01:07.840> if<00:01:08.710> I

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
voice lead my way through that if I

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.660 
voice lead my way through that if I
target<00:01:10.360> the<00:01:10.720> notes<00:01:10.930> G<00:01:11.409> sharp<00:01:11.710> which<00:01:12.340> is<00:01:12.490> the

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
target the notes G sharp which is the

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.749 
target the notes G sharp which is the
3rd<00:01:12.880> and<00:01:13.170> D<00:01:14.170> natural<00:01:14.680> which<00:01:14.860> is<00:01:14.890> the<00:01:15.130> flat<00:01:15.340> 7th

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
3rd and D natural which is the flat 7th

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.480 
3rd and D natural which is the flat 7th

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
of an e 7th chord and obviously the root

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.969 
of an e 7th chord and obviously the root
let's<00:01:18.729> say<00:01:18.939> you<00:01:19.299> know<00:01:19.420> for<00:01:20.380> some<00:01:20.590> reason<00:01:20.619> the

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
let's say you know for some reason the

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.350 
let's say you know for some reason the
human<00:01:21.100> ear<00:01:21.400> hears<00:01:21.729> those<00:01:21.909> as<00:01:22.060> the<00:01:22.180> two

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
human ear hears those as the two

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.899 
human ear hears those as the two
important<00:01:23.170> tones<00:01:23.380> you<00:01:23.710> know<00:01:23.829> another<00:01:24.640> way<00:01:24.880> to

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
important tones you know another way to

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.640 
important tones you know another way to
think<00:01:25.450> about<00:01:25.540> this<00:01:25.840> voice<00:01:26.020> leading<00:01:26.290> business

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
think about this voice leading business

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.730 
think about this voice leading business
is<00:01:26.829> that<00:01:27.240> if<00:01:28.240> I<00:01:28.509> play<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:29.020> notes<00:01:29.320> of<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.710> chord

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
is that if I play the notes of the chord

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.740 
is that if I play the notes of the chord
as<00:01:30.310> an<00:01:30.460> arpeggio<00:01:30.940> so<00:01:31.090> if<00:01:31.150> I'm<00:01:31.270> playing<00:01:31.390> over<00:01:31.720> in

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
as an arpeggio so if I'm playing over in

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.090 
as an arpeggio so if I'm playing over in
each<00:01:31.900> seventh<00:01:32.260> chord<00:01:32.440> and<00:01:32.560> I<00:01:32.620> play<00:01:32.920> these

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
each seventh chord and I play these

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.149 
each seventh chord and I play these
notes

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.830 

that's<00:01:40.159> an<00:01:40.310> e<00:01:40.369> 7<00:01:40.640> arpeggio<00:01:40.909> basically<00:01:41.510> I'm

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
that's an e 7 arpeggio basically I'm

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.539 
that's an e 7 arpeggio basically I'm
playing<00:01:42.260> the<00:01:42.440> notes<00:01:42.650> of<00:01:42.830> the<00:01:42.920> chord<00:01:42.950> one<00:01:43.400> at<00:01:43.520> a

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
playing the notes of the chord one at a

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.969 
playing the notes of the chord one at a
time<00:01:43.840> it's<00:01:44.840> as<00:01:45.020> if<00:01:45.140> I<00:01:45.260> was<00:01:45.409> playing<00:01:45.619> the<00:01:45.740> chord

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
time it's as if I was playing the chord

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.460 
time it's as if I was playing the chord
except<00:01:46.340> I'm<00:01:46.430> playing<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:46.790> melody<00:01:47.229> that<00:01:48.229> is

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
except I'm playing a melody that is

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.380 
except I'm playing a melody that is
going<00:01:48.770> to<00:01:48.890> tell<00:01:49.070> the<00:01:49.159> listener<00:01:49.549> I'm<00:01:49.790> playing<00:01:50.210> e

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
going to tell the listener I'm playing e

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.830 
going to tell the listener I'm playing e
7<00:01:50.840> you<00:01:51.290> know<00:01:51.700> so<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.880> trick<00:01:53.150> here<00:01:53.180> is<00:01:53.450> let's

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
7 you know so the trick here is let's

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.060 
7 you know so the trick here is let's
say<00:01:53.930> if<00:01:53.990> we<00:01:54.080> took<00:01:54.229> a<00:01:54.290> very<00:01:54.470> common<00:01:54.890> chord

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
say if we took a very common chord

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.420 
say if we took a very common chord
progression<00:01:55.580> let's<00:01:56.270> say<00:01:56.390> e<00:01:56.630> seven<00:01:57.110> to<00:01:57.500> a<00:01:57.530> 7<00:01:57.710> 1<00:01:58.399> 2

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
progression let's say e seven to a 7 1 2

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:09.960 
progression let's say e seven to a 7 1 2
4<00:01:58.790> right<00:01:59.030> how<00:01:59.270> many<00:01:59.330> songs<00:01:59.659> do<00:01:59.869> that

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.060 

so<00:02:10.869> if<00:02:11.080> I'm<00:02:11.230> trying<00:02:11.410> to<00:02:11.500> make<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:11.770> change

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
so if I'm trying to make the change

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.360 
so if I'm trying to make the change
between<00:02:12.280> an<00:02:12.790> e7<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.720> an<00:02:13.810> a7<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.890> way<00:02:15.100> to<00:02:15.160> get

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
between an e7 to an a7 the way to get

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.940 
between an e7 to an a7 the way to get
started<00:02:15.580> with<00:02:15.760> this<00:02:16.000> is<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.300> really<00:02:16.570> outline

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
started with this is to really outline

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.240 
started with this is to really outline
those<00:02:17.950> those<00:02:18.490> chords<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:19.810> very<00:02:20.740> simple

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
those those chords and very simple

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.490 
those those chords and very simple
bare-bones<00:02:21.760> terms<00:02:22.150> if<00:02:22.360> I<00:02:22.480> play<00:02:22.750> an<00:02:23.050> e<00:02:23.200> 7

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
bare-bones terms if I play an e 7

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.250 
bare-bones terms if I play an e 7
arpeggio<00:02:23.770> like<00:02:24.070> this<00:02:27.900> just<00:02:28.900> once<00:02:29.050> when<00:02:29.140> they

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
arpeggio like this just once when they

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.190 
arpeggio like this just once when they
set<00:02:29.440> in<00:02:29.530> arpeggio<00:02:29.830> so<00:02:29.950> I'm<00:02:30.040> gonna<00:02:30.130> play<00:02:30.310> you<00:02:30.340> 7

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
set in arpeggio so I'm gonna play you 7

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.710 
set in arpeggio so I'm gonna play you 7
to<00:02:32.740> an<00:02:32.830> a7

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
to an a7

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.620 
to an a7
just<00:02:35.710> those<00:02:36.520> simple<00:02:36.850> patterns<00:02:37.180> right<00:02:37.360> there

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
just those simple patterns right there

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:57.960 
just those simple patterns right there
so<00:02:38.440> three<00:02:38.830> four

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.759 

there<00:02:58.970> I<00:02:59.209> just<00:02:59.569> stuck<00:02:59.840> exclusively<00:03:00.620> with

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
there I just stuck exclusively with

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.259 
there I just stuck exclusively with
court<00:03:01.069> totes<00:03:01.220> I<00:03:01.340> put<00:03:01.549> in<00:03:01.640> a<00:03:01.760> little<00:03:01.909> inflection

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
court totes I put in a little inflection

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:03.550 
court totes I put in a little inflection
with<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.540> bending<00:03:02.840> which<00:03:02.959> goes<00:03:03.170> a<00:03:03.200> long<00:03:03.379> way

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
with the bending which goes a long way

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.970 
with the bending which goes a long way
to<00:03:03.620> making<00:03:03.829> any<00:03:04.040> solo<00:03:04.370> musical<00:03:04.879> hopefully

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
to making any solo musical hopefully

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.309 
to making any solo musical hopefully
this<00:03:06.980> is<00:03:07.129> a<00:03:07.159> very<00:03:07.459> different<00:03:07.670> approach<00:03:08.060> than

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
this is a very different approach than

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.710 
this is a very different approach than
bellowing<00:03:09.319> scales<00:03:10.220> over<00:03:10.579> the<00:03:11.180> chord<00:03:11.450> changes

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
bellowing scales over the chord changes

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.160 
bellowing scales over the chord changes
which<00:03:12.349> is<00:03:12.500> very<00:03:12.860> common<00:03:13.250> in<00:03:13.599> rock<00:03:14.599> but<00:03:14.900> to<00:03:15.019> make

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
which is very common in rock but to make

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.619 
which is very common in rock but to make
it<00:03:15.200> high-intensity<00:03:15.590> rough<00:03:16.420> sometimes<00:03:17.420> we're

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
it high-intensity rough sometimes we're

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.180 
it high-intensity rough sometimes we're
going<00:03:17.659> to<00:03:17.840> want<00:03:17.989> to<00:03:18.140> outline<00:03:18.739> those<00:03:18.920> chord

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
going to want to outline those chord

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.619 
going to want to outline those chord
changes<00:03:19.220> because<00:03:19.700> it<00:03:19.819> makes<00:03:19.970> people<00:03:20.269> go<00:03:20.420> ooh

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:20.629 
changes because it makes people go ooh

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:22.210 
changes because it makes people go ooh
which<00:03:21.290> is<00:03:21.440> happening<00:03:21.769> there's<00:03:21.920> something

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
which is happening there's something

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.069 
which is happening there's something
happen<00:03:22.549> it<00:03:23.299> definitely<00:03:23.629> gets<00:03:23.720> people's

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
happen it definitely gets people's

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.830 
happen it definitely gets people's
attention<00:03:24.790> that<00:03:25.790> example<00:03:26.180> I<00:03:26.209> just<00:03:26.239> played<00:03:26.629> we

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
attention that example I just played we

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.990 
attention that example I just played we
I<00:03:27.079> was<00:03:27.290> basically<00:03:27.650> sticking<00:03:28.040> directly<00:03:28.730> to<00:03:28.909> the

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
I was basically sticking directly to the

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000 
I was basically sticking directly to the
arpeggio<00:03:29.540> I'm<00:03:30.349> going<00:03:30.560> to<00:03:30.620> give<00:03:30.739> you<00:03:30.829> another

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
arpeggio I'm going to give you another

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.190 
arpeggio I'm going to give you another
little<00:03:31.190> example<00:03:31.730> to<00:03:32.150> add<00:03:32.299> some<00:03:32.599> color<00:03:32.870> to<00:03:32.959> this

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
little example to add some color to this

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.610 
little example to add some color to this
so<00:03:33.319> it's<00:03:33.470> not<00:03:33.620> so<00:03:34.040> bone-dry<00:03:34.750> I<00:03:35.750> can<00:03:36.260> approach

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
so it's not so bone-dry I can approach

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.640 
so it's not so bone-dry I can approach
each<00:03:37.250> note<00:03:38.060> of<00:03:38.269> the<00:03:38.420> arpeggio<00:03:38.840> by<00:03:39.290> let's<00:03:39.530> say

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
each note of the arpeggio by let's say

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.039 
each note of the arpeggio by let's say
chromatic<00:03:40.250> a<00:03:40.430> chromatic<00:03:41.090> tone<00:03:41.269> from<00:03:41.540> above<00:03:41.900> or

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
chromatic a chromatic tone from above or

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.020 
chromatic a chromatic tone from above or
below<00:03:42.260> this<00:03:42.500> is<00:03:42.650> a<00:03:42.680> really<00:03:42.950> neat<00:03:43.129> sound<00:03:43.340> so<00:03:43.940> if

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
below this is a really neat sound so if

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.780 
below this is a really neat sound so if
I'm<00:03:44.180> playing<00:03:44.560> an<00:03:45.560> e<00:03:45.829> seven<00:03:46.190> arpeggio<00:03:46.489> like

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
I'm playing an e seven arpeggio like

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.740 
I'm playing an e seven arpeggio like
this<00:03:47.000> I'm<00:03:47.450> playing<00:03:48.940> if<00:03:49.940> I<00:03:50.090> approach<00:03:50.720> each

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
this I'm playing if I approach each

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:57.940 
this I'm playing if I approach each
chord<00:03:51.650> tone<00:03:51.829> by<00:03:52.010> a<00:03:52.040> chromatic<00:03:52.370> step<00:03:52.639> I<00:03:52.730> get

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:38.810 

right<00:03:58.950> and<00:03:59.130> on<00:03:59.190> a<00:03:59.220> set<00:03:59.550> mode<00:03:59.700> yet
