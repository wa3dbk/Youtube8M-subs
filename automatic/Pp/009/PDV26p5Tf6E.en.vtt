00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.580
 good everyone and welcome to the third 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.590
 episode of training pasta 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.750
 I am huila today a little bit 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.640
 less put in caffeine and in this 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.439
 episode we're going to talk about the portal 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.810
 dark that is to say the event matters what 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.880
 dark that we can see right now and 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.050
 we can play in the beta of playing the 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.539
 organs 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.550
 this event is very important because 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.250
 means the transition from my back 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.570
 loft traynor water area and it is also the 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.670
 first impression we have of walt 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.769
 we in particular bring now yes 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.720
 that the truth is that it is a big event 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:45.159
 important and with scenes of lore very 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.100
 significant in fact I want to talk about 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:49.629
 this on a later platinum disc 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.909
 more calmly because the truth 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.949
 that has a lot of friends 3 me that is very 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.870
 very interesting so in this video 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.970
 let's show a little bit what it is that 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.800
 happens in the dark portal event 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.079
 what are we not going to find and 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.960
 how can you play or rather how is it 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:09.119
 the development of the game I hope that you 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.380
 like it and remember that if you do not want to see it 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.990
 anticipate the events not 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.289
 watch the video because this is an alert 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.289
 after 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.020
 warning spoilers if you do not want to know 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.659
 absolutely nothing that will happen 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:30.479
 in the dark portal event it's better 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.479
 that you do not follow do not say that we advance 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.940
 in the beta the war we do not have 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.159
 currently available to play the 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.479
 event of the dark portal that will be the 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.369
 introductory event that will make us 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.310
 transition from standard miso to 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.140
 save it to begin we should 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.270
 visit the dark portal located at 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.430
 devastated lands that as a consequence 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.250
 of the temporary alteration will become 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.250
 of red color from this moment 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.409
 that portal will communicate against him or if 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.930
 we want to visit terr allende that is to say 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.430
 the old green portal we must go to 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.039
 caverns of time that is where it will be 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.110
 from entered once we cross the 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.910
 dark portal we will find a 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.070
 horde of iron that has cross the 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.769
 dark portal with all his troops to 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.300
 throw steel and destroy it completely and 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:18.019
 of course we the heroes of 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.640
 steel we can not leave three soups like that 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:23.239
 that we together with some beings 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.920
 known as frank load we will have 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.450
 that we face the troops of the 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.360
 iron horde while we look for the 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.040
 way to close the dark portal to 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.290
 so that the iron horde can not 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.630
 access our world and destroy it 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.510
 so it's up to close portals it 's in this 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.030
 point when we are going to interact with 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.790
 multiple characters that sound to us in 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.160
 many times in an unexpected way that 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.640
 he was going to tell us that we help 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:53.000
 to golden yoga to theron of the council of 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.310
 the shadows we will have to 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.500
 release them and help them because it turns out that 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.420
 Iron Horde had captured them 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.830
 so that thanks to his evil powers 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.680
 they had opened the dark portal 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.840
 while his whole army crosses so 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.670
 we have to release them so that if the 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.010
 dark portal lose energy and we can 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.560
 really close who was going to tell us 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.450
 what would have happened but it is that 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.920
 it turns out that of course we do that and all the 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.380
 Iron horde is coming on us like this 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.300
 that we have to go out running away but it's 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.550
 that surprises do not end here 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.680
 because during the flight 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.420
 we are going to release several prisoners who 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.430
 they are very important for both 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.900
 alliance as for the horde that we 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.000
 will help pass through the 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.120
 multiple hazards and multiple 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.180
 clans that want to eliminate us 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.640
 we will cross with red kill and his clan moat 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.260
 bleeding 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:46.650
 loads and his blue hand shattered plan 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.880
 and your moon shape shadow plan 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.950
 surprising because nobody expected that 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.250
 in blue out ally of the horde of 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.440
 hiding iron and finally the 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.069
 we will see with a black fist and his rock plan 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.560
 black 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.780
 after a great and fast-paced fight 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.170
 of a great and trepidante flight 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.299
 we will find with a mega weapon a great 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.189
 cannon that iron time plans to use 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:13.700
 Zero to destroy the planet that is 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:15.709
 whole and they call it the worlds wreck 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.200
 and we ask ourselves what would be 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.260
 better to destroy the machine or use the 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.310
 own machine against iron order 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.160
 well indeed it is much more 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.160
 fun especially if you're not good 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.960
 Do not use the weapons of your enemies against 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.940
 themselves and thanks to our 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.950
 fellow engineers we just flew 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.290
 in pieces the dark portal in a 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.150
 great impressive cinematic that does not 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.190
 the beta is currently available as well 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.380
 that we can not teach 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.450
 but thanks to this now at the time of 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.820
 iron could not vary zero until 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.410
 he rebuilt it and meanwhile we 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.230
 we have achieved a lot of time but 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.910
 it's time to flee because we have 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:56.230
 to the whole sister behind us like that 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.230
 that only remains to run
