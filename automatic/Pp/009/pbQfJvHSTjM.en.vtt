 colors it changes the color of our center 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.980
 notifications and it looks very cool 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.230
 compared to old and new color 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.930
 Is this something that gives freshness to ours ? 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.740
 device and some kind of zest grandfather you 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:35.910
 You can change the settings to green 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:38.399
 looks very cool on blue too 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.440
 cool and even you can 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.640
 combine colors and create your own 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.469
 own such here violet so 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.120

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.120
 the wedge allows you to change the logo of this 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.399
 communication of your operator as you see us 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.579
 given a fairly large selection 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.939
 logo such as nike batman 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.830
 assassin's creed blue coat and how to 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.189
 but really we will have to limit 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.240
 white color well except superman color 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.060

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.490

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.009
 aux and this is perfection on i panel 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.229
 multitasking now instead of icons 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.610
 programs will appear cards and this 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.070

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.649
 to close the program is enough 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.420
 do the same swipe down close all at once 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.039

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.289
 screen 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:13.069
 In the form of an accordion in the settings you can

 it looks something like this 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.180
 I personally liked it so much 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.159
 download 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.989

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:57.209
 the most convenient tweet called 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.640
 password file and it allows you to skip 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.829
 traditional password entry procedure when 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.549
 download any and of the apps and for 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.370
 apple 100 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.409
 let file automatically inserts 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.389
 your character combination 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:12.000
 weightless cake when loading or 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:13.980
 application update is enough only 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.500
 specify a password in your settings 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.359
 devices to ensure maximum 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.519
 security password stored in 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:23.069
 encrypted 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:25.230
