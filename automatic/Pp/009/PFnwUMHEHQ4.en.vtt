00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.349 
being viewed as a safe haven right now
well<00:00:18.990> we<00:00:19.680> we'd<00:00:20.460> like<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.699> say<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.180> that's

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
well we we'd like to say that that's

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.019 
well we we'd like to say that that's
true<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.900> i<00:00:22.109> think<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.500> true<00:00:22.800> but<00:00:23.250> it's

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
true and i think it is true but it's

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.700 
true and i think it is true but it's
interesting<00:00:24.300> because<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.990> first<00:00:25.260> half<00:00:25.560> of

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
interesting because the first half of

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.230 
interesting because the first half of
the<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.859> first<00:00:26.189> hour<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.760> trading<00:00:27.090> day

the the first hour of the trading day
all<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:28.140> commodities<00:00:28.380> were<00:00:28.710> on<00:00:28.800> fire<00:00:29.099> and

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
all the commodities were on fire and

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.980 
all the commodities were on fire and
gold<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.760> silver<00:00:30.029> were<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.269> weakest<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.900> the

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
gold and silver were the weakest of the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.920 
gold and silver were the weakest of the
bunch<00:00:31.309> but<00:00:32.309> then<00:00:32.489> some<00:00:32.759> quick<00:00:33.120> news<00:00:33.450> headlines

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
bunch but then some quick news headlines

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.170 
bunch but then some quick news headlines
came<00:00:34.170> out<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.440> Europe<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.800> succession<00:00:35.190> at<00:00:35.910> the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
came out of Europe in succession at the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.819 
came out of Europe in succession at the
end<00:00:36.329> result<00:00:36.719> being<00:00:36.809> gold<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.440> silver

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
end result being gold and silver

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.479 
end result being gold and silver
rallying<00:00:38.460> along<00:00:39.210> with<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.629> dollar<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.530> I'd

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
rallying along with the dollar so I'd

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.850 
rallying along with the dollar so I'd
have<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.940> be<00:00:42.030> skeptical<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.690> anyone<00:00:43.530> who<00:00:43.620> says

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
have to be skeptical of anyone who says

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.400 
have to be skeptical of anyone who says
that<00:00:44.190> gold<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:44.940> not<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.210> safe<00:00:45.480> haven<00:00:45.629> anymore<00:00:46.170> it

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
that gold is not a safe haven anymore it

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.869 
that gold is not a safe haven anymore it
looks<00:00:46.649> like<00:00:46.710> there's<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.160> return<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.760> that

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
looks like there's a return to that

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.990 
looks like there's a return to that
mentality<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:49.320> big<00:00:49.559> way<00:00:49.770> today<00:00:50.129> all<00:00:50.940> right

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
mentality in a big way today all right

this positive for gold and silver well

is<00:03:07.830> yes<00:03:07.920> for<00:03:08.790> multiple<00:03:09.180> reasons<00:03:09.680> we<00:03:10.680> have<00:03:10.890> put

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
is yes for multiple reasons we have put

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.330 
is yes for multiple reasons we have put
in<00:03:11.190> an<00:03:11.370> intermediate<00:03:11.880> bottom<00:03:12.800> the<00:03:13.800> European

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
in an intermediate bottom the European

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.490 
in an intermediate bottom the European
crisis<00:03:14.790> is<00:03:14.910> far<00:03:15.150> from<00:03:15.360> resolved<00:03:15.540> I<00:03:16.080> think

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
crisis is far from resolved I think

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.550 
crisis is far from resolved I think
you'll<00:03:16.740> find<00:03:16.890> that<00:03:17.010> out<00:03:17.100> tomorrow<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:18.560> you

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
you'll find that out tomorrow and you

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.530 
you'll find that out tomorrow and you
know<00:03:19.680> see<00:03:20.280> any<00:03:20.400> hasn't<00:03:20.760> really<00:03:20.970> lowered<00:03:21.390> its

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
know see any hasn't really lowered its

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.320 
know see any hasn't really lowered its
margin<00:03:21.900> requirements<00:03:22.940> despite<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.090> sell-off

margin requirements despite the sell-off
in<00:03:24.660> gold<00:03:24.930> so<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:26.310> tells<00:03:26.580> me<00:03:26.700> these<00:03:26.940> buyers

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
in gold so that tells me these buyers

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.300 
in gold so that tells me these buyers
are<00:03:27.510> deeper<00:03:27.810> pocketed<00:03:28.320> and<00:03:28.470> not<00:03:29.070> so

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
are deeper pocketed and not so

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.910 
are deeper pocketed and not so

speculative oriented I I would guess

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.050 
speculative oriented I I would guess
they're<00:03:32.130> probably<00:03:32.310> money<00:03:32.610> coming<00:03:32.940> out<00:03:33.000> of

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.600 
warning is this we've had a breakout in
volatility<00:03:48.870> in<00:03:49.230> on<00:03:49.620> a<00:03:49.920> Bollinger<00:03:50.430> Bands

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
volatility in on a Bollinger Bands

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.729 
volatility in on a Bollinger Bands
system<00:03:50.940> that<00:03:51.090> we<00:03:51.180> look<00:03:51.360> at<00:03:51.540> quite<00:03:52.050> closely<00:03:52.320> and

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
system that we look at quite closely and

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.390 
system that we look at quite closely and
those<00:03:53.580> systems<00:03:53.910> often<00:03:54.300> show<00:03:55.080> large<00:03:55.980> large

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
those systems often show large large

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
moves followed by intense reversals so

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.150 
moves followed by intense reversals so
you<00:04:00.750> know<00:04:00.870> this<00:04:01.320> could<00:04:01.560> be<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.800> beginning<00:04:01.890> of

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
you know this could be the beginning of

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.780 
you know this could be the beginning of
the<00:04:03.230> Europe<00:04:04.230> is<00:04:04.380> going<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.739> have<00:04:04.890> a<00:04:04.920> crisis<00:04:05.520> and

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
the Europe is going to have a crisis and

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.640 
the Europe is going to have a crisis and
the<00:04:06.030> bottom<00:04:06.300> line<00:04:06.450> and<00:04:06.630> that<00:04:06.959> makes<00:04:07.140> gold<00:04:07.440> and

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
the bottom line and that makes gold and

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.580 
the bottom line and that makes gold and
silver<00:04:07.920> scream<00:04:08.730> higher<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:09.390> then<00:04:09.720> somebody

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
silver scream higher and then somebody

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.699 
silver scream higher and then somebody
steps<00:04:11.040> in<00:04:11.220> like<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:12.239> US<00:04:12.540> or<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.840> IMF<00:04:13.380> as<00:04:13.650> a

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
steps in like the US or the IMF as a

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.460 
steps in like the US or the IMF as a
wild<00:04:14.100> card<00:04:14.160> and<00:04:14.610> solves<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.090> problem<00:04:15.450> so<00:04:16.020> the

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
wild card and solves the problem so the

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.680 
wild card and solves the problem so the
markets<00:04:16.830> could<00:04:17.010> be<00:04:17.070> whippy<00:04:17.459> right<00:04:17.609> now<00:04:17.790> but<00:04:18.209> we

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
markets could be whippy right now but we

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.830 
markets could be whippy right now but we
think<00:04:19.880> gold<00:04:20.880> is<00:04:21.180> clear<00:04:21.900> to<00:04:22.080> go<00:04:22.260> to<00:04:22.550> 1720<00:04:23.840> before

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
think gold is clear to go to 1720 before

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.830 
think gold is clear to go to 1720 before
there's<00:04:25.200> resistance<00:04:25.729> above<00:04:26.729> 1750

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
there's resistance above 1750

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.840 
there's resistance above 1750
if<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.710> market<00:04:29.040> gets<00:04:29.190> up<00:04:29.340> there<00:04:29.580> and<00:04:29.880> we<00:04:30.750> think

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
if the market gets up there and we think

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.430 
if the market gets up there and we think
2,000<00:04:32.850> is<00:04:33.000> one<00:04:33.389> a<00:04:33.419> table<00:04:33.810> again<00:04:34.020> but<00:04:34.290> we<00:04:34.380> still

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
2,000 is one a table again but we still

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.350 
2,000 is one a table again but we still
think<00:04:34.650> it'll<00:04:34.889> be<00:04:34.919> reasonably<00:04:35.400> orderly<00:04:35.880> so

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
think it'll be reasonably orderly so

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.240 
think it'll be reasonably orderly so
Vince<00:04:36.600> when<00:04:36.750> we<00:04:36.840> say<00:04:37.050> intermediate<00:04:37.830> what<00:04:38.040> does

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
Vince when we say intermediate what does

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.450 
Vince when we say intermediate what does
intermediate<00:04:38.970> mean<00:04:39.210> what's<00:04:39.540> the<00:04:39.690> timeframe

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
intermediate mean what's the timeframe

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.620 
intermediate mean what's the timeframe
intermediate<00:04:41.460> would<00:04:41.610> be<00:04:42.350> two<00:04:43.350> weeks<00:04:43.699> to<00:04:44.699> two

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
intermediate would be two weeks to two

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.830 
intermediate would be two weeks to two
months<00:04:45.710> for<00:04:46.710> us<00:04:46.860> all<00:04:47.669> right<00:04:47.850> Vince<00:04:48.120> as<00:04:48.330> usual

this<00:04:51.660> week<00:04:51.870> yeah<00:04:53.570> couple<00:04:54.570> weeks<00:04:54.660> ago<00:04:54.810> we<00:04:55.110> said

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
this week yeah couple weeks ago we said

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.900 
this week yeah couple weeks ago we said
I<00:04:55.380> keep<00:04:55.710> your<00:04:55.830> powder<00:04:55.949> dry<00:04:56.100> we<00:04:56.669> think<00:04:56.820> it's

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
I keep your powder dry we think it's

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.680 
I keep your powder dry we think it's
time<00:04:57.120> to<00:04:57.380> to<00:04:58.380> load<00:04:58.530> your<00:04:58.680> guns<00:04:58.860> now<00:04:59.690> silver

time to to load your guns now silver
especially<00:05:01.910> we<00:05:02.910> think<00:05:03.120> if<00:05:03.180> it<00:05:03.300> closes<00:05:03.600> near

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
especially we think if it closes near

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.200 
especially we think if it closes near
the<00:05:04.229> highs<00:05:04.410> today<00:05:05.180> we'd<00:05:06.180> be<00:05:06.210> buyers<00:05:06.570> of<00:05:06.960> silver

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
the highs today we'd be buyers of silver

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.060 
the highs today we'd be buyers of silver
with<00:05:09.210> a<00:05:09.240> reasonably<00:05:09.780> tight<00:05:09.960> stopped<00:05:10.229> because

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
with a reasonably tight stopped because

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.850 
with a reasonably tight stopped because
this<00:05:11.250> is<00:05:11.400> the<00:05:11.520> beginning<00:05:11.669> of<00:05:11.880> a<00:05:12.060> large<00:05:12.300> move

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
this is the beginning of a large move

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.620 
this is the beginning of a large move
not<00:05:13.860> not<00:05:14.220> the<00:05:14.250> end<00:05:14.520> of<00:05:14.610> the<00:05:14.669> small<00:05:14.910> move<00:05:15.090> load
