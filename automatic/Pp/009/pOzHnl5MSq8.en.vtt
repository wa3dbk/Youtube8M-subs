enemy units it's like they have five
armor<00:02:12.120> penetration<00:02:12.740> basically<00:02:13.740> against

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
armor penetration basically against

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.260 
armor penetration basically against
infantry<00:02:14.370> but<00:02:14.640> not<00:02:14.790> against

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
infantry but not against

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.120 
infantry but not against
so<00:02:15.570> they're<00:02:15.720> going<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.990> be<00:02:16.080> better<00:02:16.320> against

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
so they're going to be better against

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.640 
so they're going to be better against
skirmishers<00:02:17.700> against<00:02:18.660> infantry<00:02:19.080> than<00:02:19.500> they

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
skirmishers against infantry than they

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.160 
skirmishers against infantry than they
are<00:02:19.830> against<00:02:20.490> cavalry<00:02:21.120> so<00:02:21.780> i'll<00:02:21.870> leave<00:02:21.900> the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
are against cavalry so i'll leave the
