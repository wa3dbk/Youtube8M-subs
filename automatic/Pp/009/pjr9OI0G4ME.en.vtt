and<00:01:48.440> there<00:01:48.620> you<00:01:48.770> go<00:01:49.480> so<00:01:50.480> now<00:01:50.660> this<00:01:50.870> was<00:01:51.080> a<00:01:51.110> guess

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
and there you go so now this was a guess

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.200 
and there you go so now this was a guess
nautical<00:01:52.700> not<00:01:53.510> which<00:01:53.990> allowed<00:01:54.590> you<00:01:54.860> to<00:01:55.180> get<00:01:56.180> a

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
nautical not which allowed you to get a

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.730 
nautical not which allowed you to get a
hold<00:01:56.480> of<00:01:56.600> some<00:01:56.810> rope<00:01:56.990> when<00:01:57.200> you<00:01:57.260> want<00:01:57.410> to<00:01:57.530> pull

hold of some rope when you want to pull

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.850 
hold of some rope when you want to pull
something<00:01:58.040> in<00:01:58.340> so<00:01:58.670> we'll<00:01:59.300> use<00:01:59.510> this<00:01:59.780> to<00:02:00.080> hangar

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860

something in so we'll use this to hangar
hammock<00:02:01.190> so<00:02:01.790> now<00:02:01.940> at<00:02:01.970> this<00:02:02.120> point<00:02:02.420> what<00:02:02.660> we'll

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
hammock so now at this point what we'll

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.980 
hammock so now at this point what we'll
do<00:02:02.930> is<00:02:03.110> take<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:04.570> adjustable<00:02:05.570> end<00:02:05.750> of<00:02:05.870> our
