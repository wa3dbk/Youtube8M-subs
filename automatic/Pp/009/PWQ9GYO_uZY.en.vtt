00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello everyone again you this again I'm sitting 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.520
 we will talk about cold arms in 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.240
 Russian legislation section 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.620
 federations 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.360
 I have repeatedly stated that 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.040
 a cold knife just like a store to buy 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.480
 it is impossible however the flow of questions to 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.000
 this topic does not stop for a minute 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.990
 it's time to finally make out the signs 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.240
 cold weapons 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.859
 drove the regulatory documents which 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.109
 regulate the cold parameter 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.320
 weapons in Russia only two is the state number 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.039
 r500 1548 dash 2000 knives for survival and 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.970
 state number r500 1500 399 knives and daggers 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.480
 hunting 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.760
 note that Gaster 500 1500 99 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.440
 hunting dagger knives 2005 was 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.090
 adopted a change that is changing part 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.559
 wording in some clause 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.300
 exclude and accept as fact 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.100
 edged weapons that you own and 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.110
 which could accidentally get to you in 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.149
 hands under Russian law 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.860
 it is either a hunting knife or a knife 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.660
 survival my logical question is how do 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.879
 be with combat knives which are taken on 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.680
 weapons in the army remind us of us 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.480
 talking about the Russian federation of combat knives 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.010
 in the army which is in service 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.680
 count fingers as soon as you shoot 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.719
 armament they fall into categories either 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.090
 survival knives or hunting knives 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.439
 the same goes for army combat knives 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.810
 other states when crossing 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.939
 Russian border, they are classified 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.570
 as survival knives or as knives 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.460
 hunting 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.619
 this is not all because some 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.420
 pass quietly as household 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.280
 your attention to the guys about what we are talking 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.020
 only knives legally sold on 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.430
 the territory of the Russian Federation is not necessary 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.409
 I present now for homemade 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.810
 smuggling type mikrotik jack teams 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.810
 let's start with the definition guide with 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.040
 gostom r500 1215 ira 98 cold weapons 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.729
 Terms and Definitions 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.590
 melee weapon is a weapon constructively 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.390
 intended to hit targets when 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.310
 the aid of human muscular strength i 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.920
 no wonder the intonation highlighted words weapons 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.810
 in order to become a weapon 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.790
 just in fact having let the matter 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.479
 any product must 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.040
 fit 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.259
 very strict parameters which 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.240
 guarantees and confirms this high 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.740
 rank any knife can be used 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.060
 as cold weapons just 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.310
 because knives and cold steel 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.649
 structurally similar but in order to 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.329
 the default knife was considered cold in it 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.400
 all must be present at the same time 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.530
 design features of the cold macaw 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.509
 there should be no constructive 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.350
 features an output item from 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.450
 categories hell 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.430
 please find out the lack of everything 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.860
 one of the required characteristics 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.510
 inherent in melee weapons displays any 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.760
 item from this honorary category 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.470
 now please take your knife and 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.360
 look at it if you have it in your hands 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.710
 Nozhkin fat type and here in the corner there is no 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.480
 active annotations on a separate 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.040
 you can turn off the video 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.940
 this video is because the dagger is off topic 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.160
 a separate conversation 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.280
 and this is in your hands so let's say normal 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.290
 doubtful knife then we start it 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.270
 by the way cold steel thailand 6 inches here 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.080
 someone is surprised but he is not a knife 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.110
 Ken fat type 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.760
 let's start with the banal length of the blade and immediately 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.150
 make a reservation just to be all in 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.940
 course 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.090
 the blade is a long metal 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.700
 combat part of cold weapons with one 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.430
 or with two blades 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.270
 which is part of this band a 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.450
 blade this 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.730
 sharpened edge of the warhead cold 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.010
 weapons which is a rib 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.959
 acute angle conjugation surface 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.060
 conversations are quite permissible to call names 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.530
 blade blade and vice versa but in dry 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.180
 Protocol language is still two 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.800
 big differences primarily take 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.019
 any guest knives and see how 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.670
 measure the length of the blade of the young skate 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.739
 measured from the tip 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.739
 to the limiter in the absence 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.870
 the stop length is measured from the tip 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.000
 to the front end of the sleeve and treated on 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.100
 handles with folding knives 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.930
 non-removable pore a finger is intended 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.090
 for opening the blade the length of the blade 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.980
 determined from the tip he 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.110
 directly stop that is, we take 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.880
 ruler abut and in focus or just 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.310
 start the handle and see how much 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.890
 centimeters you to the edge of the blade 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.900
 draw your attention guys what about length 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.580
 and cutting edge and the length of the blade in 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.250
 normative documents no word 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.739
 everywhere in guests only length is mentioned 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.780
 blade and according to 2 guests 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.459
 mentioned the civilian cold of the blade 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.019
 mom arms on the part of the long blade 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.500
 peremptory hard 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.900
 standard 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.790
 blade length can not be less than 90 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.190
 millimeters i.e. if the length of your 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.290
 blade with correct measurement less than 90 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.810
 at least one millimeter at least 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.239
 per centimeter no matter how much it is 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.889
 interest is not cold steel at the same time 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.389
 absolutely no matter whether you have a folding knife 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.280
 automatically with inertial opening 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:19.139
 or with a fixed blade 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.609
 the magical 90 millimeters outputs from 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.560
 categories of cold weapons absolutely 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.600
 any product 2 principle moment 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.710
 the thickness of the butt for cold 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.630
 civilian bladed weapons 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.120
 set to the next frontier 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.090
 minimum and maximum values ​​of 2.6 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.500
 millimeters and 6 millimeters for many on 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.450
 hearing parameter two point four 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.340
 millimeter explain where it came from 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.660
 the manufacturer focuses on two integers 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.400
 four tenths of a millimeter sake 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.600
 one hundred percent guarantee that the knife is not 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.470
 is a cold weapon 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.880
 for in changing the guest number 516 44-2 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.590
 thousand straight text said 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.990
 knife use tolerance 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.210
 safety handle provided that 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.310
 blade thickness will not exceed 2 4 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.660
 tenths of a millimeter inclusive separately 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.130
 worth noting the thickness of the blade 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.740
 determined by the thickest part 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.330
 shoes 3 hard standard for cold 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.070
 weapons is the hardness of the blade should not 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.330
 be less than forty two threshold units 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.250
 it is clear that you have now 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.930
 measuring device at hand is not present on 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.419
 some tanks are sometimes hard 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.800
 steel specified and again it does not matter if you 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.810
 knife with a fixed blade 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.740
 inertial automatic no 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.630
 if a 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.280
 solid steel less than forty two units 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.620
 vices this automatically means that 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.840
 your knife is not a cold weapon one hundred percent 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.510
 4 hard standard for melee weapons 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.919
 it is a safety handle that is on 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.750
 handles should be mandatory 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.970
 be constructively laid 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.040
 limiter or in case of its absence 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.080
 at least one under the finger groove 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.940
 everyday speech terminator term 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.040
 it is perfectly acceptable to substitute generalized 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.780
 obsolete concepts of guard but dry 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.850
 protocol language it is about 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.470
 limiter the case if the knife 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.930
 there is a limiter he must speak 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.130
 not less than 5 millimeters if 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.440
 limiter 2 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.660
 then they must be at least 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.490
 than 5 millimeters if the knife does not have 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.419
 restrictive but there is a single under 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.980
 finger groove 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:01.260
 its depth must be them 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.510
 not 5 millimeters if under the fingers 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.400
 few grooves they should be each 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:08.010
 not less than four millimeters depth 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.110
 draw your attention guys that having 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.420
 under finger grooves or limiter 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:16.290
 this is not a reason to consider but what percentage 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:18.600
 cold arms but lack of these 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:20.820
 Mandatory Cold Weapon Criteria 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.740
 one hundred percent say that the knife is not 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.960
 cold and another mandatory item 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.300
 for all types of knives blade should be 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.640
 sharpened the site question how to distinguish 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.350
 sharpened the knife from not sharpened can 

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.120
 guided by the guest and you can 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.310
 to be guided by the best 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.290
 human notions according to guest 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.060
 sharpened knife should cut birch 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.220
 branch thickness of 10 12 millimeters 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.350
 humidity about 12 percent 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.570
 5-6 times and at the same time the cut should 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.490
 stay smooth and not scuffed 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.320
 based on common human notions 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.780
 communication experience by security staff 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.940
 law and order sharpened knife i define as 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.980
 the knife which removed the cutting edge
