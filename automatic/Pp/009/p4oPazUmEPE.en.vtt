00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
situation it was a big deal that I was

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.359 
situation it was a big deal that I was
away<00:01:23.460> from<00:01:23.520> my<00:01:23.880> family<00:01:24.470> that<00:01:25.470> they<00:01:25.740> called<00:01:26.100> me

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
away from my family that they called me

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.100 
away from my family that they called me
or<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.939> they<00:01:27.090> told<00:01:27.150> me<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.540> they<00:01:27.780> had<00:01:27.960> these

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
or that they told me that they had these

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.960 
or that they told me that they had these
candles<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:28.920> made<00:01:29.220> arrangements

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
candles in and that I made arrangements

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.520 
candles in and that I made arrangements
to<00:01:30.000> go<00:01:30.240> get<00:01:30.450> them

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
to go get them

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.020 
to go get them
so<00:01:31.860> don't<00:01:32.040> think<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.340> wasn't<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> big<00:01:32.850> deal

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
so don't think it wasn't a big deal

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.710 
so don't think it wasn't a big deal
because<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.540> really<00:01:33.810> was<00:01:34.430> so<00:01:35.430> on<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:36.299> bigger
