00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.020
 hello very good to all that you are 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.730
 I am ministers we are here in a new 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.189
 video and we are in the main event of 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.279
 sting stops me from sacrificing this one 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.840
 more time with my friend and companion alonso 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.789
 to be of guys and this is the 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.320
 fight for the world title erik already a 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.320
 our new champion stops 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.840
 we face magnus once again 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.300
 good is the second time they face 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.339
 for him with the title in play I think and it's 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.180
 good if we count the fort wayne 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:55.620
 arrival 3 of the company does not count 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:59.900
 to this they still say that it is true similar 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:03.120
 to daniel bryan and compare him to someone 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.549
 that he does not care about, 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.620
 they misbehave 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.410
 they are almost equal in number 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.620
 has a lot more journey in what 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.620
 comes 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.750
 they start these diseases like cancer 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.750
 world 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.330
 do not 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.670
 opportunities 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.899
 and yellow in all in all rules a 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.899
 paper champions 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:45.259
 is that the best in all the times read 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:49.399
 that having retained a title of helped 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:51.920
 something and the mix well helps take the 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.840
 first the proof that the help you 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.120
 to be able to show that you do not need help 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.110
 from nobody who swims 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.000
 or else arrive and young and brush it the 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.670
 channel that less everyone except 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.360
 I hoped it was to win the title he picked 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.360
 and he won 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:15.440
 and I like the truth is a style 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:19.780
 comical yes but it's a comical style that 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.780
 mola i like to have me 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.689
 av 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.689
 next to 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.269
 It is what comes this set showing 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.270
 these analysts is a movement 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.010
 personal fixed type 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.200
 n 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.480
 guess 2 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.290
 care care care 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.290

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:02.420
 Attentive to tell, I'll tell you there 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.420

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:13.069
 239 put here below 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.069
 son of a bitch 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.080
 ah 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.180
 not one time 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.350
 no god was already inventing the 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.190
 story was so close to the third 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:38.080
 slap 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.080
 as the Spanish would say 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.790
 it's bullshit 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.460
 alive 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.840
 here we go 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:07.120
 and he will come running I did not know he was 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.120
 here is the most 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.980
 personal movements 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.810
 we find 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.810
 but it's okay 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.430
 or 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.430
 out 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.500
 above 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.509
 the player has to be 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.000
 one 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.690
 two 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:51.420
 three victories for building him 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:54.030
 retains the world liter stops 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:57.900
 there is friends victory for the youth 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.970
 in this main event stop and continue 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.280
 phase but it is useful to all this 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.550
 victory and we'll see each other in the next 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:10.280
