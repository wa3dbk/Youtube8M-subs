 in addition to vehicles coming out of the box 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.080
 I wanted to present in pack and by 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.000
 mark and blow for this first step 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.160
 that I will introduce you three bmw who 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.720
 are really beautiful 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.410
 so just behind me on the right we have 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.320
 a bmw m3 gt2 so a sporty model 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.019
 which is really beautiful then 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.410
 in the middle we have a bmw so solid series 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.989
 7 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.640
 a 7.50 which is a little more model 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.480
 family I will see this vehicle for 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.149
 michael and left we have a bmw so 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.710
 it's a m3 e30 a model that was 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.500
 appreciated at the time because he was 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.969
 really powerful so that's gone we're going 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.010
 go around the vehicles so for 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.010
 see them a little closer there all 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.079
 first we have the bmw m3 gt2 so the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.789
 sports model that is really 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.670
 beautiful look of a hood with 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.039
 several aeration a bumper enough 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.989
 imposing rims that his style and he 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.260
 devote themselves to small vent on 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:12.119
 the on the side of the vehicle when a guy 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:15.330
 said they small buttons maybe 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.030
 for to open the hood so then 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.549
 on the side and if we had vents 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.360
 the spoiler analysis the back that is 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.409
 really not bad 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.360
 frankly it's really a beautiful 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.670
 vehicle the only small negative point 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.350
 look and I think it's here at 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.220
 level of these exhaust pipes I 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.200
 the impression that it's just a sticker 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.119
 who is stuck or what not even no no 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.950
 it's well done by far like this 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.390
 earth diagnosis 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.979
 so I'm going to show you inside the 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.610
 vehicle look frankly it is 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.890
 really not bad 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.110
 I get inside the little steering wheel 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.810
 some local sport buttons it 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.590
 report to the Russians on the steering wheel 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:56.460
 counters the little one in bars and a 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.409
 little badly no passenger seat 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.860
 so it's all weird if we go up 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:05.450
 voices off we're going to look a bit like 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.679
 that a big bucket seats on our side 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.060
 of a big central control with 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.229
 full of pimples in a few weddings and 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.599
 everything in my opinion for cars like 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.989
 it's compex our not so small 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.200
 options 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.900
 there is no driver's seat 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.590
 so if I go up the side there we go 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.819
 be so sure I'll say it may even 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.769
 not mounted rise too well done but in 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.959
 do you ride hop your ass on the 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.450
 nine carboys that are next and not 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.799
 on the driver's seat 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.190
 frankly it's really well done this 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:37.110
 really nice vehicle so then we 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.620
 will go to the bm so the series the one 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:45.630
 which is right here the version 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.750
 family watching a jewel already from 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.709
 the outside she is really beautiful 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.780
 the front also look in small go 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.069
 fire the xenon lights like that we have 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.079
 the impression that we were really well 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.730
 does the grille that is really not 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.799
 wrong 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.239
 her legs of this time series 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.950
 choices are really well done with the 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.650
 outfits watch the inscriptions and 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.829
 towers make first beautiful town hall 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.720
 too much hacker flashing we even have the 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.480
 small fin for gps and cease 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.019
 the rear ride vehicle and that 7 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.209
 50 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.120
 there are the four exhaust pipes to 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:22.049
 the back so it's not a sport model 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.160
 a mayor and long and fat the flap so 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.049
 it's not a sport model it's a 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.370
 family model let's say we're going back 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.739
 an interest frankly interest but 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:33.599
 she is too well done 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:34.740
 oak inside brown here we have wood 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.800
 on the 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:41.160
 on the on the dashboard for 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.450
 remember a little the luxurious model so 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.830
 the retro that is a little bit my does this 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.610
 rhythm the textures inside are 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.030
 a little badly done 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.130
 like here look i'm going out to see 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:55.110
 a little what it gives materials 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.580
 two hours for the sniper to aim for a 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.490
 gear knob a little badly made the 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.810
 central control hurts done we're gonna 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.200
 to say that the inside of it is 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:07.230
 is not really well done but here 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.710
 also recognize as one says to 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.600
 the back so this one literary of 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.980
 ready is not super well done but 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.420
 frankly outside is really 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.390
 beautiful we have the weight increases if who 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:21.630
 alas this option in addition really not 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:24.900
 badly and then we'll finish so on the 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.540
 bmw m3 e30 vocable small enough models 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.940
 old man who has a cross on the front 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.880
 shocks right here i think all the 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.430
 world has ever seen this kind of vehicle 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.810
 frankly I found this model was 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.240
 not bad at the time since he 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.820
 was still powerful enough finally there 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.220
 I go inside the hands on the 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.810
 oc steering wheel inside that is healthy enough 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:50.850
 apart from the concrete steering wheel has been modified 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.020
 the bench at the back a texture is 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.700
 and therefore frankly some matches 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.400
 for the interior but honestly 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.440
 the outside of the vehicles are really 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.390
 gorgeous look so that was 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.200
 stopped there m3u 30 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:06.480
 the series 7 so there 7.50 and the n3 so 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.570
 it's the gp2 frankly it's the sky 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.860
 is really beautiful 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.630
 so your comments do not hesitate to 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.230
 tell us which of these vehicles you have 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.780
 the most 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.200
 I have a little 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:20.900
 he finds that this one dallas gt2 is 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.820
 really beautiful in sport i'm going 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.650
 do a little trick with at the level of 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.880
 performance comes back that has been changed 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.510
 so it's like you want it 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.060
 sentinel 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.020
 finally even power there even the same 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.090
 characteristics 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.530
 it's just the aesthetic has been changed 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.720
 to make it a real bomb 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.100
 frankly she is really beautiful 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.330
 and so we come to the end of 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.560
 this video I really hope small 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.630
 presentation will have pleased you 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.650
 do not hesitate to drop a ti more blue 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.780
 it will be really fun 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.580
 I wanted it is on these pictures you 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.730
 already all games edges and already all the 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.730
 world
