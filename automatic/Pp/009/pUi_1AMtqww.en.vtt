which<00:01:56.370> looked<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.700> lot<00:01:56.820> more<00:01:56.880> mysterious<00:01:57.360> than

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
which looked a lot more mysterious than

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.360 
which looked a lot more mysterious than
other<00:01:57.810> ones<00:01:58.050> but<00:01:58.440> rather<00:01:58.680> than<00:01:58.860> only<00:01:58.980> taking<00:01:59.310> a

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
other ones but rather than only taking a

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.950 
other ones but rather than only taking a
bite<00:01:59.520> out<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.790> few<00:01:59.970> of<00:02:00.060> these<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.420> decided<00:02:00.810> to

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
bite out of a few of these I decided to

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.810 
bite out of a few of these I decided to
see<00:02:01.140> how<00:02:01.170> nasty<00:02:01.830> Stephanie's<00:02:02.220> choices<00:02:02.610> really

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.180 
see how nasty Stephanie's choices really
are<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.330> try<00:02:03.930> all<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.200> them<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:04.890> guess<00:02:05.070> I'm

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
are and try all of them so I guess I'm

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.230 
are and try all of them so I guess I'm
just<00:02:05.280> going<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.490> start<00:02:05.700> off<00:02:05.820> with<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.060> can

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240
