blend it I'm not using a mixer today I'm

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.610 
blend it I'm not using a mixer today I'm
squeezing<00:00:50.870> in<00:00:51.140> my<00:00:51.260> spoon<00:00:52.190> here<00:00:53.290> cuz<00:00:54.290> it<00:00:54.440> gets

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
squeezing in my spoon here cuz it gets

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.710 
squeezing in my spoon here cuz it gets
noisy<00:00:55.119> so<00:00:56.119> you're<00:00:56.239> gonna<00:00:56.360> blend<00:00:56.600> this

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
noisy so you're gonna blend this

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.479 
noisy so you're gonna blend this
together<00:00:56.930> ideally<00:00:57.890> if<00:00:57.949> you<00:00:58.010> have<00:00:58.190> a<00:00:58.220> blender

your egg to this mixture now stevia is a
little<00:01:16.250> bit<00:01:16.399> has<00:01:17.180> a<00:01:17.210> little<00:01:17.539> bit<00:01:17.659> concerned

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
little bit has a little bit concerned

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.300 
little bit has a little bit concerned
consistency<00:01:19.039> than<00:01:19.359> then<00:01:20.359> regular<00:01:20.899> sugar<00:01:21.799> it's

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
consistency than then regular sugar it's

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.370 
consistency than then regular sugar it's
a<00:01:22.460> little<00:01:22.700> it<00:01:22.880> just<00:01:23.030> won't<00:01:23.600> give<00:01:23.810> you<00:01:23.899> quite<00:01:24.170> as

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
a little it just won't give you quite as

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.020 
a little it just won't give you quite as
creamy<00:01:24.740> of<00:01:24.950> a<00:01:25.039> texture<00:01:25.429> it's<00:01:25.579> a<00:01:25.609> little<00:01:25.880> bit

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
creamy of a texture it's a little bit

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.200 
creamy of a texture it's a little bit
more<00:01:26.210> challenging<00:01:26.840> to<00:01:26.899> blend<00:01:27.350> so<00:01:28.280> be<00:01:28.609> patient

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
more challenging to blend so be patient

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.630 
more challenging to blend so be patient
but<00:01:29.450> it<00:01:29.659> will<00:01:29.810> work<00:01:30.189> so<00:01:31.189> we're<00:01:31.280> gonna<00:01:31.369> blend

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
but it will work so we're gonna blend

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.380 
but it will work so we're gonna blend
that<00:01:31.789> up<00:01:32.140> now<00:01:33.520> normally<00:01:34.520> with<00:01:34.700> ginger<00:01:35.030> cookies

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
that up now normally with ginger cookies

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.010 
that up now normally with ginger cookies
you<00:01:35.780> want<00:01:35.899> molasses<00:01:36.679> but<00:01:37.460> molasses<00:01:38.359> is<00:01:38.600> very

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
you want molasses but molasses is very

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.569 
you want molasses but molasses is very
very<00:01:39.259> high<00:01:39.469> in<00:01:39.530> carbs<00:01:40.009> and<00:01:40.189> very<00:01:40.369> high<00:01:40.520> in

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
very high in carbs and very high in

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.999 
very high in carbs and very high in
sugar<00:01:40.909> so<00:01:41.570> we<00:01:41.600> don't<00:01:42.020> want<00:01:42.200> that<00:01:42.380> instead

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
sugar so we don't want that instead

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:44.679

agave<00:01:55.490> nectar<00:01:55.850> to<00:01:56.359> substitute<00:01:57.109> in<00:01:57.350> for<00:01:57.380> my

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
agave nectar to substitute in for my

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.599 
agave nectar to substitute in for my
molasses<00:01:58.869> and<00:01:59.869> what<00:02:00.439> that<00:02:00.619> does<00:02:00.859> is<00:02:01.280> it<00:02:01.429> not

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:01.609 
molasses and what that does is it not

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:03.940 
molasses and what that does is it not
only<00:02:01.819> adds<00:02:02.240> moisture<00:02:02.630> back<00:02:03.139> into<00:02:03.499> the<00:02:03.619> cookie

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
only adds moisture back into the cookie

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.739 
only adds moisture back into the cookie
because<00:02:04.549> you've<00:02:04.700> taken<00:02:04.909> it<00:02:05.149> out<00:02:05.299> with<00:02:05.509> a<00:02:05.539> lot

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:05.749 
because you've taken it out with a lot

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:07.179 
because you've taken it out with a lot
of<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.929> sugar<00:02:06.170> because<00:02:06.409> sugar<00:02:06.439> holds<00:02:07.009> in<00:02:07.100> the

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
of the sugar because sugar holds in the

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.219 
of the sugar because sugar holds in the
moisture<00:02:07.219> so<00:02:08.210> you're<00:02:08.390> adding<00:02:08.539> this<00:02:08.780> back<00:02:09.020> in

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
moisture so you're adding this back in

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.910 
moisture so you're adding this back in
and<00:02:10.720> you're<00:02:11.720> adding<00:02:11.870> a<00:02:12.049> little<00:02:12.680> bit<00:02:12.830> of

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
and you're adding a little bit of

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.030 
and you're adding a little bit of
sweetness<00:02:13.840> ok<00:02:14.840> so<00:02:15.260> we've<00:02:15.409> got<00:02:15.440> that<00:02:15.709> now<00:02:15.920> we're

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
sweetness ok so we've got that now we're

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.770 
sweetness ok so we've got that now we're
gonna<00:02:16.159> add<00:02:16.400> our<00:02:16.700> flour<00:02:17.060> and

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
gonna add our flour and

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.680 
gonna add our flour and
here's<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.560> trick<00:02:18.800> know<00:02:19.580> I<00:02:19.820> know<00:02:20.000> that<00:02:20.180> most

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
here's the trick know I know that most

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.780 
here's the trick know I know that most
of<00:02:20.960> the<00:02:21.080> times<00:02:21.350> you<00:02:21.620> when<00:02:22.160> you're<00:02:22.280> doing

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
of the times you when you're doing

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.660 
of the times you when you're doing
ginger<00:02:23.300> cookies<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:23.990> use<00:02:24.260> white<00:02:24.560> flour<00:02:24.860> but

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
ginger cookies you use white flour but

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.250 
ginger cookies you use white flour but
when<00:02:26.030> you<00:02:26.150> have<00:02:26.330> diabetes<00:02:26.570> you<00:02:26.900> want<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.170> be

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
when you have diabetes you want to be

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.870 
when you have diabetes you want to be
very<00:02:27.530> clear<00:02:28.040> that<00:02:28.370> you're<00:02:28.490> getting<00:02:28.670> more

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
very clear that you're getting more

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.960 
very clear that you're getting more
fiber<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:30.080> more<00:02:30.260> fiber<00:02:30.500> you<00:02:30.710> have<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:31.550> the

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
fiber the more fiber you have the the

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.230 
fiber the more fiber you have the the
lower<00:02:32.210> the<00:02:33.110> speed<00:02:33.410> of<00:02:33.590> your<00:02:33.800> blood<00:02:34.220> sugar<00:02:34.459> from

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
lower the speed of your blood sugar from

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.880 
lower the speed of your blood sugar from
the<00:02:35.420> flour<00:02:35.630> will<00:02:35.959> be<00:02:36.050> absorbed<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:36.680> it<00:02:36.800> will

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
the flour will be absorbed so it will

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.890 
the flour will be absorbed so it will
slow<00:02:37.160> down<00:02:37.190> absorption<00:02:37.880> and<00:02:38.240> ultimately<00:02:38.570> slow

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
slow down absorption and ultimately slow

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.650 
slow down absorption and ultimately slow
down<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:40.310> rise<00:02:40.520> in<00:02:40.730> your<00:02:40.820> blood<00:02:41.060> sugar<00:02:41.300> so

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
down the rise in your blood sugar so

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.570 
down the rise in your blood sugar so
we're<00:02:41.959> gonna<00:02:42.050> use<00:02:42.140> a<00:02:42.350> combination<00:02:42.770> of<00:02:43.220> whole

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
we're gonna use a combination of whole

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.600 
we're gonna use a combination of whole
wheat<00:02:43.700> flour<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:44.209> white<00:02:44.330> flour<00:02:44.630> I<00:02:45.459> don't<00:02:46.459> use

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
wheat flour and white flour I don't use

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.140 
wheat flour and white flour I don't use
just<00:02:46.880> whole<00:02:47.090> wheat<00:02:47.270> flour<00:02:47.300> because<00:02:48.940> they<00:02:49.940> can

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
just whole wheat flour because they can

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.350 
just whole wheat flour because they can
tend<00:02:50.450> to<00:02:50.600> be<00:02:50.720> not<00:02:51.050> quite<00:02:51.290> as<00:02:51.500> tender<00:02:52.330> but<00:02:53.330> I

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
tend to be not quite as tender but I

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.510 
tend to be not quite as tender but I
like<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:53.840> do<00:02:53.989> a<00:02:54.020> mixture<00:02:54.590> a<00:02:54.709> combination<00:02:55.400> of

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
like to do a mixture a combination of

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.040 
like to do a mixture a combination of
half<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:55.910> half<00:02:55.940> so<00:02:56.330> you<00:02:56.450> mix<00:02:56.660> that<00:02:56.870> together

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
half and half so you mix that together

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.479 
half and half so you mix that together
