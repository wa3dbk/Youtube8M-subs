00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
famas became one of those weapons that a

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.430 
famas became one of those weapons that a
lot<00:03:53.450> of<00:03:53.540> people<00:03:53.720> didn't<00:03:53.930> really<00:03:54.080> want<00:03:54.260> to<00:03:54.320> use

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
lot of people didn't really want to use

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.630 
lot of people didn't really want to use
since<00:03:54.950> it<00:03:55.010> was<00:03:55.130> a<00:03:55.220> little<00:03:55.340> bit<00:03:55.490> more

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
since it was a little bit more

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.580 
since it was a little bit more
unpredictable<00:03:56.060> and<00:03:56.540> a<00:03:56.810> little<00:03:57.020> harder<00:03:57.230> to<00:03:57.380> use

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
unpredictable and a little harder to use

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.700 
unpredictable and a little harder to use
at<00:03:57.770> a<00:03:57.830> distance<00:03:59.110> so<00:04:00.110> which<00:04:00.260> one<00:04:00.470> of<00:04:00.500> these<00:04:00.650> two

at a distance so which one of these two
weapons<00:04:01.280> is<00:04:01.460> the<00:04:01.790> better<00:04:02.000> famas<00:04:02.540> which<00:04:02.840> one<00:04:03.110> of

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
weapons is the better famas which one of

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.960 
than the other maybe just in the way
that<00:04:12.500> it<00:04:12.620> feels<00:04:12.830> in<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.100> way<00:04:13.190> that<00:04:13.310> you<00:04:13.370> use<00:04:13.730> it

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
that it feels in the way that you use it

interesting to see some of these answers

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:23.369 
interesting to see some of these answers
and<00:04:20.249> the<00:04:21.249> winner<00:04:21.459> is<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:22.210> famas<00:04:22.629> for<00:04:23.050> modern

00:04:23.369 --> 00:04:23.379 
and the winner is the famas for modern

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:26.100 
and the winner is the famas for modern
warfare<00:04:23.650> 2<00:04:24.129> now<00:04:24.999> the<00:04:25.389> both<00:04:25.629> of<00:04:25.780> these<00:04:25.870> guns

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
warfare 2 now the both of these guns

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.719 
warfare 2 now the both of these guns
would<00:04:26.349> have<00:04:26.439> been<00:04:26.590> considered<00:04:26.770> a<00:04:27.129> draw<00:04:27.430> if<00:04:27.580> it

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
would have been considered a draw if it

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.489 
would have been considered a draw if it
wasn't<00:04:28.029> for<00:04:28.180> the<00:04:28.240> patch<00:04:28.479> that<00:04:28.719> work<00:04:29.050> put<00:04:29.319> on

00:04:29.489 --> 00:04:29.499 
wasn't for the patch that work put on

00:04:34.619 --> 00:04:34.629 
the famas from black ops really wasn't

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:35.550 
the famas from black ops really wasn't
something<00:04:34.840> that<00:04:34.960> you<00:04:35.110> could<00:04:35.229> directly

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
something that you could directly

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.140 
something that you could directly
compete<00:04:35.949> with<00:04:36.099> the<00:04:36.279> width<00:04:36.490> of<00:04:36.610> a<00:04:36.729> month's<00:04:36.999> from

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
modern warfare 2 although it had very

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.369 
modern warfare 2 although it had very
high<00:04:39.580> rate<00:04:39.939> of<00:04:39.969> fire<00:04:40.090> it<00:04:40.539> had<00:04:40.689> that<00:04:40.870> really<00:04:41.110> imp

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:41.379 
high rate of fire it had that really imp

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:43.709 
high rate of fire it had that really imp
unpredictable<00:04:42.189> recoil<00:04:42.729> and<00:04:42.969> it<00:04:43.360> was<00:04:43.449> just<00:04:43.629> a

00:04:43.709 --> 00:04:43.719 
unpredictable recoil and it was just a

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:44.939 
unpredictable recoil and it was just a
weapon<00:04:43.990> that<00:04:44.020> a<00:04:44.169> lot<00:04:44.319> of<00:04:44.349> people<00:04:44.439> didn't<00:04:44.800> want

weapon that a lot of people didn't want

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539

to use unlike the modern warfare 2
version<00:04:46.990> which<00:04:47.499> was<00:04:47.529> a<00:04:47.770> one<00:04:48.129> shot<00:04:48.430> burst

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
version which was a one shot burst

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:50.610 
version which was a one shot burst
weapon<00:04:49.120> and<00:04:49.360> if<00:04:49.629> you<00:04:49.719> were<00:04:49.840> using<00:04:50.020> stopping

weapon and if you were using stopping

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.050 
weapon and if you were using stopping
power<00:04:50.770> with<00:04:51.069> it<00:04:51.249> which<00:04:51.370> a<00:04:51.490> lot<00:04:51.639> of<00:04:51.669> people<00:04:51.789> were

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
power with it which a lot of people were

power with it which a lot of people were
using<00:04:52.300> it<00:04:52.900> was<00:04:53.080> a<00:04:53.289> one<00:04:53.529> shot<00:04:53.740> burst<00:04:53.979> at<00:04:54.250> any

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
using it was a one shot burst at any

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.269 
using it was a one shot burst at any
range<00:04:54.789> that<00:04:55.719> is<00:04:55.870> why<00:04:56.020> the<00:04:56.080> modern<00:04:56.860> warfare<00:04:56.949> 2

00:04:57.269 --> 00:04:57.279 
range that is why the modern warfare 2

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:59.399 
range that is why the modern warfare 2
version<00:04:57.610> of<00:04:57.699> the<00:04:57.789> famas<00:04:58.090> is<00:04:58.330> a<00:04:58.360> winner<00:04:58.689> anyways
