00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.279
 the formulas of physics seem complicated but Professor ernani swears 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.990
 who does not and to end this myth he uses sports to explain the 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.299
 matter but has darkened 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:18.430
 the three-point pitch gained another dimension with the throw the ball 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.940
 took effect day 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.550
 for the ball 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.359
 velocity 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.369
 take a rest 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.099
 with the time of 9 seconds 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.000
 58 cents 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.430
 the usain bolt jamaican hit a world record in the 100 meter race 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.520
 but what would be the speed of the athlete during the race 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.560
 required an average of our average 37 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.560
 54 at least for now 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.440
 the athlete platform prepares to swim 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.230
 you can start a series of combinations until it reaches your 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.840
 objective the company prepared for the place we have in course 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.130
 the goalkeeper 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.980
 we have the federation 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.570
 but the reason 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.990
 obviously he began to lose his care 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.820
 after the movement of the swimming it goes 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.180
 breaking the resistance 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.870
 already in the long jump I think she only honorable mention with 45 degrees 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.160
 the reach of March 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.020
 if we defeat the goiÃ¡s won with the beginning of the year 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.310
 not to distance yourself 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.620
 to the point that he did not score 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.750
 scenario 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.310
 we need a big newspaper 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.210
 also 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.420
 the longest distance 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.380
 they said we have to go 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.170
 we will miss the little more by high but not so much the high cost made a 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.340
 good teacher does not know which course said willing to start or not in physics 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.140
 every action force generates a reaction 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.500
 let's take as a simple example the walk when that happens ps 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.280
 reacts by pushing floor back as floor pushed forward if this 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.660
 it would not happen we would be immobile the more we run in the case of athletics 

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:12.809
 knowing the laws of physics the performance of athletes in competitions 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:17.819
 can suffer a significant improvement in the greater awareness of the 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.709
 professionals connected to the sport 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.400
 want to be physically in this day to day he could study 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.980
 increases the performance of each athlete with certainty the result will be homosexual 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.859
 covered only one year when a white player 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:34.369
 well stretched in the world cup of 94 against the netherlands 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:39.349
 besides beautiful is decisive for the brazilian competition sequence 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.579
 up to the achievement of the four-time champion he is also an example of how fishing 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.479
 was important at that moment 

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:49.019
 you kick that position 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.469
 I publish here 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:53.239
 How does the ball begin to move? 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.549
 started here is smaller than the one with three points 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:02.510
 instead of the straight line to start being pushed score now Roberto already 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.059
 You know 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:05.499
 that fishing can help in the sport 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:06.440
 and even 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.060
 in his trajectory as a player
