00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:12.589
 the symphony number 6 of mahler e Ã¨ 

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:14.340
 nicknamed the tragic because tragic 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:16.560
 first of all 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.230
 has a peculiarity that distinguishes it from 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.650
 all other mahler symphonies 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:25.950
 It ends in a minor key all 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.430
 mahler symphonies are characterized 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.520
 from a labor to a deepening 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:36.660
 of the darkest feelings of the soul 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.540
 human but at the end of each symphony yes 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.290
 he sees a light in the sixth one 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.790
 what is not there and the final e 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.550
 continues to be the minor that is not 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.309
 he sees not even light or hope 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.559
 I like a higher shade 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.149
 bring it closer to what is the ending 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.750
 of the pathetic chajkowskij 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.910
 both entrust this ending to 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.570
 the most serious part of the orchestra are the strings 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:07.700
 low have one last small fragment 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.700
 of you but desolate 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:26.930
 followed by a very strong agreement and the 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:32.450
 less than the whole orchestra and then the 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:37.910
 arcs end the symphony with the sixth 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:41.000
 Mahler's symphony begins with a bass 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.940
 stubborn from the first bars on 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.330
 score if the score of who plays 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:52.630
 first lines there is written cheerful 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:56.570
 strong energetic strenghtened and 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:02.330
 always up on every beat 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:05.479
 there is an accent like how to scan 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.740
 inexorably time and tragedy 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.280
 of what is about to happen 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:18.739
 the beginning is entrusted to the serious arches of the 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:22.070
 of the orchestra that they then enter 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:27.920
 all the bows with the accent is another 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:30.820
 at 100 and then another accent and then 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.820
 finally the theme 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.879
 this is a dazzling start that 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:42.049
 then it will be all that is 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.049
 land development
