00:00:01.063 --> 00:00:03.573
 Pedophiles are really tough people. 

00:00:03.573 --> 00:00:07.343
 They like to annoy the kids, that's crazy. 

00:00:07.343 --> 00:00:10.303
 It's their favorite thing. 

00:00:10.303 --> 00:00:14.563
 I mean, it's crazy if you take the risk of being a pedophile. 

00:00:14.563 --> 00:00:17.854
 Not to mention the damage you do, but the risk ... 

00:00:17.854 --> 00:00:23.884
 You can't be worse than a pedophile. 

00:00:23.884 --> 00:00:26.204
 But they do it anyway. 

00:00:26.204 --> 00:00:31.653
 From which we can conclude that it must be really great. 

00:00:31.653 --> 00:00:37.403
 From their point of view. Not from ours. But from theirs. 

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:40.034
 It must be amazing. 

00:00:40.034 --> 00:00:43.084
 They risk so much ... 

00:00:44.314 --> 00:00:48.005
 Is that joke offensive? 

00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:50.124
 Some people think so. 

00:00:50.124 --> 00:00:53.824
 What if they look at the victims? Or what if the victims' parents are watching? 

00:00:53.824 --> 00:00:57.006
 It's such a perverted thing that happens to people, 

00:00:57.006 --> 00:01:00.734
 and I know the comics are trying to push the boundaries 

00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:03.187
 and sometimes they risk, sometimes the risk doesn't work out 

00:01:03.187 --> 00:01:07.287
 but I think something like rape is not funny 

00:01:07.287 --> 00:01:10.855
 and he is smart enough to come up with something else. 

00:01:10.855 --> 00:01:14.944
 What do we really ask when we ask a question 

00:01:14.944 --> 00:01:19.155
 Whether the joke, tweet or picture is offensive? 

00:01:19.155 --> 00:01:22.725
 We don't ask if he insulted someone, did he? 

00:01:22.725 --> 00:01:27.125
 No. We ask if what he said was morally correct. 

00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:28.405
 How can anyone decide? 

00:01:28.405 --> 00:01:32.436
 How do we know if a joke is morally wrong? 

00:01:32.436 --> 00:01:35.847
 I don't think this is just going anywhere. 

00:01:35.847 --> 00:01:39.108
 I know someone who was raped in three years, in three years! 

00:01:39.108 --> 00:01:40.748
 There's nothing funny about it. 

00:01:40.748 --> 00:01:46.348
 No club, people shouldn't be kidding. 

00:01:46.348 --> 00:01:50.065
 This woman thinks it's a joke effect 

00:01:50.065 --> 00:01:53.778
 because rape of children is such a sensitive subject. 

00:01:53.778 --> 00:01:57.093
 Because the suffering is so terrible and long lasting, 

00:01:57.093 --> 00:02:01.506
 and so a joke on this subject can suffer as a shrink 

00:02:01.506 --> 00:02:03.649
 on the contrary, bring it back. 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:09.269
 The theme of rape of children should be completely avoided. 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.056
 This is certainly a good argument. 

00:02:12.056 --> 00:02:15.908
 It cannot be the goal of comedy to cause suffering to victims. 

00:02:15.908 --> 00:02:21.016
 But that was definitely not Louis's goal. 

00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:22.720
 It wasn't his intention. 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.320
 It's all about one thing: about intent. It's just a purpose. 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.890
 In this performance, Ricky Gervais questions the desire to be moral 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.419
 the joke judge, and instead suggests that we pay attention primarily to the comic of the intent. 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:42.118
 Louis's intention was to use comedy to make us think 

00:02:42.118 --> 00:02:45.991
 the approach of society to the topic and treatment of pedophilia. 

00:02:45.991 --> 00:02:51.400
 Maybe it suggests that we are not addressing this issue, 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.451
 we are comforting our normality, even though we know the complex sexual desires 

00:02:55.451 --> 00:02:59.262
 pedophiles are not their own choice. 

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:03.222
 They never forgive them, nor do they advocate their act. 

00:03:03.222 --> 00:03:06.712
 It goes without saying that the rape of a child should follow 

00:03:06.712 --> 00:03:09.232
 the greatest contempt and retribution. 

00:03:09.232 --> 00:03:14.012
 I think this was the intention and many people thought about ours 

00:03:14.012 --> 00:03:18.863
 smug accusations of own grandeur and fear of impunity for sexuality 

00:03:18.863 --> 00:03:20.423
 in a civilized society. 

00:03:20.423 --> 00:03:25.052
 Jokes are really well designed to deliver such messages. 

00:03:25.052 --> 00:03:29.163
 They get us into the subconscious and break the barriers that make us different 

00:03:29.163 --> 00:03:32.662
 it prevents thinking about the threat to our comfort. 

00:03:32.662 --> 00:03:38.094
 I have to say that I totally disagree with Ricky when he says that it is up to the intention. 

00:03:38.094 --> 00:03:39.484
 Apparently not. 

00:03:39.484 --> 00:03:43.314
 We must be aware of both intended and unintended 

00:03:43.314 --> 00:03:45.904
 consequences of what we say. 

00:03:45.904 --> 00:03:50.654
 We know too often people with privileges define the boundaries of morality, 

00:03:50.654 --> 00:03:54.704
 without thinking about the different experiences of people 

00:03:54.704 --> 00:03:58.364
 who have been subjected by others, are thrown to the edge of society or worse. 

00:03:58.364 --> 00:04:02.875
 These discussions about political correctness and comedy began to occur more often 

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:06.215
 with the advent of the Internet that gives people the opportunity to express themselves. 

00:04:06.215 --> 00:04:11.615
 I am always amazed at how easy it is to divide the arguments into two camps. 

00:04:11.615 --> 00:04:14.385
 One side comes up with concern about the joke, 

00:04:14.385 --> 00:04:17.605
 and the other will defend the joke at any cost, 

00:04:17.605 --> 00:04:21.206
 scold at the never-ending penetration of internet police 

00:04:21.206 --> 00:04:24.006
 and fighters for social justice into freedom of speech. 

00:04:24.006 --> 00:04:28.556
 They just want to use words like racism, sexism or prejudice 

00:04:28.556 --> 00:04:30.276
 but they don't even know what they're talking about. 

00:04:30.276 --> 00:04:34.195
 All this tells me that morality is chaotic. 

00:04:34.195 --> 00:04:35.756
 Shifts and changes. 

00:04:35.756 --> 00:04:38.626
 People often say that something has already been on the line 

00:04:38.626 --> 00:04:41.137
 but there are no lines in morality. 

00:04:41.137 --> 00:04:47.127
 It's a land of no one, a hazy edge of really difficult questions. 

00:04:47.127 --> 00:04:51.017
 I can see that great comedians are like detectives. 

00:04:51.017 --> 00:04:54.857
 Look at Luther or any other criminal 

00:04:54.857 --> 00:04:56.997
 And you will see it as a company 

00:04:56.997 --> 00:05:02.768
 we do not mind when detectives sometimes bend rules for greater good. 

00:05:02.768 --> 00:05:07.908
 This is because we understand that justice is, like morality, abstract. 

00:05:07.908 --> 00:05:11.718
 Detectives are trained to move on the edge of justice 

00:05:11.718 --> 00:05:14.158
 and we allow them to do so. 

00:05:14.158 --> 00:05:19.049
 I think we should let our great comedians move 

00:05:19.049 --> 00:05:20.649
 on the edge of morality. 

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:24.229
 I don't know how society decides who can move there and who doesn't. 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.249
 There is no easy answer. 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:29.959
 I think that when a comedian is admitted to professional high circles, 

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:31.929
 somehow we know it. 

00:05:31.929 --> 00:05:34.839
 Of course I know how unsatisfactory this answer is. 

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:39.369
 We can all look at the purpose of the joke, their effect, 

00:05:39.369 --> 00:05:41.069
 whether we laugh or not. 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:47.780
 But if we want to allow our morality to evolve, we must leave it 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:55.890
 comedians move close to things that are unpleasant to us or seem bad to us.
