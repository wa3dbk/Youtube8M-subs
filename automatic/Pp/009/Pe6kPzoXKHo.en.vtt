it is of the Sennheiser MX 116 which
these<00:00:26.900> headphones<00:00:27.110> here<00:00:27.470> and<00:00:27.680> he<00:00:27.980> was<00:00:28.099> the<00:00:28.160> Box

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
these headphones here and he was the Box

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.780 
these headphones here and he was the Box
um<00:00:29.029> so<00:00:29.960> I<00:00:29.989> originally<00:00:30.590> got<00:00:30.710> this<00:00:31.009> these

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
um so I originally got this these

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.540 
um so I originally got this these
headphones<00:00:32.029> to<00:00:32.870> replace<00:00:33.829> my<00:00:34.040> iPod<00:00:34.399> headphones

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
headphones to replace my iPod headphones

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.880 
headphones to replace my iPod headphones
because<00:00:35.210> my<00:00:35.809> iPod<00:00:36.170> headphones<00:00:36.290> really

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
because my iPod headphones really

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.529 
because my iPod headphones really
weren't<00:00:37.100> giving<00:00:37.820> the<00:00:37.940> performance<00:00:38.360> that<00:00:38.420> I

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:38.539 
weren't giving the performance that I

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:40.779 
weren't giving the performance that I
really<00:00:38.780> wanted<00:00:39.050> out<00:00:39.200> of<00:00:39.289> them<00:00:39.410> so<00:00:39.620> um<00:00:40.430> I<00:00:40.579> got

00:00:40.779 --> 00:00:40.789 
really wanted out of them so um I got

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.119 
really wanted out of them so um I got
these<00:00:41.000> for<00:00:41.329> about<00:00:41.450> 16<00:00:42.050> Swiss<00:00:42.289> francs<00:00:42.739> which<00:00:42.950> is

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
these for about 16 Swiss francs which is

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.899 
these for about 16 Swiss francs which is
about<00:00:43.309> fourteen<00:00:44.089> dollars<00:00:44.300> and<00:00:44.949> um<00:00:45.949> I<00:00:46.429> didn't

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:46.909 
about fourteen dollars and um I didn't

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:48.759 
about fourteen dollars and um I didn't
really<00:00:47.089> expect<00:00:47.329> too<00:00:47.539> much<00:00:47.690> of<00:00:47.749> them<00:00:48.079> but<00:00:48.379> I<00:00:48.409> saw

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
really expect too much of them but I saw

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:51.340 
really expect too much of them but I saw
what<00:00:48.980> they<00:00:49.070> had<00:00:49.249> here<00:00:50.019> powerful<00:00:51.019> written<00:00:51.289> on

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
what they had here powerful written on

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.200 
what they had here powerful written on
them<00:00:51.499> I'm<00:00:51.679> not<00:00:51.829> like<00:00:52.100> I<00:00:52.219> judge<00:00:52.579> it<00:00:52.609> by<00:00:53.179> its

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
them I'm not like I judge it by its

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.630 
them I'm not like I judge it by its
books<00:00:53.780> but<00:00:54.050> it<00:00:54.769> is<00:00:54.920> sounded<00:00:55.190> pretty<00:00:55.280> good<00:00:55.519> to

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
books but it is sounded pretty good to

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.000 
books but it is sounded pretty good to
me<00:00:55.760> and<00:00:55.969> um<00:00:56.329> I<00:00:57.019> decided<00:00:57.140> to<00:00:57.469> go<00:00:57.530> and<00:00:57.620> buy<00:00:57.739> them

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
me and um I decided to go and buy them

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.739 
me and um I decided to go and buy them
and<00:00:58.190> my<00:00:58.370> first<00:00:58.640> impression<00:00:59.120> is<00:00:59.239> that<00:00:59.539> these

00:00:59.739 --> 00:00:59.749 
and my first impression is that these

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:03.669 
and my first impression is that these
are<00:01:00.019> very<00:01:00.319> very<00:01:01.249> powerful<00:01:01.399> headphones<00:01:02.679> maybe

00:01:03.669 --> 00:01:03.679 
are very very powerful headphones maybe

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:05.710 
are very very powerful headphones maybe
as<00:01:03.949> you<00:01:04.070> know<00:01:04.220> that<00:01:04.699> Apple<00:01:05.089> have<00:01:05.210> put<00:01:05.420> a

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
as you know that Apple have put a

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.950 
as you know that Apple have put a
restriction<00:01:06.110> on<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:06.710> iPod<00:01:07.159> volume<00:01:07.580> and<00:01:07.960> with

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
restriction on the iPod volume and with

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.660 
restriction on the iPod volume and with
these<00:01:09.170> headphones<00:01:09.590> you<00:01:09.890> can<00:01:09.920> hardly<00:01:10.220> notice<00:01:10.280> I

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
these headphones you can hardly notice I

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.700 
these headphones you can hardly notice I
mean<00:01:10.909> these<00:01:11.060> are<00:01:11.360> very<00:01:11.720> very<00:01:12.080> loud<00:01:12.380> they're

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
mean these are very very loud they're

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.920 
mean these are very very loud they're
very<00:01:12.920> powerful<00:01:13.130> as<00:01:13.490> well<00:01:13.720> one<00:01:14.720> of<00:01:14.840> the

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
very powerful as well one of the

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.480 
very powerful as well one of the
Annoying<00:01:15.350> bits<00:01:15.530> is<00:01:15.710> of<00:01:15.950> course<00:01:16.160> it's<00:01:16.310> very

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
Annoying bits is of course it's very

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.220 
Annoying bits is of course it's very
cheap<00:01:16.670> is<00:01:16.880> that<00:01:17.030> it<00:01:17.150> gets<00:01:17.300> tangled<00:01:17.810> very

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230 
cheap is that it gets tangled very

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.830 
cheap is that it gets tangled very
easily<00:01:18.470> as<00:01:18.710> you<00:01:18.740> can<00:01:18.860> you<00:01:19.100> tell<00:01:19.280> so<00:01:20.120> they

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
easily as you can you tell so they

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.270 
easily as you can you tell so they
definitely<00:01:21.020> not<00:01:21.350> tangle<00:01:21.770> free<00:01:21.800> that<00:01:22.190> is

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
definitely not tangle free that is

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.130 
definitely not tangle free that is
deathly<00:01:22.760> one<00:01:22.940> of<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:23.090> downsides<00:01:23.660> but<00:01:23.870> I

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
deathly one of the downsides but I

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.220 
deathly one of the downsides but I
really<00:01:25.010> don't<00:01:25.850> mind<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:26.300> price<00:01:26.450> that<00:01:26.690> I<00:01:26.720> paid

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.230 
really don't mind the price that I paid

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.560 
really don't mind the price that I paid
here<00:01:27.980> we<00:01:28.670> have<00:01:28.880> an<00:01:29.090> l-shaped<00:01:31.000> headphone<00:01:32.000> jack

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
here we have an l-shaped headphone jack

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.850 
here we have an l-shaped headphone jack
in<00:01:32.870> and<00:01:33.640> it's<00:01:34.640> really<00:01:34.940> a<00:01:35.390> great<00:01:35.990> dice<00:01:36.560> el

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
in and it's really a great dice el

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.310 
in and it's really a great dice el
because<00:01:37.340> I<00:01:37.660> really<00:01:38.660> don't<00:01:38.810> like<00:01:38.900> a<00:01:38.960> straight

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
because I really don't like a straight

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.400 
because I really don't like a straight
ones<00:01:39.560> since<00:01:40.130> he<00:01:40.970> mess<00:01:41.270> up<00:01:41.450> even<00:01:41.630> when<00:01:42.140> I<00:01:42.170> have

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
ones since he mess up even when I have

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.870 
ones since he mess up even when I have
them<00:01:42.590> in<00:01:42.800> my<00:01:43.370> pocket

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
them in my pocket

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.710 
them in my pocket
so<00:01:44.420> um<00:01:44.810> I<00:01:45.110> reason<00:01:45.860> have<00:01:45.980> the<00:01:46.100> box<00:01:46.280> here<00:01:46.610> is<00:01:46.850> to

so um I reason have the box here is to

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.720 
so um I reason have the box here is to
show<00:01:47.900> you<00:01:47.960> I'm<00:01:48.770> not<00:01:48.950> sure<00:01:49.070> if<00:01:49.130> you<00:01:49.190> can<00:01:49.310> see<00:01:49.550> or

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
not here we have all the technical data

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.760 
not here we have all the technical data
which<00:01:53.360> I<00:01:53.690> really<00:01:54.110> don't<00:01:54.200> know<00:01:54.320> about<00:01:54.440> but<00:01:54.740> the

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.180 
which I really don't know about but the
sound<00:01:55.010> pressure<00:01:55.130> level<00:01:55.490> is<00:01:55.610> 109<00:01:56.210> decibel<00:01:56.690> um

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
sound pressure level is 109 decibel um

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.170 
sound pressure level is 109 decibel um
and<00:01:58.190> it's<00:01:58.970> it<00:01:59.570> seems<00:01:59.870> really<00:02:00.320> good<00:02:00.470> now<00:02:01.190> I'm
