the answer to that one question in a
word<00:01:45.260> is<00:01:45.730> impressive<00:01:46.730> the<00:01:47.030> car<00:01:47.240> feels<00:01:47.480> much

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
word is impressive the car feels much

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.630 
word is impressive the car feels much
faster<00:01:47.900> than<00:01:48.590> its<00:01:48.740> 200<00:01:49.130> horsepower<00:01:49.340> would

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
faster than its 200 horsepower would

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.370 
faster than its 200 horsepower would
suggest<00:01:49.850> and<00:01:50.540> a<00:01:50.600> lot<00:01:50.750> of<00:01:50.840> that<00:01:50.930> has<00:01:51.020> to<00:01:51.050> do<00:01:51.290> with

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
suggest and a lot of that has to do with

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.440 
suggest and a lot of that has to do with
the<00:01:51.470> fact<00:01:51.620> that<00:01:51.710> has<00:01:51.890> a<00:01:51.920> 2700<00:01:52.760> pound<00:01:52.940> weight

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
the fact that has a 2700 pound weight

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.450 
the fact that has a 2700 pound weight
really<00:01:54.050> really<00:01:54.410> light<00:01:54.620> it<00:01:55.010> actually<00:01:55.190> feels

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
really really light it actually feels

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.980 
really really light it actually feels
really<00:01:55.640> great<00:01:55.970> coming<00:01:56.240> out<00:01:56.300> of<00:01:56.390> corners<00:01:56.720> too

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
really great coming out of corners too

down and further back so the center of
gravity<00:02:11.600> is<00:02:12.080> excellent<00:02:12.650> as<00:02:12.740> is<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.370> balance

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
gravity is excellent as is the balance

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.820 
gravity is excellent as is the balance

vehicle well Toyota got it just right

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.740 
vehicle well Toyota got it just right
it's<00:02:18.740> an<00:02:18.950> amazingly<00:02:19.430> balanced<00:02:20.060> vehicle<00:02:20.570> and

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
it's an amazingly balanced vehicle and

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.540 
it's an amazingly balanced vehicle and
you<00:02:20.959> can<00:02:21.110> really<00:02:21.470> operate<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.130> by<00:02:22.220> driving

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
you can really operate it by driving

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.640 
you can really operate it by driving
with<00:02:22.850> a<00:02:22.880> rear<00:02:23.240> end<00:02:23.450> which<00:02:23.720> is<00:02:23.840> a<00:02:24.050> lot<00:02:24.320> of<00:02:24.350> fun
