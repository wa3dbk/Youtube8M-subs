start off with our sugar and our butter

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.549 
start off with our sugar and our butter
the<00:00:33.329> butter<00:00:33.480> really<00:00:33.840> does<00:00:34.020> have<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.200> be<00:00:34.290> room

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
the butter really does have to be room

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.660 
the butter really does have to be room
temperature<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:35.010> do<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.430> can<00:00:35.550> always

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
temperature to do this you can always

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.400 
temperature to do this you can always
soften<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.329> microwave<00:00:36.719> if<00:00:36.960> you've<00:00:37.140> got

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
soften it in the microwave if you've got

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.590 
soften it in the microwave if you've got
it<00:00:37.530> too<00:00:37.829> hard<00:00:38.070> we'll<00:00:38.520> put<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:38.940> our<00:00:39.030> flavor<00:00:39.300> so

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
it too hard we'll put in our flavor so

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.030 
it too hard we'll put in our flavor so
this<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.809> lemon<00:00:40.020> shortbread<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.860> will<00:00:40.950> get

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
this is lemon shortbread and it will get

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.889 
this is lemon shortbread and it will get
better<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.280> better<00:00:41.340> as<00:00:41.520> we<00:00:41.579> go<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.660> zest

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
better and better as we go so the zest

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.080 
better and better as we go so the zest
of<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.559> lemon<00:00:43.700> there<00:00:44.700> we<00:00:44.760> go

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
of a lemon there we go

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.670 
of a lemon there we go
and<00:00:45.360> then<00:00:45.450> we<00:00:45.539> fold<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:45.930> two<00:00:46.170> different<00:00:46.469> types

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
and then we fold in two different types

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.290 
and then we fold in two different types
of<00:00:46.829> flour<00:00:47.160> when<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.399> say<00:00:47.579> fold<00:00:47.850> it's<00:00:48.059> really

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
of flour when I say fold it's really

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.729 
of flour when I say fold it's really
just<00:00:48.450> beating<00:00:48.750> all<00:00:48.870> together<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.320> our<00:00:49.350> plain

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
just beating all together so our plain

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.430 
just beating all together so our plain
flour<00:00:50.039> goes<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.969> there<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.510> then<00:00:51.899> our<00:00:52.020> corn

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
flour goes in there and then our corn

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.529 
flour goes in there and then our corn
flour<00:00:52.770> as<00:00:52.980> well<00:00:53.010> at<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.309> same<00:00:53.579> time<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.449> what

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
flour as well at the same time and what

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.060 
flour as well at the same time and what
that<00:00:54.660> does<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.320> two<00:00:55.530> different<00:00:55.649> acts<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.949> flour

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
that does is two different acts of flour

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.500 
that does is two different acts of flour
takes<00:00:56.309> all<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.640> moisture<00:00:56.760> out<00:00:56.969> it's<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.300> really

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
takes all the moisture out it's a really

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.720 
takes all the moisture out it's a really
crumbly<00:00:57.960> dry<00:00:58.260> shortbread<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.160> little<00:00:59.579> bit<00:00:59.670> of

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
crumbly dry shortbread a little bit of

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.299 
crumbly dry shortbread a little bit of
elbow<00:00:59.910> grease<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.449> will<00:01:00.539> start<00:01:00.750> to

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
elbow grease and that will start to

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.130 
elbow grease and that will start to
loosen<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.520> up<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.449> eventually<00:01:03.750> come

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
loosen it up so that eventually come

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.719 
loosen it up so that eventually come
together<00:01:04.320> into<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.830> paste<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.580> meantime

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
together into a paste in the meantime

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.940 
together into a paste in the meantime
I'll<00:01:06.060> show<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.390> our<00:01:06.630> tin<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.500> it's<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.650> 20

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
I'll show you our tin so it's a 20

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.679 
I'll show you our tin so it's a 20
centimeter<00:01:08.430> by<00:01:08.520> 20<00:01:08.880> centimeter<00:01:09.390> square

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
centimeter by 20 centimeter square

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.300 
centimeter by 20 centimeter square
baking<00:01:09.900> tin<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.590> all<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:10.979> just<00:01:11.010> line

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
baking tin and all of that is just line

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.920 
baking tin and all of that is just line
digging<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.610> bit<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.790> greaseproof<00:01:12.000> paper<00:01:12.150> and

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
digging a bit of greaseproof paper and

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:13.910 
digging a bit of greaseproof paper and
actually<00:01:13.200> if<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.320> could<00:01:13.380> just<00:01:13.560> take<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> little

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
actually if I could just take a little

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.130 
actually if I could just take a little
bit<00:01:14.100> out<00:01:14.340> there<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.330> kind<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.869> squeeze

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
bit out there and just kind of squeeze

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.100 
bit out there and just kind of squeeze
it<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.320> there<00:01:17.090> that<00:01:18.090> just<00:01:18.270> enables<00:01:18.930> this

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
it in there that just enables this

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.359 
it in there that just enables this
grease<00:01:19.320> proof<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.770> kind<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.009> stick<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
grease proof to kind of stick to the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.330 
grease proof to kind of stick to the
bottom<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.479> doesn't<00:01:21.720> move<00:01:21.840> later<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.409> and

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
bottom so it doesn't move later on and

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.770 
bottom so it doesn't move later on and
now<00:01:23.549> that's<00:01:23.790> together<00:01:24.090> if<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.299> put<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> whole

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
now that's together if you put a whole

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.840 
now that's together if you put a whole
lot<00:01:25.080> into<00:01:25.470> there<00:01:25.650> yep<00:01:28.189> and<00:01:29.189> then<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.640> best

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
lot into there yep and then the best

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.429 
lot into there yep and then the best
thing<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.090> do<00:01:30.329> if<00:01:30.450> I'm<00:01:30.570> honest<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> little

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
thing to do if I'm honest is a little

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.980 
thing to do if I'm honest is a little
bit<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.650> wet<00:01:31.829> finger<00:01:32.369> okay<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.090> just<00:01:33.390> dampen

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
bit of wet finger okay so just dampen
