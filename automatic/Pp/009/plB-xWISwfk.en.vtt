00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.070
 nice all guys because with this 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.389
 sorry new video if I talk a little 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.770
 looks like a strange voice but I have a sore throat 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.439
 today clearly a time of shit a 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.699
 rome anyway the kids today finally 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.000
 back with a nice video of 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.230
 buying and selling today I will explain how 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.650
 various buying and selling with the players 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.929
 bronze to all those we say have 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.090
 little time to apply to do 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.059
 only pop company 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.010
 so let's say I'll explain a method where 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.899
 you do n't need to rely on 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.360
 players and aspects of waiting for 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.940
 win the auction then resell it see the 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.140
 player happened case de quo that is that 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.690
 rocco to trade as a game 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.980
 rich and silver and bronze players 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.329
 sorry and I recommend first of all 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.270
 make a player from barclays 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.210
 then there are also other championships where 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.190
 you can do like for example the series a 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.369
 there are few players but anyway 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.479
 there I believe Brazil or other oars are 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.490
 good enough for buying and selling 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.880
 meanwhile here they have suffered a player 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.270
 good for the sale of bronze vi 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.159
 I say you wo n't have to wait for that 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.259
 win the auction because you use it 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.689
 mainly the buy now on this 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.659
 method even if sometimes you could 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.100
 also we Italian what the fuck I do 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.100
 you could even peck not good 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.740
 offered by a lot to be able to bid 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.970
 which then sell it more anyway 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.710
 this is a great player because a lot 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.850
 people really just when his 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.500
 price is quite high 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.299
 then you can see that its price and 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:51.090
 2009 2005 2009 let's say it could 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.530
 take this 2005 and this from 2000 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.290
 with want to vote have been put 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.430
 auction really just then yet 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.549
 pisa of nobody 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.439
 we buy them and then we will raise them to 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.619
 2009 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.820
 obviously how to see is very fast 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.399
 let's say I call it the kind of 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.690
 price correction maybe those that 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.580
 put 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.160
 to the players axis to so little because 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.380
 they have little time or various things 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.910
 we do this hermitage balance mo 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.620
 all the prices that are a little busted 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.090
 downward 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.430
 sorry we are a bit then the heirs that me 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.500
 has made quite a few teams on which 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.990
 I will make scud burida only of the 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.100
 great teams 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:33.990
 now let's see some modules a plexus 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.580
 put an hour because I have this time 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.130
 800 boys this is the mind a 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.390
 Offerton few guys Most 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.740
 sometimes they are earned around 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.010
 1000 credits for each player then 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.560
 really very good and I recommend you 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.260
 to put these players up for sale 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.000
 for a day especially those who 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.920
 they have little time maybe already for some time 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.060
 put them an hour but still recommend 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.740
 mental to one day because these 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.810
 bronze players 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:01.050
 let's say it takes a while before 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.250
 that someone purchases then we turn 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.320
 page or other parenthesis of this 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.140
 method there are many who put fat 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.800
 very very tall and guys for example 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.560
 here if there had been type three 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.209
 players at 4300 and this at 2007 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.030
 some might say is very good 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.500
 take this and put it 4300 m in 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.030
 not really because maybe it's someone who 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.950
 is paying presstv yes but for sure 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.360
 so it doesn't work because you always have to 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.130
 adjust with the prices of others 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.920
 forms to be given in ways that bring 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.650
 players around 2000 2005 this 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.110
 with this module you can't put it 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.880
 2000 mainly from 4000 because not 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.310
 I'll never buy it from anyone seeing that 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.040
 the 4 2 2 module change does not cost a 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.380
 football and therefore the price remains low a 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.060
 player while the only form where the 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.709
 price rises sharply is made not 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.980
 they see two where players are 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:52.500
 always very short we must see 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.560
 turn around all the modules as you can see 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.940
 I turning three modules or already earned 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.510
 around 5000 injured 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.510
 As this has put at 2,500 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.790
 if you have time maybe I recommend 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.319
 put them at 1 hour and if no one was 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.099
 buy lowered people put them on 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.900
 for a day then we'll go and look 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:18.130
 any other player and competitor 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:20.739
 we will find at the moment we see a good one 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.280
 that this obeng really happens to us 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:27.699
 very good right- back of the swansea 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:30.580
 sit down and foreign slam sites 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:33.220
 where you think 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.570
 I recommend going to see the 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.130
 donkeys don't go to see so mentioned 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.190
 the 3 of course because they are only three 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.510
 central we finally need boys 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.780
 make some sales videos 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.900
 sorry for a time where I didn't 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:50.729
 but because we say I preferred a little 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:55.300
 play or I had a lot to study 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:57.550
 2000 1400 1200 this in my opinion yes 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.229
 can use 2000 because the 4 12 square 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.120
 really very tall and that was it 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:05.020
 put on average recently and that means 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.789
 which has just been put and is 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.960
 likely that the price is wrong 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:12.280
 now here obviously earns very good 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.070
 guys I can assure you this 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.289
 method really fruit me but me 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.340
 i'm falling in love with bronze players 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:20.620
 I also did this with i 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.210
 silver players I noticed more 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.919
 earning is lower than those 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.070
 bronze because there is a little more than 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:28.120
 competition is therefore easier than the 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.180
 price players you can't go 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:34.360
 put on sale if you lower someone 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.220
 put it type 500 degrees of minus one thousand e 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.310
 a thousand pounds less could this be 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:43.660
 raise 2000 but I prefer not to do it for 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:47.229
 we risk not sell them 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:49.000
 here 1500 1000 1200 this could 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:50.169
 just stay there at 1500 at this 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.500
 2002 2005 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:54.159
 I'm poor getting out in another 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.229
 earn 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:59.310
 also because 4 3 1 2 is not a module it is 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:59.310
 not a bad form 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.720
 1500 right guys if you have any 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:11.190
 idea for a new series of the less 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.660
 because I want to do quite a lot of series of 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.210
 themes don't buy sell by gameplay 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:18.990
 whatever you want I am ready to 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:20.910
 do it even if we count that if precisely 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.210
 as said in turn engaged rosi 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:26.640
 as a kid from 16 to 23 it will no longer be 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:29.280
 available on youtube because I go to 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.590
 so cruise with the school will be 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:35.100
 busy tension here gain nie 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:37.320
 double gain is towards strange in a 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:41.970
 purchased cooked 23 cock should 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:45.630
 be tall let's take me and 31 2008 for 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:49.950
 don't risk it if I call it yours 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:53.250
 maybe let's turn down a guys I think 

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:56.160
 I hope that often method is clear to 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:58.710
 all hope would have explained 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.510
 correct way that it is so much a milan 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:03.419
 some message arrives on whatsapp goes

 as you see here I put it up for sale 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:11.100
 all these here calculated that the 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.450
 gain of each player about the 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.330
 1,000 customers 

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:19.440

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:20.760
