00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:16.379
 as usual that happy because 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.240
 yes this because we are fruit on top 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.460
 of the costs with the fruit markets 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.820
 they are going to take over the eye mother universe 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.890
 because we are here in a race the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.269
 which is called the pantoja ladder 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.769
 then justica going really well the truth 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.600
 ok eye so far is a bit strange 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.550
 because it's because we have here first 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.950
 a kind of ladder yahyá yahyá 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.809
 yahyá and vale has seen I have a career 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.300
 who wants a platform and once 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.469
 that we see here now we have to fall 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:49.610
 towards here today he heard this is going to be very 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.610
 difficult is this is going to be very complicated 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.110
 he told us I think he includes the dough 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.760
 first flipa chat I think it's the chop 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.190
 and I do not know for sure but uribe yeah well the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.870
 case is complicated but neither is it so 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.550
 long therefore I think we could 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.230
 I also get it with so much I do not know 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.210
 why but I feel safer 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.940
 eye do not fall nobody heard the 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.340
 braking and incredible 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.770
 I do not shit on your father god I served him 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.170
 that big brake man 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.700
 he sticks with me has stopped with my 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.560
 car they know then in the end has not been 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.060
 I stuck yes but good nothing happens 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.430
 karma will make it all insecure the alder 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.350
 boy place is here I did not think anything is worth 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.340
 eye eye because that actually with the 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.720
 so much the good thing that it has is so 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.510
 little one who is here we can push 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.950
 us back to the ramp and it 's more 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.890
 close to the stairway of death 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.880
 for me to hit the pei that the 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.450
 boy I think that from the moment of clovis 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.740
 affair 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.410
 I just saw how caught the point a 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.880
 uncle if I have not seen bad things that the 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.230
 It's true that I have a little touch 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.370
 godmothers that is I do not know why he threw me 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.570
 with valid in the middle the truth but 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:53.790
 well ok let's go anything 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:02:01.170
 both eyes eyes full love 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:02.900
 we do not get it very little because there is a 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.400
 bunch of little rocks 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:13.600
 and on top is super delivered here 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:15.010
 come on now yes there we are going to 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.030
 always try to fall before lateral form 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.690
 ok I hit it mega but do not go to 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.120
 difficult guys is complicated this 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.410
 ladders is not the most divided 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.670
 that tasted you already know dare to try 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.730
 some that were super ultra hyper those 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.850
 big and super difficult but good the 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:39.160
 case is that I think we can pass 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:41.230
 worth nothing to balance the car for 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.630
 that does not deviate to any side my 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.010
 wanted so much to see sir bread all 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.640
 you have to try not to double 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.190
 Collating win worth we are going to eat 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.300
 acid against the damn gas canister 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.150
 it's complicated the boy is complicated that 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.500
 say it's complicated but but what 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.250
 we will get it I know that in the future what 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.660
 we will get guys we will be like this 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.680
 thank you and now we have passed and 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.090
 perfect perfect because we see that we have 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.890
 perfect is very good ok ok ok 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.959
 guys and now here we are going to 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.450
 finalize what I have clear we are going to do 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.560
 so there is nothing more wrong but good 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.320
 but well because we are being very 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:22.660
 straight 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:24.400
 no longer not what sorry guy had it in the 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.800
 point look I had it next to you as 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.269
 own already I ask the point thing I did not know 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.690
 the point but you catch it to the point or 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.340
 true 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.080
 to see I do not ask the point literally 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.000
 but he catches the race point 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.360
 case how are we going to do it well then look 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.920
 it's about slowly giving increases and 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.030
 jump over and it does not fit like 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.160
 is locked to see try to jump 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.519
 a mega trancas and with the gas cylinder 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.519
 uncle 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:57.340
 or we are going down well have 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.810
 finished people and how they do it 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.760
 I'm telling you true, I'm telling you 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.490
 respectability we have lowered God the law 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:07.390
 and now here the face itself to come down pretty 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:11.980
 straight guys and make a good jump ay ay 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:14.400
 oh and there it is I have it is already there 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.400
 we're 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:20.380
 the key will be not to explode but I will 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.680
 little madryn lad the bread touches cahuates 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.030
 and what do you say 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.910
 there is a point that I have not caught what point 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.680
 What point 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.960
 you have already seen how the bread fell all of 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.400
 rhythms does not explode audio in addition to both 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.440
 for the peanut let's call it is a 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.610
 now there are guys well all 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.710
 Past uncle it seems that it was very difficult 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.840
 very impossible but finally we have 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.330
 finished with a lot of money, so we are going to 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.560
 come not here and we're going to finish the 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.440
 race as it is due 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.440
 here with the jump this looks let's go 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.970
 because it 's a trunk of my car 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.040
 amazing 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.310
 well they are this checkpoint 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.230
 We have 10 missing 7 and now basically 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.240
 what I would miss to see eye this is going to 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.740
 being complicated is up the but 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.320
 I think we can get it effective at 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.670
 to the booklet lad my mother project what 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.500
 handsome this to cure this team less 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:17.230
 a couple of many I want to 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.230
 calculations of how many molans to the eye eye 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:31.760
 both peanuts pipes and all terrain 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:35.230
 of legitimate power to bread tanda for 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.230
 put it in adjective that in the end 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.960
 this is more than done I have the car 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.960
 done shit but it does not matter if 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.600
 catch the goal that's the important thing 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.180
 the state of the car gives exactly the same 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:50.730
 ok but you're left with a dry hedge 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.090
 I shit on your father and balladeer here 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.540
 right 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:56.520
 and this is more than fact that this 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.810
 I am here when there is a parking lot 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.580
 It's a shame that this game really 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.580
 I say it the party has arrived 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.040
 goodbye
