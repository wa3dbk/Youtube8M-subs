00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
knees before I don't get to go to local

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.479 
knees before I don't get to go to local
so<00:00:54.320> I<00:00:54.380> don't<00:00:54.530> get<00:00:54.590> to<00:00:54.710> pick<00:00:54.800> a<00:00:54.860> lot<00:00:55.070> of<00:00:55.190> these<00:00:55.280> up

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
so I don't get to pick a lot of these up

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
guess the vendor didn't really care and

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.150 
guess the vendor didn't really care and
since<00:01:01.309> uh<00:01:02.000> he<00:01:02.360> didn't<00:01:02.780> um<00:01:03.110> you<00:01:03.590> know<00:01:03.650> I<00:01:03.860> guess<00:01:04.040> I

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
since uh he didn't um you know I guess I

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
since uh he didn't um you know I guess I
don't<00:01:04.280> either<00:01:04.430> and<00:01:04.550> I'm<00:01:04.729> gonna<00:01:04.820> open<00:01:04.970> these
