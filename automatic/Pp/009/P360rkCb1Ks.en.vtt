00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.569
 hi to all youtube friends welcome 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.310
 in this new video as usual here 

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:07.589
 alessia today I am very happy with 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.150
 present you a fantastic initiative of 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.190
 an italian developer I'm talking about 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.990
 by roberto mazzone that I decided to 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.389
 make a guide for all 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.010
 aspiring programmers this guide is 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.560
 fully compatible with the latest 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.120
 xcode version and it's really well done 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.280
 and we're going to analyze, I'll show you 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.110
 a little preview and we're going to see 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.550
 obviously the features 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.020
 obviously we are on the official website 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.000
 of the developer has precisely 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.960
 of the author of the guide we go to 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.199
 read a little bit 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.690
 feature of this guide 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:39.359
 we can read that inside the 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.760
 guide you will find quite a bit of tutorial 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:43.859
 appropriately subdivided if I was not 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.620
 there are twenty chapters so we are 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:48.210
 talking about 54 boys pages so it is 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.699
 definitely a well done guide 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.859
 whereas these are some 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.620
 practical tutorials so then we'll see 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:58.440
 from the first chapter we will start a 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.390
 schedule applications starting 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.300
 from the classical segis but is the world 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.640
 boys but as the races chapters 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.790
 the tutorials obviously go on 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.570
 they will become more and more we can say 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.670
 complex then slowly 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.020
 we will begin to lean on this world 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.410
 and thank you so much profit of 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.790
 this small space to thank 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.950
 obviously the author of this book e 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.190
 Roberto nation I am really grateful 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.630
 because I don't know how many I think 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.900
 of users who follow me know 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.860
 very well that I was also starting 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.500
 trying to approach me precisely at 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.240
 programming world but unfortunately 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.740
 in the easy because with the last 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.590
 disc version have changed quite a bit 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.050
 of things so this guide really is 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.730
 perfect thanks a lot roberto let's go 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.460
 come on let's read some more 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.690
 a very characteristic feature 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.740
 important that I appreciated 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.450
 lot 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.400
 or that practically everything comes 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.100
 explained step by step with the people 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.360
 of image useful tips after 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.740
 read the book you certainly can't 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.570
 consider the programmers experts 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.020
 these or two boys 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.460
 anyway 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.229
 let's say this guide serves only for 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.869
 introduce the appunteremo 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.420
 programming to make us understand something 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.849
 more but I think it is not enough I hope 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.670
 I hope roberto later there 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.019
 delight with some other guide but 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.790
 anyway yes we will go on we will have 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.730
 definitely gained an overview on 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.709
 xcode I always tell myself why I too 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.470
 I am personally involved 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.959
 since as I told you before I am 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.950
 approaching programming 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.110
 great guys let's go ahead let's go 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.920
 to see a preview of this by 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.650
 this fantastic guide learns to 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.510
 program apps for iphone ipad 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.310
 and ipod touch 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.959
 obviously in order to use these 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.420
 guardians this seems to me enough 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.989
 discounted you must have xcode which is 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.970
 downloadable for free from the app store 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.880
 maximum this is the first page and there is 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.319
 the introduction with introduction to 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.030
 guide and we also have the pil of the 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.970
 first chapter on the right 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.750
 it's 6 pm thanks will allow towards 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.180
 called the timetable 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.850
 as you can see, it really already appears 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.590
 very very important very beautiful 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.200
 the fact is that the theory is immediately 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.209
 the practice is immediately flanked 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.069
 obviously the introduction of images 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:16.480
 in the guide will surely allow us to 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:18.970
 move more easily in precisely in 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.380
 various steps that we will follow with 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.030
 you want to see everything is explained step 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.260
 step we have an explanation of all the 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.060
 codes we're going to write 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.630
 manually demo insert manually into 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.549
 xcode we also have notes to be able to 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.530
 just better understand what we are 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.239
 doing 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.590
 as you can also see though in 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.959
 approximate manner certainly in 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.340
 this first guide because now I will go 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.239
 go ahead but stop me at the first chapter 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.900
 not to show you too much 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.609
 we have explained everything step by step 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.419
 as mentioned before it is a question of 54 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:53.889
 pages 1 therefore are twenty chapters 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:55.569
 I repeat I have to stop more boys 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:57.760
 I don't want to say too much vi 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.069
 I assure you I've got to browse already 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.980
 to test I sell tutorials are 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.569
 they work great apart from that but 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.060
 surely I'm having fun too 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.370
 so much in following these guides 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.410
 so guys the price of the guide is 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.020
 of 3 euros and 50 which as he says so 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:17.260
 same author of a figure more than anything else 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.639
 we can define it as symbolic as they can 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.200
 say important at the level of bonuses 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.680
 gratification precisely for the author 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.750
 same 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.180
 so in my opinion you guys are right 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.300
 I recommend buying this one 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.220
 this guide because it is really a lot 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.080
 important but I think that anyway 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.060
 whether for whom all the colors of all 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.860
 Mac owners need to search 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.400
 obviously to approach this 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:42.010
 world because surely yes it can 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.780
 learn a lot and you could eventually 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.639
 carry out work 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.740
 however the boys find the link 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.210
 of the book in the inscriptions available 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.150
 in two pdf format versions a format 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.830
 compatible for ebook 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.380
 if I'm not mistaken, you decide to buy it 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.910
 which version to download from s all 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.630
 find link to the description at 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.630
 next guys
