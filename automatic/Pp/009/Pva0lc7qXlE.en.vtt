00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.190 

when<00:00:00.299> weaving<00:00:01.230> in<00:00:01.319> loose<00:00:01.530> ends<00:00:02.929> you<00:00:03.929> know<00:00:04.020> you

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
when weaving in loose ends you know you

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.960 
when weaving in loose ends you know you
thread<00:00:04.670> the<00:00:05.670> yarn<00:00:05.790> on<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.240> needle<00:00:06.710> and

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:07.970 
thread the yarn on to the needle and

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.860 
thread the yarn on to the needle and
then<00:00:08.970> you<00:00:09.360> don't<00:00:09.599> want<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:09.900> just<00:00:10.080> go<00:00:10.429> up

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
then you don't want to just go up

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.200 
then you don't want to just go up
through<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.929> row<00:00:13.230> stitches<00:00:13.740> like<00:00:13.860> so<00:00:14.210> because

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
through a row stitches like so because

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.890 
through a row stitches like so because
then<00:00:15.389> as<00:00:15.599> you<00:00:15.960> move<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:17.600> one<00:00:18.600> over<00:00:18.660> the

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
then as you move the one over the

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.570 
then as you move the one over the
garment<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.320> around<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:19.890> might<00:00:20.100> come<00:00:20.279> undone

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
garment is around it might come undone

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.029 
garment is around it might come undone
so<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.359> actually<00:00:21.570> like<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.960> go<00:00:22.109> along<00:00:22.859> the

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
so I actually like to go along the

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.790 
so I actually like to go along the
diagonal<00:00:23.699> so<00:00:24.359> from<00:00:24.539> where<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.840> yarn<00:00:25.019> starts<00:00:25.560> I

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
diagonal so from where the yarn starts I

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.240 
diagonal so from where the yarn starts I
go<00:00:26.730> through<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.180> stitch<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.900> then<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.800> kind<00:00:29.160> of

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
go through a stitch and then I kind of

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.110 
go through a stitch and then I kind of
go<00:00:29.490> through<00:00:29.960> go<00:00:30.960> up<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.619> fabric<00:00:32.369> going

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
go through go up the fabric going

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.420 
go through go up the fabric going
through<00:00:33.510> these<00:00:33.719> stitches<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.260> are<00:00:34.320> on<00:00:34.530> this

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
through these stitches that are on this

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.450 
through these stitches that are on this
diagonal<00:00:36.059> once<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:36.989> can<00:00:37.110> see<00:00:37.230> here<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:38.040> I

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
diagonal once you can see here and I

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.970 
diagonal once you can see here and I
will<00:00:38.640> then<00:00:38.730> pull<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.239> yarn<00:00:39.390> through<00:00:42.890> you<00:00:43.890> know

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
will then pull the yarn through you know

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.400 
will then pull the yarn through you know
and<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.730> can<00:00:44.850> see<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.510> cannot<00:00:45.840> see<00:00:46.200> that

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
and you can see that you cannot see that

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.819 
and you can see that you cannot see that
at<00:00:46.620> all<00:00:46.800> on<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.039> right<00:00:47.190> side<00:00:48.410> so<00:00:49.410> turning<00:00:49.649> it

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
at all on the right side so turning it

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.979 
at all on the right side so turning it
over<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.820> know<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:50.940> just<00:00:51.300> brought<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
over you know I just brought the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.840 
over you know I just brought the
stitches<00:00:52.469> through<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.370> diagonal<00:00:53.820> right

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
stitches through this diagonal right

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.740 
stitches through this diagonal right
here<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.539> I'm<00:00:55.079> now<00:00:55.260> going<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.590> go<00:00:55.739> back<00:00:56.460> up<00:00:56.750> the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
here and I'm now going to go back up the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.590 
here and I'm now going to go back up the
other<00:00:57.780> direction<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.469> kind<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:59.070> zigzag

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
other direction in kind of a zigzag

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.119 
other direction in kind of a zigzag
manner<00:01:01.609> so<00:01:02.609> as<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.879> see<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.359> put<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:04.129> needle

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
manner so as you see I put the needle

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.960 
manner so as you see I put the needle
through<00:01:06.080> these<00:01:07.159> diagonal<00:01:08.159> stitches<00:01:08.580> on<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
through these diagonal stitches on the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.340 
through these diagonal stitches on the
row<00:01:09.229> then<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.320> pulled<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.770> yarn<00:01:10.950> through<00:01:11.420> and<00:01:12.420> I

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
row then I pulled the yarn through and I

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.960 
row then I pulled the yarn through and I
tend<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.680> do<00:01:13.799> this<00:01:13.920> for<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.189> while<00:01:14.430> because<00:01:14.760> if

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
tend to do this for a while because if

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.539 
tend to do this for a while because if
you<00:01:15.090> have<00:01:15.330> your<00:01:15.600> end<00:01:15.830> be<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.860> little<00:01:17.100> too<00:01:17.250> short

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
you have your end be a little too short

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.090 
you have your end be a little too short
it<00:01:17.850> can<00:01:18.270> unravel<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.500> can<00:01:19.770> cause

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
it can unravel and that can cause

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.270 
it can unravel and that can cause
problems<00:01:20.460> for<00:01:21.000> your<00:01:21.090> work<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:22.259> again<00:01:22.500> I'll<00:01:23.070> go

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
problems for your work so again I'll go

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.850 
problems for your work so again I'll go
back<00:01:23.310> up<00:01:24.530> through<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.830> diagonal<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:27.860> pull

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
back up through the diagonal and pull

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.429 
back up through the diagonal and pull
through<00:01:31.220> and<00:01:32.509> again<00:01:33.509> before<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.900> cut<00:01:34.200> yarn

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
through and again before I cut yarn

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.109 
through and again before I cut yarn
which<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:35.009> don't<00:01:35.130> even<00:01:35.280> have<00:01:35.460> scissors<00:01:35.670> handy<00:01:35.909> I

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
which I don't even have scissors handy I

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.030 
which I don't even have scissors handy I
like<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.509> pull<00:01:37.700> on<00:01:38.930> my<00:01:39.930> swatch<00:01:40.500> or<00:01:40.740> would<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.920> at

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
like to pull on my swatch or would it at

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.190 
like to pull on my swatch or would it at
whatever<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.939> make<00:01:41.970> sure<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.360> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
whatever it is to make sure that the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.590 
whatever it is to make sure that the
yarn<00:01:43.409> isn't<00:01:43.649> going<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.829> pull<00:01:43.950> out<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.570> what<00:01:45.570> I

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
yarn isn't going to pull out and what I

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.789 
yarn isn't going to pull out and what I
have<00:01:45.930> here<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.439> nice<00:01:47.119> zigzag<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.619> Aran<00:01:49.619> woven

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
have here is a nice zigzag of Aran woven

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.569 
have here is a nice zigzag of Aran woven
through<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.790> cannot<00:01:51.090> tell<00:01:51.420> at<00:01:51.600> all<00:01:52.579> now

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
through and you cannot tell at all now

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.389 
through and you cannot tell at all now
when<00:01:53.759> I'm<00:01:54.060> dealing<00:01:54.299> with<00:01:54.540> two<00:01:54.750> colors<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.560> like

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
when I'm dealing with two colors I like

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.039 
when I'm dealing with two colors I like
to<00:01:57.000> weave<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:58.020> color<00:01:58.290> within<00:01:58.860> its<00:01:59.280> own<00:02:00.049> color

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
to weave in a color within its own color

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.709 
to weave in a color within its own color
but<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.649> can<00:02:01.969> you<00:02:02.969> know<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.090> could<00:02:03.329> weave<00:02:03.509> this

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
but you can you know I could weave this

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.139 
but you can you know I could weave this
purple<00:02:04.079> in<00:02:04.200> with<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.530> blue<00:02:04.740> but<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.729> wouldn't

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
purple in with the blue but I wouldn't

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.460 
purple in with the blue but I wouldn't
want<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.799> risk<00:02:08.000> having<00:02:10.129> it<00:02:11.129> show<00:02:11.430> through

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
want to risk having it show through

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.810 
want to risk having it show through
so<00:02:12.770> again<00:02:13.040> I<00:02:13.340> am<00:02:13.880> going<00:02:14.330> through<00:02:14.360> a<00:02:15.820> diagonal

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
so again I am going through a diagonal

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.090 
so again I am going through a diagonal
and<00:02:17.000> in<00:02:17.090> this<00:02:17.210> time<00:02:17.450> I'm<00:02:17.930> going<00:02:18.350> down<00:02:18.530> a<00:02:18.770> lot

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
and in this time I'm going down a lot

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.430 
and in this time I'm going down a lot
further<00:02:19.400> than<00:02:19.660> four<00:02:20.660> stitches<00:02:20.930> I<00:02:21.170> guess<00:02:21.320> I've

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
further than four stitches I guess I've

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.330 
further than four stitches I guess I've
got<00:02:21.590> six<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.250> I<00:02:23.150> will<00:02:23.480> pull<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:23.810> through<00:02:24.170> and

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.130 

then<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.610> will<00:02:28.910> go<00:02:29.060> back<00:02:29.090> up<00:02:29.950> making<00:02:30.950> a<00:02:31.130> V<00:02:32.140> when

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
then I will go back up making a V when

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.710 
then I will go back up making a V when
you<00:02:33.230> have<00:02:33.380> many<00:02:33.620> many<00:02:33.860> ends<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.910> weave<00:02:35.030> in<00:02:35.270> you

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
you have many many ends to weave in you

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.240 
you have many many ends to weave in you
will<00:02:35.990> have<00:02:38.410> some<00:02:39.410> ends<00:02:39.740> that<00:02:39.890> might<00:02:40.040> go

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
will have some ends that might go

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.900 
will have some ends that might go
through<00:02:40.550> some<00:02:40.730> of<00:02:40.820> the<00:02:40.880> same<00:02:41.090> stitches<00:02:41.440> but

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
through some of the same stitches but

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.280 
through some of the same stitches but
you<00:02:43.910> know<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.150> if<00:02:44.210> there<00:02:44.420> isn't<00:02:44.600> enough<00:02:45.110> space

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
you know and if there isn't enough space

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.530 
you know and if there isn't enough space
for<00:02:45.410> me<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:45.680> go<00:02:45.830> very<00:02:45.980> far<00:02:46.190> this<00:02:46.370> way<00:02:46.550> I'll<00:02:47.300> go

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
for me to go very far this way I'll go

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.010 
for me to go very far this way I'll go
one<00:02:47.720> stitch<00:02:47.960> over<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:50.000> then<00:02:50.540> I<00:02:50.630> will<00:02:50.840> come

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
one stitch over and then I will come

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:59.880 
one stitch over and then I will come
back<00:02:51.260> this<00:02:52.130> way<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:58.430> last<00:02:58.670> time<00:02:58.970> I<00:02:59.300> went<00:02:59.510> down

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
back this way so last time I went down

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.100 
back this way so last time I went down
this<00:03:00.890> row<00:03:01.190> right<00:03:01.400> here<00:03:01.480> and<00:03:02.480> now<00:03:02.690> I'm<00:03:02.840> coming

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
this row right here and now I'm coming

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.970 
this row right here and now I'm coming
back<00:03:03.290> through<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:04.490> opposite<00:03:05.650> way<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:06.710> so

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
back through the opposite way and so

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.340 
back through the opposite way and so
those<00:03:07.220> are<00:03:07.490> parallel<00:03:08.030> now<00:03:08.840> you<00:03:08.900> don't<00:03:09.140> want<00:03:09.290> to

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
those are parallel now you don't want to

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.080 
those are parallel now you don't want to
pull<00:03:09.560> too<00:03:09.830> too<00:03:10.370> tight<00:03:10.610> because<00:03:10.790> you<00:03:10.940> don't

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
pull too too tight because you don't

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.450 
pull too too tight because you don't
want<00:03:11.300> it<00:03:11.420> to<00:03:11.690> pull<00:03:11.870> on<00:03:11.990> the<00:03:12.110> fabric<00:03:12.410> at<00:03:12.530> all<00:03:12.620> but

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
want it to pull on the fabric at all but

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.060 
want it to pull on the fabric at all but
then<00:03:13.670> this<00:03:14.270> is<00:03:14.450> another<00:03:14.660> end<00:03:14.900> that<00:03:15.290> is<00:03:15.530> ready

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
then this is another end that is ready

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.610 
then this is another end that is ready
to<00:03:16.250> cut<00:03:18.100> now<00:03:19.100> if<00:03:19.430> like<00:03:20.150> right<00:03:20.300> here<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:20.900> then

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
to cut now if like right here and then

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.350 
to cut now if like right here and then
turns<00:03:22.010> out<00:03:22.130> we<00:03:22.310> have<00:03:22.459> a<00:03:22.490> little<00:03:22.700> bit<00:03:22.940> of<00:03:22.970> a<00:03:23.120> hole

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
turns out we have a little bit of a hole

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.960 
turns out we have a little bit of a hole
and<00:03:23.690> that's<00:03:24.230> something<00:03:24.530> that<00:03:24.680> you<00:03:24.830> can<00:03:25.190> fix<00:03:25.610> a

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
and that's something that you can fix a

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.390 
and that's something that you can fix a
bit<00:03:26.240> by<00:03:26.450> weaving<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:27.080> loose<00:03:27.230> ends<00:03:27.440> so<00:03:28.340> I'm

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
bit by weaving and loose ends so I'm

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.580 
bit by weaving and loose ends so I'm
going<00:03:28.550> to<00:03:28.610> thread<00:03:28.990> the<00:03:29.990> yarn<00:03:30.170> onto<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.220> needle

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
going to thread the yarn onto the needle

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.490 
going to thread the yarn onto the needle
and<00:03:34.120> when<00:03:35.120> you<00:03:35.390> want<00:03:35.600> when<00:03:35.930> I<00:03:35.990> want<00:03:36.170> to<00:03:36.200> fix<00:03:36.350> a

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
and when you want when I want to fix a

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.830 
and when you want when I want to fix a
hole<00:03:36.709> I<00:03:36.980> will<00:03:37.070> kind<00:03:37.340> of<00:03:37.490> making<00:03:38.360> sure<00:03:38.510> I<00:03:38.540> pick

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
hole I will kind of making sure I pick

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.170 
hole I will kind of making sure I pick
up<00:03:38.990> like<00:03:39.200> the<00:03:39.380> back<00:03:39.620> these<00:03:40.520> stitches<00:03:40.730> but<00:03:41.060> I'll

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
up like the back these stitches but I'll

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.410 
up like the back these stitches but I'll
kind<00:03:41.480> of<00:03:41.570> go<00:03:41.980> forward<00:03:43.450> and<00:03:45.340> back<00:03:46.340> a<00:03:46.670> bit<00:03:47.150> and

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
kind of go forward and back a bit and

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.320 
kind of go forward and back a bit and
you<00:03:48.380> can<00:03:48.410> see<00:03:48.770> this<00:03:49.730> is<00:03:49.940> where<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.150> hole<00:03:50.300> is

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
you can see this is where the hole is

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.520 
you can see this is where the hole is
you<00:03:51.170> can't<00:03:51.440> see<00:03:51.739> what<00:03:52.520> I'm<00:03:52.670> doing<00:03:53.000> over<00:03:53.180> there

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
you can't see what I'm doing over there

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.820 
you can't see what I'm doing over there
but<00:03:54.530> I've<00:03:54.709> just<00:03:54.950> kind<00:03:55.220> of<00:03:55.370> in<00:03:55.610> a<00:03:56.420> non<00:03:56.830> specific

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
but I've just kind of in a non specific

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.440 
but I've just kind of in a non specific
way<00:03:58.600> woven<00:03:59.600> this<00:04:00.560> yarn<00:04:01.250> through<00:04:01.610> the<00:04:01.670> back<00:04:01.940> to

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
way woven this yarn through the back to

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.260 
way woven this yarn through the back to
close<00:04:02.930> it<00:04:03.110> in
