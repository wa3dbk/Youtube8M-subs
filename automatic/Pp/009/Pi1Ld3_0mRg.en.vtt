example<00:00:16.860> I'm<00:00:17.220> using<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.699> laptop<00:00:18.320> connected<00:00:19.320> to

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
example I'm using a laptop connected to

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.650 
example I'm using a laptop connected to
the<00:00:19.529> printer<00:00:19.890> as<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.730> server<00:00:21.269> for<00:00:21.599> the

the printer as the server for the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.900 
the printer as the server for the
printer<00:00:22.339> normally<00:00:23.339> you'd<00:00:23.460> probably<00:00:23.669> use<00:00:23.820> a

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
printer normally you'd probably use a

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.349 
printer normally you'd probably use a
desktop<00:00:24.300> but<00:00:25.609> since<00:00:26.609> that's<00:00:26.880> already<00:00:27.150> hooked

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
desktop but since that's already hooked

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.669 
desktop but since that's already hooked
up<00:00:27.509> I'm<00:00:27.660> going<00:00:27.749> to<00:00:27.810> show<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.019> how<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.289> do<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.529> on

jump<00:00:51.180> on<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.930> computer<00:00:52.680> now<00:00:54.890> alright<00:00:55.890> now

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
jump on to the computer now alright now

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.890 
jump on to the computer now alright now
that<00:00:56.220> we've<00:00:56.490> jumped<00:00:56.970> onto<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.330> computer<00:00:57.750> and

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
that we've jumped onto the computer and

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.030 
that we've jumped onto the computer and
they<00:00:58.290> can<00:00:58.410> printer<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.160> all<00:00:59.280> plugged<00:00:59.520> in<00:01:00.020> first

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
they can printer is all plugged in first

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.870 
they can printer is all plugged in first
let's<00:01:02.040> make<00:01:02.220> sure<00:01:02.280> it's<00:01:02.520> all<00:01:02.640> set<00:01:02.850> up

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 
let's make sure it's all set up

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.109 
let's make sure it's all set up
correctly<00:01:03.240> go<00:01:03.990> to<00:01:04.129> actually<00:01:05.129> let's<00:01:05.970> make<00:01:06.000> it

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
correctly go to actually let's make it

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.499 
correctly go to actually let's make it
easier<00:01:06.450> let's<00:01:06.600> go<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.810> control<00:01:07.140> panel

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
easier let's go to control panel

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:16.940 
easier let's go to control panel
hardware<00:01:09.509> and<00:01:09.899> sound<00:01:10.670> Devices<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.700> Printers

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.740 

it's<00:01:17.550> going<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.880> take<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.030> little<00:01:18.300> bit<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.570> load

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
it's going to take a little bit to load

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.950 
it's going to take a little bit to load
and<00:01:19.740> we<00:01:19.860> want<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.100> make<00:01:20.250> sure<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:21.210> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
and we want to make sure that the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.969 
and we want to make sure that the
printer<00:01:22.350> we<00:01:22.650> just<00:01:22.830> connected<00:01:24.110> right<00:01:25.110> here<00:01:25.350> is

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
printer we just connected right here is

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.290 
printer we just connected right here is
shown<00:01:26.280> up<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:27.390> then<00:01:27.540> we<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:27.720> go<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.900> properties

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
shown up so then we can go to properties

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.990 
shown up so then we can go to properties
not<00:01:30.300> hardware<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:32.100> little<00:01:32.310> icon<00:01:32.460> does

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
not hardware and this little icon does

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.380 
not hardware and this little icon does
mean<00:01:33.300> that<00:01:33.330> it's<00:01:33.660> already<00:01:33.960> being<00:01:34.320> shared<00:01:35.390> but

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390

that laptop is plugged in to the printer

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.370 
that laptop is plugged in to the printer
and<00:03:37.120> on<00:03:39.390> and<00:03:40.390> sometimes<00:03:40.990> takes<00:03:41.200> a<00:03:41.290> little

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
printer this isn't just like the printer

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.860 
printer this isn't just like the printer
was<00:04:06.010> already<00:04:06.310> you<00:04:06.730> there's<00:04:07.150> some<00:04:07.390> printers

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
was already you there's some printers

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.750 
was already you there's some printers
you<00:04:08.019> can<00:04:08.170> just<00:04:08.350> connect<00:04:08.709> directly<00:04:08.890> to<00:04:09.489> a

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
you can just connect directly to a

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.860 
you can just connect directly to a
network<00:04:10.720> but<00:04:11.590> this<00:04:12.340> one<00:04:12.550> I<00:04:12.880> connected<00:04:13.540> through

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
network but this one I connected through

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.840 
network but this one I connected through
my<00:04:14.019> laptop<00:04:14.230> and<00:04:14.830> then<00:04:15.250> went<00:04:15.489> over<00:04:15.640> to<00:04:15.730> my

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
my laptop and then went over to my

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.650 
my laptop and then went over to my
desktop<00:04:16.209> and<00:04:16.769> accessed<00:04:17.769> it<00:04:17.950> wirelessly<00:04:18.660> of

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
desktop and accessed it wirelessly of

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.290 
desktop and accessed it wirelessly of
course<00:04:20.590> now<00:04:20.859> it<00:04:21.040> has<00:04:21.160> to<00:04:21.280> find<00:04:21.519> the<00:04:21.669> driver<00:04:21.970> for

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
course now it has to find the driver for

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.659 
course now it has to find the driver for
this<00:04:22.419> computer<00:04:22.960> it<00:04:23.710> would<00:04:23.890> take<00:04:24.070> less<00:04:24.280> time<00:04:24.310> if

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
this computer it would take less time if

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.090 
this computer it would take less time if
you<00:04:24.790> had<00:04:25.000> plugged<00:04:25.330> the<00:04:25.919> printer<00:04:26.919> in

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
you had plugged the printer in
