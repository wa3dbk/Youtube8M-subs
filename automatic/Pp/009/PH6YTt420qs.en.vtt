00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
so in this trailer the main gist that I

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.380 
so in this trailer the main gist that I
got<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.370> beginning<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:38.940> we<00:00:39.089> see<00:00:39.269> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
got in the beginning is that we see the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.000 
got in the beginning is that we see the
repercussions<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:40.079> Superman<00:00:40.559> pretty<00:00:40.859> much

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
repercussions of Superman pretty much

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.680 
repercussions of Superman pretty much
wiping<00:00:41.429> out<00:00:41.550> metropolis<00:00:42.089> which<00:00:42.300> i<00:00:42.420> think<00:00:42.539> is

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
wiping out metropolis which i think is

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.250 
wiping out metropolis which i think is
pretty<00:00:42.809> cool

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
pretty cool

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.599 
pretty cool
because<00:00:43.469> there<00:00:43.649> would<00:00:43.829> be<00:00:43.859> consequences<00:00:44.129> for

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:44.609 
because there would be consequences for

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:46.040 
because there would be consequences for
that<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:44.909> is<00:00:45.030> also<00:00:45.180> clearly<00:00:45.539> gonna<00:00:45.719> become<00:00:45.899> a
