00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 that deeply disappoints me not being able to 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.140
 celebrate the great night of howard and am and 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.630
 We'll see you tomorrow, it's all 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.400
 these years of close friendship I have never 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.570
 I had the opportunity to express my 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.549
 admiration 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.910
 and I was looking forward to see the face that he put 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:21.610
 when that happened 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.220
 you are amazing I know 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.650
 the dictionary and we form teams that 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.810
 every boys against girls and that's not me 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.340
 it seems fair because I guess the 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.540
 team in which I am not will have a 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:37.420
 clear disadvantage 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.420
 I repeat incredible beings I repeat I know 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:46.210
 first round I'm good prepared 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.210
 ready now 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:54.390
 the window box 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.390
 batman 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.420
 batman and 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:06.090
 the fantastic twins plus the monkey 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.090
 the fantastic twins manolo and banal 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.950
 of a present present 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:18.540
 leonard as you may not get caught 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.970
 that your universe is that a present is not 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.540
 a present is the present 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.470
 Look, it's you and me and Penn and Jamie 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.470
 we are playing pine forest myself in the 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.470
 I presented 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.210
 let's crush 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.829
 it's plasma gluon quarks 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.380
 they are not factors in synthetic freedom 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.790
 plasma within a course 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.040
 nothing of quarks 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.600
 is an observational replica of the model 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.600
 lambda cdm of the universe 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.040
 how could it fail to hear if you want 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.570
 someone guess that's a cookie 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.060
 of chocolate draws a glass of milk 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.459
 a side 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.550
 come and clear right after that 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.910
 I will eliminate the obvious answers from 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.910
 nothing 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.980
 chorizo sausages 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.560
 hot 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.060
 come and you will not draw anything quiet 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.060
 there is time this is fun 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.049
 the solar system is already 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.260
 [Music] 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.260
 already 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.850
 Come on Leonard, I'm putting it 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.850
 suck 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:02.140
 I dont know 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.140
 kasper the alcoholic ghost 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.670
 enough 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.770
 by hand the wing 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.370
 [Applause] 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:20.069
 do not 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.750
 the word is Polish Polish sausage the 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.849
 solar system model developed by 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.040
 nicolás copérnico an astronomer of 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:29.190
 descent and if it was not enough 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.040
 that should be, Madame Curie lost the 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.409
 life discovering the radius although it 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.190
 had nationalized French was Polish 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:37.190
 of birth 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.630
 excuse me in the word slack sometimes 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.630
 no pop 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.430
 It is true 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.430
 I guess it's the fault of both
