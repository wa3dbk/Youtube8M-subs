 he would be the author so henceforth now possession of the queen to

 devolved 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.329
 the rough mistake 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.449
 it does not look like him

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:06.609
 combined 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:11.030

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:17.549
 a beautiful season 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.479
 the management of such a competition leaves no room for doubt 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:23.949
 at 17 and a half only publishing or pepper 

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:25.169
 the favourite 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:28.309
 this neo-zealous tanned figural extreme 

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:30.129
 its fluidity 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.129
 seems almost unreal 

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:38.949
 all of these pilots each extreme on the razor's edge without going over 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:40.369
 their limits 

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:43.969
 tom pagès and his friends are athletes of the modern era 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:46.969
 tell

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:57.929
 quietly 

00:03:57.929 --> 00:03:59.639
 it's the paradox 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.769
 thrilling compound of a journey of competitive pleasure and adrenaline 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:04.299
 friendship 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:05.370
 that he would stop for nothing in the world
