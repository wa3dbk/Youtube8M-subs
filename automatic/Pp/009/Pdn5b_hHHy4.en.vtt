 this amateur video shows the 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.030
 formation of a waterspout 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.510
 the natural phenomenon caused concern to 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.790
 the residents of the area we have 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.580
 seen six times on the high seas but 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.410
 never here to one never first time the 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.410
 inhabitants mentioned that the phenomenon 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.590
 it is not common some fishermen had 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.660
 seen bad outside but never near the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.980
 beach found by the caserinos those 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.080
 high that here 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.660
 serene higher 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:48.230
 fear of the fear population because 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:51.860
 I was throwing sand and wind right here the year 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.440
 past a waterspout touched land and 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.260
 destroyed roofs and affected several 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.989
 single dwellings that happened at night 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.180
 the other day happened another that we 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.920
 whole house goes on the day at night 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.470
 happened and lifted him up everything is natural and 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.690
 you're my brother and it's supposed to be 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.460
 So with what at night the 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.250
 government could be seen more than there was neither 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.710
 moon was light in those moments that 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.690
 the sticks I follow some witnesses 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.110
 They assured that craft craft 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.420
 they were in the sea when it was formed 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.710
 the waterspout and ran the danger of 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:30.140
 dump by the phenomenon to turn off then 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.860
 he got up until he started grabbing 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.540
 to that way of 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.930
 it touched earth was the one that raised the cloud 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.770
 of the 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:41.280
 name and it was getting up started 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.960
 over there and those pieces a few roofs 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.720
 residents were alarmed because they saw 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.050
 that the destructive force was going 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.450
 them but it deviated a few meters before 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.640
 of touching land nature has 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.310
 hit the inhabitants strongly 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.470
 here in a salted bar not only the 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.410
 formation of waterspouts but that 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:06.070
 also the high tide has had to 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:09.520
 knock down many structures and like them 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.090
 they say they had to come out with their own 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.170
 effort in these hard tests
