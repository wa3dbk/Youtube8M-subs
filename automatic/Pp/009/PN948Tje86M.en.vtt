you're<00:03:01.600> at<00:03:01.750> your<00:03:01.870> airport<00:03:02.230> if<00:03:02.440> you<00:03:02.740> have<00:03:03.100> one

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.720 
you're at your airport if you have one
there<00:03:04.900> again<00:03:05.350> it<00:03:05.620> looks<00:03:05.890> they<00:03:06.250> look<00:03:06.550> like

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
there again it looks they look like

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.390 
there again it looks they look like
literally<00:03:07.090> like<00:03:07.420> railroad<00:03:08.290> tracks<00:03:08.650> there<00:03:08.950> so

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
literally like railroad tracks there so

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.730
