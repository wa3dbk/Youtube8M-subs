00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:15.969
 postpone every day to become a marketer by motoring that he likes it 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.210
 but also to earn something 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.210
 in a hobby-like way I am still on highways 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.910
 and it is not that I only have a big car in front of the elderly 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.909
 who has the fingers in the neighborhood 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:28.989
 and that it is not the men who walk 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:33.110
 those small-scale newspapers but android is the father with its own 

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:33.800
 company 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.800
 with it makes it possible to keep the operator running 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.650
 the passion for engines starts when mark 16 is 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.620
 the vouchers of only 6 purchased johannesburg had driven away 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.500
 and it was the body song that made things all sound nice untrue 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.000
 the people on board die for life 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.550
 and from the courses around he in the honda engines he ever came 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.860
 He always uses my children 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.450
 By word of mouth, more and more customers make parts that year 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.080
 from whom he repairs the engine 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.160
 and I started for a very short hour against a garage box and 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.729
 but that really went nowhere but someone who thought it was beautiful 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.130
 of course 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.730
 the extent to which it fits that you might find the best project 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.710
 the first model of these malloten that later and wildly popular is a whole 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.720
 sold the five million in particular 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.920
 And then you make one of the first eight thousand say that are still in it 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.790
 the race for the country is the bigger the engine blocks that is 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.140
 for his will 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.410
 And if you have one of those you have taken then you may have a very valuable one 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.030
 but more on his own and you are on the train but he still has to go there 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.909
 completely restore and then it is worth a lot 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.720
 and nice for later 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.720
 that becomes green 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.250
 because want to make a folder refurbished for a tom sell but well that still takes 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.929
 we live 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.109
 in the meantime also market his work at least with a lot of pleasure what we 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:56.770
 want 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.020
 and that a straight line became a working life 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.790
 Also thanks
