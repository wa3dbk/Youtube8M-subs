00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.400 
tearing itself apart
and<00:02:08.550> they<00:02:09.209> also<00:02:09.360> have<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.780> calculate<00:02:10.229> the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
and they also have to calculate the

and they also have to calculate the

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
gives me and just like to speed the G

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.290 
gives me and just like to speed the G
just<00:03:06.100> by<00:03:06.220> everything<00:03:06.520> like<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:06.880> whole<00:03:07.030> entire

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.660 
the whole entire time you can tell how
good<00:04:28.140> a<00:04:28.380> ride<00:04:28.680> is<00:04:28.950> on<00:04:29.190> how<00:04:31.400> tough<00:04:32.400> it<00:04:32.580> is
