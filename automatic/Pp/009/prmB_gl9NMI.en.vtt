 Speak, everyone, beauty.

 I'm the fuck I 'm going to tell you 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:13.019
 about our stainless steel smoker 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.109
 I'll explain how it works as it is. 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:20.010
 which prepares the smoking box for the 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:23.490
 and I'm going to smoke also two 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.800
 Long period boxes and display here 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.849
 now that we're going to prepare the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:35.190
 in the smoking box only then 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:41.670

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:43.770
 hole here I go at night what for 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:49.860
 there is an air inlet channel 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:52.860
 after assembling the smoke is there 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.340
 especially the slightly downward smoking 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:01.070
 for each one who does not want fluffy late one 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.070
 time it burns very slowly for being 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:13.430
 here will form later how to make the 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.430
 still score and the line of fire 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:37.770

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:42.149

 of hour 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.799

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:44.730
