00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.470
 we have the indication of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.570
 windows phone battery but not 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.990
 shows the percentage will never show 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.970
 apparently then download this ep that I 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.429
 I'm giving the tip to you guys, they voted for 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.380
 kan description of the video it is free 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.820
 and it shows how much battery you have 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.890
 very simple and objective 69% and according to him 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.500
 he kicks that I have 10 hours and 22 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.430
 minutes of use yet it demonstrates the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.800
 graph of how your battery is and is 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.899
 simple is free as I said is 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.660
 configurable and can tell you when the 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.250
 Your battery is ending too fast. 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.170
 He can tell you when your battery 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.050
 just uploaded gives you several 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.270
 information does not have Portuguese 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.140
 so even though you're in English, you 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.930
 do not understand is easy to understand test the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.790
 controls they are super simple you 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.280
 will get the application anyway 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.560
 it will show beyond your 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.760
 percentage it allows it to stay in the 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.580
 Lockscreen 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.830
 here 69% on my lock screen 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.950
 saying how much he has battery 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.710
 updates every 30 minutes 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.080
 is the system that imposes him what is 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.780
 good, it's too short you know 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.670
 as battery has and besides it 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.070
 will not spend energy totaling 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.189
 antÃ´nio santana every five seconds if 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.259
 necessarily you come here in screen of 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.720
 lock and you will have the option of 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.100
 select it as mine is already a bit 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.399
 in the squares 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.899
 mine is selected then when the 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.119
 time on the lock screen will show 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.600
 here for me and also 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.090
 have another option that is to let him 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.000
 run a task in the background 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.000
 I let it not consume more battery 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.640
 so it does not spoil the processing and 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.950
 course gives you the option to keep it there and 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.720
 or active and you do not have to 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.009
 opening the program to know how much of 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.720
 battery you have 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.370
 besides earning this resource that I showed 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.319
 what 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.510
 excellent sales profit while 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.670
 battery you have this information that 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.590
 Are you seeing here 10 hours and so many? 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.090
 my remaining battery minutes 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.220
 it is information that he is tuning 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.159
 with the same use as the days go by 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.019
 that you install he will see and will 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.640
 hitting more and more so it's very 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.799
 likely even if I have 10 hours of 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.170
 battery in the use I'm giving in this 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.360
 moment and that's what I had to show 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.670
