probably<00:02:16.230> work<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.800> out<00:02:17.690> that's<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.840> year's

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
probably work it out that's a year's

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.110

I<00:02:21.530> think<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.710> was<00:02:22.770> three<00:02:23.040> years<00:02:23.250> ago<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:23.910> think

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
I think it was three years ago I think

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.870 
I think it was three years ago I think
it'll<00:02:24.930> be<00:02:24.960> their<00:02:25.170> fourth<00:02:25.440> year<00:02:25.770> this<00:02:25.980> year<00:02:26.040> but

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
it'll be their fourth year this year but

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.790 
it'll be their fourth year this year but
it<00:02:26.970> might<00:02:27.180> be<00:02:27.270> death<00:02:27.450> I<00:02:27.960> should<00:02:28.470> know<00:02:28.620> that

it might be death I should know that
