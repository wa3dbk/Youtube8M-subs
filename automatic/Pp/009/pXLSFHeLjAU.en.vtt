 welcome to a new video on the day of 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.140
 Today I'm going to teach them well, I'm going to 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.450
 show all the codes or the 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.880
 translations of these secret messages 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.160
 what is on this map of origins there is a 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.470
 total of 4 messages that are hidden 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.060
 and you are going to teach all and well the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.890
 first of these messages is found 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.779
 just inside the leg of 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.000
 giant ok we have to get into the 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.130
 giant called short and once we 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.490
 let's get this giant, let's find 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.040
 this message that is like in the middle of 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.750
 these two like I do not know how little blue tubes 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.760
 is in the robot of beloved author 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.190
 ok and well let's see what this says 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.440
 message the breath of knowledge 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.690
 old is humiliating I find 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.700
 doubtful not only of my understanding of 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.890
 scientific world but also the 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.050
 nature of the universe itself by 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.969
 first time in my adult life I 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.890
 I am open to the possibility of a 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.320
 superior and good power because with this we 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.059
 let's go to the next message and well this 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.379
 second message is in the part 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.059
 of the workshop, he had already 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.710
 taught in a previous video but good 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.600
 I'm going to show you this what is 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.890
 which means this secret message 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.060
 is exactly where is this 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.009
 kraft eo visit 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.750
 right let's see as one so that you do not 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.369
 tire shoots on this map and it goes to 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.530
 find there in the inside 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.299
 this message let's see what it says though 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.130
 Edward's work was an integral part 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.259
 of our initial analysis in divided 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.750
 the gap between us becomes more 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.970
 great every day I fear that your loyalty will be 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.130
 only with group 935 and its 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.590
 insatiable desire for weaponry even more 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.509
 devastating I can no longer continue by 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.700
 this way although my actions will be 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.560
 inevitably as betrayals I am 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.720
 more worried about how to react to 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.850
 edward when I tell him I contacted 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.740
 the allies and well let's go with the 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.450
 third and good the third one is 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.130
 just as if we were grabbing a 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.810
 of the one of the pieces of the canes 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.220
 of the church ok here you will find 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.500
 remember that one of the pieces is 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.630
 we come here and the cane is going to 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.849
 find exactly in this part here 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.200
 back he cited how these are not beams of 

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:57.689
 wood then well let's see what 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.390
 says this message from its first day 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.520
 studying in heidelberg eduardo showed 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.159
 an intellect more mature than his age 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.319
 however the impact of the death of 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.599
 his parents affected him deeply to 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.880
 Although I have tried to be like 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.569
 a father figure for him I'm afraid 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.879
 that your 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.450
 have been influenced by their new 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:21.299
 friends in group 9 35 and well this is 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.730
 the third message let's go with the last 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.530
 of these secret messages and good this 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.389
 last message is justly 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.950
 here in the part of the excavation and 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:31.079
 well we have simply to go down 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.459
 and once we're in this part of 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.680
 this part come like here where 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.269
 we put the gramophone here to follow 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.129
 as the same road the same step 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.629
 that I so that they are not going to lose us 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.579
 We see around here we're going to climb 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.379
 here is that we go to the little zombie that 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.450
 we have here we come here and in 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.549
 this is how it is crypt where it will look and be 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.769
 It's caracas we crouched down to the floor 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.900
 that we were going to see that back there is the 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.560
 secret message let's see what they say 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.199
 some will think I'm crazy but I 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.780
 I'm forced to conclude that blanket 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:03.659
 can be the key to everything for reasons 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.329
 I can not understand it seems that she 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:08.639
 somehow you have mastery of this 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.620
 reality and good those are all 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.419
 messages that we all have all the 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.819
 messages that are secret here in this 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:16.290
 map if another one appears if I arrive 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.790
 find me out there something more curious 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.390
 Well, you know that I do not have the 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.430
 so much 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.110
