00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.240 
let's enable breakout it's add kind of
interesting<00:01:13.460> effect<00:01:14.469> pop-up<00:01:15.469> roughness<00:01:16.040> for

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
interesting effect pop-up roughness for

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:30.910 
interesting effect pop-up roughness for
this<00:01:18.520> okay<00:01:19.520> we<00:01:20.390> can<00:01:20.570> scale<00:01:21.290> it<00:01:25.479> closer

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:44.789 
I think this work run right okay let's
go<00:01:43.060> back<00:01:43.299> to<00:01:43.509> layout<00:01:43.689> right<00:01:44.140> here<00:01:44.200> we<00:01:44.560> have<00:01:44.590> an

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
go back to layout right here we have an

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.249 
go back to layout right here we have an
hour<00:01:44.979> layout<00:01:45.490> so<00:01:46.180> I<00:01:46.240> want<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:46.479> take<00:01:46.720> this<00:01:46.990> loud

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
hour layout so I want to take this loud

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.850 
hour layout so I want to take this loud
and<00:01:47.590> connect<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.369> mask<00:01:49.020> now<00:01:50.020> you<00:01:50.080> can<00:01:50.409> see<00:01:50.680> we

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
and connect the mask now you can see we

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.340 
and connect the mask now you can see we
have<00:01:51.039> our<00:01:51.250> problem<00:01:51.820> applied<00:01:52.180> in<00:01:52.450> its<00:01:53.020> mask

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
have our problem applied in its mask

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.719 
have our problem applied in its mask
with<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:53.920> shape<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.689> inside<00:01:56.340> probably<00:01:57.340> we<00:01:57.580> can

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
with a shape so inside probably we can

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.169 
with a shape so inside probably we can
reduce<00:01:58.200> slightly<00:01:59.670> detail<00:02:00.670> or<00:02:00.820> increase

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
reduce slightly detail or increase

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:04.020 
reduce slightly detail or increase
details<00:02:01.600> so<00:02:01.810> did<00:02:01.929> you<00:02:02.020> scale<00:02:02.399> okay<00:02:03.429> we'll<00:02:03.759> use

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
details so did you scale okay we'll use

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.370 
details so did you scale okay we'll use
it<00:02:04.179> bring<00:02:05.080> it<00:02:05.289> by<00:02:06.250> default<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:07.689> you<00:02:07.720> know<00:02:08.259> what

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
it bring it by default and you know what

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.280 
it bring it by default and you know what
maybe<00:02:09.039> pop-up<00:02:09.700> step<00:02:10.149> nurse<00:02:11.250> elevation<00:02:13.290> okay

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
maybe pop-up step nurse elevation okay

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.920 
maybe pop-up step nurse elevation okay
some<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.620> those<00:02:14.920> I<00:02:15.330> probably<00:02:16.330> come<00:02:16.690> back<00:02:16.720> and

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.300 
you can see right here in preview okay
we'll<00:03:01.540> just<00:03:01.780> leave<00:03:01.989> it<00:03:02.109> like<00:03:02.140> let's<00:03:02.920> go<00:03:03.100> over

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
we'll just leave it like let's go over

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.930 
we'll just leave it like let's go over
the<00:03:03.430> right<00:03:03.640> here<00:03:04.950> render<00:03:05.950> very<00:03:06.370> fast<00:03:06.700> so<00:03:06.850> we

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
the right here render very fast so we

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.319 
the right here render very fast so we
can<00:03:07.090> preview<00:03:07.420> air<00:03:07.660> here's<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:08.819> mountain<00:03:09.819> that's

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
can preview air here's a mountain that's

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.280 
can preview air here's a mountain that's
create<00:03:10.690> very<00:03:11.019> kind<00:03:11.350> of<00:03:11.549> just<00:03:12.549> put<00:03:12.730> together

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
create very kind of just put together

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.190 
create very kind of just put together
will<00:03:14.290> have<00:03:14.500> a<00:03:14.530> different<00:03:14.980> maps<00:03:15.310> for<00:03:16.060> this<00:03:16.209> so

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
will have a different maps for this so

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.890 
will have a different maps for this so
next<00:03:17.500> what<00:03:17.769> I<00:03:17.799> want<00:03:17.920> to<00:03:18.069> do<00:03:18.510> it's<00:03:19.510> going<00:03:19.810> to

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
next what I want to do it's going to

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.640 
next what I want to do it's going to
options<00:03:20.350> and<00:03:20.769> pop<00:03:21.639> hop<00:03:21.970> at<00:03:22.209> about<00:03:22.500> 4000<00:03:23.500> pixels

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
options and pop hop at about 4000 pixels

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.640 
options and pop hop at about 4000 pixels
so<00:03:24.010> on<00:03:24.190> higher<00:03:24.880> resolution<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:26.019> will<00:03:26.079> take<00:03:26.620> a

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
so on higher resolution it will take a

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.629 
so on higher resolution it will take a
bit<00:03:26.889> longer<00:03:27.040> time<00:03:27.700> to<00:03:28.000> render<00:03:28.510> but<00:03:29.410> it<00:03:30.400> will

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
bit longer time to render but it will

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.479 
bit longer time to render but it will
provide<00:03:31.030> much<00:03:31.329> better<00:03:31.530> map<00:03:32.560> I<00:03:32.920> feel<00:03:33.190> never

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
provide much better map I feel never

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.090 
provide much better map I feel never
next<00:03:34.480> I<00:03:34.720> want<00:03:34.930> to<00:03:34.989> connect<00:03:35.380> because<00:03:35.590> I<00:03:35.829> want

next I want to connect because I want

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.690 
next I want to connect because I want

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.789 
safe floor map where map and deposit map
and<00:03:40.060> I<00:03:40.299> want<00:03:40.480> to<00:03:40.540> use<00:03:40.630> it<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:41.019> them<00:03:41.380> as<00:03:41.650> an

place<00:04:16.930> okay<00:04:17.930> so<00:04:17.989> I<00:04:18.170> just<00:04:18.410> type<00:04:18.620> path<00:04:18.980> in<00:04:19.310> click

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
place okay so I just type path in click

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.420 
place okay so I just type path in click
OK<00:04:20.120> and<00:04:20.870> we<00:04:21.739> can<00:04:21.920> just<00:04:23.380> go<00:04:24.380> to<00:04:24.410> outputs<00:04:25.160> and

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
OK and we can just go to outputs and

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.210 
OK and we can just go to outputs and
right<00:04:26.360> he'll<00:04:26.630> notice<00:04:27.020> we<00:04:27.350> have<00:04:27.620> it

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
right he'll notice we have it

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.860 
right he'll notice we have it
bitmap<00:04:29.120> mash<00:04:30.130> hide<00:04:31.130> output<00:04:31.700> in<00:04:31.940> check<00:04:32.240> so<00:04:32.270> we

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
bitmap mash hide output in check so we

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.260 
bitmap mash hide output in check so we
just<00:04:33.700> one<00:04:34.700> create<00:04:35.140> two<00:04:36.140> three<00:04:36.620> more<00:04:37.070> let's<00:04:38.060> go

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
just one create two three more let's go

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:45.460 
just one create two three more let's go
connect<00:04:38.720> them<00:04:39.340> flow<00:04:40.340> so<00:04:40.730> we<00:04:40.850> can<00:04:41.000> open<00:04:41.860> GFF<00:04:44.470> and

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
connect them flow so we can open GFF and

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:52.240 
connect them flow so we can open GFF and
let's<00:04:45.770> go<00:04:46.540> address<00:04:47.540> floor<00:04:50.770> take<00:04:51.770> another<00:04:52.040> one

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
let's go address floor take another one

00:04:52.250 --> 00:05:01.860 
let's go address floor take another one
connect<00:04:52.670> to<00:04:52.850> the<00:04:52.970> where<00:04:54.340> get<00:04:55.340> same<00:04:55.610> set<00:04:56.150> us<00:04:56.390> tff
