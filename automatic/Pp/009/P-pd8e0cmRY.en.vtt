Neiman Marcus as soon as I had the
opportunity<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:34.230> think<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.950> was<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.899> limited

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
opportunity I think it was a limited

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.619 
opportunity I think it was a limited
release<00:00:37.260> only<00:00:37.739> at<00:00:38.100> Neiman<00:00:38.879> Marcus<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.300> now<00:00:39.600> I

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
release only at Neiman Marcus and now I

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.509 
release only at Neiman Marcus and now I
think<00:00:39.839> it's<00:00:40.170> generally<00:00:40.469> it's<00:00:40.980> been<00:00:41.160> released

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:41.519 
think it's generally it's been released

think it's generally it's been released
generally<00:00:42.050> this<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> leather<00:00:43.499> based<00:00:43.800> scent

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
generally this is a leather based scent

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.209 
generally this is a leather based scent

when I first note this before I actually

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.610

reviews that some of the great fragrance
blogs<00:01:13.500> do<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.220> really<00:01:14.820> thought<00:01:15.000> there<00:01:15.210> was

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
blogs do I really thought there was

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.110 
blogs do I really thought there was
violet<00:01:16.020> in<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:17.370> think<00:01:17.580> that's<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
violet in this and I think that's the

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.600 
violet in this and I think that's the
combination<00:01:18.870> of<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.710> Jasmine<00:01:20.280> with<00:01:20.490> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
combination of the Jasmine with the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.790 
combination of the Jasmine with the
bergamot<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.630> kind<00:01:22.050> of<00:01:22.140> giving<00:01:22.440> me<00:01:22.470> that

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
bergamot it kind of giving me that

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.860 
bergamot it kind of giving me that
impression<00:01:22.980> in<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.820> top<00:01:24.060> there<00:01:24.660> may<00:01:24.840> be

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
impression in the top there may be

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.600 
impression in the top there may be
violet<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.410> there<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.680> they<00:01:25.740> may<00:01:25.860> not<00:01:25.920> not<00:01:26.430> be

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610
