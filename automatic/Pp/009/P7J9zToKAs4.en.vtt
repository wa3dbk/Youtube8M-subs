00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.119 
the right is how you initiate the
pairing<00:02:08.849> in<00:02:09.060> order<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.690> pair<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.170> with<00:02:10.500> your

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
pairing in order to pair this with your

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.960 
pairing in order to pair this with your
iPad

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
iPad

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.630 
iPad
so<00:02:13.360> I<00:02:13.390> really<00:02:13.780> like<00:02:14.020> it<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:14.440> it<00:02:15.069> works<00:02:15.310> quite

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
so I really like it and it works quite

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.199 
so I really like it and it works quite
well

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
well

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.900 
well
what<00:02:16.750> I<00:02:16.780> really<00:02:17.260> like<00:02:17.440> about<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.920> key<00:02:18.190> board

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
what I really like about the key board

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.750 
what I really like about the key board
itself<00:02:19.600> as<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:19.990> doesn't<00:02:20.200> flex<00:02:20.800> when<00:02:21.280> you<00:02:21.310> type

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
itself as it doesn't flex when you type

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.210 
itself as it doesn't flex when you type
on<00:02:22.000> it<00:02:22.030> yeah<00:02:22.780> it's<00:02:22.959> a<00:02:23.080> slightly<00:02:23.470> condensed

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
on it yeah it's a slightly condensed

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.640 
on it yeah it's a slightly condensed
keyboard<00:02:24.730> but<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:25.060> quickly<00:02:25.840> got<00:02:26.140> used<00:02:26.440> to<00:02:26.560> it

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
keyboard but I quickly got used to it

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.220 
keyboard but I quickly got used to it
and<00:02:26.860> I<00:02:27.550> tell<00:02:27.819> you<00:02:27.910> now<00:02:28.120> that<00:02:28.300> I'm<00:02:28.720> used<00:02:29.020> to<00:02:29.110> the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
and I tell you now that I'm used to the

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.530 
and I tell you now that I'm used to the
keyboard<00:02:29.709> I<00:02:29.830> can't<00:02:30.400> even<00:02:30.520> imagine<00:02:30.700> using<00:02:31.390> my

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
keyboard I can't even imagine using my

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.690 
keyboard I can't even imagine using my
iPad<00:02:32.020> without<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.740> keyboard<00:02:33.190> it<00:02:33.310> just<00:02:33.490> makes

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
iPad without the keyboard it just makes

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.940 
iPad without the keyboard it just makes
everything<00:02:33.880> so<00:02:34.300> much<00:02:34.360> easier<00:02:34.950> especially

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
everything so much easier especially

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.320 
everything so much easier especially
typing<00:02:36.790> email<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.630> and<00:02:38.050> what-have-you<00:02:38.620> but

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
typing email and and what-have-you but

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.270 
typing email and and what-have-you but
even<00:02:40.330> just<00:02:40.570> the<00:02:40.780> ability<00:02:41.350> to<00:02:41.380> quickly<00:02:41.860> access

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
even just the ability to quickly access

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.570 
even just the ability to quickly access
certain<00:02:43.209> things<00:02:43.770> from<00:02:44.770> the<00:02:44.860> keyboard<00:02:45.190> itself

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
certain things from the keyboard itself

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.960 
certain things from the keyboard itself
makes<00:02:45.910> it<00:02:46.120> very<00:02:46.900> worthwhile<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:48.370> you<00:02:48.430> do<00:02:48.670> have

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
makes it very worthwhile so you do have

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.490 
makes it very worthwhile so you do have
two<00:02:49.750> very<00:02:50.100> minor<00:02:51.100> slots<00:02:51.910> here<00:02:52.420> which<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:52.900> iPad

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
two very minor slots here which the iPad

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.220 
two very minor slots here which the iPad
will<00:02:54.060> presumably<00:02:56.250> stick<00:02:57.250> in<00:02:57.580> but<00:02:57.910> I<00:02:58.120> find<00:02:59.019> that

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
will presumably stick in but I find that

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.560 
will presumably stick in but I find that
it<00:02:59.380> slides<00:02:59.800> quite<00:03:00.250> easily<00:03:00.459> that's<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:01.030> only

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
it slides quite easily that's the only

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.840 
it slides quite easily that's the only
negative<00:03:02.080> comment<00:03:02.680> I<00:03:02.769> have<00:03:02.950> about<00:03:03.220> this<00:03:03.519> as<00:03:03.730> it

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
negative comment I have about this as it

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.580 
negative comment I have about this as it
doesn't<00:03:04.180> really<00:03:04.390> if<00:03:04.930> you<00:03:05.019> don't<00:03:05.080> have<00:03:05.410> the

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
doesn't really if you don't have the

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.060 
doesn't really if you don't have the
keyboard<00:03:06.160> there<00:03:06.660> magnetically<00:03:07.660> attached<00:03:08.080> the

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
keyboard there magnetically attached the

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.210 
keyboard there magnetically attached the
iPad<00:03:09.459> really<00:03:09.820> doesn't<00:03:10.150> stay<00:03:10.420> up<00:03:10.450> on<00:03:10.810> its<00:03:10.989> own

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
iPad really doesn't stay up on its own

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.650 
iPad really doesn't stay up on its own
they<00:03:12.220> should<00:03:12.430> try<00:03:12.640> to<00:03:12.700> improve<00:03:12.880> that<00:03:13.330> and<00:03:13.390> the

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
they should try to improve that and the

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.590 
they should try to improve that and the
future<00:03:14.019> version<00:03:14.410> of<00:03:14.530> this<00:03:14.739> but<00:03:15.310> otherwise

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
future version of this but otherwise

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.090 
future version of this but otherwise
it's<00:03:16.600> really<00:03:16.750> awesome<00:03:17.200> to<00:03:17.530> have<00:03:17.829> this

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100
