 Andrew and suddenly to listen to see what 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.920

 guardiola lauro non-citizen has been 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:06.329
 reference and you can see that they have been 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.609
 referents in the way of playing the art 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.390
 really is when you put the genuine and 

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:10.860
 the real 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.160

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.760

 superior to me 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:34.280
 the one that leads me to what I keep with 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.280
 the life that having 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:42.530
 who tells me the time that goes on in a 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:47.299
 strange and it brings me down the street of the
