can just grab a section of the hair and

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:04.880 
can just grab a section of the hair and
wrap<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.150> around<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:03.110> then<00:03:04.110> you<00:03:04.260> can<00:03:04.290> secure

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
wrap it around and then you can secure

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.710 
wrap it around and then you can secure
it<00:03:04.920> now<00:03:05.099> you<00:03:05.489> can<00:03:05.790> go<00:03:05.910> ahead<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.330> pull<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:06.510> I

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
it now you can go ahead and pull it I

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.900 
it now you can go ahead and pull it I
would<00:03:06.989> recommend<00:03:07.110> putting<00:03:07.530> in<00:03:07.769> a<00:03:07.860> few<00:03:08.190> of

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
would recommend putting in a few of

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.610 
would recommend putting in a few of
these<00:03:09.180> short<00:03:09.480> little<00:03:09.540> whips<00:03:09.959> because

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
these short little whips because

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.620 
these short little whips because
