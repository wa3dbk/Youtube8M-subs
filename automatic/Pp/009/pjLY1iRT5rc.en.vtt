00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.620
 tomorrow love natural bodybuilding 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.999
 friends 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:16.640
 today we have tuesday 10 june 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:18.880
 still 18 days to the competition masters 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.019
 wm over 50 years 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.529
 today was actually back on 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:25.910
 Video clip planned about my training 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.480
 But today I have to get up again 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.669
 noticed body and mind 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.270
 especially the body not so today 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:38.140
 far for a really hard workout 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.640
 muscles are relatively flat 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.800
 energy reserves pretty far down in the 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.719
 lower level and that's why I am 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.520
 decided today the instinctive principle 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.890
 to apply and not 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.690
 to train a bit the 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.949
 energy reserves to replenish, too 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.879
 the muscle fill something again 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.910
 hinzubekommen 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.579
 And yes, it's a day break 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.620
 I can only recommend on the advice 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.160
 own body to hear what but 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.439
 to do the same is a form check 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.330
 as said muscles are relatively flat today 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.520
 I'm cold an hour ago 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.259
 well, color is not up yet 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.259
 on it but we look at the times 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:35.110
 now there are still 18 days to go 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:38.140
 short review in the 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.660
 principle, I am already relatively far from 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.600
 the shape is even a bit too early 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.100
 So that's what I have this morning too 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.490
 noticed after that get up that 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.970
 muscles is nonsense in definition 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:55.570
 already appealing the pass quality 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.820
 So the veins drawing is quite 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.040
 available 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.280
 but right now you have to watch that 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.229
 I do not overshoot and aim 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.050
 the mold so the icing still 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.090
 essays in the last remaining in 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.680
 The last 18 days no more 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.709
 you find the last training on 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.200
 wednesday early possibly on 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.500
 thursday afternoon on the spot in nitra 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.450
 city the unload workout what is now 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.470
 important today is tuesday 10 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.030
 June until the end of next week the 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.580
 training remains focused 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.350
 It must not be allowed to watch 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.239
 do not play crazy so big 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.930
 make changes more training 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.590
 nutrition but focused and 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.330
 Focused on the things 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.130
 Competitions stay what actually 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.390
 happen, of course, am is quite 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.730
 Of course, no big ones right now 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.930
 experiment more so this is now 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.880
 important that the matter in peace and with 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.830
 focus on the daytime too 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.590
 work then comes the last one 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:03.040
 week before the competition a special one 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.310
 Loading and unloading and loading strategy 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.420
 I have always done well with it 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.450
 do not change anything accordingly 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.890
 My approach that I stop first 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.750
 So it lures with almost zero 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.720
 carbohydrates the first three days in 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.330
 The week then works on carbohydrates 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.920
 not aiming too high either 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.410
 too little is always a difficult topic 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.690
 Here we can target it again 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.519
 deal but when it's time 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:33.670
 important is now first as I said 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:36.370
 positive to remain calm voted to 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.319
 Stay tuned for the contest 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.819
 I do 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.499
 I am very confident that I am 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.109
 this time my best form there 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:44.579
 present and everything else lies 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.530
 not in my hand so for me 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.999
 It is important that I personally go there 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.010
 really stand on the stage and say 

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:53.609
 okay, you worked hard for that now 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.920
 not do more group and then the 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:04:00.060
 Enjoy the match and see what happens then 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:03.269
 as a result, this is how it was 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.129
 a short inventory my 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.379
 current situation as I said today 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:09.120
 Fill break batteries 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:11.540
 fire-fighting until next time 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.540
