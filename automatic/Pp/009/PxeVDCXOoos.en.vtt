which showed toxic Holocaust bringing a

album to come out of this project and
Joel<00:01:06.689> really<00:01:06.950> subtracted<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.159> black<00:01:08.700> metal

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
Joel really subtracted the black metal

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.480 
Joel really subtracted the black metal
influences<00:01:09.780> from<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.110> record<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.979> big<00:01:11.220> way

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
influences from this record in a big way

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.000 
influences from this record in a big way
and<00:01:11.820> just<00:01:12.090> sort<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.330> stuck<00:01:12.630> simply<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.500> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
and just sort of stuck simply to the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.580 
and just sort of stuck simply to the
thrash<00:01:14.310> metal<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.240> punk<00:01:15.570> sounds<00:01:16.229> that

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
thrash metal and the punk sounds that

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.050 
thrash metal and the punk sounds that
they<00:01:16.740> had<00:01:16.890> been<00:01:17.040> playing<00:01:17.310> with<00:01:17.430> for<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.850> most

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
they had been playing with for the most

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.850 
they had been playing with for the most
part<00:01:18.360> up<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.780> point<00:01:19.020> anyway<00:01:19.290> there's<00:01:19.710> no

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
part up to that point anyway there's no

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.570 
part up to that point anyway there's no
question<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.759> album<00:01:21.030> Joel<00:01:21.540> really

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
question on this album Joel really

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.359 
question on this album Joel really
simplified<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.820> Toxic<00:01:24.270> Allah<00:01:24.860> to<00:01:25.860> some<00:01:26.250> of

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
simplified the Toxic Allah to some of

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.340 
simplified the Toxic Allah to some of
its<00:01:26.520> most<00:01:26.759> aggressive<00:01:27.770> just<00:01:28.770> no<00:01:29.729> BS<00:01:30.450> elements

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
its most aggressive just no BS elements

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.050 
its most aggressive just no BS elements
and<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.740> sort<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.070> left<00:01:32.280> me<00:01:32.340> wondering<00:01:32.640> or

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
and that sort of left me wondering or

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.719 
and that sort of left me wondering or
fearing<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:34.229> maybe<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.740> next<00:01:35.040> album<00:01:35.280> would

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
fearing that maybe the next album would

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.359 
fearing that maybe the next album would
entertain<00:01:36.119> me<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> bit<00:01:36.659> less<00:01:36.930> because<00:01:37.829> there

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
entertain me a bit less because there

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.640 
entertain me a bit less because there
would<00:01:38.549> surely<00:01:38.880> be<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.240> lack<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.689> surprises<00:01:40.470> on

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
would surely be a lack of surprises on

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.319 
would surely be a lack of surprises on
it<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:40.950> do<00:01:41.070> kind<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.490> feel<00:01:41.640> like<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.820> is

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
it I do kind of feel like that is

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.679 
it I do kind of feel like that is
happening<00:01:43.049> here<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.560> at<00:01:44.520> least<00:01:44.729> some<00:01:45.000> degree<00:01:45.180> I

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
happening here to at least some degree I

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.030 
happening here to at least some degree I
guess<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.020> recording<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.740> production

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
guess the recording and the production

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.910 
guess the recording and the production
on<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.460> record<00:01:47.670> are<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.360> bit<00:01:48.630> thicker<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.530> bit

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
on this record are a bit thicker a bit

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.550 
on this record are a bit thicker a bit
more<00:01:50.189> distorted<00:01:50.970> Joel's<00:01:51.479> vocal<00:01:51.930> delivery<00:01:52.320> is

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
more distorted Joel's vocal delivery is

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.249 
more distorted Joel's vocal delivery is
roughly<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.310> same<00:01:53.520> if<00:01:53.820> toxic<00:01:54.509> Holocaust<00:01:54.990> goes

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
roughly the same if toxic Holocaust goes

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.679 
roughly the same if toxic Holocaust goes
in<00:01:55.409> any<00:01:55.590> direction<00:01:55.890> with<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:56.430> album<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:57.000> think

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
in any direction with this album I think

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.130 
in any direction with this album I think
they<00:01:57.840> actually<00:01:58.020> boil<00:01:58.619> things<00:01:58.950> down<00:01:59.219> even

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
they actually boil things down even

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.080 
they actually boil things down even
further<00:02:01.140> because<00:02:01.560> many<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.189> heavy<00:02:02.399> slower

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
further because many of the heavy slower

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.690 
further because many of the heavy slower
