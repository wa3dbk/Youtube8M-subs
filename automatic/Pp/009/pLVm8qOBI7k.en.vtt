it'd<00:04:02.920> be<00:04:03.010> better<00:04:03.160> if<00:04:03.280> I<00:04:03.340> had<00:04:03.520> a<00:04:03.550> spoon<00:04:04.320> took

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
it'd be better if I had a spoon took

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
this or something scrape that off is

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.780 
this or something scrape that off is
better<00:04:08.680> than<00:04:08.830> the<00:04:08.950> sport<00:04:09.250> but<00:04:09.310> you're<00:04:09.580> getting

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
better than the sport but you're getting

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.280 
better than the sport but you're getting
the<00:04:09.880> idea<00:04:12.060> all<00:04:13.060> right<00:04:13.270> and<00:04:13.630> then<00:04:13.990> you<00:04:14.110> just

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
the idea all right and then you just

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.199 
the idea all right and then you just
kind<00:04:14.500> of<00:04:14.680> put<00:04:15.640> it<00:04:15.760> around<00:04:15.850> like<00:04:16.150> this<00:04:16.770> and

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
kind of put it around like this and

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.610 
kind of put it around like this and
you're<00:04:19.209> going<00:04:19.360> to<00:04:19.420> microwave<00:04:19.870> this<00:04:20.050> from<00:04:20.290> one

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
you're going to microwave this from one

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.220 
you're going to microwave this from one
minute<00:04:21.070> no<00:04:21.430> longer<00:04:21.910> and<00:04:22.120> then<00:04:22.810> when<00:04:23.110> it<00:04:23.200> comes

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
minute no longer and then when it comes

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.760
