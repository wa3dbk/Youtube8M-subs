over there and the right but they

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.010

actually<00:01:14.939> didn't<00:01:15.119> even<00:01:15.299> kill<00:01:15.479> me<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.719> my<00:01:15.840> guys

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020

they just damaged up and there's still

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.069 
they just damaged up and there's still
one<00:01:17.610> shot<00:01:17.880> anyway<00:01:18.180> from<00:01:18.329> the<00:01:18.450> boom<00:01:18.600> kitten<00:01:18.930> so

one shot anyway from the boom kitten so

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.690 
one shot anyway from the boom kitten so
it<00:01:19.170> really<00:01:19.350> doesn't<00:01:19.560> matter<00:01:19.799> as<00:01:20.070> long<00:01:20.430> as<00:01:20.610> you

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700
