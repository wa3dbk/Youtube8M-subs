00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
because I had it pinned up with crazy

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.490 
because I had it pinned up with crazy
amounts<00:00:10.469> of<00:00:11.059> straight<00:00:12.059> pins<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:12.630> have<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.170> little

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
amounts of straight pins I have a little

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.550 
amounts of straight pins I have a little
short<00:00:13.740> lines<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.280> I<00:00:14.309> have<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.519> very<00:00:14.790> long<00:00:14.969> ones

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:15.560 
short lines and I have a very long ones

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.200 
short lines and I have a very long ones
so<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:17.250> get<00:00:17.340> started<00:00:17.550> what<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:18.510> did<00:00:18.930> was<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:20.210> took

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
so to get started what I did was I took

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.870 
so to get started what I did was I took
I<00:00:21.510> just<00:00:21.720> put<00:00:22.140> basket-weave<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.609> back<00:00:23.760> of

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
I just put basket-weave in the back of

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.070 
I just put basket-weave in the back of
my<00:00:23.970> head<00:00:24.150> so<00:00:24.480> I'm<00:00:24.570> just<00:00:24.720> going<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.869> show<00:00:25.019> you

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
my head so I'm just going to show you

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.599 
my head so I'm just going to show you
really<00:00:25.320> quick<00:00:27.590> it's<00:00:28.590> not<00:00:28.800> going<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.130> be<00:00:29.279> as

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
really quick it's not going to be as

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.970 
really quick it's not going to be as
neat<00:00:30.359> but<00:00:30.720> just<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.050> can<00:00:31.170> get<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.439> concept<00:00:31.890> of

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
neat but just you can get the concept of

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.299 
neat but just you can get the concept of
it<00:00:32.510> so<00:00:33.510> what<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.660> did<00:00:33.899> was<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.170> just<00:00:34.230> thought<00:00:35.040> with

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
it so what I did was I just thought with

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.060 
it so what I did was I just thought with
the<00:00:35.430> middle<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:36.230> started<00:00:37.230> taking<00:00:37.410> here<00:00:37.829> and

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
the middle I started taking here and

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.610 
the middle I started taking here and
going<00:00:38.309> over<00:00:39.410> crisscross<00:00:40.410> with<00:00:40.620> each<00:00:40.739> other

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
going over crisscross with each other

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:52.150 
going over crisscross with each other
take<00:00:43.620> them<00:00:43.800> locks<00:00:44.629> just<00:00:45.629> going<00:00:45.960> across<00:00:48.680> and

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.770 

sometimes<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.520> would<00:00:54.449> take<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.629> pin<00:00:55.520> and<00:00:56.520> just

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
sometimes I would take a pin and just

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.819 
sometimes I would take a pin and just
pin<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.620> place<00:01:00.530> okay

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.620 

and<00:01:04.550> then<00:01:05.390> what<00:01:05.810> I<00:01:05.840> did<00:01:05.990> was<00:01:07.300> yeah<00:01:08.300> I<00:01:08.330> think<00:01:08.540> I

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
and then what I did was yeah I think I

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.990 
and then what I did was yeah I think I
can<00:01:08.690> do<00:01:08.900> this<00:01:09.050> much<00:01:09.229> so<00:01:09.860> what<00:01:10.130> I<00:01:10.190> did<00:01:10.250> was<00:01:10.909> I

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
can do this much so what I did was I

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.180 
can do this much so what I did was I
took<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:11.390> side<00:01:11.630> I<00:01:11.990> have<00:01:12.320> like<00:01:12.440> a<00:01:12.470> base<00:01:12.740> back

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
took the side I have like a base back

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.859 
took the side I have like a base back
here<00:01:13.430> so<00:01:14.240> I<00:01:14.270> said<00:01:14.630> when<00:01:14.780> I<00:01:14.869> took<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.260> sides

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
here so I said when I took the sides

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:22.660 
here so I said when I took the sides
separated<00:01:17.869> about<00:01:18.729> to<00:01:19.729> roll<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.150> locks<00:01:20.390> and<00:01:21.670> I

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
separated about to roll the locks and I

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.730 
separated about to roll the locks and I
just<00:01:23.030> took<00:01:23.750> them<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:24.880> twisted<00:01:26.470> twisted<00:01:27.470> them

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
just took them and twisted twisted them

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:34.240 
just took them and twisted twisted them
back<00:01:28.210> like<00:01:29.210> so<00:01:32.020> all<00:01:33.020> right<00:01:33.320> and<00:01:33.590> then<00:01:33.860> I<00:01:33.890> pinned

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
back like so all right and then I pinned

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.639 
back like so all right and then I pinned
that<00:01:34.490> to<00:01:35.950> real<00:01:36.950> easy<00:01:37.220> real<00:01:37.880> simple<00:01:37.940> just<00:01:38.690> be

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
that to real easy real simple just be

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.180 
that to real easy real simple just be
careful<00:01:40.160> for<00:01:40.340> these<00:01:40.550> pins<00:01:41.270> are<00:01:41.479> like<00:01:41.690> Oh<00:01:42.190> kind

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
careful for these pins are like Oh kind

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.749 
careful for these pins are like Oh kind
of<00:01:43.280> hurt

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
of hurt

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.639 
of hurt
all<00:01:44.450> right<00:01:44.660> do<00:01:44.929> the<00:01:44.960> same<00:01:45.229> thing<00:01:45.440> to<00:01:45.560> the

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
all right do the same thing to the

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.830 
all right do the same thing to the
outside<00:01:47.470> till<00:01:48.470> two<00:01:48.679> rolls<00:01:49.539> now<00:01:50.539> I<00:01:50.570> have<00:01:50.810> a

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
outside till two rolls now I have a

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.040 
outside till two rolls now I have a
really<00:01:51.020> fat<00:01:51.470> lot<00:01:52.160> over<00:01:52.610> here<00:01:52.850> so<00:01:53.330> I<00:01:53.360> didn't<00:01:53.869> let

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
really fat lot over here so I didn't let

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:02.469 
really fat lot over here so I didn't let
twisted<00:01:54.500> him<00:01:54.649> by<00:01:54.830> itself<00:01:55.160> first<00:01:55.520> and<00:01:56.110> then<00:02:01.479> and

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
twisted him by itself first and then and

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.710 
twisted him by itself first and then and
then<00:02:02.780> I<00:02:02.899> just<00:02:03.110> twisted<00:02:04.000> did<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.149> same<00:02:05.360> thing

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
then I just twisted did the same thing

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.919 
then I just twisted did the same thing
same<00:02:06.259> thing<00:02:07.330> twist<00:02:08.330> twist

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
same thing twist twist

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.000 
took like some of these pieces this is
like<00:02:30.230> so<00:02:30.860> simple<00:02:31.310> I<00:02:31.489> just<00:02:32.060> took<00:02:32.540> it<00:02:32.599> and<00:02:33.050> rolled

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
like so simple I just took it and rolled

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.330 
like so simple I just took it and rolled
it<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:35.379> just<00:02:36.379> rolled<00:02:36.620> it<00:02:36.800> in<00:02:37.180> like<00:02:38.180> that<00:02:38.420> you

see like that rolled it slip in to the

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.380
