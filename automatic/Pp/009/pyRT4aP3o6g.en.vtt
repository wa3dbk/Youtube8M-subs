see<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.330> breaking<00:01:21.810> if<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.020> put<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.259> little<00:01:22.500> bit

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
see it breaking if you put a little bit

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.230 
see it breaking if you put a little bit
too<00:01:22.799> much<00:01:22.950> pressure<00:01:23.220> on<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.610> keep<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.119> in

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
too much pressure on it so keep that in

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.530 
too much pressure on it so keep that in
mind

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
mind

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.570 
mind
one<00:01:24.930> small<00:01:25.200> feature<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.560> didn't<00:01:25.950> really<00:01:26.100> expect

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
one small feature I didn't really expect

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.730 
one small feature I didn't really expect
is<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:26.850> there's<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.360> huge<00:01:27.689> boost<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.320> speaker

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
is that there's a huge boost and speaker

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.440 
is that there's a huge boost and speaker
performance<00:01:29.310> from<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.579> case<00:01:29.880> there's<00:01:30.390> a

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
performance from this case there's a

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.999 
performance from this case there's a
notch<00:01:30.659> cut<00:01:30.960> out<00:01:30.990> for<00:01:31.290> both<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.560> microphone

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
notch cut out for both the microphone

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.100 
notch cut out for both the microphone
and<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.340> speaker<00:01:32.460> facing<00:01:33.150> forward<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.900> it

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
and the speaker facing forward and it

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.690 
and the speaker facing forward and it
really<00:01:34.350> does<00:01:34.619> direct<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.100> sound<00:01:35.340> right<00:01:35.520> at

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
really does direct the sound right at

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.429 
really does direct the sound right at
you<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.150> sounds<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.659> lot<00:01:36.840> better<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.350> was

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
you and it sounds a lot better it was

00:01:37.439 --> 00:02:00.520 
you and it sounds a lot better it was
really<00:01:37.740> quite<00:01:38.009> surprising<00:01:38.430> take<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> listen

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.169 

now<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.680> case<00:02:01.830> is<00:02:02.009> also<00:02:02.189> pretty<00:02:02.610> thin

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
now this case is also pretty thin

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:04.520 
now this case is also pretty thin
you<00:02:03.330> definitely<00:02:03.539> know<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:03.929> have<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.200> battery

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
you definitely know you have a battery

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.080 
you definitely know you have a battery
case<00:02:04.799> on<00:02:05.009> but<00:02:05.310> for<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.549> amount<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.880> battery

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
case on but for the amount of battery

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.969 
case on but for the amount of battery
life<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.840> get<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.409> actually

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
life that you get this is actually

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.740 
life that you get this is actually
pretty<00:02:08.220> small<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.910> actually<00:02:09.209> found<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.690> the

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
pretty small I actually found that the

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.570 
pretty small I actually found that the
case<00:02:09.899> made<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.259> iPhone<00:02:10.590> feel<00:02:10.769> even<00:02:11.099> better<00:02:11.280> in

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
case made the iPhone feel even better in

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.339 
case made the iPhone feel even better in
the<00:02:11.670> hand<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.150> was<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.390> lot<00:02:12.630> easier<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:13.170> hold

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
the hand and was a lot easier to hold

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.020 
the hand and was a lot easier to hold
it's<00:02:13.709> definitely<00:02:14.160> heavier<00:02:14.519> than<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.880> naked

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
it's definitely heavier than a naked

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.880 
it's definitely heavier than a naked
iPhone<00:02:15.540> but<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:15.870> isn't<00:02:16.170> so<00:02:16.350> heavy<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.799> you

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
iPhone but it isn't so heavy that you

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.650 
iPhone but it isn't so heavy that you
can't<00:02:17.100> carry<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.430> around<00:02:17.580> all<00:02:17.910> day<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:18.540> what

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
can't carry it around all day so what

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.509 
can't carry it around all day so what
kind<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.810> value<00:02:19.110> do<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.290> get<00:02:19.500> well<00:02:20.130> this<00:02:20.310> case

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
kind of value do you get well this case

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.490 
kind of value do you get well this case
has<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.760> great<00:02:21.090> battery<00:02:21.269> life<00:02:21.630> it<00:02:21.959> has<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.230> nice

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
has a great battery life it has a nice

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.380 
has a great battery life it has a nice
kickstand<00:02:23.069> feature<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.700> it's<00:02:23.850> pretty<00:02:24.150> well

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
kickstand feature and it's pretty well

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.180 
kickstand feature and it's pretty well
made<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:25.080> get<00:02:25.200> all<00:02:25.350> these<00:02:25.470> features<00:02:25.890> for<00:02:25.920> a

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
made you get all these features for a

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.750 
made you get all these features for a
cost<00:02:26.459> of<00:02:26.700> $100<00:02:27.600> u.s.<00:02:28.019> and<00:02:28.410> in<00:02:28.830> my<00:02:29.069> mind<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:29.549> is

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
cost of $100 u.s. and in my mind that is

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.059 
cost of $100 u.s. and in my mind that is
a<00:02:29.790> bit<00:02:30.299> pricey<00:02:30.630> yes<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:31.410> get<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.590> great<00:02:31.830> case

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
a bit pricey yes you get a great case

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.680 
a bit pricey yes you get a great case
with<00:02:32.310> some<00:02:32.459> pretty<00:02:32.640> cool<00:02:32.850> features<00:02:33.209> but<00:02:33.540> there

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
with some pretty cool features but there

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.270 
with some pretty cool features but there
are<00:02:33.780> definitely<00:02:34.170> others<00:02:34.470> on<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.769> market<00:02:35.100> for

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
are definitely others on the market for

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.890 
are definitely others on the market for
less<00:02:35.459> I<00:02:35.790> think<00:02:35.850> that<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.269> price<00:02:36.510> is<00:02:36.780> the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
less I think that the price is the

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.509 
less I think that the price is the
biggest<00:02:37.230> weak<00:02:37.410> point<00:02:37.680> for<00:02:37.890> this<00:02:37.980> case<00:02:38.220> at<00:02:38.430> this

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
biggest weak point for this case at this

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:38.840 
biggest weak point for this case at this
time

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
time

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.940 
time
overall<00:02:39.510> this<00:02:39.660> case<00:02:39.870> was<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.140> joy<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.440> have<00:02:40.709> and

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
overall this case was a joy to have and

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.500 
overall this case was a joy to have and
I<00:02:41.010> definitely<00:02:41.190> found<00:02:41.519> myself<00:02:41.760> getting<00:02:42.090> plenty

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
I definitely found myself getting plenty

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.180 
I definitely found myself getting plenty
of<00:02:42.599> use<00:02:42.810> out<00:02:43.019> of<00:02:43.049> it<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.440> features<00:02:43.769> included

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
of use out of it the features included

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.680 
of use out of it the features included
like<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.519> kickstand<00:02:45.000> are<00:02:45.180> definitely<00:02:45.540> nice

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
like the kickstand are definitely nice

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.690 
like the kickstand are definitely nice
to<00:02:45.900> have<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.440> if<00:02:46.590> they<00:02:46.799> stood<00:02:47.190> out<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.579> you

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
to have and if they stood out to you

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.099 
to have and if they stood out to you
then<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:48.000> think<00:02:48.239> you<00:02:48.329> would<00:02:48.450> enjoy<00:02:48.480> this<00:02:48.840> case

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
if the price is too high for you then

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.370 
if the price is too high for you then
there<00:02:50.970> are<00:02:51.090> surely<00:02:51.329> some<00:02:51.720> cheaper<00:02:52.019> options

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
there are surely some cheaper options

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.599 
there are surely some cheaper options
out<00:02:52.500> there<00:02:52.709> so<00:02:52.859> go<00:02:52.950> take<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.160> look<00:02:53.340> at<00:02:53.430> those
