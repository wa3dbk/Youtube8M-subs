00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.619 
hey guys what's up so I thought I'd show
you<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:04.049> new<00:00:04.529> version<00:00:05.100> of<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.339> BS<00:00:05.609> 5<00:00:05.910> I<00:00:06.330> think

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
you the new version of the BS 5 I think

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.450 
you the new version of the BS 5 I think
it<00:00:06.720> looks<00:00:06.930> a<00:00:07.080> little<00:00:07.259> more<00:00:07.589> appealing<00:00:08.069> this

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
it looks a little more appealing this

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.610 
it looks a little more appealing this
time<00:00:08.760> nobody<00:00:09.660> liked<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:11.870> can<00:00:12.870> sticking<00:00:13.500> out

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
time nobody liked the can sticking out

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.970 
time nobody liked the can sticking out
the<00:00:13.650> cone<00:00:14.070> or<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:15.330> two<00:00:16.109> different<00:00:16.470> surround

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
the cone or the two different surround

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.010 
the cone or the two different surround
so<00:00:17.430> hopefully<00:00:18.060> this<00:00:18.270> will<00:00:18.449> do<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.720> little

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
so hopefully this will do a little

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.769 
so hopefully this will do a little
better<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:19.730> will<00:00:20.730> hit<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.029> like<00:00:21.210> button<00:00:21.240> if<00:00:21.720> you

the concept behind the whole length of
the<00:01:36.720> sub<00:01:37.049> 0<00:01:37.200> 4<00:01:37.439> cyl<00:01:38.750> still<00:01:39.750> get<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.430> 10<00:01:41.430> slug

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
the sub 0 4 cyl still get the 10 slug

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.340 
the sub 0 4 cyl still get the 10 slug
motor<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:44.030> think<00:01:45.030> put<00:01:45.360> some<00:01:45.540> more<00:01:45.659> light<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.049> the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
motor I think put some more light on the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:55.280 
motor I think put some more light on the
situation<00:01:52.970> 10<00:01:53.970> slugs<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.600> that's<00:01:54.810> just<00:01:55.079> to

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
situation 10 slugs and that's just to

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.100 
situation 10 slugs and that's just to
stand<00:01:55.560> it's<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.759> holds<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.450> up<00:01:57.570> real<00:01:57.869> nice

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
stand it's on it holds it up real nice

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:06.810 
stand it's on it holds it up real nice
staying<00:01:58.770> in<00:01:58.890> there<00:01:59.100> so

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820
