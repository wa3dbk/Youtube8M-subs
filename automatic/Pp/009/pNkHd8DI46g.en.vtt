00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.770
 the stage dad dad dad the parastatal dad dad dad 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.109
 tucker 

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:14.309
 every cover here that wave friends 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.189
 Today I am going to talk to you a little about that moment we all go through but 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:19.769
 nobody wants to remember 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.140
 when we learned to drive 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.670
 when I learned to drive I signed up for one of those schools 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:26.509
 driving 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.999
 according to them they were the best in quality 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:31.269
 Punctuality and seriousness 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.350
 to my pinches egg 3 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.090
 I was very excited for my first class 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.840
 I expected that I would get a good instructor or an instructor 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.150
 Professional with dress shirt and tie 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.080
 like those that appear on television 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.410
 jajajajaj guaje jejej eye then I could not be more wrong 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.510
 the asshole who touched me as a supposed instructor did not teach me and mothers very 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.850
 just to learn the car and that because he felt like it 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.820
 I do not want to generalize and say that all driving instructors do not know 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.950
 teach to manage 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.100
 but by some who are not professionals 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.379
 they leave us with a bad image of their work 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.320
 like a bad master cop 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.890
 or any other job 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.020
 for those assholes we are left with a bad image 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.450
 but well I already deviated from the subject 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.030
 the ox looked like the only thing that was good was to charge and 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.200
 toss 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.570
 in all the sessions I had with him he was doing other things like talking 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.100
 for his cell phone send fucking messages see the girls well that's 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.030
 passable because I also saw them even that almost coll low ja ja the ox 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.350
 I also ate pistachios or pralines 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.890
 One day he asked me to stop by a store where he had ordered some 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.830
 shirts to pick them up where I took 15 minutes waiting and to top 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.830
 very son of his slut bitch and malparida mother fell asleep 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.080
 the asshole was not anything punctual I was 20 minutes late and I left ten 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.470
 minutes before 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.700
 he was nothing serious in his work and nothing professional 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.030
 therefore, there was no quality in the service provided 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.250
 this son of his fucking mother and his shit the motto of his company in less than 15 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.510
 minutes 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.660
 moral 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.129
 the best instructors a trusted family member who has a lot of patience 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:11.569
 you have confidence 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.590
 and have health insurance in case the flies hahahaha 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.889
 well let's leave aside the bad experience with the instructor and let's talk 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:22.059
 what all the novice drivers go through 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:26.159
 the first time you grab a standard car is that when you turn it on 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:26.969
 they jumped 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:30.019
 because one is not used to using the car 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.190
 once you turn it on if you want to advance, pull it again because you get 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.729
 very fast the pinocho or why do not you accelerate enough 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:40.729
 you can almost hear the car screaming 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:44.499
 tell me you pass you asshole 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:47.219
 that can not synchronize the feet 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:50.819
 once you manage to move without it going off you feel very good 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:51.859
 but suddenly 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:53.359
 comes the second problem 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.779
 the speed change and you can almost hear the car say 

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:02.909
 but what are you crazy 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:07.949
 put second p you're going to create the whole gearbox but at the moment of 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:09.659
 put second something goes wrong 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.359
 and the car is jalonea again and it turns off 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.359
 again you can hear the car say 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.609
 but fucking master April 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.239
 that they pass you piece of bull of forment 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.239
 I want to express to egg the gearbox 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.150
 when you go through those speed change problems and you go out into the real world with 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.309
 other drivers 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:35.889
 you realize that the world is very intolerant of novice drivers 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:41.389
 do not miss the asshole moms dicks that you whistle and saw just to make you 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:42.479
 hard life 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:45.479
 those assholes you should scream colon pool 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.680
 pinochet in de junÃ­n tolerant I'm learning to drive and I'm sure that 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.639
 you ever learned you enlist from your reversal boss with a tsuru 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:55.719
 integrated 

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:58.329
 so get him out of bastard eggs 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:03:59.819
 but do not worry 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.180
 maybe and just maybe 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.210
 that a tolerant driver and that remembers how hard it is to be a rookie and 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.760
 that take the step go to the step they are going 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.450
 or do not whistle at the moment you turn off the car or turn around 

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:15.739
 oo every time you move forward more and more problems arise 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:18.370
 the parking laps 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.100
 the semaphores the dogs that pass through the assholes that 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.750
 they go through what they think of rubber 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.700
 and then at the first red light you start thinking about buying a 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.220
 horse or foot to leg all your life or in using public transport forever 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.550
 or simply to buy an automatic car and forget about so much weight 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.759
 suddenly the traffic light turns green and then you think there are a million 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:43.180
 more problems and the car goes off 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.130
 At that time all the cars start to whistle or the drivers 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.940
 they start to say of fregaderas 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.320
 you start to wish that the earth trembles and treats you or that a meteorite crushes you 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.819
 &amp; co that anything else happens that teza cds problem 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:00.110
 after some moment of nervousness by a miracle can 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.099
 detach the car and accelerate 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:06.409
 a second miracle happens you do not know how it happened but you came to your house 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:09.159
 as soon as you get out of the car, you shake 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:11.689
 and swear never to drive again 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:14.930
 and this is repeated for four or five more days 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.809
 guajaja ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:21.710
 this video I did so that novice drivers are not discouraged 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.479
 and see the good side of life 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:27.629
 do not worry because there are more people like you who are struggling to 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:28.349
 drive 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:31.090
 and that someday they will manage to lead to perfection 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.939
 they just need to practice 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:36.720
 and remember that all of us were also novices ever 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.060
 to be tolerant 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.069
 because we also went through that 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:42.590
 says goodbye to you 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.050
 ares miguel 91 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.050
 until next time 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.479
