 So we'll start like this. 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.110

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.690
 I take a walk 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.670

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.140
 And slowly I'll shoot here. 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.250
 and with that money has a game out 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.790

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.400
 I put it here 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.320
 douala sardine 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.240
 slowly 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.330
 have games where 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.720
 again 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.580
 I'm coming back 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.920
 sara team canary 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.950
 if you throw away 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:10.759
 without him 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:13.200
 in this way 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.500
 for those who do not know how to lose 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.580
 I can do it very slowly until I learn 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.170
 only that 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.069
 philip mold devastated dominated the two needles 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.420
 the rapporteur 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.420
 and this is the critical point 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.310
 every time I finish this career 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.900
 I'm going to turn over my job 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.470
 and I'll start over again 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.420
 remembering that now 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.580
 when this North Movie is on my left side 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.040
 it's because here is the warning of my work 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.800
 again we start here 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.540
 put the woman 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.710
 I'm devastated 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.479
 the shot of river pay 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.020
 the game outside 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.670
 an agreement with iran 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.639
 I do not think anything 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.669
 otherwise it will not happen 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:17.389
 if you drop and with are holding tight to the wireless networks 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:22.689
 I'm devastated and I stay holding him tight I did not let loose 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.689
 because otherwise my work will be very beautiful 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:28.750
 put here again 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.750
 I thought the game was off. 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.599
 I request that the people believed 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:46.209
 when we talk we have a career 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.919
 is the career is one that the palm trees end up in the same woman 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:55.929
 the cord is the one that begins 

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:59.439
 to finish then this is a drawstring
