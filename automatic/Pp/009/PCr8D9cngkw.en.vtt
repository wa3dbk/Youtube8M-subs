00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:11.449
 and for all the kids today I bring you 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.969
 an interesting enough gameplay is worth 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:16.789
 endure endless rounds until which 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.199
 I get out of the balls okay but good 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.880
 I will explain the more or less how 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.349
 Do the time for whoever wants to do it 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.390
 to do first as you have seen 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:26.089
 you have to build the turret of 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.189
 energy and then a companion of the 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:30.199
 paintings that you have to do the 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.020
 almost the entire mari round has complaint 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.629
 he launched bing and will have to have pasta by 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.010
 at least 2000 to be able to open doors 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:38.660
 because you will have to go craig 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.070
 moore that later we will see how the 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.320
 purchases so buy them from dic 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.949
 well now we are taking out of the zombie 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:49.010
 out from inside to be out here 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:51.649
 and now with the single turbine turret is 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.199
 we have to open the first round of 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.449
 this room to not force toxo that will be 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.670
 the street you have to do is take the 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.609
 so far away and that it's time to 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.649
 go out and then put one that goes to the 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.670
 fund are here in total in this 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.670
 corner of a corner 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.700
 the other partner and he has to be 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.990
 where the zombie walks all the time to 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.380
 that he does not leave here and that the doors 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.460
 do not close now we will see what 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.040
 next mind have to do the 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.120
 other classmates I need more 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.520
 first he has to go for the 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.890
 we exclude and I will go to the stop of the 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.680
 it looks station here Notice how the 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.530
 serious on your part of how to buy 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.070
 the ones we read for bought them a thousand 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.520
 there are no more than 420 of those abdominals 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.170
 and now fix what you have to do 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.970
 has to get right in the corner is 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.070
 Okay, you will have squared is the one of the 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.020
 right of the door and you have to be 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.120
 the zombie in front and on Sunday will begin 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.890
 to paste until it falls scientific 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.170
 gelak ley moore and leave it halfway up 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.860
 of the chin and chest then that 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.630
 I will die when he dies where I 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.250
 I have where I was 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.020
 you have to be here is worth the gas station 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.390
 you have to open this door and it will be 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.010
 in here and wait for the zombie that 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.350
 I was hitting eric die then 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.390
 will appear from you are you just 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.490
 here good it depends on what you do 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.870
 will appear here and you have to enter vale 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.550
 You can see that it is there in the background 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.310
 start to come 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.820
 you have to put it in, go out and you have 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.190
 to take him to the station walking and 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.680
 carefully I did not charge in this the 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.170
 bigheads kill us because you have me 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.180
 to wear it, because if not, if you 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.950
 you're going to record this area a lot and what 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.930
 you have to do is take it yourself and 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.510
 saying a little bit a little bit 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.950
 you know he left a piece where he hit the 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.200
 motorway through the area is less than 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.870
 kill that then dragging you there 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.490
 is that round 1 the last on the 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.040
 super of these mines fixed we are by 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.470
 here on the highway and it goes through and 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.590
 little by little can be quite a while 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.600
 bring it is a bit incriminating but at 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.000
 final goes well and some guys set 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.980
 already bring it the station as you will see 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.120
 follow that is still in the corner was 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.840
 up to the middle and inside some 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.610
 we are bringing is in the fog 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.680
 and now what you have to do is kill him 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.050
 right in front of the door Zombie 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.540
 you have to kill him who brought him 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.160
 can kill another that is getting closer 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.640
 little by little 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.590
 and so we kill him already so much inside the 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.620
 door do not have to leave no one has 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.630
 that going out inside we killed him and we 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.310
 we put in inside running I think that 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.710
 this story to eric and otto that will make 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.300
 his second command that there was nobody else and 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.590
 we three coordinate well in 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.810
 do what 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.330
 I would like to fix jce that the rounds 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.710
 they start to pass by themselves, we go to 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.600
 round 2 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.750
 we wait 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.520
 and it was last round 3 we expected round 4 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.180
 more or less we did a calculation as 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.880
 we were up to round 225 waiting and 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.850
 I think that every 13 14 seconds passes a 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:56.300
 round matter set round 13 here what 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:59.150
 I put a fast camera in the 4 round 5 to 6 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.240
 to 7 until enough and now it leaves well 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:07.220
 some short ones like we're not in the round 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:09.710
 99 round 199 200 and then round 225 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:13.370
 there we do not get tired of waiting anymore 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:15.140
 it and went out running and 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.360
 the zombies that there is my mother we 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.730
 are left at the beginning but we come to give 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:23.180
 more laps and followed and once zombies 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:25.800
 of the support to uncle one last when fixing me to 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.409
 round 199 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.580
 final as it happened 200 that deceived us there 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:30.930
 that we were waiting for a while 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.440
 like an hour waiting to get to 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.509
 the round 202 125,000 the map is all 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.110
 natural you know it's like a square 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:43.110
 that there's no note that the zombies went through 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.599
 so good fixed they grabbed the 125 and 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.990
 until there we left here in this battery 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:50.490
 from the corner to help us and notice is 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.190
 something that there was nothing is not given any 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.810
 scream and a bus with which everything happens 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.060
 round only all the time and it turns out that 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.870
 now they start to hear the screams and so 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:03.000
 the colorful and running session is not 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.699
 it depends on doing it was ready it came 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.690
 screaming how it works and there are many today 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:12.990
 look he already wins him and now after 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:15.360
 support a combi are invincible 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.370
 with 20 loaded with will bring me what you kill 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.169
 some guys but that showed up 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.780
 curious this ruling that there is already tropo 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.500
 that supposed to fix everything and also goes up 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.150
 this level 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.710
 I'm superficial this me and you know how 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.060
 came the endless but what has 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.060
 already liked until the next video
