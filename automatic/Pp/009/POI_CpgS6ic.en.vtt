00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
way with that defense so you really have

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.060 
way with that defense so you really have
to<00:03:40.030> make<00:03:40.329> sure<00:03:40.450> you<00:03:40.570> win<00:03:40.810> on<00:03:40.989> first<00:03:41.500> down<00:03:41.769> and

Giants in this game the Giants have the

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.949 
Giants in this game the Giants have the
offensive<00:03:48.670> balance<00:03:49.000> to<00:03:49.510> effectively

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
offensive balance to effectively

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.150 
offensive balance to effectively
neutralized<00:03:50.350> with<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:50.590> Seahawks<00:03:50.739> want<00:03:51.040> to<00:03:51.100> do

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
neutralized with the Seahawks want to do

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.770 
neutralized with the Seahawks want to do
on<00:03:51.250> defense<00:03:51.430> and<00:03:51.850> they<00:03:52.269> have<00:03:52.450> a<00:03:52.480> healthy

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
on defense and they have a healthy

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.380 
on defense and they have a healthy
defense<00:03:53.530> to<00:03:53.950> neutralize<00:03:54.579> with<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:54.910> see<00:03:55.269> how

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
defense to neutralize with the see how

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.729 
defense to neutralize with the see how
it's<00:03:55.510> going<00:03:55.630> to<00:03:55.690> do<00:03:55.780> on<00:03:55.900> office<00:03:56.260> so<00:03:56.620> I<00:03:56.650> think

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
it's going to do on office so I think

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.199 
it's going to do on office so I think
they<00:03:57.250> could<00:03:57.370> have<00:03:57.459> played<00:03:57.609> this<00:03:57.730> game<00:03:57.970> in

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
they could have played this game in

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.690 
they could have played this game in
Boise<00:03:58.690> Idaho<00:03:58.720> and<00:03:59.320> the<00:03:59.650> giant<00:04:00.220> still<00:04:00.400> can<00:04:00.549> come

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
Boise Idaho and the giant still can come

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.340 
Boise Idaho and the giant still can come
out<00:04:00.790> and<00:04:00.850> play<00:04:01.269> balance<00:04:01.720> now<00:04:02.019> if<00:04:02.079> they<00:04:02.200> come

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
out and play balance now if they come

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.960 
out and play balance now if they come
out<00:04:02.500> with<00:04:02.769> a<00:04:02.799> slow<00:04:03.100> start<00:04:03.370> the<00:04:03.489> Seahawks<00:04:03.820> can

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
out with a slow start the Seahawks can

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.940 
out with a slow start the Seahawks can
effectively<00:04:04.239> keep<00:04:04.810> this<00:04:04.989> a<00:04:05.049> game<00:04:05.350> and<00:04:05.590> win
