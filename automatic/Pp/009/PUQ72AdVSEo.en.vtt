00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.249 

so<00:00:01.040> in<00:00:02.040> this<00:00:02.370> video<00:00:02.580> I'm<00:00:03.000> going<00:00:03.389> to<00:00:03.510> talk<00:00:03.689> about

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
so in this video I'm going to talk about

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.450 
so in this video I'm going to talk about
hole<00:00:04.890> I<00:00:05.160> sold<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.970> pyramids<00:00:06.600> I<00:00:07.160> have<00:00:08.160> written

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
hole I sold the pyramids I have written

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.330 
hole I sold the pyramids I have written
down<00:00:08.610> some<00:00:09.059> notes<00:00:09.269> here<00:00:09.650> basically<00:00:10.650> explains

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
down some notes here basically explains

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.419 
down some notes here basically explains
how<00:00:11.550> I<00:00:11.790> solve<00:00:12.179> it<00:00:12.620> so<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:13.679> have<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.219> last

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
how I solve it so you have the last

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.480 
how I solve it so you have the last
three<00:00:15.000> edges<00:00:15.269> I'm<00:00:15.900> going<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.289> go<00:00:16.980> through<00:00:17.279> this

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
three edges I'm going to go through this

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.179 
three edges I'm going to go through this
method<00:00:17.789> from<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.390> back<00:00:18.750> if<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.439> begin<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.770> say

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
method from the back if I begin to say

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.800 
method from the back if I begin to say
what<00:00:20.430> you're<00:00:20.550> going<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.789> solve<00:00:21.029> first<00:00:21.359> you

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
what you're going to solve first you

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.929 
what you're going to solve first you
will<00:00:22.230> never<00:00:22.529> get<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.519> last<00:00:23.670> step<00:00:23.760> is

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
will never get it so the last step is

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.340 
will never get it so the last step is
last<00:00:24.150> three<00:00:24.420> edges<00:00:24.570> we<00:00:24.869> don't<00:00:25.050> have<00:00:25.199> to

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
last three edges we don't have to

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.220 
last three edges we don't have to
explain<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.769> at<00:00:25.949> all<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.670> let's<00:00:26.880> just<00:00:27.230> start

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
explain that at all so let's just start

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.600 
explain that at all so let's just start
from<00:00:28.349> here<00:00:29.119> so<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:31.109> want<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.590> know<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.309> lot<00:00:32.550> of

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
from here so you want to know a lot of

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.940 
from here so you want to know a lot of
easy<00:00:32.940> cases<00:00:33.300> from<00:00:33.750> different<00:00:34.200> methods<00:00:34.590> to

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
easy cases from different methods to

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.119 
easy cases from different methods to
make<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.250> work<00:00:35.579> smooth<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.530> you<00:00:37.530> want<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.890> set

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
make this work smooth so you want to set

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.220 
make this work smooth so you want to set
it<00:00:38.250> up<00:00:38.340> into<00:00:38.820> an<00:00:38.940> easy<00:00:39.210> case<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.960> have<00:00:40.079> to

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
it up into an easy case you have to

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.979 
it up into an easy case you have to
think<00:00:40.410> what<00:00:40.890> possible<00:00:41.820> easy<00:00:42.180> case<00:00:42.660> could<00:00:42.960> i

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
think what possible easy case could i

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.500 
think what possible easy case could i
set<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.379> up<00:00:43.530> into<00:00:43.800> well<00:00:44.579> your<00:00:44.730> figured<00:00:45.149> i<00:00:45.329> can

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
set this up into well your figured i can

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.299 
set this up into well your figured i can
say<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.780> i<00:00:45.960> can<00:00:46.289> probably<00:00:46.530> set<00:00:46.770> up<00:00:46.950> into<00:00:47.190> this

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
say that i can probably set up into this

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.240 
say that i can probably set up into this
case<00:00:47.610> then<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.450> can<00:00:48.719> begin<00:00:49.320> looking<00:00:49.680> how<00:00:50.190> do

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
case then you can begin looking how do

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.670 
case then you can begin looking how do
they<00:00:50.460> get<00:00:50.760> from<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.600> scramble<00:00:51.989> state<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.530> this

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
they get from the scramble state to this

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.299 
they get from the scramble state to this
easy<00:00:53.129> case<00:00:53.550> here<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.629> saw<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.829> cancel

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
easy case here so you saw you cancel

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.930 
easy case here so you saw you cancel
this<00:00:56.760> step<00:00:57.360> before<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.320> know<00:00:58.620> what<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.250> step

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
this step before you know what this step

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.330 
this step before you know what this step
is<00:01:00.120> going<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.449> be<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.410> kind<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.829> sub<00:01:02.070> steps

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
is going to be this is kind of sub steps

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.030 
is going to be this is kind of sub steps
this<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:03.270> solving<00:01:03.629> everything<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.439> lost

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
this is just solving everything but lost

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.100 
this is just solving everything but lost
three<00:01:05.369> edges<00:01:05.519> by<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.939> way<00:01:06.150> that's<00:01:06.540> about<00:01:07.080> it

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
three edges by the way that's about it

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.460 
three edges by the way that's about it
so<00:01:07.950> let's<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:08.670> look<00:01:08.850> at<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.180> all<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:10.290> thing

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
so let's just look at this all the thing

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.320 
so let's just look at this all the thing
is<00:01:10.619> right<00:01:10.860> now<00:01:11.010> I'm<00:01:11.130> seeing<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.760> lot<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.970> easy

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
is right now I'm seeing a lot of easy

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.350 
is right now I'm seeing a lot of easy
cases<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:13.200> could<00:01:13.950> set<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.220> up<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.700> but<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.119> can't

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
cases I could set it up to but it can't

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.560 
cases I could set it up to but it can't
find<00:01:15.659> anything<00:01:16.790> intuitively<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:18.090> get<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.420> that

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
find anything intuitively to get to that

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.800 
find anything intuitively to get to that
case<00:01:19.049> fast<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:20.100> one<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.909> my<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.270> was<00:01:21.570> actually

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
case fast so one of my I was actually

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.990 
case fast so one of my I was actually
trying<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.229> set<00:01:22.830> up<00:01:22.920> into<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.369> one<00:01:23.580> flip<00:01:23.820> with

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
trying to set up into the one flip with

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.020 
trying to set up into the one flip with
two<00:01:24.299> centers<00:01:24.750> but<00:01:25.049> i<00:01:25.290> can<00:01:26.159> see<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.430> i<00:01:26.670> can<00:01:26.850> set

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
two centers but i can see that i can set

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.569 
two centers but i can see that i can set
up<00:01:27.180> into<00:01:27.450> one<00:01:27.810> flip<00:01:28.080> with<00:01:28.259> one<00:01:28.470> edge<00:01:28.710> one

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
up into one flip with one edge one

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.719 
up into one flip with one edge one
Center<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.470> three<00:01:31.470> moves<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:31.979> that's<00:01:32.189> fine<00:01:32.700> for

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
Center in three moves so that's fine for

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.039 
Center in three moves so that's fine for
me<00:01:33.560> so<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.700> set<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.000> up<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.299> then<00:01:36.689> I

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
me so I do that to set it up and then I

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.380 
me so I do that to set it up and then I
saw<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.439> all<00:01:37.860> done<00:01:38.250> I'm<00:01:38.610> not<00:01:38.820> going<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.180> slow

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
saw it all done I'm not going to slow

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.130 
saw it all done I'm not going to slow
down<00:01:39.540> for<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.500> if<00:01:40.979> you're<00:01:41.189> here<00:01:41.520> for

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
down for you so if you're here for

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.380 
down for you so if you're here for
learning<00:01:43.140> anything<00:01:43.500> except<00:01:44.340> how<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:45.060> method

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
learning anything except how the method

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.510 
learning anything except how the method
works<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.869> might<00:01:46.049> want<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.439> go<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.369> walk

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
works you might want to go to the walk

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.130 
works you might want to go to the walk
through<00:01:47.820> salt<00:01:48.090> we're<00:01:48.329> actually<00:01:48.479> go<00:01:48.810> slowly

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
through salt we're actually go slowly

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.910 
through salt we're actually go slowly
through<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.640> soles<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.439> this<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.619> would<00:01:52.740> set

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
through the soles and this I would set

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.959 
through the soles and this I would set
it<00:01:52.950> up<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.890> actually<00:01:55.890> it's<00:01:56.009> one<00:01:56.219> flat<00:01:56.490> it's

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
it up to a actually it's one flat it's

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.929 
it up to a actually it's one flat it's
like<00:01:57.329> one<00:01:57.689> move<00:01:57.869> into<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.229> one<00:01:58.259> flip<00:01:58.619> case<00:01:58.939> and

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
like one move into a one flip case and

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.030 
like one move into a one flip case and
then<00:02:00.030> just<00:02:00.210> all<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:03.079> so<00:02:04.079> here<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.500> can<00:02:04.770> set<00:02:04.920> up

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
then just all that so here I can set up

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.029 
then just all that so here I can set up
into<00:02:05.369> an<00:02:05.640> ECA<00:02:06.119> keyhole<00:02:06.570> Ches<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.560> two<00:02:07.799> moves

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
into an ECA keyhole Ches and two moves

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.360 
into an ECA keyhole Ches and two moves
one<00:02:08.789> two<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.780> i<00:02:09.869> have<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.140> edge<00:02:10.259> piece<00:02:10.560> on<00:02:10.979> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
one two and i have the edge piece on the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.339 
one two and i have the edge piece on the
center<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:11.910> just<00:02:12.180> insert

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
center I just insert

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.920 
center I just insert
I'm<00:02:14.349> done<00:02:15.340> one<00:02:16.150> flip<00:02:16.680> three<00:02:17.680> moves<00:02:17.920> I<00:02:18.220> think

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
I'm done one flip three moves I think

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.460 
I'm done one flip three moves I think
one<00:02:19.930> or<00:02:20.379> two<00:02:20.709> no<00:02:21.280> three<00:02:21.549> two<00:02:22.060> three<00:02:22.390> so<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:23.260> have

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
one or two no three two three so I have

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.149 
one or two no three two three so I have
one<00:02:24.269> edge<00:02:25.269> and<00:02:25.629> two<00:02:26.290> centers<00:02:26.709> are<00:02:26.860> lots<00:02:27.040> of

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
one edge and two centers are lots of

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:31.619 
one edge and two centers are lots of
cake<00:02:27.459> and<00:02:28.230> by<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.260> way<00:02:29.440> you<00:02:30.280> are<00:02:30.760> totally<00:02:31.329> the

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
cake and by the way you are totally the

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.710 
cake and by the way you are totally the
person<00:02:32.200> who<00:02:32.349> decides<00:02:32.709> what<00:02:33.340> an<00:02:33.640> easy<00:02:34.150> case<00:02:34.450> is

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
person who decides what an easy case is

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.800 
person who decides what an easy case is
it's<00:02:35.260> not<00:02:35.500> like<00:02:35.829> there<00:02:36.790> is<00:02:36.940> a<00:02:36.970> list<00:02:37.329> of<00:02:37.540> easy

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
it's not like there is a list of easy

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.099 
it's not like there is a list of easy
cases<00:02:38.170> you<00:02:38.560> just<00:02:38.829> find<00:02:39.579> the<00:02:39.760> cases<00:02:40.209> from<00:02:40.450> all

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109 
cases you just find the cases from all

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:42.960 
cases you just find the cases from all
the<00:02:41.319> message<00:02:41.680> you<00:02:41.920> know<00:02:42.069> and<00:02:42.400> then<00:02:42.519> just<00:02:42.730> say

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
the message you know and then just say

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.270 
the message you know and then just say
oh<00:02:43.629> that<00:02:43.689> one<00:02:44.109> is<00:02:44.140> easy<00:02:44.349> so<00:02:44.739> I<00:02:44.769> could<00:02:44.980> use<00:02:45.129> that

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
oh that one is easy so I could use that

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.160 
oh that one is easy so I could use that
one<00:02:45.519> then<00:02:45.730> I<00:02:45.940> think<00:02:46.480> this<00:02:46.599> is<00:02:46.750> kind<00:02:46.959> of<00:02:47.109> the

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
one then I think this is kind of the

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.259 
one then I think this is kind of the
same<00:02:47.440> way<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.950> computer<00:02:48.579> sold<00:02:48.879> a

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
same way a computer sold a

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.830 
same way a computer sold a
three-by-three<00:02:50.099> when<00:02:51.099> it's<00:02:51.250> doing<00:02:52.120> this<00:02:52.299> send

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
three-by-three when it's doing this send

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.599 
three-by-three when it's doing this send
me<00:02:52.900> optimal<00:02:53.379> scrambles<00:02:53.859> of<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.129> optimal

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
me optimal scrambles of the optimal

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.869 
me optimal scrambles of the optimal
scrambles<00:02:55.060> it<00:02:55.780> pretty<00:02:56.049> much<00:02:56.139> knows<00:02:56.650> a<00:02:56.920> lot<00:02:57.730> of

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
scrambles it pretty much knows a lot of

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.280 
scrambles it pretty much knows a lot of
cases<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.920> then<00:02:59.920> it<00:03:00.190> figures<00:03:00.430> out<00:03:00.760> how<00:03:01.120> to<00:03:01.290> get

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
cases and then it figures out how to get

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.339 
cases and then it figures out how to get
to<00:03:02.709> any<00:03:03.069> of<00:03:03.220> those<00:03:03.370> cases<00:03:03.700> so<00:03:04.389> especially<00:03:04.780> such

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
to any of those cases so especially such

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.550 
to any of those cases so especially such
just<00:03:05.739> searching<00:03:06.340> for<00:03:06.370> a<00:03:07.209> solution<00:03:07.930> that<00:03:08.290> will

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
just searching for a solution that will

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.069 
just searching for a solution that will
solve<00:03:08.799> it<00:03:09.040> into<00:03:09.340> one<00:03:09.519> of<00:03:09.639> the<00:03:09.760> cases<00:03:10.030> it<00:03:10.720> knows

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
solve it into one of the cases it knows

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.309 
solve it into one of the cases it knows
that<00:03:11.879> was<00:03:12.879> actually<00:03:13.180> my<00:03:13.480> idea<00:03:13.510> back<00:03:14.049> when<00:03:14.290> I

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
that was actually my idea back when I

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.030 
that was actually my idea back when I
decided<00:03:14.920> to<00:03:15.280> begin<00:03:15.970> solving<00:03:16.299> it<00:03:16.629> like<00:03:16.840> this<00:03:17.109> so

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
decided to begin solving it like this so

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.150 
decided to begin solving it like this so
hopefully<00:03:18.609> you<00:03:19.090> get<00:03:20.019> something<00:03:20.650> out<00:03:20.859> of<00:03:20.919> this

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
hopefully you get something out of this

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.420 
hopefully you get something out of this
video<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:22.060> I<00:03:22.690> might<00:03:23.560> well<00:03:23.769> I<00:03:24.010> might<00:03:24.220> have<00:03:24.400> to

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
video and I might well I might have to

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.780 
video and I might well I might have to
say<00:03:24.819> that<00:03:25.120> it's<00:03:25.329> not<00:03:26.129> very<00:03:27.129> beginner<00:03:27.579> friendly

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
say that it's not very beginner friendly

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.720 
say that it's not very beginner friendly
you<00:03:28.599> kind<00:03:29.560> of<00:03:29.650> have<00:03:30.069> to<00:03:30.099> know<00:03:30.430> how<00:03:30.669> the

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
you kind of have to know how the

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.640 
you kind of have to know how the
parameter<00:03:31.299> works<00:03:31.690> and<00:03:32.019> all<00:03:32.109> like<00:03:32.290> all<00:03:32.500> the

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
parameter works and all like all the

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.229 
parameter works and all like all the
things<00:03:32.859> like<00:03:33.010> that<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:33.430> make<00:03:33.819> this<00:03:34.000> run
