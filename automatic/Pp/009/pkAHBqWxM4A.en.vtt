00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
the fade this cross Vegas ended up the

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.050 
the fade this cross Vegas ended up the
way<00:02:16.470> that<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.680> would<00:02:16.800> have<00:02:16.980> liked<00:02:17.190> it<00:02:17.370> was<00:02:17.520> um<00:02:17.760> it

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
way that I would have liked it was um it

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.600 
way that I would have liked it was um it
was<00:02:18.510> hard<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:19.140> broke<00:02:19.590> up<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.980> big<00:02:20.130> groups<00:02:20.400> and

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
was hard it broke up the big groups and

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.640 
was hard it broke up the big groups and
to<00:02:21.060> see<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.420> group<00:02:21.630> actually<00:02:21.870> split<00:02:22.320> and<00:02:22.470> stay

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
to see the group actually split and stay

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.580 
to see the group actually split and stay
split<00:02:23.010> was<00:02:23.730> definitely<00:02:24.480> better<00:02:24.780> for<00:02:25.170> someone

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
split was definitely better for someone

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.860 
split was definitely better for someone
like<00:02:25.680> me<00:02:25.890> or<00:02:26.100> Jeremy<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.060> didn't<00:02:27.780> play

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
like me or Jeremy and and didn't play

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.229 
like me or Jeremy and and didn't play
into<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.290> sit<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.340> wait<00:02:29.430> wait<00:02:29.640> wait<00:02:29.850> wait<00:02:30.060> and

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
into the sit and wait wait wait wait and

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.330 
into the sit and wait wait wait wait and
sprint<00:02:30.510> tactic<00:02:31.080> so<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.500> think<00:02:31.770> it<00:02:31.920> ended<00:02:32.250> up

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
sprint tactic so I think it ended up

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.540 
sprint tactic so I think it ended up
being<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:32.670> way<00:02:32.760> that<00:02:32.790> I<00:02:32.940> would<00:02:33.030> white<00:02:33.360> yeah

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
being the way that I would white yeah

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.570 
being the way that I would white yeah
yeah<00:02:35.550> it's<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:36.140> it's<00:02:37.140> always<00:02:37.590> a<00:02:37.620> fast<00:02:37.980> race<00:02:38.250> over
