sweet spot you're doing pretty good is

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.229 
sweet spot you're doing pretty good is
that<00:00:36.989> like<00:00:37.170> on<00:00:37.320> two<00:00:37.500> times<00:00:37.770> it's<00:00:38.670> not<00:00:38.850> that's

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
that like on two times it's not that's

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.360 
that like on two times it's not that's
just<00:00:39.360> how<00:00:39.480> fast<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.899> tank<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.320> it's<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.309> little

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.220 
just how fast this tank is it's a little
jumpy<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.120> probably<00:00:42.690> because<00:00:43.079> it's

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
jumpy and I probably because it's

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.350 
jumpy and I probably because it's

these new tanks to the limit see what i

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.520 
these new tanks to the limit see what i
could<00:01:42.810> do<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.409> here's<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.619> cave<00:01:43.799> III<00:01:44.329> biome<00:01:45.530> 240

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
could do so here's a cave III biome 240

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.389 
could do so here's a cave III biome 240
damage<00:01:46.860> right<00:01:47.009> there<00:01:47.040> on<00:01:47.340> him<00:01:47.659> think<00:01:48.659> he's<00:01:48.869> and

530 out of the jag egg pant jagdpanther

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.270 
530 out of the jag egg pant jagdpanther
right<00:01:53.040> there<00:01:53.450> right<00:01:54.450> right<00:01:54.960> there<00:01:55.200> I'm<00:01:56.100> gonna

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
right there right right there I'm gonna

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
start doing an alum ith so obviously

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.789 
start doing an alum ith so obviously
that<00:01:59.130> yags<00:01:59.399> gun<00:01:59.729> is<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.939> lot<00:02:00.119> better<00:02:00.299> than<00:02:00.479> mine

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
that yags gun is a lot better than mine

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.139 
that yags gun is a lot better than mine
but<00:02:01.799> great<00:02:02.040> hit<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.520> thing<00:02:02.700> did<00:02:02.850> reload

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
but great hit and the thing did reload

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.660 
but great hit and the thing did reload
pretty<00:02:03.390> fast<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.990> probably<00:02:04.890> have<00:02:05.070> too<00:02:05.189> much<00:02:05.310> hg

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
pretty fast I probably have too much hg

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.749 
pretty fast I probably have too much hg
in<00:02:05.729> this<00:02:05.850> thing<00:02:06.350> I'm<00:02:07.350> not<00:02:07.500> even<00:02:07.740> just<00:02:07.829> go<00:02:08.039> to

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
in this thing I'm not even just go to

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.460 
in this thing I'm not even just go to
heb<00:02:08.970> cuz<00:02:09.390> look<00:02:09.569> how<00:02:09.629> many<00:02:09.720> shells<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.200> have<00:02:10.349> like

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
heb cuz look how many shells I have like

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.880 
heb cuz look how many shells I have like
thirty<00:02:11.160> three<00:02:11.459> shells<00:02:11.730> or<00:02:11.940> something

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
thirty three shells or something

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.349 
thirty three shells or something
so<00:02:13.890> we're<00:02:14.219> pretty<00:02:14.519> much<00:02:14.640> crushed<00:02:14.999> him<00:02:15.209> over

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:15.359 
so we're pretty much crushed him over

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:16.759 
so we're pretty much crushed him over
here<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.540> think<00:02:15.749> it's<00:02:15.840> time<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:16.019> move<00:02:16.230> in<00:02:16.409> like

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
here I think it's time to move in like

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.449 
here I think it's time to move in like
I'm<00:02:16.950> about<00:02:17.159> to<00:02:17.310> move<00:02:17.459> in<00:02:17.609> here<00:02:17.639> yeah<00:02:19.280> so<00:02:20.280> that's

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
I'm about to move in here yeah so that's

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.520 
I'm about to move in here yeah so that's
another<00:02:21.150> thing<00:02:21.389> I<00:02:21.480> like<00:02:21.569> about<00:02:21.629> this<00:02:21.870> tank<00:02:22.109> you

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
another thing I like about this tank you

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.470 
another thing I like about this tank you
can<00:02:22.560> move<00:02:22.799> up<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.159> get<00:02:23.280> in<00:02:23.370> into<00:02:23.819> position<00:02:24.389> and

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
can move up and get in into position and

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.729 
can move up and get in into position and
sit<00:02:24.689> there<00:02:24.840> for<00:02:24.989> a<00:02:25.049> while<00:02:25.139> and<00:02:25.379> not<00:02:25.469> have<00:02:25.650> to

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
sit there for a while and not have to

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.709 
sit there for a while and not have to
worry<00:02:25.769> too<00:02:26.010> much<00:02:26.099> about<00:02:26.249> about<00:02:27.150> your<00:02:27.359> allies

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719 
worry too much about about your allies

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:29.300 
worry too much about about your allies
pushing<00:02:28.109> ahead<00:02:28.230> too<00:02:28.499> much<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.950> where<00:02:29.040> you

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
pushing ahead too much to where you

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.309 
pushing ahead too much to where you
can't<00:02:29.549> shoot<00:02:29.819> at<00:02:29.969> enemies<00:02:30.150> because<00:02:31.109> you<00:02:31.200> can

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
can't shoot at enemies because you can

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.670 
can't shoot at enemies because you can
really<00:02:31.519> relocate<00:02:32.519> pretty<00:02:32.730> quick<00:02:33.500> so<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.530> can

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
really relocate pretty quick so you can

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.149 
really relocate pretty quick so you can
