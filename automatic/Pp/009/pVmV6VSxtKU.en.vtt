00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.170
 very good all here the gamers and today 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.190
 we are in a shadow gameplay 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.980
 gunderson because I wanted to bring them because 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.980
 how is a game free to feel free to 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.940
 play that came out and they can 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.399
 to download 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.710
 if I remember I'll leave you online in 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.420
 the part in the description so that 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.460
 can click and download good if 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.579
 I do not want it to be gameplays either 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.530
 a lot so as you see I had a 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.350
 account before but I did an hour to 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.509
 start from scratch with you and I have the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.000
 macro that at level 4 duel is blocked by 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.790
 teams so let's take a 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.729
 partidita here I have it in English 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.860
 village tempo in Spanish so if you see 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.530
 what if they like the game go down only 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.860
 because I recommend it a lot 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.860
 good 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.820
 It is not that it has many things but 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.369
 when you are farting 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.030
 I for the game I'm not very good like that 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:39.100
 what 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.100
 neither do they ask me for much fasting 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.850
 we kill him walking 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.770
 we throw ourselves to the ground to death 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.259
 they saw that pump for biogas 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.790
 in the whole face in the whole face 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:02.630
 we hope we put 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.630
 we're 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.060

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:49.260

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.780

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:41.879
 a game 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.730
 as you want to talk 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.560
 but nothing 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.250
 one 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.220

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.900
 we are also 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.300

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.830

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.530

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:18.290
 the seventh we were going so let's see if 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.470
 we can rooms finish the first 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.890
 first gameplay 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.890
 good 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.180
 there are comets and of all the mine times I 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.780
 gave some complete because I have the 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.780
 own garden 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.450
 come on we can 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.020
 where I can 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.880
 or told me 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.970
 the whore 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:58.110
 well he does not come to the one who happened there 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.820
 but 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.820
 something strange happens now 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.740
 like any other that has 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:14.649
 we move up 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:21.190
 well we continue to third the boy but 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.670
 third 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:27.120
 18 more or less younger we can 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.120
 overcome it 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.490
 how do you say 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.260
 taking 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.060
 well I had little life again 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:00.530
 I know I 'm going to upload the example and several 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:04.120
 already have if you see that somewhere in some 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:05.980
 gameplay I'm level 4 something do not get scared 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.060
 this killed this 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.060
 or if it does not kill me 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.759
 well I kill myself but the maternal 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.919
 assistance is surely made 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:18.900
 gameplay now I dream the 2 but if I go up 1 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:21.229
 doing level 4 or 5 do not get scared 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.210
 because I will be playing and recording 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:26.900
 so 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.900
 I'm going to go up 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.500
 shared 

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:38.060
 the strongest route 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.060
 or we go bad or we go bad 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:45.960
 there are not 23 seconds left to finish 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:48.830
 they are short farewells 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.830
 one 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.479
 only too 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:07.470
 and the whole good face ends the game 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:09.570
 we finished fourth 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:12.000
 to do it in re first game no 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:14.510
 pretty good pretty good 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.510
 do not 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.790
 back to the beginning 

00:07:21.459 --> 00:07:28.299
 But I do not know 

00:07:24.019 --> 00:07:28.299
 good for being first things first 

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:35.840
 About 17,000 

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.969
 well we cut that because if it's not very 

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:42.079

00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:44.879
