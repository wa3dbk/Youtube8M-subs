00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.790
 the last days I have completely 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.549
 Miserable attempts had mandl only 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.959
 determine and then is appropriate 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.760
 The vegan chocolate is nothing 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.410
 become 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.810
 but today I go to the almond milk 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.000
 and that should actually work and 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.980
 yoga is just below it 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.089
 made friends 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.179
 found fallen mandl and 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:32.970
 cracked I have 100 grams of almonds here 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.860
 so that half a pack and have 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.890
 I already peeled at the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.260
 try with almond must make 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.390
 I bought you in the shell 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.350
 in all the costs the faith lies euro 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.120
 or something 120 and then I have hot 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.240
 water put on boiling water 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.860
 have you put so much minute in there 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.990
 you have then under cold water 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.000
 rinsed off and then you can easily 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.980
 squeeze out of the shell 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.870
 works really well 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.450
 yes and the half I have just for 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.210
 the model has to be used up and the second one 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.920
 half now for milk me 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.929
 that will also agave a bit 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.140
 thick juice between and with a few 

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:14.850
 mandates 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.920
 and then there's half of it 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.460
 liter of water so you have about one 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.369
 half a liter of almond milk has now become 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.130
 I with the pulse function of my mixas 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.679
 First the trade a bit rough 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.140
 chop 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:33.899
 Of course, that can be smaller 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.429
 food processor and stuff and milk 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.259
 I'll whip up in the mixer 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:41.819
 but I do not think so 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.889
 Stabmixer what I'll be seven 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:47.639
 pose with me use 

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:50.130
 Let's see how sweet tastan heard and 

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:55.109
 Here of course you have previously in stone 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:58.490
 before you put them in there because of it 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:58.490
 just get the stone out 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.280
 so that the cleaning function can be seen 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.280
 I already now construct you 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.709
 get shredded 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:14.300
 okay so and then I'll give it now 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.300
 my bags with pure 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:29.540
 a shot of agave dicksaft water and 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.010
 then purÃ©e the whole thing again 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.470
 I have now perhaps minute 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.040
 polished that our mixed on the 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.750
 middle level of a mix and it is 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.709
 already a pretty nice white 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.709
 possible liquid won 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:52.319
 a few more saddle pieces 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:55.410
 I will now just another 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.730
 two minutes nixon paulus result 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.290
 I smell like a lick 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:05.700
 I think I will admit it 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:10.019
 shoot agaven dix I like it 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:15.060
 but he then when I see the milk you 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:21.120
 too little and I will now 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:23.220
 through seven for one with one drinks 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.100
 the woman has to free me guess has 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.069
 and to take a fine tights 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:33.480
 so simple, they have here very cheap 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:38.010
 to have bought in aldi and yes 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:43.739
 one could take up and say that 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:46.730
 totally elegant too the quality 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.730
 really high quality 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:57.410
 and I'll think so now 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.410
 Cut off such a leg piece here 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.959
 yes , I have a piece of bavaria 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.580
 now cut off 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.780
 that's pretty good as well as with that 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.430
 It is so oblong then I can do it 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.860
 namely on my glass piece through the 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.760
 wants to fill 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.600
 that works like me 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:32.150
 introduce and then I give to therefore 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:32.150
 one of me looks great 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.740
 that's really green aperture 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:55.429
 does not mess with it a bit 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:58.550
 just yourself and yes what that step 

00:04:55.429 --> 00:05:00.589
 it remains that one should really 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:04.459
 not throw away that would be a pity 

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:07.489
 So here you can see that because it can 

00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:12.979
 You can either make it into the cereal 

00:05:07.489 --> 00:05:17.479
 great for cake and biscuits dough 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:20.689
 use that advice now before the 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:28.699
 Christmas season I know it really well 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:41.800
 to bake or whatever else 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:41.800
 comes to mind when I'm around here 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:50.439
 of course it is was much easier 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:58.189
 Production trade with to buy 

00:05:50.439 --> 00:06:02.139
 but that is really super expensive and stuff 

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:03.889
 you can choose the sweet ones yourself 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:06.679
 I'm fine with that too 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:08.869
 Imagine that there maybe cocos 

00:06:06.679 --> 00:06:13.729
 three more power are pure 

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:17.329
 and so what and above all you have then 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:18.860
 also just this whole surplus if 

00:06:17.329 --> 00:06:24.069
 you do not have if you look at the 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:26.599
 you want to buy me finished and you want me 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:28.029
 then just for me too 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:32.559
 can use 

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:34.789
 yes, the mixa is now empty 

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:39.079
 it is always for the crowd home 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:41.269
 I think I'll throw in one 

00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:43.029
 a little less also says so to me 

00:06:41.269 --> 00:06:46.249
 bit next public principle 

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:48.139
 but I am trying now and am happy 

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:52.179
 to drink my coffee and 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:52.179
 to make me a cocoa with it 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.620
 after a tip to finish the 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.370
 Of course you can get an impression again 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.900
 use 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.460
 I just turned left now 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.470
 and was now really nice 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.610
 and then you can just do that 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:06.569
 maybe to your teesieb or something 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:10.270
 lay and use again and again 

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:12.509
 have fun in your own convertible me 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.509
 makes
