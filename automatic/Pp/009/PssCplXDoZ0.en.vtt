00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.720
 sometimes choosing a car is not 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.939
 not at all easy and especially 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.250
 when it comes to the small cars that 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.019
 between engine and vehicle versions 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.019
 facilities are a bit all the same 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.800
 for example this new generation of 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.930
 tiny engines that everyone is talking about 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.380
 from a liter or even less 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.380
 but it is to be trusted 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.600
 actually we have already tried them 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.010
 several and we also know that the 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.010
 better is called strong 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.110
 this three- cylinder engine is a given goal 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.450
 which is already mounted on four models 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.550
 different and even equips the 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.900
 big c max has received praise e 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.900
 awards from all over Europe 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.040
 small but not just for small cars 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.640
 even if the fiesta looks made for it 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.620
 for him 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.620
 we had already tried it last December 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:30.960
 in the 100-horsepower turbo version 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.960
 which are perhaps too many 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:36.860
 what do you say we do a bit of spending 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.619
 review we give up 20 horses and the 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.770
 list price immediately drops by 2,200 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.770
 EUR 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.740
 the ecoboost engine this power of 80 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.160
 horses lost the bus but remains 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.620
 however ecological the house is the homologue with 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.250
 105 grams of carbon dioxide per 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.260
 kilometer 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.050
 and also in our tests and consumption not 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.240
 goes bad but you have to drive according to 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.380
 nature of this engine therefore without 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.380
 exaggerate with the accelerator 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.790
 in the city with a loose guide it almost does 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.980
 13 kilometers with a liter and in 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.930
 highway at a distance more or less 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.300
 equal better than i 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.130
 renault and peugeot competitors only the 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.210
 yaris actress indri manages to make a 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.370
 better bit 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.170
 therefore a nice hoard saved 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.240
 enough to get gas for a year 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.920
 maybe even a year and a half but if 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.750
 I give up the turbo I have to give up 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.850
 something else 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.920
 the version is practically non - existent 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.440
 titanium the most equipped among the 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.300
 motorizations from 80 horses to a series 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.220
 of electronic news that we like 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.400
 all because they go in the direction 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.440
 of greater security 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.020
 let's take this key for example yes 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.940
 never call who you remember when i 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.010
 your parents for the first time me 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.960
 they gave the car keys and said me 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.270
 I recommend go flat fasten your seat belts 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:06.980
 and always look at the fuel level 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.870
 well this is the modern version and more 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.360
 effective of the words of dad and mom 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.160
 on the key can be programmed 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.490
 a series of security features plus 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.490
 stringent 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.070
 when you use it for example the car does not 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.990
 exceeds 130 kilometers per hour and launches 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.660
 acoustic warnings when exceeded 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:29.480
 programmable speeds between 70 and 140 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.700
 kilometers per hour 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.260
 it might seem a little limitation to 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.390
 130 kilometers per hour 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.849
 since in an accident you can already 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.099
 do very badly at 50 per hour but a 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.720
 survey done throughout europe tells us 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.879
 than more than half of parents 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.500
 they would be more favorable to giving the car 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:49.610
 to children if they could somehow 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:52.040
 moderate performance but it is not the only one 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.500
 mikey characteristic for example not 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.329
 it can be disarmed plus the east cannot be 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.090
 increase the volume of the radio beyond one 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.799
 certain threshold is the light of the reserve yes 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.480
 lights up when autonomy goes down 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:08.540
 the 120 km instead of the usual 50 the spy 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.190
 belts never go out until you do 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.010
 they don't even work 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.930
 the audio system 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.030
 as proof of the validity of this 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.430
 system in the united states the ford 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.040
 puts on virtually all models and 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.250
 the euro and in both ip has conferred a 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.810
 special safety award 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.120
 It is estimated that if all the cars in 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.669
 Europe had the one who ever could 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.210
 avoid 4 thousand accidents and over 150 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.210
 dead 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.980
 but on this holiday there is another 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:45.490
 technology that deserves for example sa 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.560
 call for help on its own if a 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.600
 accident on board there is a telephone with 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.389
 bluetooth the emergency system 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.340
 assistance locates the car with the gps e 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.260
 via the coordinates to a number of 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.610
 rescue by choosing the language 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.610
 right based on location 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.710
 in short, it seems the ideal car to put 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.510
 in the hands of their children 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.790
 but pay attention to the version you buy 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.530
 this with 80 horses cannot be 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.400
 driven by those with a driving license for less than 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.830
 12 months 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.300
 pity the ford they had thought of 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.550
 everything but not this law 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.640
 after all we only have it in 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.640
 Italy
