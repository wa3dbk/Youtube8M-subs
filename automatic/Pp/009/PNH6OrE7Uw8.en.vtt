but if you give me some ideas and I like
them<00:01:44.500> would<00:01:44.950> probably<00:01:45.399> make<00:01:45.550> them<00:01:45.729> happen

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
them would probably make them happen

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.570 
them would probably make them happen
depending<00:01:46.209> on<00:01:46.509> what<00:01:46.630> they<00:01:46.720> are<00:01:47.429> it<00:01:48.429> should<00:01:48.550> be

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
hopefully anyway uh really looking

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:59.550 
hopefully anyway uh really looking
forward<00:01:58.420> to<00:01:58.450> it<00:01:58.599> it's<00:01:58.690> going<00:01:58.780> to<00:01:58.869> be<00:01:58.959> a<00:01:58.989> great

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
forward to it it's going to be a great

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.589 
forward to it it's going to be a great
experience<00:01:59.679> as<00:02:00.280> it<00:02:00.429> always<00:02:00.640> is<00:02:00.789> the<00:02:01.239> few<00:02:01.420> times

00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:01.599 
experience as it always is the few times

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:03.990 
experience as it always is the few times
i<00:02:01.899> have<00:02:02.009> headed<00:02:03.009> out<00:02:03.129> to<00:02:03.250> California<00:02:03.910> and

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
i have headed out to California and

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.029 
i have headed out to California and
stuff<00:02:04.239> like<00:02:05.170> I<00:02:05.289> said<00:02:05.470> I'm<00:02:05.560> not<00:02:05.590> going<00:02:05.860> to<00:02:05.920> be

stuff like I said I'm not going to be
there<00:02:06.250> very<00:02:06.489> long<00:02:06.879> so<00:02:07.869> I<00:02:07.899> probably<00:02:08.379> won't<00:02:08.560> be

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
there very long so I probably won't be
