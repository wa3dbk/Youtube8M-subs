00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
you got to hit the no block the reason

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.770 
you got to hit the no block the reason
why<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:14.939> do<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.240> because<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.600> move

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
why I do this is because I move

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.300 
why I do this is because I move
extremely<00:01:16.049> fast<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:16.770> you're<00:01:16.950> going<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.189> have

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
extremely fast so you're going to have

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.219 
extremely fast so you're going to have
to<00:01:17.400> pause<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.759> video<00:01:17.850> here<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.299> there<00:01:18.689> also

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
to pause the video here and there also

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.539 
to pause the video here and there also
when<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.560> place<00:01:19.770> down<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.950> repeater<00:01:20.340> now<00:01:20.460> if

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
when I place down a repeater now if

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.429 
when I place down a repeater now if
you're<00:01:20.640> not<00:01:20.790> really<00:01:21.030> redstone<00:01:21.570> savvy<00:01:21.900> when<00:01:22.380> I

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
you're not really redstone savvy when I

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.260 
you're not really redstone savvy when I
place<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.860> repeater<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.759> one<00:01:24.030> tick

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
place on a repeater that is one tick

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.270 
place on a repeater that is one tick
there<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.659> no<00:01:24.840> such<00:01:25.049> thing<00:01:25.320> as<00:01:25.350> zero<00:01:25.650> ticks<00:01:26.070> on

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
there is no such thing as zero ticks on

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.789 
there is no such thing as zero ticks on
a<00:01:26.310> repeater<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:27.030> any<00:01:27.270> platform<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.409> it's<00:01:28.590> one

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
a repeater on any platform so it's one

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.219 
a repeater on any platform so it's one
tick<00:01:29.040> two<00:01:29.490> ticks<00:01:29.790> three<00:01:30.329> ticks<00:01:30.600> four<00:01:30.960> ticks
