this text we can animate it we can move
it<00:00:48.899> around<00:00:49.399> we<00:00:50.399> can<00:00:50.700> rotate<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.480> all<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.899> same

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
it around we can rotate it all the same

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.979 
it around we can rotate it all the same
things<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.770> can<00:00:53.010> do<00:00:53.660> with<00:00:54.660> any<00:00:54.960> layer<00:00:55.550> rotate

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
things you can do with any layer rotate

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.020

point<00:01:00.510> now<00:01:01.320> again<00:01:01.800> with<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> anchor<00:01:02.399> point

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
point now again with the anchor point

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.390 
point now again with the anchor point
that<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.989> position<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.070> point

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
that is the position that is the point

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
that is the position that is the point
at<00:01:05.489> which<00:01:05.519> things<00:01:05.790> will<00:01:05.970> be<00:01:06.119> scaled<00:01:06.630> from<00:01:07.020> and

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
at which things will be scaled from and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:16.160 
at which things will be scaled from and
rotate<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.540> around<00:01:13.490> but<00:01:14.490> text<00:01:14.939> has<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.420> new

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
rotate it around but text has a new

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.410 
rotate it around but text has a new
another<00:01:16.560> feature<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.100> normal<00:01:17.970> layers<00:01:18.180> don't

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
another feature that normal layers don't

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.530 
another feature that normal layers don't
have<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.900> as<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.799> can<00:01:19.950> see<00:01:20.130> here<00:01:20.400> down<00:01:21.270> on<00:01:21.420> my

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
have and as you can see here down on my

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.719 
have and as you can see here down on my
timeline<00:01:21.900> I've<00:01:22.830> got<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.220> little<00:01:23.549> button

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
timeline I've got this little button

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.039 
timeline I've got this little button
this<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:23.909> animate<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.570> there's<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.750> triangle

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
this is animate and there's a triangle

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.080 
this is animate and there's a triangle
next<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.340> want<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.580> click<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:26.939> that

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
next to it so I want to click on that

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.700 
next to it so I want to click on that
now<00:01:27.570> there's<00:01:27.750> all<00:01:27.869> these<00:01:28.020> things<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.439> we<00:01:28.560> can

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
now there's all these things that we can

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.679 
now there's all these things that we can
do<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.130> look<00:01:29.280> familiar<00:01:29.460> like<00:01:29.970> position<00:01:30.479> and

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
do that look familiar like position and

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.950 
do that look familiar like position and
scale<00:01:31.280> but<00:01:32.280> there's<00:01:32.460> skew<00:01:32.909> rotation<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:33.720> some

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
scale but there's skew rotation so some

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.350 
scale but there's skew rotation so some
of<00:01:33.990> these<00:01:34.079> are<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.259> little<00:01:34.290> bit<00:01:34.500> different<00:01:34.799> and

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
of these are a little bit different and

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.670 
of these are a little bit different and
enable<00:01:36.360> per<00:01:36.600> character<00:01:36.960> 3d<00:01:37.380> I'll<00:01:37.470> talk<00:01:37.650> about

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
enable per character 3d I'll talk about

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.770 
enable per character 3d I'll talk about
that<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.040> little<00:01:38.100> bit<00:01:38.220> later<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:39.030> let's<00:01:39.270> try<00:01:39.630> one

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
that a little bit later so let's try one

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.399 
that a little bit later so let's try one
of<00:01:39.840> these<00:01:39.960> things<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.439> let's<00:01:40.590> try<00:01:41.030> scale<00:01:42.409> and

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
of these things so let's try scale and

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.350 
of these things so let's try scale and
it<00:01:43.619> brings<00:01:43.829> up<00:01:44.130> some<00:01:44.399> new<00:01:44.610> options<00:01:44.850> here

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
it brings up some new options here

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.830 
it brings up some new options here
animator<00:01:46.049> one<00:01:46.640> range<00:01:47.640> selector<00:01:48.240> scale<00:01:48.600> what

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
animator one range selector scale what

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.990 
animator one range selector scale what
are<00:01:48.960> these<00:01:49.110> things<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.979> let's<00:01:50.369> test<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.909> out

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
are these things so let's test it out

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.370 
are these things so let's test it out
I'm<00:01:51.210> going<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.420> scale<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:51.840> up<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.259> can

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
I'm going to scale this up and you can

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.310 
I'm going to scale this up and you can
see<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.829> text<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.280> scaling<00:01:53.790> up<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.320> they're

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
see the text is scaling up and they're

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.740 
see the text is scaling up and they're
all<00:01:55.590> kind<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.920> running<00:01:56.399> into<00:01:56.640> each<00:01:56.700> other<00:01:56.939> but

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
all kind of running into each other but

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.510 
all kind of running into each other but
what<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.869> can<00:01:58.079> do<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:58.799> range<00:01:59.009> selector

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
what I can do is in this range selector

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.940 
what I can do is in this range selector
what<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.229> can<00:02:01.259> see<00:02:01.530> these<00:02:01.649> two

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
what this is is you can see these two

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.719 
what this is is you can see these two
new<00:02:02.130> lines<00:02:02.340> here<00:02:03.680> this<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.070> range<00:02:05.340> and

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
new lines here this is the range and

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.300 
new lines here this is the range and
which<00:02:06.090> in<00:02:06.329> between<00:02:06.719> these<00:02:06.840> two<00:02:07.049> lines<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.920> is

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
which in between these two lines that is

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.460 
which in between these two lines that is
being<00:02:08.610> affected<00:02:08.759> by<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:09.690> parameter<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.379> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
being affected by this parameter of the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.860 
being affected by this parameter of the
scale<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:11.520> I<00:02:11.550> can<00:02:11.879> change<00:02:12.120> the

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
scale so I can change the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.140 
scale so I can change the
and<00:02:16.159> did<00:02:17.159> you<00:02:17.280> see<00:02:17.430> what<00:02:17.580> happened<00:02:17.670> there<00:02:17.909> as

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
and did you see what happened there as

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.350 
and did you see what happened there as
it<00:02:18.299> sweeps<00:02:18.510> across<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:19.530> scales<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.159> up<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:21.209> and

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
it sweeps across it scales it up so and

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.690 
it sweeps across it scales it up so and
I<00:02:21.390> can<00:02:21.569> keyframe<00:02:21.959> that<00:02:21.989> so<00:02:22.709> I'll<00:02:22.920> start<00:02:23.580> my

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
I can keyframe that so I'll start my

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.990 
I can keyframe that so I'll start my
keyframe<00:02:24.180> I'll<00:02:24.959> go<00:02:25.110> forward<00:02:25.440> in<00:02:25.620> time<00:02:27.799> and<00:02:29.000> end

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
keyframe I'll go forward in time and end

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.119 
keyframe I'll go forward in time and end
it<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:31.069> can<00:02:32.069> also<00:02:32.280> do<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.670> same<00:02:32.879> thing<00:02:32.940> with<00:02:34.129> the

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
it I can also do the same thing with the

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:42.619 
it I can also do the same thing with the
start<00:02:35.459> point<00:02:39.680> go<00:02:40.680> forward<00:02:40.980> in<00:02:41.040> time<00:02:41.069> and<00:02:41.730> then

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
start point go forward in time and then

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.220 
start point go forward in time and then
bring<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.590> across<00:02:44.099> as<00:02:44.370> well<00:02:44.989> now<00:02:45.989> since

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
bring that across as well now since

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.390 
bring that across as well now since
they're<00:02:46.349> both<00:02:46.440> going<00:02:46.680> across<00:02:46.890> at<00:02:47.129> the<00:02:47.190> same

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
they're both going across at the same

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.690 
they're both going across at the same
time<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.879> does<00:02:48.030> nothing<00:02:48.810> but<00:02:49.680> if<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.370> go<00:02:50.549> in<00:02:50.579> here

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
time it does nothing but if I go in here

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.640 
time it does nothing but if I go in here
highlight<00:02:51.359> both<00:02:51.569> these<00:02:51.720> keyframes<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.530> I

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
highlight both these keyframes and I

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.150 
highlight both these keyframes and I
move<00:02:52.980> them<00:02:53.220> over<00:02:53.690> then<00:02:54.690> do<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:54.930> see<00:02:55.140> how<00:02:55.410> they

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
move them over then do you see how they

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.339 
move them over then do you see how they
both<00:02:56.400> sweep<00:02:56.670> across<00:02:56.910> so<00:02:57.299> only<00:02:57.780> in<00:02:58.200> between

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
both sweep across so only in between

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.589 
both sweep across so only in between
those<00:02:58.650> two<00:02:58.799> lines<00:02:59.069> is<00:02:59.700> being<00:03:00.030> affected<00:03:00.450> by<00:03:00.540> the

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
those two lines is being affected by the

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.190 
those two lines is being affected by the
scale<00:03:01.019> so<00:03:01.980> that's<00:03:02.069> pretty<00:03:02.400> cool<00:03:02.579> now<00:03:03.170> what<00:03:04.170> I

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
scale so that's pretty cool now what I

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.470 
scale so that's pretty cool now what I
can<00:03:04.409> do<00:03:04.560> is<00:03:04.739> I<00:03:04.829> can<00:03:04.890> add<00:03:05.190> more<00:03:05.849> animation

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
can do is I can add more animation

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.690 
can do is I can add more animation
parameters<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:07.620> can<00:03:07.650> add<00:03:07.980> it<00:03:08.099> if<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.340> click<00:03:08.549> up

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
parameters I can add it if I click up

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.300 
parameters I can add it if I click up
here<00:03:08.730> I<00:03:09.500> can<00:03:10.500> add<00:03:10.739> now<00:03:11.510> rotation<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:13.099> it<00:03:14.099> adds

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
here I can add now rotation and it adds

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.140 
here I can add now rotation and it adds
it<00:03:14.549> here<00:03:14.819> to<00:03:15.060> this<00:03:16.280> range<00:03:17.280> selector<00:03:17.760> so<00:03:18.120> I

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
it here to this range selector so I

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.770 
it here to this range selector so I
bring<00:03:18.450> up<00:03:18.569> the<00:03:18.690> rotation<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:19.410> now<00:03:20.660> it's<00:03:21.660> going

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
bring up the rotation and now it's going

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.870 
bring up the rotation and now it's going
to<00:03:21.870> rotate<00:03:22.099> along<00:03:23.099> that<00:03:23.280> same<00:03:23.989> swipe<00:03:24.989> across

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
to rotate along that same swipe across

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.819 
to rotate along that same swipe across
click<00:03:26.880> here<00:03:27.209> or<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:27.690> can<00:03:27.989> just<00:03:28.019> click<00:03:28.169> add<00:03:28.500> over

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
click here or I can just click add over

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:41.180 
click here or I can just click add over
here<00:03:30.319> and<00:03:31.319> I<00:03:31.440> can<00:03:31.470> add<00:03:31.739> different<00:03:32.040> properties

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.560 

so<00:03:41.820> now<00:03:43.310> all<00:03:44.310> of<00:03:44.370> these<00:03:44.670> things<00:03:44.970> are<00:03:45.240> going<00:03:45.450> to

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
so now all of these things are going to

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:51.200 
so now all of these things are going to
be<00:03:46.190> tied<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.790> this<00:03:48.030> start<00:03:48.990> and<00:03:49.140> end<00:03:49.380> point<00:03:50.210> with

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
be tied to this start and end point with

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.410 
be tied to this start and end point with
the<00:03:51.330> range<00:03:51.570> selector<00:03:52.610> so<00:03:53.610> and<00:03:53.910> the<00:03:54.030> last<00:03:54.060> thing

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
the range selector so and the last thing

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.180 
the range selector so and the last thing
I<00:03:54.510> want<00:03:54.690> to<00:03:54.750> show<00:03:54.900> you<00:03:54.960> before<00:03:55.230> we<00:03:55.470> are<00:03:55.950> done

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
I want to show you before we are done

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.720 
I want to show you before we are done
with<00:03:56.400> this<00:03:56.550> tutorial<00:03:57.060> is<00:03:57.800> the<00:03:58.800> per<00:03:59.310> character

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
with this tutorial is the per character

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.400 
with this tutorial is the per character
3d<00:04:00.300> so<00:04:00.630> if<00:04:00.750> I<00:04:00.930> enable<00:04:01.200> that<00:04:01.880> now<00:04:03.050> let's<00:04:04.050> go<00:04:04.260> in

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
3d so if I enable that now let's go in

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:11.300 
3d so if I enable that now let's go in
here<00:04:04.710> and<00:04:04.890> add<00:04:05.160> a<00:04:06.470> position<00:04:07.470> I<00:04:08.510> can<00:04:09.510> I<00:04:10.310> can

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
here and add a position I can I can

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:18.140 
here and add a position I can I can
change<00:04:11.640> these<00:04:11.940> in<00:04:12.830> 3d<00:04:13.830> space<00:04:15.290> position<00:04:16.290> I<00:04:17.150> can

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
change these in 3d space position I can

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.650 
change these in 3d space position I can
add<00:04:18.530> rotation<00:04:19.580> and<00:04:20.580> I<00:04:20.670> can<00:04:20.850> have<00:04:21.000> these<00:04:21.120> rotate

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
add rotation and I can have these rotate

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:29.720 
add rotation and I can have these rotate
in<00:04:22.040> 3d<00:04:23.040> space<00:04:26.450> and<00:04:27.890> it'll<00:04:28.890> all<00:04:29.070> work<00:04:29.100> per

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
in 3d space and it'll all work per

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.310 
in 3d space and it'll all work per
character<00:04:30.150> instead<00:04:30.600> of<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:30.780> word<00:04:30.960> as<00:04:31.200> a<00:04:31.230> whole

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
character instead of the word as a whole

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.220 
character instead of the word as a whole
and<00:04:31.800> you<00:04:32.700> can't<00:04:32.940> do<00:04:33.120> that<00:04:33.300> unless<00:04:33.600> you<00:04:34.200> are

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
and you can't do that unless you are

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.070 
and you can't do that unless you are
using<00:04:34.500> these<00:04:34.860> animate<00:04:35.670> a<00:04:35.940> feature<00:04:36.630> in<00:04:36.960> the

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
using these animate a feature in the

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.200 
using these animate a feature in the
text<00:04:37.610> now<00:04:38.610> if<00:04:38.880> I<00:04:39.000> want<00:04:39.240> to<00:04:39.420> go<00:04:39.630> back<00:04:39.870> and<00:04:40.170> then

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
text now if I want to go back and then

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.380 
text now if I want to go back and then
rotate<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.360> whole<00:04:42.510> thing<00:04:42.810> I<00:04:43.610> can<00:04:44.610> and<00:04:45.150> you<00:04:45.240> can

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
rotate the whole thing I can and you can
