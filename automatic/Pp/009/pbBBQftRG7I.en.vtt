00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
GoPro swallowed the hook and I decided

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.990 
GoPro swallowed the hook and I decided
just<00:05:28.380> to<00:05:28.620> go<00:05:28.680> ahead<00:05:28.920> and<00:05:29.040> cut<00:05:29.190> the<00:05:29.280> line

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
just to go ahead and cut the line

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.790 
just to go ahead and cut the line
because<00:05:30.480> fish<00:05:30.690> they<00:05:31.050> have<00:05:31.200> acid<00:05:31.620> in<00:05:31.710> their

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
because fish they have acid in their

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.190 
because fish they have acid in their
stomach<00:05:32.100> and<00:05:32.250> actually<00:05:32.310> you<00:05:32.550> can<00:05:32.730> dissolve

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
stomach and actually you can dissolve

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.390 
stomach and actually you can dissolve
fish<00:05:34.200> hooks<00:05:34.410> in<00:05:34.530> over<00:05:34.710> time<00:05:34.860> they'll<00:05:35.130> come<00:05:35.160> out

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
fish hooks in over time they'll come out

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.730 
fish hooks in over time they'll come out
and<00:05:35.790> a<00:05:36.570> lot<00:05:36.720> of<00:05:36.810> times<00:05:36.960> they'll<00:05:37.200> live<00:05:37.410> if<00:05:37.620> they

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
and a lot of times they'll live if they

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.590 
and a lot of times they'll live if they
fall<00:05:37.950> swallow<00:05:38.370> a<00:05:38.460> fish<00:05:38.700> hook<00:05:38.880> or<00:05:39.240> at<00:05:39.450> least
