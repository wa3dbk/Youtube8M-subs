 rugby languedocien the 4th series men 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.489
 hours 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.490
 it's like that every Tuesday night 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.530
 in this little room of beziers the team 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.130
 of serial 15 records these three 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.130
 programs of the week 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.030
 another goal he really was to be 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.469
 a magazine thank you you're not doing any 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.229
 the live info 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.869
 there are plenty of people doing it 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.670
 on facebook or on or on things 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.710
 like that and but I did not want to go crazy 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.619
 is really back on the matches in 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.970
 talk and and that the show are are 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.860
 friendly we are spoiled at 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.840
 the unifem the choice one is spoiled by the 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.640
 makeups are all pretty good 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.380
 atmosphere so before entering the 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.850
 plateau must be said that all 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.140
 have known for a long time and are 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.909
 more or less involved in clubs 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.179
 of the region 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:34.050
 I was surprised by the notoriety 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:36.060
 so because we are moving 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.310
 as during our club is we are we 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.810
 is recognized what guys I am 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.100
 adverse wearer or even players who 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.360
 said were these series ken that's all 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.820
 so that's good because it wants 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.710
 to say that when it generates something 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.540
 positive then has to start with the 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.800
 merchants reuter gentlemen bruno dhont 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.460

 results and analyze the matches the 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.730
 languedoc committee seems to respond to a 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.170
 real public expectation for the 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.590
 series has no cover on monday in 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.060

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.740
 very few items to appreciate each 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.810
 village that was his room are 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.800
 constrained by these people there because 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.120
 that we can go to the site and had 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.710
 forced to view matches and to 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:24.300
 some salads that falls low and 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:25.290
 it's not bad the guest is difficult 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.020
 for me because it's true that you have to 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.690
 always get him back to him at 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.190
 what people listen to his speech and 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.810
 it's the most difficult after 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.340
 cameramen it'll know it's a trick 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.930
 I like such wines of the world 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.430
 so I 'm not too embarrassed for that all 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.410
 are amateurs and take a pleasure 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.520
 obvious to record its emissions 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.130
 about ten minutes 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.420
 thanks to them the 52 series clubs has at 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.200

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.200
 media on the web 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.459
