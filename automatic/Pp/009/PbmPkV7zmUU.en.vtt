let's get ready for the next scene you

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.830 
let's get ready for the next scene you
know<00:00:29.279> there's<00:00:29.550> one<00:00:29.970> thing<00:00:30.300> about<00:00:30.630> this

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
know there's one thing about this

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.290 
know there's one thing about this
director<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.529> ours<00:00:31.890> he<00:00:32.219> insisted<00:00:32.700> everything

be<00:00:33.540> technically<00:00:34.230> correct<00:00:34.550> everything<00:00:35.550> just

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
be technically correct everything just

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.330 
be technically correct everything just
as<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.510> actually<00:00:36.690> happened<00:00:37.050> that's<00:00:37.950> why<00:00:38.190> we

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
as it actually happened that's why we

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.069 
as it actually happened that's why we
came<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> proving<00:00:38.879> ground<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.510> get<00:00:39.960> the
