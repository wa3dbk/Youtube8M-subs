00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.460
 I'm back here to bring the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.599
 video today on globe box also the 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.590
 first 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.810
 this three-year boxing edition is me 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.460
 To be honest, I'm going to confess that 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.619
 Once upon a time I was disappointed. 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.840
 It is not a fact of product singer in 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.150
 few products next edition of three 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.660
 That's how kind to me. 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.120
 listed here are ok 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.190
 is fulfilling cash value but I was hoping 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.219
 a little more not only this but also 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.559
 he hoped that the experiment would have 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.570
 fixed the problem they had 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.309
 a month ago with the box myself 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.090
 I received the box is responsible with some 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.160
 their products only like everyone else 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.100
 complained a lot of people complained and I 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.170
 of course obviously I complained 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.180
 produced close proximity 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.670
 now for the month of April more or less 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.049
 and that box that the two products that 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.970
 came to the end of experience too 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.659
 came with products with expiration 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.040
 for April 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.500
 people is a disrespect to the consumer 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.570
 This is it, I do not claim to be a bossa. 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.320
 old woman already in the box nor should she be 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.939
 in that 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.369
 in fact who is to blame but is the 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:22.049
 own brand that provides products for 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:25.470
 box but it is the following I think the following 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.270
 if you really take it in time 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.490
 front 11 those products have 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.829
 knowledge from the front of the 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.159
 sell or else the simple liquidation 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.619
 then put samples in magazines a 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.400
 fit of the globe to box the river in the 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.380
 Mexico 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.270
 I find this strange among people not 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.149
 recycle and also a very 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.340
 of the product but rather the consumer 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.720
 no inter guilty or the people because they 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.390
 also in the products in my opinion 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.710
 but that I can not understand well 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.229
 certainly the great hope is 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.759
 leaving much to wish last month 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.880
 I had a problem with this box too. 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.290
 with the question of salaries but also 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.409
 anyway it was only my birthday 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.440
 receive 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.720
 and two of my friends are two kits - the 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.970
 who said berenice and the two were 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.000
 expiring next and so for you 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.860
 find products that always change and treat 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.810
 a pact for you to find a product that 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.430
 has a much later investment 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.470
 so this is the tip for who says 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.200
 berenice be careful with this between 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.720
 some consumers in general because it has 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.549
 a consumer there so I do not yet 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.720
 said he wants to know, leave it alone and 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.940
 barbecue 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.819
 but has much consumer who goes after the 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.920
 thing and will catch badly 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.110
 so that's the tip to who said 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.150
 berenice to take care more or less 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.480
 clear with the situation and do not catch a train 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.180
 good chatinho get chaton client vai 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.040
 catching the picture badly, I 'll go 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.090
 Show you a box. 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.400
 the box will so is always that already have 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.150
 I was curious, I finally saw 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:04.359
 then it came that way that right 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.370
 explanatory coletinhos vehicles in the month 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:09.609
 she did not come very well packaged this 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:13.930
 I mean, I did not continue, but it's okay anyway. 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:15.639
 and the produtinhos came to show 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.560
 quickly to camera's battery is 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:20.230
 ending all showed fast for you 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.319
 functional products came from two 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.599
 eudora that came and if this mask 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.730
 colored eyelashes that is one thing 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.069
 very beautiful and only I like all of you 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.349

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.739

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.319
 I think it's beautiful I'm probably going to use it 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.630
 now carnival was already so neither speak 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.669
 but I'm probably going to use this 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.209
 here, surely, his salary was 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:48.730
 2016 that was cool and came that lipstick 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:51.280
 here the let me xinguem the dada is only that 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:55.090
 I do not continue with the color, not her color 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.250
 came a juninho tone that for the love of honey 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.069
 for this code when it escapes law 11 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.079
 to make me more sales in color of 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:06.639
 dumb when he runs away there is not much color 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:08.440
 much there that I would use but finally give 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:11.079
 said the two products that 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.109
 came were these two enamels which is the 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:17.829
 silver chic practicing right? 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:18.310
 and so the red can you see that 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.680
 like this 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.060
 he also a picture knows then the 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.080
 His knowledge is not very cool 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.150
 not 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.570
 But anyway this is good, I do not know if 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.250
 You'll get to use it anyway, sure it came from 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.280
 reported the website became almost came 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:36.010
 this live protector use daily glow 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.980
 intense protection uo see a baby with 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.880
 Silicon for flash does not diligently 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.590
 I'll test this one because I'm 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.660
 Looking for a book My hair we'll see 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:47.290
 if this is good it is with argan oil and 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:51.669
 70 ml of sample minus three products 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:53.440
 came two perfumes from the guess who and came 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.840
 a cosplay see if a mask 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.520
 treatment of that skaf machine I already 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.540
 I used skaf products there is very good for 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.729
 who has progressive hair 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.560
 mainly of this line is very very 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.290
 It's really good that he has to go to China. 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.120
 but not the result of the 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.010
 smooth effect we are going in that really 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:13.270
 works when I touch pillow I 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:16.090
 I'll use it, but I do not know 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.889
 This is it right here is what I 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.389
 I wanted to leave it here in the video 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.850
 It is also this issue of salaries 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.740
 so one thing the attack is the opinion 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.200
 Of you, who's watching the video? 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.840
 I have an opinion of this principal and 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.300
 if you have a pathologist watching, okay? 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.940
 Product Due Matter I Heard 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.220
 talk a lot about it in the states 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.570
 For example, you use the 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.150
 product when you start using 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.530
 products and by-products such're okay with 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.510
 due in one year from now 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.210
 you open the product you have let's have 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.830
 a date without rivalry with 11 and 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.510
 Conezinho on the side 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.490
 the euro, for example, you have six months 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.139
 with 12 months of use of the product 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.479
 only from the moment that you 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:57.190
 open the product and not when you 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:59.440
 example takes the product in the store you have 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.200
 maturity, which is neither what 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:05.500
 account here in Brazil who speaks whatever the 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:10.210
 current month four of 2014 2015 is an excuse 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:13.479
 but I wanted to know if it really did 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.669
 works because people usually go 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:18.100
 the quality of the anvisa that the 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:19.450
 Anvisa proposes to us only that 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.700
 story, we have to stay 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:24.250
 eye on texture and consistency in the 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.229
 smell of the products but in both 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.060
 Let's go and they're not cool so we 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:30.850
 discards the product that does not really 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:33.460
 I do not know, but I really wanted to know 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:35.350
 this story is true inside of 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.790
 having the product information has a 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.530
 validity of six months from the 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.880
 moment about the product or more 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.230
 less so right 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.790
 so that's it folks I hope you 

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.560
 Did you like the video sorry? 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.139
 I vent but really do not have 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.730
 how to understand the controversial cause again 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:50.950
 I did not want to cause to cause 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:53.800
 Unfortunately, there's no way right. 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:56.530
 but so I wanted to make it clear 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.690
 also because experience one day someone 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:01.060
 of their advice to see this video and 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.370
 tetra because this will not be the suspect 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.260
 consumer understood the question manila box 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.300
 who says that the problem starts is the 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.240
 disrespect with the consumer and I think 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:12.400
 Yes, of course if I take more 

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.560
 This way I do not buy anymore. 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.090
 their products are sure to lose 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.040
 a website client 

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.380
 So that's it. I hope we did all the 

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:23.970
 video that gives a young man here and 

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.970
 sign the channel a kiss for you
