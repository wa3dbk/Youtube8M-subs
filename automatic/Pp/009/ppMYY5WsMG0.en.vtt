00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949

step two actually of the boat and then

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.539 
step two actually of the boat and then
here<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> cool<00:01:04.049> calibrating<00:01:05.040> system<00:01:05.430> which

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
here is a cool calibrating system which

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.649 
here is a cool calibrating system which
everyone<00:01:06.030> can<00:01:06.060> use<00:01:06.950> so<00:01:07.950> basically<00:01:08.580> these<00:01:08.909> cows

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
everyone can use so basically these cows

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.710 
everyone can use so basically these cows
are<00:01:09.930> writing<00:01:10.680> cards<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.369> they<00:01:12.330> are<00:01:12.479> still

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
are writing cards and they are still

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.679 
are writing cards and they are still
able<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.110> breathe<00:01:13.619> actually<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.479> once<00:01:15.479> they

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
able to breathe actually and once they

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.280 
able to breathe actually and once they
have<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:16.320> baby<00:01:17.009> cow<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.939> vehicle<00:01:18.299> will<00:01:18.840> at<00:01:19.229> some

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
have a baby cow the vehicle will at some

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.590 
have a baby cow the vehicle will at some
point<00:01:19.590> get<00:01:20.189> pushed<00:01:20.460> off<00:01:20.640> by<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.939> minecarts

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
point get pushed off by the minecarts

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.520 
point get pushed off by the minecarts
things<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.200> falls<00:01:22.470> down<00:01:22.710> here<00:01:23.040> into<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
things and falls down here into the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.719 
things and falls down here into the
water<00:01:25.530> flow<00:01:25.799> which<00:01:26.070> connects<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.840> storage

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
water flow which connects to the storage

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.940 
water flow which connects to the storage
so<00:01:29.729> all<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:30.390> have<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.750> do<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:30.930> press<00:01:31.439> down<00:01:31.740> press

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
so all we have to do is press down press

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.039 
so all we have to do is press down press
down<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.180> look<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:35.570> there's<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.659> little<00:01:36.869> look

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
down and look and there's a little look

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.620 
down and look and there's a little look
I'll<00:01:37.170> see<00:01:37.409> if<00:01:38.040> all's<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.610> then<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.360> card

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
I'll see if all's and then the card

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.430 
I'll see if all's and then the card
starts<00:01:39.990> moving<00:01:40.530> again

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
starts moving again

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.520 
starts moving again
and<00:01:41.560> then<00:01:42.220> we<00:01:42.610> can<00:01:42.880> do<00:01:43.090> this<00:01:43.390> for<00:01:43.780> all<00:01:43.810> of<00:01:44.260> these

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
and then we can do this for all of these

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.760 
and then we can do this for all of these
cows<00:01:44.860> and<00:01:46.170> then<00:01:47.170> walk<00:01:47.500> over<00:01:47.770> here<00:01:49.410> if<00:01:50.410> it's<00:01:50.680> a

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
cows and then walk over here if it's a

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.060 
cows and then walk over here if it's a
bit<00:01:50.920> laggy<00:01:51.250> that<00:01:51.550> is<00:01:51.700> because<00:01:52.330> i<00:01:52.480> have<00:01:52.660> i<00:01:53.350> think

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
bit laggy that is because i have i think

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.060 
bit laggy that is because i have i think
i<00:01:54.250> have<00:01:54.420> put<00:01:55.420> some<00:01:55.750> cows<00:01:56.080> in<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.590> storage

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
i have put some cows in the storage

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.360 
i have put some cows in the storage
already<00:01:58.710> which<00:01:59.710> makes<00:02:00.130> it<00:02:00.370> kind<00:02:01.150> of<00:02:01.240> laggy<00:02:01.510> and

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
already which makes it kind of laggy and

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.210 
already which makes it kind of laggy and
did<00:02:03.370> i<00:02:03.490> break<00:02:03.730> that<00:02:04.000> or<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:05.320> this<00:02:05.530> a<00:02:05.590> magical

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
did i break that or is this a magical

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.000 
did i break that or is this a magical
cow<00:02:06.400> so<00:02:06.970> then<00:02:07.510> here<00:02:07.960> we<00:02:07.990> have<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.350> main<00:02:08.619> room

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.010

here<00:02:20.500> are<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.770> cows<00:02:21.190> they<00:02:21.610> are<00:02:21.730> kind<00:02:22.030> of

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
here are the cows they are kind of

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.510 
here are the cows they are kind of
spinning<00:02:22.540> because<00:02:23.110> there's<00:02:23.410> quite<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.040> lot<00:02:24.220> so

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
spinning because there's quite a lot so

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.270 
spinning because there's quite a lot so
you<00:02:24.550> just<00:02:25.030> wait<00:02:25.270> until<00:02:25.570> they<00:02:26.290> grown<00:02:26.740> their

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
you just wait until they grown their

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.700 
you just wait until they grown their
ground<00:02:27.670> here<00:02:27.910> so<00:02:28.450> we<00:02:28.540> break<00:02:28.810> this<00:02:29.050> this<00:02:29.500> is<00:02:29.680> a

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
ground here so we break this this is a

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.590 
ground here so we break this this is a
little<00:02:30.010> area<00:02:30.220> where<00:02:30.580> you<00:02:30.610> can<00:02:30.850> reset<00:02:31.240> it<00:02:31.300> once

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
little area where you can reset it once

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.960 
little area where you can reset it once
you<00:02:31.720> did<00:02:32.020> break<00:02:32.740> it<00:02:33.010> basically<00:02:33.790> it's<00:02:33.910> just

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
you did break it basically it's just

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.130 
you did break it basically it's just
some<00:02:34.930> signs<00:02:35.260> holding<00:02:35.830> up<00:02:36.010> a<00:02:36.840> gravel<00:02:37.840> blocks

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
some signs holding up a gravel blocks

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.070 
some signs holding up a gravel blocks
there<00:02:38.500> which<00:02:38.890> keep<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.390> cows<00:02:40.390> from<00:02:40.630> flowing

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
there which keep the cows from flowing

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.410 
there which keep the cows from flowing
away<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.680> water<00:02:41.890> as<00:02:42.100> well<00:02:42.280> no<00:02:43.030> water<00:02:43.210> is

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
away and the water as well no water is

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.800 
away and the water as well no water is
to<00:02:43.720> push<00:02:43.990> them<00:02:44.350> in<00:02:44.800> this<00:02:45.280> flowing<00:02:45.790> water<00:02:46.120> which

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
to push them in this flowing water which

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.979 
to push them in this flowing water which
brings<00:02:47.260> them<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:47.920> cooker<00:02:48.720> let<00:02:49.720> me<00:02:49.840> show

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
brings them to the cooker let me show

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.320 
brings them to the cooker let me show
you<00:02:50.020> the<00:02:50.260> cook<00:02:50.440> real<00:02:50.590> quick<00:02:50.920> so<00:02:51.700> this<00:02:51.970> is<00:02:52.120> kind

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
you the cook real quick so this is kind

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.390 
you the cook real quick so this is kind
of<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.450> heat<00:02:52.690> engine<00:02:53.140> I<00:02:53.530> just<00:02:53.920> for<00:02:54.370> some

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
of the heat engine I just for some

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.940 
of the heat engine I just for some
reason<00:02:54.580> at<00:02:55.090> this<00:02:55.390> kind<00:02:55.750> of<00:02:55.870> you<00:02:56.320> will<00:02:56.500> they<00:02:56.680> are

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
reason at this kind of you will they are

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.580 
reason at this kind of you will they are
able<00:02:57.130> to<00:02:57.430> see<00:02:57.640> this<00:02:57.850> so<00:02:58.630> basically<00:02:59.320> it's

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
able to see this so basically it's

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.270 
able to see this so basically it's
flowing<00:02:59.950> lava<00:03:00.130> so<00:03:00.880> it<00:03:01.000> flows<00:03:01.300> here<00:03:01.630> and<00:03:01.900> it<00:03:02.110> is

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
flowing lava so it flows here and it is

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.190 
flowing lava so it flows here and it is
like<00:03:03.280> really<00:03:03.790> really<00:03:04.000> thin<00:03:04.390> laughs<00:03:04.840> I<00:03:05.020> where

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
like really really thin laughs I where

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.840 
like really really thin laughs I where
the<00:03:05.320> cows<00:03:05.560> fall<00:03:05.890> through<00:03:06.160> so<00:03:06.400> they<00:03:06.520> always

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
the cows fall through so they always

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.240 
the cows fall through so they always
fell<00:03:07.060> through<00:03:07.330> and<00:03:07.510> don't<00:03:07.750> I<00:03:08.020> get<00:03:08.770> stuck<00:03:09.040> in<00:03:09.160> it

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
fell through and don't I get stuck in it

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.130 
fell through and don't I get stuck in it
or<00:03:09.400> something<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:09.910> they<00:03:10.600> just<00:03:10.630> fall<00:03:11.110> through

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
or something and they just fall through

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.290 
or something and they just fall through
and<00:03:11.560> it's<00:03:11.709> a<00:03:11.769> stationary<00:03:12.370> la<00:03:12.610> value<00:03:13.000> i<00:03:13.030> will

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
and it's a stationary la value i will

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.830 
and it's a stationary la value i will
show<00:03:13.510> you<00:03:13.570> that<00:03:13.660> in<00:03:13.959> a<00:03:14.080> second<00:03:15.480> because<00:03:16.480> if<00:03:16.690> you

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
show you that in a second because if you

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.080 
show you that in a second because if you
go<00:03:16.989> down<00:03:17.170> here<00:03:19.890> you<00:03:20.890> can<00:03:21.220> see<00:03:21.519> this<00:03:21.820> is<00:03:22.060> not

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
go down here you can see this is not

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.729 
go down here you can see this is not
falling<00:03:22.690> that<00:03:22.810> is<00:03:22.870> because<00:03:23.260> it's<00:03:23.410> stationary

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
falling that is because it's stationary

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.650 
falling that is because it's stationary
lava<00:03:24.250> if<00:03:24.489> you<00:03:24.640> want<00:03:24.850> to<00:03:24.940> know<00:03:25.060> how<00:03:25.239> to<00:03:25.300> make

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
lava if you want to know how to make

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.199 
lava if you want to know how to make
this<00:03:25.959> it's<00:03:26.950> really<00:03:27.130> easy<00:03:27.370> it<00:03:27.550> just<00:03:27.580> place<00:03:28.030> down

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
this it's really easy it just place down

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.140 
this it's really easy it just place down
the<00:03:28.360> lava<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:29.680> at<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.160> point<00:03:30.430> at<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:30.880> state

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
the lava and at the point at the state

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.470 
the lava and at the point at the state
it<00:03:32.140> is<00:03:32.320> you<00:03:32.530> how<00:03:33.010> you<00:03:33.070> want<00:03:33.370> it<00:03:33.640> you<00:03:34.180> have<00:03:34.300> to

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
be able to make it a place how you can

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.740 
be able to make it a place how you can
break<00:04:07.700> these<00:04:08.000> ones<00:04:08.330> in<00:04:08.480> there<00:04:08.630> as<00:04:08.810> well<00:04:09.400> but<00:04:10.750> i

break these ones in there as well but i
chose<00:04:12.260> the<00:04:12.680> system<00:04:14.080> so<00:04:15.080> now<00:04:15.380> every<00:04:15.950> single<00:04:16.430> cow

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
chose the system so now every single cow

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.440 
chose the system so now every single cow
has<00:04:17.840> been<00:04:17.870> fallen<00:04:18.590> and<00:04:19.570> let's<00:04:20.570> check<00:04:21.410> the<00:04:21.890> loot

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
built and from then I just kept

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.090 
built and from then I just kept
rereading<00:04:49.880> them<00:04:50.510> at<00:04:50.870> some<00:04:51.260> times<00:04:51.530> when<00:04:51.830> I<00:04:51.860> felt

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
rereading them at some times when I felt

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.210 
rereading them at some times when I felt
like<00:04:52.370> it<00:04:52.580> and<00:04:53.240> then<00:04:53.470> you<00:04:54.470> pick<00:04:54.710> all<00:04:54.920> of<00:04:54.950> these

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
like it and then you pick all of these

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.250 
like it and then you pick all of these
up<00:04:55.460> which<00:04:55.670> is<00:04:55.820> like<00:04:56.060> hundreds<00:04:56.720> and<00:04:56.900> hundreds

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260

probably if this isn't survival you

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.970 
probably if this isn't survival you
probably<00:05:01.700> never<00:05:02.120> ever<00:05:02.630> ever<00:05:02.990> need<00:05:03.410> any<00:05:04.900> any

carrots and if you want to do this with

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.360 
carrots and if you want to do this with
chickens<00:05:45.169> you<00:05:45.410> have<00:05:45.620> to<00:05:45.740> do<00:05:45.860> a<00:05:45.890> really

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
chickens you have to do a really

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.070 
chickens you have to do a really
different<00:05:46.760> design<00:05:47.240> because<00:05:47.540> this<00:05:47.690> won't<00:05:47.870> work

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
different design because this won't work

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.600 
different design because this won't work
because<00:05:48.350> the<00:05:48.560> chickens<00:05:48.740> fell<00:05:49.040> really<00:05:49.400> slow

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
because the chickens fell really slow

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.880 
because the chickens fell really slow
and<00:05:49.820> they<00:05:50.419> will<00:05:50.570> just<00:05:50.750> die<00:05:50.930> in<00:05:51.200> the<00:05:51.350> lava<00:05:51.530> and

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890 
and they will just die in the lava and

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.430 
and they will just die in the lava and
all<00:05:52.040> their<00:05:52.220> stuffs<00:05:52.610> falls<00:05:53.000> in<00:05:53.180> a<00:05:53.270> lava<00:05:53.450> so<00:05:53.810> not

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440
