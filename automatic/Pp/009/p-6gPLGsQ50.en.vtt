00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:05.590
 Commercial aviation has had the biggest slump last year 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.440
 experienced the post-war history 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.800
 Airlines worldwide are also struggling with drastically declining passenger numbers on the 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.579
 spoiled for success Stuttgart Airport, the numbers are canceled 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:20.239
 Ten percent fewer passengers is the sorrowful balance of 2009 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.180
 Georg Fundel has been managing the fortunes of the company for 14 years 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.130
 airport 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.159
 from the fans as a victory possible 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:34.829
 Berlin have also been easier to install 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.190
 there as I believe 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.739
 the way to work in the already difficult then no longer falls in his profession 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.860
 A deadline hunts the next project manager Rebecca Klaus 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.839
 would like the layout of the first published environmental report 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:51.310
 imagine 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.499
 be in principle 

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:57.909
 but then no thought of his last performances the orchestra No 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:03.079
 That's just the beginning of a year, it's about 20 percent out 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.880
 it becomes clear that the airport takes its responsibility towards the environment 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.979
 Ernst takes for the second round an important task and what setting for 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.600
 a positive development 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.140
 Do not min this puck with us 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.390
 show them where they are in Sion 2 in the next 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.920
 save 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.570
 that is nice and good execution 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.570
 municipal want to build our children Â»Merkel said 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.340
 Aircraft noise at the airport boss already sleepless nights prepares this 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.070
 To become numbers 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.450
 Dusseldorf 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.360
 for that I have understanding also Coop is certainly not going to turn 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.170
 that is to say, whether it is a series 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.670
 the quality of an airport 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.980
 to have the clientele on the journey of the people near him 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.010
 a failure 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.980
 but that should at least be reduced 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.970
 No, this aircraft 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.050
 It weighs less paid Mr. terrain in apply 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.200
 but that ultimately leads to the fact that there is no one more but that is 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.419
 on the subject 

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:13.889
 Aachens does not need anything to stimulate in the name of 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:16.909
 twelve to six at six only a few exceptions 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:18.339
 they were allowed to fly 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:21.569
 that means the night's sleep is also guaranteed and what is crucial 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.899
 For many it is also positive and thinkable 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:28.459
 we have affected the neighbors the starting fields around are the 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.749
 Soundproof windows paid 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:34.179
 even the de-icing of the planes worries the people nearby 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:38.049
 The airport manages to worry that by using chemical 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.379
 Solutions soil and groundwater are polluted 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.169
 To avoid this, the airport company has more than 100 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:49.400
 Millions of euros have been spent Georg Fundel looks at the environment 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.400
 Facilities regularly on site 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:03:00.309
 The huge underground storage basins are impressive 

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:03.409
 Here the polluted water is caught and he demanded 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:05.419
 it is a world 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:07.560
 Airport runways cleared 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.219
 we need this 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:11.919
 comply with the summer flood rules 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:13.999
 furthermore rainwater retention basin 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:17.169
 Minute as our total de-icing agent 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:19.319
 the opel-zoo into the gate 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.959
 Whenever his time allows, Georg Fundel likes to get one 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.959
 personal insight into the daily processes 

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:32.149
 in the office of the participants to find the disposition of the check-in who goes 

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:34.209
 and the luggage belts take place 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.159
 sometimes alarm messages go a few 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:38.550
 Frankfurt 2 3 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.210
 Little problems on the spot we lost about 3 hours ago 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.889
 fire services 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.629
 Now follows a test for us 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:47.869
 and what was 

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:50.309
 because of sales work 

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:52.319
 April 2 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.029
 want to hold us 

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:56.279
 the exam 

00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:57.609
 Hohenwarter 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:00.389
 Binder 3 and 4 came out again 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.689
 Honda from US Palermo hardly want anything 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:06.689
 He is very open with his employees 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.729
 he will become the covenant too 

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:13.729
 and he makes himself mentally fight yours 

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:16.529
 what if said 

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:17.359
 High penalties 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.769
 At the showcase up to six important every employee feel 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:21.680
 to give 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.499
 independent supervision at the eighth stage he stands 

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:28.860
 that he is a valuable employee and they can only do so in direct 

00:04:28.859 --> 00:04:34.939
 Contact broker an expanded route network means more planes in 

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:35.729
 Stuttgart 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.909
 and that requires more parking positions 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:42.860
 CEO of the Elder an extension of the airport therefore for 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.590
 essential 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.650
 With 54 parking spaces, the capacity is already almost complete, especially in summer 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.120
 exhausted 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.610
 Even though critics often doubt white falling passenger numbers such a 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.610
 immense investment is necessary at the moment 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:04.800
 we have what many do not know Inter makes our biggest problems 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.759
 yes that the planes have been stationed in Stuttgart 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.599
 Find them wherever and whenever possible for the next day's operation in Stuttgart 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:14.319
 That's why we are very interested in it 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:17.800
 Basically, you should always do that from German airports 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.499
 the Stuttgart has to fight particularly hard with space problems a highway 

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:26.659
 and several nearby villages make a major expansion very much 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.559
 difficult to change 

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:32.909
 Managing Director Georg Fundel wants to tackle future projects such as the 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:36.149
 Expansion of the airport or the desired medium-haul flights 

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:39.039
 advance
