00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.379
 hello to all of you so a few times sport-prestige you 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:37.420
 reserve a surprise today's one will take the form of a 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.670
 homage tribute to one of the most emblematic sportsmen of this draw of 21st 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.170
 century today so let's talk about the ferrari f430 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.350
 he is about to hand over within a few months 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.000
 it's in this next year we did that her substitute the it's a camp will be 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.820
 unveiled at the Frankfurt show these people career in the ass that we could 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.580
 sum up well 490 horses well bound by pininfarina music 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.580
 maestro first 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.720
 Yes 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.860
 reminder of the facts fall 2004 ferrari strikes very hard by presenting the 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.880
 substitute for the 360 ​​modena 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.880
 face the ball informed could have believed in a simple restyling 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.570
 avoid the f430 which is much more different than it seems judd 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.060
 back already inspired the video with protruding taillights and a 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.060
 diffuser who leaves speechless 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.660
 the f430 is a dna a little apart from a v8 in the rear center position and a 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.570
 spirit of many but then much more radical than the other ferrari the 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.500
 david yates's family has always been considered as the entry-level 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.720
 until the recent arrival of california we are reassured all the same 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.890
 the f430 remains the most dainty of the catalog except for its balance 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.460
 blow behind 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.540
 given the circumstances i'm going to have to bother you with some cipher what 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.490
 you hear in my back it's the all-aluminum enemy to usher in a 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.450
 little earlier thanks to you and maserati of 1200 cubic capacity officers was 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.940
 carried to the head 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.670
 3,490 horses aline 500 rpm 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.759
 one could believe in a very good sharp temperament unstoppable in 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.209
 reality 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.679
 Karim Benzema 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:17.099
 during training 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.099
 or downright brunet revival of the economy 

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:23.919
 it's really time 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.079
 the most accomplished of the market 

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:33.899
 then the f430 is really the one that marks the massive arrival of 

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:35.320
 electronics at ferrari 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.150
 it's a phenomenon that is symbolized by this little joystick we call the 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.160
 manettino and who manages the settings the driver assistance in 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.059
 normal traffic conditions we will put it like this site 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:47.119
 by cons the sharpest to put in mode remains 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:49.029
 it's unfortunate that it's also not to hang around too much 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:50.939
 go to Paris 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.939
 we do not say it's 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.429
 first sign a contract 

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:14.739
 it is necessary to treat the ears before treating the cervical ones besides one goes 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.339
 from that not cut to nice 

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:19.049
 in the first part of the contest will be cumulative 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.949
 metal witness in the past in the second chapter it's the shock it's a 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:23.449
 fury 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:24.599
 a tear in the summer 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.539
 he sent his seat 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:29.289
 they took off in case of arrival too positivist curve input 

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:31.989
 where the carbon-ceramic brakes will take care of reminding you of 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.809
 principles of basic physics but with poland 

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:36.829
 almost 150 pounds 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.829
 yes in fact it will be like that will remain in mode 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.510
 many more than 600 dead mostly holds the ease of transmission of the 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.539
 ground power 

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:47.089
 the traceability chassis he said 

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:49.809
 we allow ourselves passages in progress 

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:52.719
 hire even if the interventions of the electronics are not so frequent 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:54.689
 but always discreet 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:56.639
 with the model 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.809
 he had to fight against the stage if it is 

00:03:59.809 --> 00:04:03.269
 nick is more permissive 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.399
 for the exercise 

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:06.789
 0 to 100 

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:10.399
 a little more patience and we're expecting 3,115 kilometers an hour Mass was 

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:13.399
 called 

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:19.319
 m 

00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:24.340
 one thing is sure finally for the f450 which arrives at the end of the year 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.440
 the bar was set very high and the margin of progression seems well 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.010
 pregnant and with each new ferrari it's always the same story we've 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.030
 tendency to revise his classics
