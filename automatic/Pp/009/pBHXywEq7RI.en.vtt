 riding a motorcycle has its advantages over 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.990
 two wheels under the sun or even 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.120
 is the means of transport 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.120
 preferred of most of the 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.240
 Brazilian economy and the speed to 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.440
 motorcycle riding indispensable item 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.930
 helmet who goes on the rump too 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.949
 need to have this concern as well as 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.170
 the conductor 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.420
 other care that should be considered is 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.109
 the minimum age to ride on the rump of 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.630
 A motorcycle 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.510
 the Brazilian traffic code says that 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.189
 the child must be over 7 years of age and 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.750
 also has to be evaluated complexion 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.430
 physics of the child 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.860
 if its size provides security 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.200
 when she was with a passenger in the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.760
 vehicle but a bill or 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.620
 change the minimum age for 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.800
 motorcyclist carrying a child on a rump 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.789
 the proposal wants to go from seven to ten 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.100
 years 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.460
 there is the child 's physical complexion 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.730
 Better helmet size is easier to 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.960
 achieve the right size for the child and 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.579
 how do we see the same car vehicle at age 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.640
 minimum to walk in the front seat and 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.549
 10 years while the motorcycles were demanding 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.229
 only seven years while the law does not change 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.330
 the recommendation for anyone who 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.119
 children from the age of seven for 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.689
 then ensures greater security to 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.049
 children and greater than 7 physical 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.080
 helmet the child is with 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.790
 inmetro check and live in the store 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.159

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.900
 for motorcyclists 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.329
 the owner of the establishment explains that 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.229
 there are specific helmets for the 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.450
 children 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.299
 the person who buys a helmet more 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.860
 nagai in a few days will be good not 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.930
 but it has to aim at the safety of the child 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.680
 depends on the accident the helmet leaves the 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.659
 head 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.420
 to innovate with page does not have function 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.140
 for children or for children. 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.149
 the helmet should be a priority. 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.640
 indispensable security to preserve the 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.860
 life in the traffic of each more capable and 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.869

 Get out and you'll wear the helmet for an hour the boy.

 and mother how to change because it 's tight 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.069
 and a side helmet also will not stay 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.270
 with the wind it life then the person 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.270
 loses sight for
