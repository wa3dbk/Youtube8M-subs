make a circle

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.250 
make a circle
like<00:03:46.230> this<00:03:47.000> it<00:03:48.000> doesn't<00:03:48.570> have<00:03:48.660> to<00:03:48.750> be<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:48.870> circle

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
like this it doesn't have to be a circle

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.890 
like this it doesn't have to be a circle
it<00:03:49.350> can<00:03:49.500> be<00:03:49.620> an<00:03:49.800> oval<00:03:50.520> it<00:03:50.700> can<00:03:50.850> be<00:03:50.970> in<00:03:51.120> whatever

it can be an oval it can be in whatever

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.080 
it can be an oval it can be in whatever
all<00:03:53.439> right<00:03:53.620> so

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
all right so

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.510 
all right so
now<00:03:56.660> as<00:03:57.470> white<00:03:57.709> as<00:03:57.950> your<00:03:58.099> foreground<00:03:58.160> color

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
now as white as your foreground color

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.610 
now as white as your foreground color
choose<00:03:59.000> foreground<00:03:59.540> to<00:03:59.870> transparent<00:04:00.110> on<00:04:00.560> the

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
choose foreground to transparent on the

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.090 
choose foreground to transparent on the
great<00:04:00.800> Enzo<00:04:01.599> go<00:04:02.599> from<00:04:02.840> up<00:04:03.470> to<00:04:03.890> down

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
great Enzo go from up to down

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.250 
great Enzo go from up to down
I<00:04:05.160> guess

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.740 

so<00:04:08.470> it<00:04:08.709> automatically<00:04:09.340> added<00:04:09.670> that<00:04:09.819> now<00:04:10.420> once

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
so it automatically added that now once

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.809 
so it automatically added that now once
you<00:04:10.900> have<00:04:10.930> that<00:04:11.080> done<00:04:11.560> it's<00:04:12.310> basically

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
you have that done it's basically

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.720 
you have that done it's basically
