but it's awesome I'll try to break it

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.039 
but it's awesome I'll try to break it
down<00:00:14.370> I<00:00:14.700> try<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.150> figure<00:00:15.299> out<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.570> best<00:00:15.750> way<00:00:16.020> to

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
down I try to figure out the best way to

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.800 
down I try to figure out the best way to
play<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.440> for<00:00:16.619> you<00:00:16.680> guys<00:00:17.060> and<00:00:18.060> there's<00:00:18.480> lots<00:00:18.690> of

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
play it for you guys and there's lots of

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.359 
play it for you guys and there's lots of
different<00:00:19.080> ways<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.470> are<00:00:19.529> really<00:00:19.890> difficult

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
different ways that are really difficult

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.210 
different ways that are really difficult
but<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.880> think<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.930> easiest<00:00:22.320> way<00:00:22.619> so

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
but I think this is the easiest way so

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.410 
but I think this is the easiest way so
here<00:00:23.580> we<00:00:23.699> go<00:00:23.850> we're<00:00:24.060> going<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.210> be<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:24.570> C<00:00:25.199> minor

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
here we go we're going to be in C minor

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.819 
here we go we're going to be in C minor
and<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.930> third<00:00:28.529> friend

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
okay and this main riff is basically

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.690

all right so here we are and we're just

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.870 
all right so here we are and we're just
gonna<00:00:54.600> outline<00:00:55.110> basically<00:00:55.920> pick<00:00:56.220> all<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.790> way

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
gonna outline basically pick all the way

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.480 
gonna outline basically pick all the way
from

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:00.490 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.340 

all<00:01:00.610> four<00:01:01.030> of<00:01:01.060> those<00:01:01.240> and<00:01:01.990> then<00:01:02.110> we're<00:01:02.230> going

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
all four of those and then we're going

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.840 
all four of those and then we're going
to<00:01:02.410> take<00:01:02.560> this<00:01:02.770> middle<00:01:03.100> finger<00:01:03.130> and<00:01:03.490> slide<00:01:03.700> it

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
to take this middle finger and slide it

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.070 
to take this middle finger and slide it
down<00:01:03.970> the<00:01:04.090> third<00:01:04.390> fret

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.330 

and<00:01:07.170> then<00:01:07.770> five<00:01:08.100> five

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.109 

so<00:01:11.940> let's<00:01:12.090> put<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.330> together<00:01:16.760> the<00:01:17.760> best<00:01:17.970> way

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
so let's put that together the best way

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.760 
so let's put that together the best way
to<00:01:18.150> do<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.510> is<00:01:18.720> just<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:19.020> have<00:01:19.229> your

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
to do that is just to have your

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.550 
to do that is just to have your
formation<00:01:20.220> here<00:01:20.640> as<00:01:20.790> C<00:01:21.479> minor<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.259> we're<00:01:22.470> just

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
formation here as C minor and we're just

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.170 
formation here as C minor and we're just
going<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.770> lift<00:01:23.130> up<00:01:23.340> our<00:01:23.580> middle<00:01:23.880> finger<00:01:24.090> when

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
going to lift up our middle finger when

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.530 
going to lift up our middle finger when
we<00:01:24.299> get<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.720> part

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.300 

and<00:01:29.690> then<00:01:29.810> stroll<00:01:30.110> back<00:01:30.230> down

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
and then stroll back down

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.670 
and then stroll back down
so<00:01:32.640> super<00:01:33.030> easy<00:01:33.060> if<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.570> go

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:43.620 

would<00:01:37.100> be<00:01:37.130> done

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.690 

that<00:01:44.320> last<00:01:44.649> note<00:01:44.920> and<00:01:45.130> I'll<00:01:45.340> repeat<00:01:45.579> the

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
that last note and I'll repeat the

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.580 
that last note and I'll repeat the
beginning

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.850 

back<00:01:50.710> up<00:01:50.920> to<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:51.189> fourth<00:01:51.399> fret

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:10.070 

okay<00:01:57.860> so<00:01:58.580> let's<00:01:58.760> put<00:01:58.880> all<00:01:59.000> that<00:01:59.030> together

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.620 

and<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.800> kind<00:02:11.070> of<00:02:11.130> add<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.250> note<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:11.910> when<00:02:12.540> you

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
and I kind of add that note so when you

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:20.180 
and I kind of add that note so when you
go<00:02:13.250> you<00:02:14.250> can<00:02:14.400> slide<00:02:14.640> up<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:17.510> high<00:02:18.920> okay<00:02:19.920> and

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
go you can slide up to the high okay and

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.470 
go you can slide up to the high okay and
then<00:02:20.460> we're<00:02:20.610> just<00:02:20.730> going<00:02:20.850> to<00:02:20.880> move<00:02:21.180> our

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
then we're just going to move our

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.290 
then we're just going to move our
position<00:02:21.960> all<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.230> way<00:02:22.620> up<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:23.820> take<00:02:24.090> eighth

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
position all the way up to take eighth

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.140 
position all the way up to take eighth
fret<00:02:24.690> eighth<00:02:24.990> tenth<00:02:25.380> and<00:02:25.880> repeat<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:26.970> same

thing<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:33.510> I'll<00:02:33.660> feel<00:02:33.810> up<00:02:33.990> front

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
thing that I'll feel up front

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.140 
thing that I'll feel up front
we're<00:02:34.830> just<00:02:34.920> gonna<00:02:35.040> do<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.310> twice<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:36.030> then

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
we're just gonna do that twice and then

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.550 
we're just gonna do that twice and then
go<00:02:36.690> back<00:02:36.840> down<00:02:36.870> here

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.620 

and<00:02:44.069> that<00:02:44.250> brings<00:02:44.430> us<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.910> cool<00:02:45.120> part<00:02:45.420> it's

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
doing all downstrokes it's six five

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.790 
doing all downstrokes it's six five
three<00:03:14.240> and<00:03:14.840> you're<00:03:15.110> gonna<00:03:15.200> beat<00:03:15.410> that<00:03:15.620> four
