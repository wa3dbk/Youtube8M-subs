 the staff is fine, we're going to do it today 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:21.490
 the fast cookie recipe 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.950
 we're going to need an egg a spoon 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.260
 of oat bran soup and a spoon 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:32.320
 of wheat bran soup 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:35.730
 the two are together here a spoon of 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.730
 skimmed milk powder soup 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:48.890
 3 spoons of skimmed milk and 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.890
 two teaspoons of assad cooking 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:57.210
 our ancestors 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.690
 after achieving a very homogeneous mass 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:05.070
 I'm going to add 10 drops of 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.410
 vanilla and a teaspoon of yeast 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.670
 I'm using yeast 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.670
 dry biological 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.560
 Let's mix this point marine. 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.690
 resistance that the mass stays I go 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.410
 put in a spoon furnace 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:28.410
 so and then the cookie will be fine if 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.470

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.170
