00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.000
 dear friends hello it 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.720
 alexander melt you on russian channel 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.490
 tactics 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.110
 in this short clip we 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.290
 look with you on the beta version of the game 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.109
 battlefield 4 which will be released in this 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.670
 month card shanghai domination mode 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.210
 need to capture as much as possible 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:27.090
 points to reduce the enemy's score but 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.279
 the enemy's score decreases very quickly 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.780
 if most points 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.030
 already captured a little later we are with you 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.120
 look at the graphics settings menu and 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.070
 here I will immediately wish and at the level 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:47.300
 ultra and also see the menu 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.300
 customization of weapons 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.800
 I immediately rushed the fight because I needed 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:58.690
 was to capture the flag as soon as possible 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:02.200
 grab a point and here's an interactive with 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:07.420
 surroundings can be omitted to lower here 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:10.060
 these iron shutters are a pair of nice ones 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.780
 dots of the map you understand incomplete 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:17.140
 only a fragment of it can be climbed 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.300
 here and on the roof you can use the elevator 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.369
 in order to climb the roof all 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:27.990
 it will be tested very soon 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.990
 in this round 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.179
 climb up with you can it 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.039
 do everything both on the stairs and on 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:38.399
 elevator as i said before here's mine 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:38.399
 elevators 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.270
 . on top of course a very fight on and but also 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.909
 dangerous and at the same time as the bottom and the fighters 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:02:00.409
 which is on the roof very well 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:02.869
 visible and not difficult 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.539
 the enemy destroy whom you see 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.330
 on the roof 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:11.120
 jumping from the roof can be used 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.590
 also parachute here is something to me somewhat 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.590
 lucky on Prague here perhaps 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:23.040
 just suitable victims before we jump 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.280
 it was possible to open a little earlier 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:30.110
 parachute 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.110
 it you don't get such serious damage 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.850
 in general, our goal is here on 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.850
 this map in this mode is not only 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:47.150
 maximum and destruction of enemy forces 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.150
 but also capture and guard targets 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:07.410
 here is just a very good one. 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:10.260
 so many opponents here and strive 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.520
 Well, not only opponents are very convenient 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.540
 with this position 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.959
 defend the appropriate flag 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.959
 appropriate target 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:25.020
 153 they didn't even see me 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:29.280
 unlocked weapons and here knife stab 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:33.830
 well, plus a fun way to tell someone 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:39.420
 not bad not bad here tokens 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:42.990
 confused fighter competing countries here 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:48.150
 What is our default calculation for different 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:50.940
 categorized by customization classes 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.890
 weapons well, a lot of things naturally not 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.580
 will be available to us at the first level 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:00.000
 it was up to level 1, I managed to pump 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.180
 plus unlock creator now like 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.010
 time we it from 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:08.010
 still give up resurrection ally 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.659
 choose with you 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.659
 squad member we can 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.880
 stationed 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.110
 and yet we can even see his 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.469
 faces 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:30.039
 state of the environment and themes 

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:33.680
 most accurately decide on 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:36.969
 stationed precisely on a separate 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.969
 squad member 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:45.290
 starts to wear all 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.389
 I'm cleaning up here 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.750
 quick so as not to grab the hinge 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.750
 sandpiper 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:05:00.950
 I really like playing metrics 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:02.560
 battlefield 3 i probably most of 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.830
 of time played by this particular class 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:09.920
 like to resurrect people treat and so 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:13.580
 further here they were waiting for me on the roof 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:17.630
 but I think we can answer if 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:20.880
 of course this opponent will stay with us 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.960
 in the same place 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.960
 we and put 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:34.539
 but how well studied but she member 

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:38.309
 squad I stumbled over the sat rat 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:38.309
 managed to destroy 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.550
 waited, he waited there, too, is a good position 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:49.480
 easy to demolish those who climb 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:52.420
 ladder well and control 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:55.090
 disembarking if someone allied forces 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:58.420
 You can arrive a little bit of media years and 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:01.020
 advance to the edge you already pour the roof 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:04.180
 and other fighters 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:06.460
 which does not even suspect that many 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.210
 that ignited on the roof can be 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.670
 to climb 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.060
 Well, who gets at least on this card 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.060
 first 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:23.870
 I'll tell you honestly the game is now at 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:23.870
 least 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.130
 sometimes lags quite seriously in 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.639
 much more these lags 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:33.800
 manifested European servers 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:36.740
 i will try to play swedish in general 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:39.410
 the first time he was available most 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.630
 low ping for there of course and departures 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.680
 games were 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.680
 online serious 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:53.550
 young rode like a horse but then appeared 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:56.250
 Russian server is a Russian server on 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:58.550
 everything is much more pleasant for him 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:03.050
 say on the chart 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:06.000
 ultra settings but just such 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:09.150
 significant differences from the previous one 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.860
 version I do not see that is naturally 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.860
 improvements there are they visible 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:21.389
 but I need more time to think 

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.389
 to take a closer look and already 

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.830
 make a conclusion on this basis 

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:34.710
 we have this round almost over 

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:35.460
 already ended with a very good score we 

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.800
 won 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:41.090
 our team won and let's now 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:43.880
 view statistics statistics battlefield 

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:46.680
 quite a few friends left us up 

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.419
 level two thank you very much for 

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.919
