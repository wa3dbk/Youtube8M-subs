00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.500 

all<00:00:01.560> right<00:00:01.680> now<00:00:01.860> that<00:00:02.129> we<00:00:02.250> have<00:00:02.490> the<00:00:03.060> gun

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
all right now that we have the gun

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.710 
all right now that we have the gun
disassembled<00:00:04.230> we<00:00:04.620> let<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.240> action<00:00:06.240> sit

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
disassembled we let the action sit

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.120 
disassembled we let the action sit
outside<00:00:06.839> in<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.230> Sun<00:00:07.440> for<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.649> bit<00:00:07.799> and<00:00:07.950> bake

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
outside in the Sun for a bit and bake

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.000 
outside in the Sun for a bit and bake
some<00:00:08.340> of<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.490> cosmoline<00:00:08.940> off<00:00:09.150> of<00:00:09.300> it<00:00:09.889> when<00:00:10.889> it

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
some of the cosmoline off of it when it

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.190 
some of the cosmoline off of it when it
heats<00:00:11.190> up<00:00:11.370> it<00:00:11.550> tends<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.450> be<00:00:12.570> really<00:00:12.870> easy<00:00:13.049> to

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
heats up it tends to be really easy to

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.480 
heats up it tends to be really easy to
remove<00:00:13.500> because<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:13.920> can<00:00:14.040> it<00:00:14.250> can<00:00:14.280> actually

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
remove because it can it can actually

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.150 
remove because it can it can actually
Harden<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.120> dry<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.660> really<00:00:16.500> stick<00:00:16.770> on<00:00:16.949> there

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
Harden and dry and really stick on there

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.760 
Harden and dry and really stick on there
so<00:00:17.279> we<00:00:17.369> let<00:00:17.520> it<00:00:17.609> heat<00:00:17.760> up<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.090> let<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:18.720> remove<00:00:19.080> a

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
so we let it heat up and let it remove a

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.500 
so we let it heat up and let it remove a
little<00:00:20.220> bit<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.550> we<00:00:20.609> also<00:00:20.760> just<00:00:20.910> use<00:00:21.240> some

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
little bit and we also just use some

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.170 
little bit and we also just use some
some<00:00:21.900> paper<00:00:22.260> towel<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.859> remove<00:00:23.519> most<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:24.090> it

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
some paper towel to remove most of it

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.390 
some paper towel to remove most of it
off<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.449> barrel<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.199> off<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.890> magazine

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
off the barrel and and off the magazine

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.029 
off the barrel and and off the magazine
and<00:00:27.359> that'll<00:00:27.599> get<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.900> clean<00:00:28.560> enough<00:00:28.590> where

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
and that'll get you clean enough where

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.500 
and that'll get you clean enough where
you<00:00:29.310> can<00:00:29.490> start<00:00:29.699> working<00:00:29.939> on<00:00:30.179> some<00:00:30.359> other

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
you can start working on some other

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.970 
you can start working on some other
things<00:00:30.779> like<00:00:30.990> what<00:00:31.410> we<00:00:31.529> want<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.769> deal<00:00:31.920> with

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
things like what we want to deal with

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.590 
things like what we want to deal with
right<00:00:32.279> now<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.880> little<00:00:33.090> bit<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.390> surface

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
right now is a little bit of surface

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.920 
right now is a little bit of surface
rust<00:00:33.960> on<00:00:34.110> some<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.500> pieces<00:00:35.690> for<00:00:36.690> instance

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
rust on some of the pieces for instance

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.959 
rust on some of the pieces for instance
on<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> magazine<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.340> try<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.579> get<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.850> in<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
on the magazine and try to get it in the

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:39.860 
on the magazine and try to get it in the
light<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.270> can<00:00:39.329> see<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.600> can<00:00:39.719> see<00:00:39.840> a

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
light so you can see you can see a

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.180 
light so you can see you can see a
little<00:00:39.989> bit<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.200> surface<00:00:40.379> rust<00:00:40.680> on<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.980> front

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
little bit of surface rust on the front

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.670 
little bit of surface rust on the front
of<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.660> and<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.899> should<00:00:43.079> come<00:00:43.260> off<00:00:43.410> if<00:00:43.590> you

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
of that and that should come off if you

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.150 
of that and that should come off if you
use<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.920> very<00:00:44.579> fine<00:00:44.910> steel<00:00:45.660> wool<00:00:46.110> so<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:47.070> not

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
use a very fine steel wool so it's not

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.799 
use a very fine steel wool so it's not
to<00:00:47.280> scratch<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.789> metal<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.450> just<00:00:48.629> kind<00:00:48.780> of

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
to scratch the metal you just kind of

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.260 
to scratch the metal you just kind of
want<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.079> lightly<00:00:49.289> rub<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.789> won't<00:00:51.000> destroy

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
want to lightly rub it and won't destroy

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.600 
want to lightly rub it and won't destroy
the<00:00:51.390> finish<00:00:51.750> it'll<00:00:51.930> just<00:00:52.170> sort<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.610> remove

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
the finish it'll just sort of remove

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.869 
the finish it'll just sort of remove
that<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.300> surface<00:00:54.570> rust<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.760> we're<00:00:56.760> gonna

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
that that surface rust and we're gonna

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.880 
that that surface rust and we're gonna
have<00:00:57.289> Jordan<00:00:58.289> over<00:00:58.649> here<00:00:58.829> take<00:00:59.129> care<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.460> that

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
have Jordan over here take care of that

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.709 
have Jordan over here take care of that
he's<00:01:01.890> gonna<00:01:02.039> try<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.340> get<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.699> off<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.480> should

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
he's gonna try to get it off it should

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:11.390 
he's gonna try to get it off it should
come<00:01:03.899> off<00:01:04.019> pretty<00:01:04.320> easy<00:01:09.979> now<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.010> want<00:01:11.310> to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
come off pretty easy now you want to

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.609 
come off pretty easy now you want to
when<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.330> do<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.780> probably<00:01:13.140> don't<00:01:13.409> want

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
when you do this you probably don't want

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.920 
when you do this you probably don't want
to<00:01:13.710> use<00:01:13.890> any<00:01:14.070> oil<00:01:14.340> with<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.600> issue<00:01:15.659> with

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
to use any oil with it the issue with

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.859 
to use any oil with it the issue with
oil<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.820> the<00:01:17.820> rust<00:01:18.150> will<00:01:18.390> get<00:01:18.570> stuck

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
oil is that the rust will get stuck

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.700 
oil is that the rust will get stuck
inside<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.710> fibers<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.610> steel<00:01:20.880> wool<00:01:21.119> and

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
inside the fibers of the steel wool and

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.740 
inside the fibers of the steel wool and
I'll<00:01:22.710> create<00:01:23.369> more<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.670> problems<00:01:24.090> with

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
I'll create more of a problems with

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.350 
I'll create more of a problems with
scratching<00:01:25.290> by<00:01:25.470> pushing<00:01:26.040> in<00:01:26.549> keeping<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.330> the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
scratching by pushing in keeping the the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.719 
scratching by pushing in keeping the the
rust<00:01:27.780> particles<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.380> area<00:01:28.680> if<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.070> do<00:01:29.610> it

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
rust particles in the area if you do it

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.630 
rust particles in the area if you do it
dry<00:01:30.060> like<00:01:30.840> Jordan<00:01:31.229> just<00:01:31.350> stood<00:01:31.500> there<00:01:31.640> the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
dry like Jordan just stood there the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.580 
dry like Jordan just stood there the
rust<00:01:33.060> particles<00:01:33.210> will<00:01:33.540> fall<00:01:33.720> away<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.259> you'll

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
rust particles will fall away and you'll

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.310 
rust particles will fall away and you'll
end<00:01:34.740> up<00:01:34.799> with<00:01:34.950> something<00:01:35.130> like<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:36.320> which

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
end up with something like that which

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.899 
end up with something like that which
obviously<00:01:37.650> still<00:01:38.009> has<00:01:38.130> rust<00:01:38.400> underneath<00:01:38.670> it

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
obviously still has rust underneath it

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.240 
obviously still has rust underneath it
you<00:01:39.000> can<00:01:39.150> see<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.450> it's<00:01:39.630> bobbled<00:01:39.960> but<00:01:40.250> it

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
you can see that it's bobbled but it

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.800 
you can see that it's bobbled but it
doesn't<00:01:41.490> look<00:01:41.579> rusty<00:01:41.939> anymore<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.509> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
doesn't look rusty anymore and the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.780 
doesn't look rusty anymore and the
surface<00:01:43.110> rust<00:01:43.259> has<00:01:43.380> fallen<00:01:43.619> off

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
surface rust has fallen off

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.730 
surface rust has fallen off
we've<00:01:45.149> also<00:01:45.329> also<00:01:45.840> gonna<00:01:45.960> use<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.500> same

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
we've also also gonna use this same

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.649 
we've also also gonna use this same
technique<00:01:47.159> on<00:01:47.460> different<00:01:48.149> pieces<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.570> the

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
technique on different pieces of the

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.389 
technique on different pieces of the
barrel<00:01:48.960> band<00:01:49.170> actually<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.710> receiver<00:01:50.130> when

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
barrel band actually the receiver when

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.899 
barrel band actually the receiver when
we<00:01:50.460> started<00:01:50.759> stripping<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:52.399> it<00:01:53.399> has<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.610> little

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
we started stripping it it has a little

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.310 
we started stripping it it has a little
bit<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.329> surface<00:01:54.570> rust<00:01:55.670> and<00:01:56.670> also<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:58.020> barrel

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
bit of surface rust and also the barrel

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.219 
bit of surface rust and also the barrel
does<00:01:58.530> as<00:01:58.710> well<00:01:58.890> up<00:01:59.070> here<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.670> the<00:02:00.570> steel<00:02:01.079> wool

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
does as well up here and the steel wool

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.830 
does as well up here and the steel wool
is<00:02:01.350> actually<00:02:01.619> also<00:02:01.740> good<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.939> pieces<00:02:03.750> at

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
is actually also good on the pieces at

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.510 
is actually also good on the pieces at
that<00:02:03.960> paint<00:02:04.259> like<00:02:04.469> this<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:04.860> buck<00:02:05.100> point<00:02:05.340> had

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
that paint like this this buck point had

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.419 
that paint like this this buck point had
black<00:02:06.240> paint<00:02:06.540> on<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.860> we<00:02:07.979> just<00:02:08.160> used<00:02:08.340> that

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
black paint on it and we just used that

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.300 
black paint on it and we just used that
fine<00:02:08.759> steel<00:02:09.030> wool<00:02:09.530> lightly<00:02:10.530> rubbed<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.099> we

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
fine steel wool lightly rubbed it and we

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.930 
fine steel wool lightly rubbed it and we
got<00:02:11.459> most<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.849> paint<00:02:12.060> off<00:02:12.239> and

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
got most of the paint off and

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.490 
got most of the paint off and
bluing<00:02:13.270> underneath<00:02:13.600> it's<00:02:13.780> actually<00:02:14.170> fine<00:02:14.470> I

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
bluing underneath it's actually fine I

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.710 
bluing underneath it's actually fine I
don't<00:02:14.890> know<00:02:15.010> why<00:02:15.940> it<00:02:16.000> was<00:02:16.150> painted<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.630> was

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
don't know why it was painted it was

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.780 
don't know why it was painted it was
just<00:02:16.960> probably<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.320> long-term<00:02:17.800> an<00:02:18.250> idea<00:02:18.580> for<00:02:18.730> a

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
just probably a long-term an idea for a

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.510 
just probably a long-term an idea for a
long-term<00:02:19.150> storage<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:19.810> stop<00:02:20.110> rust<00:02:20.520> probably

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
long-term storage to stop rust probably

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.000 
long-term storage to stop rust probably
way<00:02:21.910> way<00:02:22.120> way<00:02:22.300> cheaper<00:02:22.330> as<00:02:22.870> well<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.980> other

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
way way way cheaper as well the other

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.140 
way way way cheaper as well the other
thing<00:02:24.220> you'll<00:02:24.340> want<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.550> do<00:02:24.700> is<00:02:24.790> after<00:02:24.940> you

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
thing you'll want to do is after you

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.090 
thing you'll want to do is after you
clean<00:02:25.360> it<00:02:25.510> up<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:25.930> get<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.170> rust<00:02:26.440> off<00:02:26.620> is<00:02:26.860> is

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
clean it up and get the rust off is is

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.900 
clean it up and get the rust off is is
real<00:02:27.850> Oubre<00:02:28.180> kate<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.600> metal<00:02:29.430> I'd<00:02:30.430> use<00:02:30.700> REM

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
real Oubre kate the metal I'd use REM

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.790 
real Oubre kate the metal I'd use REM
oil<00:02:31.150> that's<00:02:31.810> one<00:02:32.020> thing<00:02:32.200> we've<00:02:32.320> been<00:02:32.350> using<00:02:32.680> a

oil that's one thing we've been using a

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.830 
oil that's one thing we've been using a
lot<00:02:33.010> and<00:02:33.760> it's<00:02:33.910> fairly<00:02:34.120> cheap<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:34.660> you<00:02:34.720> can

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
lot and it's fairly cheap and you can

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.230

of<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.660> metal<00:02:40.870> pieces<00:02:41.290> it'll<00:02:41.530> help<00:02:41.710> with<00:02:41.770> the

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
of the metal pieces it'll help with the

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.400 
of the metal pieces it'll help with the
finish<00:02:42.310> too<00:02:42.660> it'll<00:02:43.660> keep<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.810> blue<00:02:44.080> look<00:02:44.320> a

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
finish too it'll keep the blue look a

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.970 
finish too it'll keep the blue look a
little<00:02:44.680> bit<00:02:44.830> a<00:02:45.250> little<00:02:46.030> bit<00:02:46.150> shinier<00:02:46.980> but

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
little bit a little bit shinier but

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.710 
little bit a little bit shinier but
basically<00:02:48.670> continue<00:02:49.150> that<00:02:49.300> that<00:02:49.510> same

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
basically continue that that same

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.360 
basically continue that that same
procedure<00:02:50.110> on<00:02:50.230> all<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.770> different<00:02:50.950> pieces<00:02:51.190> of

procedure on all the different pieces of

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.850 
procedure on all the different pieces of
the<00:02:51.490> rifle<00:02:51.930> that<00:02:52.930> need<00:02:53.140> it<00:02:53.290> all<00:02:53.710> the<00:02:53.770> different

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
pieces of metal that need it and when

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.960 
pieces of metal that need it and when
you're<00:02:56.530> done<00:02:56.650> real<00:02:57.220> Oubre<00:02:57.460> Kate<00:02:57.670> them<00:02:57.850> and

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
you're done real Oubre Kate them and

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.000 
you're done real Oubre Kate them and
that<00:02:58.090> old<00:02:58.240> now<00:02:58.870> get<00:02:59.170> them<00:02:59.260> without<00:02:59.560> doing

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
that old now get them without doing

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.670 
that old now get them without doing
anything<00:03:00.190> major<00:03:00.580> without<00:03:01.240> going<00:03:01.630> to<00:03:01.870> the

anything major without going to the

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.330 
anything major without going to the
extent<00:03:03.010> of<00:03:03.160> reblooming<00:03:04.950> that'll<00:03:05.950> get<00:03:06.100> enough

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
extent of reblooming that'll get enough

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.010 
extent of reblooming that'll get enough
done<00:03:06.610> that<00:03:06.970> that<00:03:07.330> you<00:03:07.480> can<00:03:07.630> put<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.870> rifle

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
done that that you can put the rifle

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.270 
done that that you can put the rifle
together<00:03:08.350> and<00:03:08.500> have<00:03:08.590> a<00:03:08.620> decent<00:03:08.830> looking

portion<00:03:14.230> we're<00:03:14.350> gonna<00:03:14.440> do<00:03:14.680> is<00:03:14.800> going<00:03:14.890> to<00:03:14.950> be

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
portion we're gonna do is going to be

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.060 
portion we're gonna do is going to be
staggering<00:03:15.460> finishing<00:03:15.970> stripping<00:03:16.480> and

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
staggering finishing stripping and
