hey<00:00:01.230> guys<00:00:01.469> it's<00:00:01.800> therapy<00:00:02.159> Qbert<00:00:02.520> and<00:00:02.760> today<00:00:03.270> I

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
hey guys it's therapy Qbert and today I

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:11.810 
hey guys it's therapy Qbert and today I
have<00:00:03.750> a<00:00:03.780> cool<00:00:04.080> little<00:00:04.110> mod<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.740> show<00:00:04.950> you<00:00:10.820> so

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
have a cool little mod to show you so

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.330 
have a cool little mod to show you so
the<00:00:12.090> reason<00:00:12.480> why<00:00:12.630> there<00:00:12.929> is<00:00:13.139> no<00:00:13.349> red<00:00:14.099> side

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
the reason why there is no red side

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.919 
the reason why there is no red side
first<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.700> all<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:15.030> because<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.389> just<00:00:15.690> don't

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
first of all is because I just don't

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.470 
first of all is because I just don't
have<00:00:16.080> any<00:00:16.230> red<00:00:16.470> side<00:00:16.740> stickers<00:00:17.340> for<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.789> 5x5<00:00:18.449> and

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
have any red side stickers for a 5x5 and

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.859 
have any red side stickers for a 5x5 and
I'm<00:00:18.779> too<00:00:18.930> lazy<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.619> buy<00:00:20.130> some<00:00:20.570> so<00:00:21.570> I'm<00:00:21.720> making

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
I'm too lazy to buy some so I'm making

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.540 
I'm too lazy to buy some so I'm making
this<00:00:22.050> video<00:00:22.199> right<00:00:22.350> now<00:00:22.650> before<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.130> get<00:00:23.369> any

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
this video right now before I get any

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.529 
this video right now before I get any
anytime<00:00:24.510> soon<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:25.070> yeah<00:00:26.070> without<00:00:27.060> out<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.420> the

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
anytime soon so yeah without out of the

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.730 
anytime soon so yeah without out of the
way<00:00:27.660> let's<00:00:28.320> talk<00:00:28.560> about<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.890> mod<00:00:30.019> so<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.500> is

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
way let's talk about the mod so this is

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.729 
way let's talk about the mod so this is
a<00:00:31.820> 5x5<00:00:32.820> cutter<00:00:33.180> cube<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.989> looks<00:00:34.260> like<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.440> normal

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
a 5x5 cutter cube it looks like a normal

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.190 
a 5x5 cutter cube it looks like a normal
5<00:00:34.890> by<00:00:35.010> 5<00:00:35.160> which<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.520> pretty<00:00:35.820> cool<00:00:36.090> except<00:00:36.660> when

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
5 by 5 which is pretty cool except when

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.979 
5 by 5 which is pretty cool except when
you<00:00:37.290> try<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.500> turn<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:38.760> way<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.750> doesn't

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
you try to turn it this way it doesn't

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.119 
you try to turn it this way it doesn't
move<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.890> turns<00:00:41.129> only<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.820> U<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.210> D<00:00:42.390> faces<00:00:43.129> but

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
move it turns only the U and D faces but

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.180 
move it turns only the U and D faces but
not<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.399> other<00:00:44.550> faces<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.890> I'm<00:00:46.890> trying<00:00:47.160> to

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
not the other faces so I'm trying to

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.950 
not the other faces so I'm trying to
move<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.520> but<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.730> can't<00:00:47.969> if<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.629> don't<00:00:48.899> know

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
move it but I can't if you don't know

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.510 
move it but I can't if you don't know
what<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.110> cutter<00:00:49.320> cube<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:50.250> basically

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
what a cutter cube is it's basically

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.709 
what a cutter cube is it's basically
when<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.510> take<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.989> 3x3<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.850> offset<00:00:54.539> you

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
when you take a 3x3 you offset you

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.040 
when you take a 3x3 you offset you
offset<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.379> slice<00:00:55.800> off<00:00:56.219> by<00:00:57.000> 45<00:00:57.480> degrees<00:00:57.809> and

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
offset this slice off by 45 degrees and

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.970 
offset this slice off by 45 degrees and
then<00:00:58.800> trim<00:00:59.760> off<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.390> edge<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:01.649> flush

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
then trim off this edge that it's flush

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.870 
then trim off this edge that it's flush
with<00:01:02.010> these<00:01:02.699> two<00:01:03.030> layers<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.690> then<00:01:04.700> build<00:01:05.700> up

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
with these two layers and then build up

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.120 
with these two layers and then build up
from<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.299> Center<00:01:06.689> up<00:01:07.170> with<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.710> edges<00:01:08.010> so

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
from this Center up with the edges so

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.310 
from this Center up with the edges so
that<00:01:08.159> it's<00:01:08.400> flush<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:09.140> column<00:01:10.140> right<00:01:10.170> here

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
that it's flush this column right here

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.370 
that it's flush this column right here
you<00:01:11.130> do<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.729> all<00:01:11.880> four<00:01:11.909> sides<00:01:12.350> so<00:01:13.350> that

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
you do that to all four sides so that

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.710 
you do that to all four sides so that
when<00:01:14.130> it's<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.369> its<00:01:14.549> cube<00:01:14.790> shape<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.540> what

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
when it's in its cube shape this is what

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.899 
when it's in its cube shape this is what
it<00:01:15.810> looks<00:01:15.990> like<00:01:16.049> on<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.320> inner<00:01:16.530> mechanism<00:01:17.130> but

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
it looks like on the inner mechanism but

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.090 
it looks like on the inner mechanism but
then<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.390> have<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.570> do<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.780> 45<00:01:19.110> degree<00:01:19.320> turn<00:01:19.770> and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
then you have to do a 45 degree turn and

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.940 
then you have to do a 45 degree turn and
then<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.820> can<00:01:21.090> turn<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> same<00:01:22.770> thing

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
then you can turn it so the same thing

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.219 
then you can turn it so the same thing
applies<00:01:23.220> here<00:01:25.670> if<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.820> take<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.030> 5x5<00:01:27.659> right<00:01:27.840> here

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
applies here if I take a 5x5 right here

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.899 
applies here if I take a 5x5 right here
if<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.740> were<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.920> look<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.490> internal

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
if you were to look on the internal

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.880 
if you were to look on the internal
mechanism<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.630> 5x5<00:01:31.170> right<00:01:31.409> now<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.799> this

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
mechanism of this 5x5 right now in this

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.390 
mechanism of this 5x5 right now in this
cube<00:01:32.159> shape<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.970> would<00:01:33.119> look<00:01:33.329> like<00:01:33.659> that

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:44.410 

so<00:01:38.400> what<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:38.970> have<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.119> do<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:40.400> offset<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.600> oops

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
so what you have to do is offset it oops

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.740 
so what you have to do is offset it oops
like<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.790> then<00:01:48.740> you<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:49.920> turn<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.659> and<00:01:51.659> it

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
like so and then you can turn it and it

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.160 
like so and then you can turn it and it
turns<00:01:52.020> both<00:01:52.470> layers<00:01:52.799> it's<00:01:53.100> fully<00:01:53.369> functional

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
turns both layers it's fully functional

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.120 
turns both layers it's fully functional
its<00:01:55.170> shape<00:01:55.409> shifts

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.590 

it's<00:01:59.880> shape-shift<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:01.520> it's<00:02:02.520> really<00:02:03.180> really

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
it's shape-shift so it's really really

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.830 
it's shape-shift so it's really really
cool<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:04.200> solved<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.680> once<00:02:04.890> before<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:06.210> I'm

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
cool I solved it once before and I I'm

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.290 
cool I solved it once before and I I'm
gonna<00:02:07.050> upload<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.440> solve<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.369> pretty<00:02:09.030> soon

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
gonna upload a solve of this pretty soon

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.940 
gonna upload a solve of this pretty soon
maybe<00:02:09.690> in<00:02:09.869> like<00:02:10.050> two<00:02:10.590> days

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
maybe in like two days

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.620 
maybe in like two days
Irie<00:02:11.580> still<00:02:11.760> good<00:02:11.850> this<00:02:11.940> with<00:02:12.120> our<00:02:12.390> Chang

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
Irie still good this with our Chang

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.840 
Irie still good this with our Chang
stickers<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:14.130> reason<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.490> didn't<00:02:14.730> use

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
stickers and the reason I didn't use

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.870 
stickers and the reason I didn't use
vanilla<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.600> cut<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.620> for<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:16.980> specific<00:02:17.700> shape

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
vanilla to cut it for the specific shape

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.699 
vanilla to cut it for the specific shape
of<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.150> Kyuubi<00:02:18.480> it's<00:02:18.959> because<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.350> wanted<00:02:19.620> to

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
of the Kyuubi it's because I wanted to

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.460 
of the Kyuubi it's because I wanted to
look<00:02:19.860> like<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:20.070> normal<00:02:20.430> five<00:02:20.610> by<00:02:20.790> five<00:02:21.320> so<00:02:22.320> that

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
look like a normal five by five so that

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.199 
look like a normal five by five so that
when<00:02:22.620> people<00:02:22.800> go<00:02:23.340> up<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:23.910> they<00:02:24.000> start

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
when people go up to it and they start

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.880 
when people go up to it and they start
turning<00:02:24.360> in<00:02:24.600> they're<00:02:24.810> really<00:02:25.320> confused<00:02:25.500> and

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
turning in they're really confused and

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.870 
turning in they're really confused and
it's<00:02:26.010> cool<00:02:26.310> so<00:02:27.950> if<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.990> if<00:02:30.990> I<00:02:31.200> were<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.880> pop

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
it's cool so if you if I were to pop

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.479 
it's cool so if you if I were to pop
open<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.239> mechanism<00:02:33.720> right<00:02:33.810> here<00:02:34.190> so<00:02:35.190> here

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
open the mechanism right here so here

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.630 
open the mechanism right here so here
you<00:02:35.610> can<00:02:35.730> see<00:02:35.940> this<00:02:36.120> is<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.570> normal<00:02:37.640> centerpiece

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
you can see this is a normal centerpiece

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.360 
you can see this is a normal centerpiece
it's<00:02:39.090> like<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.300> middle<00:02:39.660> centerpiece<00:02:40.140> of<00:02:40.350> an<00:02:41.100> of

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
it's like a middle centerpiece of an of

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.960 
it's like a middle centerpiece of an of
an<00:02:41.610> out<00:02:41.730> Chang<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.380> this<00:02:43.380> is<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:44.430> modded

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
an out Chang and this is the modded

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.680 
an out Chang and this is the modded
piece<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:46.500> cutter<00:02:46.709> cube<00:02:47.209> what<00:02:48.209> I<00:02:48.239> did<00:02:48.510> as

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
piece of the cutter cube what I did as

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.680 
piece of the cutter cube what I did as
you<00:02:48.810> can<00:02:48.959> see<00:02:49.140> is<00:02:49.350> I<00:02:49.680> just<00:02:50.130> took<00:02:50.640> this<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.180> I

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
you can see is I just took this and I

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.080 
you can see is I just took this and I
extended<00:02:52.110> it<00:02:52.230> up<00:02:52.350> by<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.130> way<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.370> used<00:02:53.640> a<00:02:53.790> shank

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
extended it up by the way I used a shank

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.390 
extended it up by the way I used a shank
chef's<00:02:54.300> 5x5<00:02:54.780> for<00:02:54.930> this<00:02:55.050> one<00:02:55.200> here<00:02:55.650> we<00:02:55.890> see<00:02:56.160> a

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
chef's 5x5 for this one here we see a

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.840 
chef's 5x5 for this one here we see a
normal<00:02:56.790> corner<00:02:57.780> centerpiece<00:02:58.680> from<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.670> moyu

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
normal corner centerpiece from the moyu

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.350 
normal corner centerpiece from the moyu
out<00:03:00.090> ring<00:03:00.330> and<00:03:00.600> here<00:03:01.440> is<00:03:01.590> a<00:03:01.620> modded<00:03:02.220> one<00:03:02.400> now<00:03:03.150> it

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
out ring and here is a modded one now it

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.990 
out ring and here is a modded one now it
sort<00:03:03.570> of<00:03:03.690> looks<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.900> same<00:03:04.170> but<00:03:04.830> they're<00:03:05.640> flat

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
sort of looks the same but they're flat

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.289 
sort of looks the same but they're flat
on<00:03:06.209> different<00:03:06.600> angles<00:03:07.130> so<00:03:08.130> here<00:03:08.670> you<00:03:08.850> can<00:03:09.000> see

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
on different angles so here you can see

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.830 
on different angles so here you can see
that<00:03:10.230> it<00:03:10.440> used<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.890> slant<00:03:11.519> this<00:03:11.820> way<00:03:12.060> but<00:03:12.690> then

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
that it used to slant this way but then

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.780 
that it used to slant this way but then
I<00:03:12.959> cut<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:13.590> then<00:03:13.739> extended<00:03:14.280> it<00:03:14.400> this<00:03:14.549> way

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
I cut it and then extended it this way

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.590 
I cut it and then extended it this way
so<00:03:15.890> it's<00:03:16.890> still<00:03:17.130> flat<00:03:17.430> but<00:03:18.150> on<00:03:18.360> a<00:03:18.420> different

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
so it's still flat but on a different

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.470 
so it's still flat but on a different
angle<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:19.320> lastly<00:03:19.799> here<00:03:20.280> is<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.820> edge<00:03:21.150> piece

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
angle and lastly here is the edge piece

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.539 
angle and lastly here is the edge piece
this<00:03:21.690> is<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.870> normal<00:03:22.260> edge<00:03:22.620> piece<00:03:23.070> of<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.310> normal

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
this is a normal edge piece of a normal

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.030 
this is a normal edge piece of a normal
five<00:03:23.700> by<00:03:23.820> five<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.269> this<00:03:25.170> is<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.500> modded<00:03:25.860> edge

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
five by five and this is the modded edge

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.000 
five by five and this is the modded edge
piece<00:03:26.390> as<00:03:27.390> you<00:03:27.450> can<00:03:27.750> see<00:03:27.989> it's<00:03:28.230> very<00:03:28.350> different

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
piece as you can see it's very different

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.039 
piece as you can see it's very different
it's<00:03:29.760> pretty<00:03:30.000> obvious<00:03:30.329> what<00:03:30.480> I<00:03:30.510> did<00:03:30.690> here<00:03:31.019> I

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
it's pretty obvious what I did here I

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.740 
it's pretty obvious what I did here I
just<00:03:31.200> cut<00:03:31.799> it<00:03:31.950> down<00:03:31.980> here<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:32.970> then<00:03:33.090> flattened

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
just cut it down here and then flattened

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.110 
just cut it down here and then flattened
it<00:03:33.840> out<00:03:33.959> and<00:03:35.180> yeah<00:03:36.470> now<00:03:37.519> another<00:03:38.519> thing<00:03:38.640> to<00:03:38.910> say

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
it out and yeah now another thing to say

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.930 
it out and yeah now another thing to say
is<00:03:39.390> thicker<00:03:39.750> look<00:03:40.019> kind<00:03:40.260> of<00:03:40.380> offset<00:03:40.940> right

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
is thicker look kind of offset right

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.640 
is thicker look kind of offset right
here<00:03:42.239> on<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.420> edges<00:03:42.690> right<00:03:42.930> here<00:03:42.989> or<00:03:43.440> the

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
here on the edges right here or the

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.930 
here on the edges right here or the
center's<00:03:44.750> because<00:03:45.750> they<00:03:46.530> are<00:03:46.799> I<00:03:47.220> rounded<00:03:47.730> them

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
center's because they are I rounded them

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.819 
center's because they are I rounded them
and<00:03:48.209> I<00:03:48.329> made<00:03:48.480> them<00:03:48.660> kind<00:03:48.840> of<00:03:48.959> dig<00:03:49.230> in<00:03:49.410> this<00:03:49.620> way

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
and I made them kind of dig in this way

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.940 
and I made them kind of dig in this way
or<00:03:50.100> slant<00:03:50.400> in<00:03:50.549> that<00:03:50.700> way<00:03:50.850> so<00:03:51.120> that<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:52.560> puzzle

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
or slant in that way so that the puzzle

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.740 
or slant in that way so that the puzzle
could<00:03:53.130> actually<00:03:53.280> corner<00:03:54.150> cut<00:03:54.329> decently

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
could actually corner cut decently

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.390 
could actually corner cut decently
because<00:03:55.260> otherwise<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.920> pieces<00:03:56.190> would<00:03:56.340> be

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
because otherwise the pieces would be

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.759 
because otherwise the pieces would be
very<00:03:56.940> very<00:03:57.299> square<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:57.930> would<00:03:58.290> not<00:03:58.470> be<00:03:58.530> able

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
very very square and would not be able

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.910 
very very square and would not be able
to<00:03:58.890> turn<00:03:59.220> so<00:04:00.120> I<00:04:00.570> had<00:04:01.019> to<00:04:01.140> kind<00:04:01.350> of<00:04:01.440> round<00:04:01.620> these

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
to turn so I had to kind of round these

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.920 
to turn so I had to kind of round these
pieces<00:04:02.190> so<00:04:02.610> that<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.180> puzzle<00:04:03.540> could<00:04:03.750> actually

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
pieces so that the puzzle could actually

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.470 
pieces so that the puzzle could actually
turn<00:04:04.320> on<00:04:04.350> this<00:04:04.680> layer<00:04:04.970> this<00:04:05.970> is<00:04:06.329> a

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
turn on this layer this is a

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.100 
turn on this layer this is a
checkerboard<00:04:07.049> pattern<00:04:07.109> sort<00:04:07.829> of

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
checkerboard pattern sort of

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.000 
checkerboard pattern sort of
I<00:04:08.140> guess<00:04:08.470> I<00:04:08.740> don't<00:04:08.920> even<00:04:09.010> know<00:04:09.190> but<00:04:09.430> um<00:04:10.950> let<00:04:11.950> me

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
I guess I don't even know but um let me

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.990 
I guess I don't even know but um let me
just<00:04:12.250> say<00:04:12.460> huge<00:04:13.240> thanks<00:04:13.810> to<00:04:14.280> Allison<00:04:15.280> or<00:04:15.580> the
