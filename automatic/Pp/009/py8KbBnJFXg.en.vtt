00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.189
 of bogotÃ¡ in 2012 inspired the 2600 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.019
 to perform a minute for the pedestrian 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.460
 a bet to ask the 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.320
 district administration and 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.650
 citizens who care more about their 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.650
 lives 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.640
 to the sizes 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.050
 through a call for 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.879
 social networks the 2600 combo invited 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.670
 the citizens to perform a flashmob on 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.469

 they closed the roads and the citizens 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.670
 they made a minute of silence for the 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.260
 pedestrians deceased pedestrians 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.729
 recognize that in some cases 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.210
 accidents are caused by your 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:57.210
 imprudence 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.590

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.330
 organizers of the event considers that 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.620
 the reasons that put life at stake 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.620
 citizens go beyond 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.700
 with the slogan want to think and do 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.920
 city this group of young people are looking for 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.690
 the Bogotanos take over their city and 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.170
 Do not wait for things to be done 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.170
 from above 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.370
 an initiative that they celebrate near the 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.370

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.220

 46% of daily trips are made 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.990
 walking which makes it indispensable that 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.910
 there is better signaling controls 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.340
 speed and spaces for those 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.930
 they walk on the streets besides the 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.610
 citizens and drivers are 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.190
 aware that the safety of 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.190
 pedestrian is a responsibility
