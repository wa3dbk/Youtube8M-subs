this<00:01:26.580> father<00:01:26.850> actually<00:01:27.420> did<00:01:27.960> kill<00:01:28.200> his<00:01:28.320> own

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
this father actually did kill his own

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.109 
this father actually did kill his own
son<00:01:28.710> why<00:01:28.860> would<00:01:29.009> he<00:01:29.070> kill<00:01:29.220> his<00:01:29.340> own<00:01:29.460> son<00:01:29.700> guys<00:01:29.939> I

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
son why would he kill his own son guys I

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.819 
son why would he kill his own son guys I
know<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.270> he<00:01:30.479> might<00:01:30.900> be<00:01:30.990> sad<00:01:31.290> about<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.619> loss

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
know that he might be sad about the loss

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.620 
know that he might be sad about the loss
of<00:01:31.979> his<00:01:32.100> other<00:01:32.250> son<00:01:32.579> but<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.119> don't<00:01:33.210> think<00:01:33.479> that

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
of his other son but I don't think that

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.359 
of his other son but I don't think that
a<00:01:33.659> father<00:01:33.930> would<00:01:34.079> kill<00:01:34.350> his<00:01:34.530> own<00:01:34.619> son<00:01:34.860> guys<00:01:35.070> or

at<00:01:35.579> least<00:01:35.759> in<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:36.030> game<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.329> don't<00:01:36.450> think<00:01:36.600> that

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
at least in this game I don't think that

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.480 
at least in this game I don't think that
these<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:37.079> family<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.950> father<00:01:38.250> would

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
these this family this father would

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.010

even a mangle plush doll or a toy mangle
I'm<00:02:35.390> not<00:02:35.540> sure<00:02:35.659> exactly<00:02:35.989> what<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.349> is<00:02:36.379> but

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
I'm not sure exactly what it is but

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.890 
I'm not sure exactly what it is but
mangle<00:02:37.310> is<00:02:37.400> actually<00:02:37.760> a<00:02:37.790> female<00:02:38.090> as<00:02:38.450> well<00:02:38.720> so<00:02:38.840> I

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
mangle is actually a female as well so I

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.839
