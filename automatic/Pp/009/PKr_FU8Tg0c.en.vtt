00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.480
 I am simply giving you and today we are 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.449
 in this new video tutorial in this 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.750
 I will explain how to insert video 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:25.240
 a 500 gigabyte hard drive is 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.119
 back into the adapter and then inserted 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.599
 to insert it in the ps3 this here at 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.740
 ps3 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:34.649
 the super slim we have to have a 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:38.430
 our hard disk is fine 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.430
 from 500 gb 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.899
 the hard disk adapter ok 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.629
 and then here as you can see we have 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.760
 also of the screws that obviously levi that 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.679
 will be used to put the hard disk 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.269
 on the adapter and fix it and of course 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:59.530
 we must have a staff available 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:01.690
 playtech I must also have available 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.809
 a screwdriver in such a way as to total 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.420
 okay screws as you already know I hope and 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.240
 so we can proceed to kids 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.080
 we all have to put the play in 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.510
 vertical 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.950
 this way where the reader is like that 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.490
 push down and to the left 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.230
 on my side so obviously in 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.690
 this way so that it comes off 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:29.020
 this part is here where we will go to 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.440
 put our hard disk then the 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.930
 play put it aside for now 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.930
 ok and let's start with the 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.850
 hard disk message we take the 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.040
 we pull it out of my hard drive 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.580
 I recommend kids very gently 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.850
 because it's really a piece 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:51.670
 according to me that obviously if it falls or you do 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.390
 abrupt movements of the TV inserted quarries 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:59.170
 they are cocks but really they are cocks cocks 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:02.130
 here we have the teeth then the teeth 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.770
 they always go outwards 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:10.060
 we take the adapter and go to 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.909
 insert the hard disk in this way 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.230
 being very careful 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:17.810
 joke on the contrary because 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.629
 this one is the part we say front 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.510
 of the hard disk and let's insert a 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.580
 once inserted we turn it getting with 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.879
 the index and the thumb here in such a way 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.010
 that the hard disk does not fall and we go to 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.650
 we can take a second well 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.129
 oh well let's go get our lives 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.560
 the screws also have a rubber pad that serves 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:43.610
 to make the thickness let's say the thickness 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:49.489
 and then the vine we put the screw in 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:53.180
 rubber that we go to live here where 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:55.370
 I recommend the screw holes 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:00.079
 boys first or fingers with canvas fingers 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:03.260
 so that you do not force because I am 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:09.590
 some very delicate screws and go to 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:12.980
 inhabit it ok luckily we have the 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.170
 rubber that protects the same thing itself 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.590
 procedure 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.660
 put the rubber in the screw and 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.720
 advice as I read on the internet of 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.090
 screw the opposite one ever these two 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.160
 clots 2 qa first then one in 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.430
 diagonal practically so that 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:36.169
 do not force on the same point but 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:40.989
 the force in reciprocal quotation marks 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:40.989
 on all two acts also here we 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:53.540
 ok now let me want to live itself 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:55.069
 procedure my ok here you can put it 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.609
 where you want there is between a corner and 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.609
 from the other equal 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:06.230
 let's also avoid this here once 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.349
 also invited this we go to 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.709
 screw the last screw we almost have 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.709
 finished 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:21.139
 it's a quick thing, however, not to do 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:22.610
 gently, I've already done it 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.159
 before making this video for this 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.380
 that you have lived in short, everything 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:28.260
 I've already done it once screwed in all 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.560
 the screws 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:35.010
 there remains this life this life is the 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:39.840
 screw the so-called bastard vine as I have 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:44.550
 read on the internet the screw will be screwed 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:47.490
 with dates I bring, let's leave them for a moment 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:52.170
 to the disk and we still carry the ps3 la 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:53.400
 life and blue to gravitated between this and 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.070
 this then both 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.860
 zac must be thought of and very often 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.940
 that of you breaks in those cases 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.300
 because it gets stronger so I recommend it 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.160
 boys don't you force now let's go to 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.980
 place the hard disk inside 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.870
 of our plate 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.510
 as you can see it does not enter yet 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.660
 because because we did not close well 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:20.060
 our lives 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.060
 so here I need to do some strength myself 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.930
 you still do two or three laps is right 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.810
 because there are so many rubbers that 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.360
 keep kids don't be afraid 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.240
 I've already tried it before then 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:38.280
 quiet, nothing happens 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.950
 I recommend you do not overdo it 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.490
 and I told him strength but minimal strength 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:48.300
 it is right to live a little better 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:51.420
 perfect now should interest the 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.300
 perfect seals you have to do a little bit of 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.820
 force that here to put it inside 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:06:01.020
 perfect the hard disk is in there now 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:02.220
 missing the infamous vine place it 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.920
 turn it with your fingers 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:08.100
 first once the wind glass a 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.110
 po with your fingers, here it is or go 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.580
 splits 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:14.010
 the would-be smashed split me up 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.270
 paul then system a mess 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:19.370
 I've seen videos where the dispute is 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.370
 he broke the boys here with two fingers 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:27.889
 perfect 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:32.050
 now the hard disk is mounted so 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:32.050
 cover we can call it we put it back 

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:39.580
 ok ours to our hard disk it is 

00:06:36.499 --> 00:06:41.150
 mounted guys we finished this 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.529
 video 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.360
 I hope you enjoyed clicking it like it 

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:46.460
 if you liked it if you don't like links 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:50.110
 I don't like commenting and sign up 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.110
 we are not the next beautiful one
