00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:19.650
 this time we have from babyartikel de 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:23.539
 such a baby food rather warmer and 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.180
 though by luxor since it is new 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.869
 It has become very interesting 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:33.300
 the food perlich technologies 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.130
 lighting technology warms me, we are 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.930
 very interested and very curious how 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:43.110
 that will work the look joyride 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.660
 fruit thermo sorry baby food with light 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.820
 warm a very new technology 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.510
 as far as I can see on the carton 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:56.250
 read do it warms evenly and 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.609
 gently hygienic without water for 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.300
 different container sizes and and and and 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:05.820
 So everything I Peile you the 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.130
 Let's try it out soon 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.530
 see it in warm dinner 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.220
 and then we'll see what's the name 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.960
 and how long does it take me? 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.140
 think with light it would actually 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:23.189
 go longer like peer steam but that 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.700
 Let's try it today. Let's have a look 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.470
 I built it and here is mine 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.890
 I'll eat it then I'll buy it 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.439
 ok so it looks like if i do 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.380
 simply put on top is sinking 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.729
 not complete terminal 1 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.380
 but of course that is very important 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.229
 before we get started is the 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.810
 what to read in the manual 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.689
 package was there were these sang here 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.329
 or this tongs around the glass 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.380
 to take out and probably will 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.299
 flow very hot okidoki 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.070
 operating instructions were read then 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.360
 I set it up quickly 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.030
 I'm going to put it on the right now 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.700

 I'll warm it up again now 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.480
 namely, that I am the wrong one 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:17.049
