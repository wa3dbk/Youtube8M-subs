00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.220 

all<00:00:01.650> right<00:00:01.829> so<00:00:02.070> I<00:00:02.460> sanded<00:00:03.300> down<00:00:03.360> the<00:00:03.630> the<00:00:04.020> long

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
all right so I sanded down the the long

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.680 
all right so I sanded down the the long
glass<00:00:04.470> and<00:00:04.970> now<00:00:05.970> I'm<00:00:06.090> starting<00:00:06.390> with<00:00:06.450> short

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
glass and now I'm starting with short

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.220 
glass and now I'm starting with short
glass<00:00:07.610> this<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:08.999> step<00:00:09.299> and<00:00:09.629> process<00:00:09.929> of

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
glass this is the step and process of

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.259 
glass this is the step and process of
steps<00:00:10.440> you<00:00:10.530> gotta<00:00:10.650> take<00:00:10.919> to<00:00:11.789> do<00:00:11.879> these<00:00:12.030> doors

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
steps you gotta take to do these doors

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.770 
steps you gotta take to do these doors
properly<00:00:13.969> starting<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.030> police<00:00:15.209> first<00:00:15.480> for

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
properly starting the police first for

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.169 
properly starting the police first for
your<00:00:15.869> actual<00:00:16.439> shape<00:00:16.679> even<00:00:17.609> move<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.820> your<00:00:18.029> long

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:18.179 
your actual shape even move to your long

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:20.150 
your actual shape even move to your long
glass<00:00:18.420> for<00:00:18.779> your<00:00:18.929> for<00:00:19.679> the<00:00:19.740> majority<00:00:19.980> of

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
glass for your for the majority of

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.249 
glass for your for the majority of
rigidity<00:00:20.460> short<00:00:21.449> glass<00:00:21.599> helps<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.990> little<00:00:22.080> bit

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:22.259 
rigidity short glass helps a little bit

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.300 
rigidity short glass helps a little bit
more<00:00:22.380> strength<00:00:22.679> and<00:00:24.199> a<00:00:25.199> lot<00:00:25.589> smoother<00:00:26.099> look<00:00:26.279> a

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
more strength and a lot smoother look a

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.279 
more strength and a lot smoother look a
lot<00:00:26.490> easier<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.849> work<00:00:27.150> with<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.869> then<00:00:28.199> you

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
lot easier to work with and then you

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.919 
lot easier to work with and then you
move<00:00:28.679> on<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.830> fuller<00:00:29.099> through<00:00:29.369> final<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:30.599> this

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
move on to fuller through final so this

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.960 
move on to fuller through final so this
is<00:00:31.079> the<00:00:31.199> short<00:00:31.410> glass<00:00:31.619> going<00:00:31.829> on<00:00:32.009> yeah<00:00:32.670> it's

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
is the short glass going on yeah it's

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.720 
is the short glass going on yeah it's
still<00:00:33.210> very<00:00:33.420> rough<00:00:33.690> but<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.520> first

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
still very rough but this is the first

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.950 
still very rough but this is the first
layer<00:00:35.940> going<00:00:36.180> on<00:00:36.390> I'll<00:00:36.570> probably<00:00:36.750> end<00:00:36.900> up

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
layer going on I'll probably end up

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.130 
layer going on I'll probably end up
throwing<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.500> know<00:00:38.040> three<00:00:38.310> three<00:00:38.430> layers<00:00:38.640> on

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
throwing I know three three layers on

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
throwing I know three three layers on
but<00:00:40.140> uh<00:00:40.170> that's<00:00:41.010> where<00:00:41.160> I'm<00:00:41.250> at<00:00:41.310> now

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
but uh that's where I'm at now

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.570 
but uh that's where I'm at now
alright<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.310> here's<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.640> first<00:00:44.940> coat<00:00:45.720> of

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
alright so here's the first coat of

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.790 
alright so here's the first coat of
Short<00:00:47.580> Strand<00:00:47.790> sanded<00:00:48.150> down<00:00:48.180> now<00:00:48.960> when<00:00:49.680> you're

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
Short Strand sanded down now when you're

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.610 
Short Strand sanded down now when you're
doing<00:00:49.890> glass<00:00:50.220> you<00:00:50.970> want<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.240> do<00:00:51.390> nice<00:00:52.260> light

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
doing glass you want to do nice light

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.810 
doing glass you want to do nice light
layers<00:00:52.860> at<00:00:53.280> least<00:00:53.430> when<00:00:53.580> you're<00:00:53.700> using

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
layers at least when you're using

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.430 
layers at least when you're using
stranded<00:00:55.460> resin<00:00:56.540> and<00:00:57.540> the<00:00:58.020> reason<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.320> want

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
stranded resin and the reason you want

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.690 
stranded resin and the reason you want
to<00:00:58.470> use<00:00:58.620> light<00:00:58.800> layers<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.190> because<00:00:59.340> if<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.580> go

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
to use light layers is because if you go

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.860 
to use light layers is because if you go
to<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.880> heavy<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.240> can<00:01:00.390> end<00:01:00.510> up<00:01:00.540> with<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> lot<00:01:00.840> of

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
to a heavy you can end up with a lot of

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.810 
to a heavy you can end up with a lot of
air<00:01:01.050> pockets<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.620> air<00:01:02.070> pockets<00:01:02.340> are<00:01:02.700> your

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
air pockets and air pockets are your

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.820 
air pockets and air pockets are your
worst<00:01:02.970> enemy<00:01:03.270> when<00:01:03.390> you're<00:01:03.930> glass<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.379> it

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
worst enemy when you're glass and it

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.280 
worst enemy when you're glass and it
just<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.790> completely<00:01:06.180> destroys<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:07.020> rigidity

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
just it completely destroys the rigidity

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.250 
just it completely destroys the rigidity
and<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:08.160> strength<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.640> glass<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.260> you

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
and the strength of the glass so you

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.080 
and the strength of the glass so you
want<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.440> do<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.560> lot<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.890> light<00:01:11.250> layers<00:01:11.460> sand

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
want to do a lot of light layers sand

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.450 
want to do a lot of light layers sand
layer<00:01:12.570> sand<00:01:12.990> layer<00:01:13.230> sand<00:01:13.590> like<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.280> this

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
layer sand layer sand like that so this

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.680 
layer sand layer sand like that so this
is<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.610> first<00:01:14.850> layer<00:01:15.060> that's<00:01:15.300> sanded<00:01:15.659> down

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
is the first layer that's sanded down

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.850 
is the first layer that's sanded down
and<00:01:16.530> ready<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.710> put<00:01:16.860> on<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.040> second<00:01:17.310> layer<00:01:18.860> all

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
and ready to put on the second layer all

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.840 
and ready to put on the second layer all
right<00:01:19.980> guys<00:01:20.159> here's<00:01:20.370> the<00:01:20.400> second<00:01:20.730> layer

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
right guys here's the second layer

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.780 
right guys here's the second layer
Shorthair<00:01:22.010> as<00:01:23.010> you<00:01:23.130> can<00:01:23.250> see<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.520> starts<00:01:23.760> to

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
Shorthair as you can see it starts to

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.720 
Shorthair as you can see it starts to
smooth<00:01:24.060> out<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> little<00:01:24.420> bit<00:01:24.570> more<00:01:24.690> but<00:01:25.730> you're

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
smooth out a little bit more but you're

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.730 
smooth out a little bit more but you're
not<00:01:26.850> going<00:01:27.090> for<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.270> glass<00:01:27.480> like<00:01:27.780> smoothest<00:01:28.590> on

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
not going for a glass like smoothest on

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.430 
not going for a glass like smoothest on
this<00:01:28.940> you're<00:01:29.940> just<00:01:29.970> going<00:01:30.120> more<00:01:30.420> for<00:01:30.479> no<00:01:31.229> air

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
this you're just going more for no air

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.260 
this you're just going more for no air
bubbles<00:01:31.800> and<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.340> get<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.030> completely

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
bubbles and you get it completely

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.320 
bubbles and you get it completely
covered<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:35.520> filler<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:35.909> what<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.180> actually

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
covered the filler is what you actually

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.980 
covered the filler is what you actually
get<00:01:36.600> your<00:01:36.780> nice<00:01:37.770> smooth<00:01:38.100> machine<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.990> but

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
get your nice smooth machine to it but

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.450 
get your nice smooth machine to it but
you<00:01:40.050> still<00:01:40.229> wanna<00:01:40.350> make<00:01:40.440> it<00:01:40.530> nice<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.680> smooth

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
you still wanna make it nice and smooth

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.670 
you still wanna make it nice and smooth
as<00:01:41.550> possible<00:01:42.080> as<00:01:43.080> you<00:01:43.140> can<00:01:43.200> see<00:01:43.380> it's<00:01:43.530> the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
as possible as you can see it's the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.860 
as possible as you can see it's the
shape<00:01:43.860> starting<00:01:44.190> to<00:01:44.250> really<00:01:44.340> come<00:01:44.549> out

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
shape starting to really come out

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.660 
shape starting to really come out
probably<00:01:45.870> do<00:01:46.049> one<00:01:46.229> more<00:01:46.350> layer<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.770> I'll

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
probably do one more layer this I'll

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.100 
probably do one more layer this I'll
sand<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:47.970> down<00:01:48.030> do<00:01:48.360> one<00:01:48.479> more<00:01:48.630> layer<00:01:48.780> and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
sand this down do one more layer and

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.240 
sand this down do one more layer and
then<00:01:49.770> let<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.400> cure<00:01:50.580> overnight

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250

you add thickness when I got 20 before

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.430 
you add thickness when I got 20 before
any<00:01:59.790> time<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.300> actually<00:02:00.450> change

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
you do a fit test just to make sure so I

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:19.240 
you do a fit test just to make sure so I
just<00:02:06.570> want<00:02:06.690> to<00:02:06.750> make<00:02:06.840> sure<00:02:06.870> to<00:02:07.020> have<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.170> close

all<00:02:20.250> right<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.550> I'm<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.760> final<00:02:21.060> layer<00:02:21.180> Schwartz

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
all right so I'm a final layer Schwartz

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.830 
all right so I'm a final layer Schwartz
trained<00:02:21.750> in<00:02:21.840> his<00:02:21.960> own<00:02:23.120> gs-11<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:24.480> started<00:02:24.780> the

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
couple hours a day to work on but let

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.310 
couple hours a day to work on but let
that<00:02:32.190> cure<00:02:32.400> overnight<00:02:33.080> stand<00:02:34.080> it<00:02:34.200> down
