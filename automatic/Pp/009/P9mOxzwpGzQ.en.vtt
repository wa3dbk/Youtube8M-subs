00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.049
 Hello everyone today, a little about the door 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.349
 locks and closing doors on many 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.360
 have questions please tell me 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.400
 the door does not close well 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.820
 one of the doors for example on the car 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.600
 or even all that do tell me how 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.920
 adjust 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.560
 I'll tell you guys not necessarily right away 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.769
 you regulate 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:32.149
 you just have to make sure that 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.460
 You castles though ever lubricated 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:38.040
 even if you have them here for example 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.649
 states like mine you see there that 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.940
 there is old grease anyway 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:49.920
 it is recommended to remove and lubricate 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:53.579
 in a new way, see for example how 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.550
 better for better closing seems to be and 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.710
 now is good but everyone knows for himself 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.260
 with what effort is his door for example 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.899
 closed better and after some time 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.100
 began to close shut worse in 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.420
 this mainly happens after winter and 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.390
 winter frost 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.140
 there for example more than minus 10 that is 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:21.080
 less than below -10 degrees with us 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.259
 the lubricant is basically all kind of 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.100
 freezes 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:29.490
 and loses its properties locks and doors 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.829
 many of us noticed closing 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.250
 worse 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:38.009
 before and after winter from spring came 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:41.460
 I always try to change this whole thing 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.090
 lubrication and lubricate in a new way so i already 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.229
 spoke 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.090
 remove old grease 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.759
 a rag screwdriver 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.689
 climb it all remove by 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.149
 opportunities 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:59.280
 it is clear that without fanaticism there is no need to wash 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:04.200
 burn gas with a blowtorch 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:07.380
 of course, and make sure that the bolts 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.230
 fastening vaz lock 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:15.660
 many have a twisted state 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:18.850
 one or even several screws missing 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:24.430
 a couple of screws so make sure you have 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:28.840
 and twist their satiety he and we have the same 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:32.590
 the very thing is grease clean this whole thing 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:36.190
 you can lift and make sure that too 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.920
 our fastening screws are tight and that 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.650
 We are not the mate of the castle walks 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:45.310
 by the way after removing the old grease 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.830
 you should have a question that we 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.460
 need to precisely lubricate as we 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:54.700
 starting to see those parts working parts 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.580
 the so-called lock who work and 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.540
 which need to be lubricated here they are in such 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:07.120
 here is a brilliant condition that's all of us 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:11.200
 see here everything is beautifully visible 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:15.280
 so clean the castle you're exposing 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:18.370
 to make our life lubrication it means for 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.110
 about lubrication at one time I tried 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.489
 lubricate in-40 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:26.260
 since it 's still easier this process 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.770
 I will immediately say vd-40 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.480
 long not keep locks able on 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.890
 Zhiguli can on and on vintage 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.610
 locks maybe she will continue 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.209
 hold on 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:39.550
 but precisely on Zhiguli castles for a long time 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.320
 can not hold can try 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.570
 who have silicone grease 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.270
 try grease but it seems to me too 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:50.230
 that she is not so effective on 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:53.200
 classical castles I smear on this 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:57.340
 lithologic usual time I had 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.950
 I once tried with a mask of the crb, the crb, yes 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:04.390
 Of course, rb locks longer 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:07.630
 but once a year is not hard to lubricate lithologic 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.680
 lithola is enough so take here 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:16.030
 such here 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:16.030
 seldom have some and we lubricate the light 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:25.650
 All these parts about which I already to you 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:30.360
 showed said excess lubrication can 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.920
 then wipe remove rag this 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.850
 here's the latch itself 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:41.390
 you can push down like this 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:44.690
 motion and lubricate the first click 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.690
 second click 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:55.640
 we put grease back 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.640
 return by opening the handle here 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:08.350
 our latch returned to its original position 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:13.150
 position scroll our video too 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:16.870
 grease his poor part as I already 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.840
 spoke we can see too where we glitters 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.210
 where are we 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:25.919
 the lock contacts the mating part 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.919
 so these places also lubricate 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:36.740
 superfluous but in general it is not necessary lubricants 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:40.210
 when closing doors on some there 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:43.180
 places will scatter nothing terrible and 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:47.270
 lubricate the top 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:52.220
 a little bit the retainer will see this 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:56.540
 spring can be his little too 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:06:02.270
 help well, in general, that is, and 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:06.410
 special grease for locks good 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:09.740
 For example, liquidate moth there are different 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:12.410
 enter in google search and many you 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.420
 will produce a selection with this now 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:19.460
 no problems 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:24.110
 it is already choosing you such a lubricant 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:29.440
 enjoy a little bit this thing after 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:37.010
 development lubricants with each instillation 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:40.550
 We feel that we have a better and better in the 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:42.740
 camera of course the efforts are transmitting to 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.230
 door hand i'm not turning you on 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:48.590
 today all subscribe to my channel 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:52.420
 until next time good luck on the roads 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.420
 good luck with repairs all bye
