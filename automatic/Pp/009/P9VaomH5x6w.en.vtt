00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.230
 hello friends tankers with you evolution 

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:10.719
 games 91 and today I will tell you about 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.070
 British there are 4 levels with charming 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.369
 female name matilda 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.740
 and so from the distinguishing features of it 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.210
 or more precisely and gives off great forty 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.699
 millimeter rechargeable gun 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.499
 about 1 point eight tenths of a second 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.529
 breaking one hundred twenty one millimeter with 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:28.300
 Alpha 55 as points also Matilda 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.839
 boasts thick enough 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.160
 booking both in the forehead and along the sides 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:35.290
 the weakest link of the tank is his 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.690
 terribly slow dynamics with mass in 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.480
 27 tons we have an engine all in 190 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.610
 horsepower more than the maximum 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.500
 the speed of the tank is 24 kilometers in 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:51.100
 an hour which means that even with crusts 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:53.470
 we will go very, very slowly and so 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.270
 map hidden village i'm in top before 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.430
 what to choose sent to this machine 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.040
 should take into account the fact that he left far from 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.070
 I won't have time to go back, for example 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.809
 for capturing capture also choosing for example 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.720
 right flank and they will be able if necessary 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.939
 help allies on the left flank ie 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.189
 you are very dependent on your team of 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.049
 my choice of direction so i 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:17.729
 almost always choose the maximum 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.729
 central direction on the rink 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.760
 honestly i don't know what is matilda 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.530
 average tank dynamics are not at all to 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.570
 you knew about how this 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.030
 sad dynamics I will give an example 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.370
 beloved heavy tank fifth level 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.440
 KV-1 so compared to Matilda 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.960
 kv-1 just jumps across the field like 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.650
 young wiles leaving our mother 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.650
 far behind 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.820
 walks a and big but still single 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.830
 minus our beauty but thanks 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.050
 to your exact problem instrument 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.700
 crazy rate of fire we can 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.710
 easily disassemble all opponents 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.430
 who can catch us in rand 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.050
 without a single gold wav shells also 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.330
 it is worth neglecting the reservation 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.340
 matilda put the tank rhombus we can 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.610
 cram enemy shells even from 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.350
 heavy tanks 5 lesson especially good 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.420
 Matilda turns out to tank because 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.080
 shelters substituting enemies of the board under 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.080
 right angle 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.120
 in general, we have a very good strong 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.770
 tank on level four beautiful 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.930
 a tool that can fight on equal terms 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.560
 even against medium and heavy tanks 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.560
 5th level 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.230
 most importantly understand what you want from 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.300
 This machine is still at the beginning of the battle because 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.730
 that playing it you can't 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.800
 improvise during the battle you must 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.350
 clearly set a goal for battle 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.720
 explore only her without being distracted by 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.350
 all other events in the gods decided stand 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.000
 on the base means worth it to the last 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.190
 decided to push the flank means go 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.020
 push the flank at your own risk 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.020
 good for this you have everything 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.040
 their 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.440
 completely forgot from the modules I will advise 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.190
 put the rammer fan and 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.239
 the third module I put the stereo 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.360
 standard repair consumables 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.670
 fire extinguisher and first aid kit in ammunition I 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:42.730
 I drive only their armor-piercing shells are not 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:44.920
 enough for today 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.300

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.040
 very very slowly

 I'm voicing here and you called me 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.250
 part of the code wait
