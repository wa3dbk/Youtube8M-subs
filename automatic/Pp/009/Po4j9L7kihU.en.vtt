00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
first off let me clarify something we

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.870 
first off let me clarify something we
would<00:02:00.750> recommend<00:02:01.140> training<00:02:01.950> your<00:02:02.250> dog<00:02:02.430> not<00:02:02.820> to

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
pull on the leash and do some leash

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.789 
pull on the leash and do some leash
pressure<00:02:05.790> work<00:02:06.090> rather<00:02:07.049> than<00:02:07.200> they'll<00:02:07.500> keep

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
pressure work rather than they'll keep

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.160 
pressure work rather than they'll keep
allowing<00:02:08.069> your<00:02:08.399> dog<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.789> pull<00:02:09.020> we<00:02:10.020> have<00:02:10.140> a

originally designed for somebody who had

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.220 
originally designed for somebody who had
arthritis<00:02:30.459> very<00:02:31.209> bad<00:02:31.450> arthritis<00:02:31.630> in<00:02:32.110> the

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
arthritis very bad arthritis in the

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.110 
arthritis very bad arthritis in the
wrist<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.680> when<00:02:33.400> their<00:02:33.550> dog<00:02:33.730> would<00:02:33.940> pull<00:02:34.090> on

the<00:02:34.300> leash

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
the leash

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.960 
the leash
obviously<00:02:35.350> there's<00:02:35.739> this<00:02:35.890> jerking<00:02:36.730> or<00:02:36.880> the

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
obviously there's this jerking or the

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.970 
obviously there's this jerking or the
impact<00:02:37.390> that<00:02:37.660> gets<00:02:37.900> put<00:02:38.140> on<00:02:38.319> to<00:02:38.500> your<00:02:38.530> joints

here<00:02:39.220> well<00:02:40.470> with<00:02:41.470> this<00:02:41.620> elastic<00:02:41.980> tab<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:42.700> I'll

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
here well with this elastic tab and I'll

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.430 
here well with this elastic tab and I'll
shorten<00:02:43.180> this<00:02:43.239> up<00:02:43.450> so<00:02:43.600> you<00:02:43.690> can<00:02:43.810> see<00:02:44.050> it<00:02:44.200> or<00:02:44.380> I

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
shorten this up so you can see it or I

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.600 
shorten this up so you can see it or I
can<00:02:44.590> demonstrate<00:02:44.770> it<00:02:45.160> a<00:02:45.190> little<00:02:45.340> bit<00:02:45.489> better

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
can demonstrate it a little bit better

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.440 
can demonstrate it a little bit better
you<00:02:46.410> can<00:02:47.410> see<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.769> impact<00:02:48.070> there<00:02:48.400> versus<00:02:49.330> on

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
you can see the impact there versus on

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.080 
you can see the impact there versus on
the<00:02:49.570> end<00:02:49.750> that<00:02:50.230> little<00:02:51.190> bit<00:02:51.340> of<00:02:51.370> a<00:02:51.489> stretch<00:02:51.790> and

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
the end that little bit of a stretch and

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.580 
the end that little bit of a stretch and
as<00:02:52.239> I<00:02:52.360> said<00:02:52.420> it<00:02:52.630> only<00:02:52.750> stretches<00:02:53.230> about<00:02:53.440> that

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
as I said it only stretches about that

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.220 
as I said it only stretches about that
far<00:02:53.970> absorbs<00:02:54.970> all<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.269> impact<00:02:55.780> from<00:02:55.930> your<00:02:56.019> dog

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230

pull on the end of the leash these

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.630 
pull on the end of the leash these
leashes<00:03:08.410> also<00:03:08.860> have<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:09.810> reflective<00:03:11.640> strip

sewn<00:03:12.940> into<00:03:13.150> them<00:03:13.390> two<00:03:13.569> of<00:03:13.660> them<00:03:13.780> actually<00:03:13.930> so

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
sewn into them two of them actually so

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.910 
sewn into them two of them actually so
at<00:03:15.130> night<00:03:15.459> time<00:03:15.730> these<00:03:16.209> two<00:03:16.660> white<00:03:17.470> strips

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
at night time these two white strips

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.340 
at night time these two white strips
here<00:03:18.220> are<00:03:18.370> a<00:03:18.400> 3m<00:03:18.940> tape<00:03:19.299> that's<00:03:19.959> sewn<00:03:20.320> right

here are a 3m tape that's sewn right

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.350 
here are a 3m tape that's sewn right
into<00:03:20.829> the<00:03:20.920> leash<00:03:21.100> so<00:03:21.130> the<00:03:21.489> leash<00:03:21.700> itself<00:03:22.120> will

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
into the leash so the leash itself will

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.569 
into the leash so the leash itself will
be<00:03:22.480> reflective<00:03:23.049> there<00:03:23.709> you<00:03:23.829> have<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.250> that's

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
be reflective there you have it that's

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.270 
be reflective there you have it that's
the<00:03:25.000> heard<00:03:25.360> of<00:03:25.510> hands-free<00:03:25.900> leash<00:03:26.290> this<00:03:27.100> is

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
the heard of hands-free leash this is

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.430 
the heard of hands-free leash this is
actually<00:03:27.640> becoming<00:03:27.970> pretty<00:03:28.720> much<00:03:28.900> my<00:03:29.079> go-to
