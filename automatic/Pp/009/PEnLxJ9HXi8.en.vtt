the<00:02:04.079> actual<00:02:04.380> metal<00:02:04.560> chain<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.219> pretty<00:02:05.610> long

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
the actual metal chain is pretty long

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.080 
the actual metal chain is pretty long
pre<00:02:06.180> decent

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
pre decent

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.190 
pre decent

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
other two were colored silver but this

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.340 
other two were colored silver but this
one's<00:02:14.370> gold<00:02:14.640> for<00:02:14.850> some<00:02:15.000> reason<00:02:15.480> now<00:02:16.080> as<00:02:16.260> you

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
one's gold for some reason now as you

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.800 
one's gold for some reason now as you
can<00:02:16.470> see<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.770> says<00:02:17.180> 20<00:02:18.180> Sonic<00:02:18.420> 20th

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
Pritz screen protector on it so you

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.170 
Pritz screen protector on it so you
don't<00:02:46.530> actually<00:02:46.709> accidentally<00:02:47.459> scratch<00:02:47.850> when

don't actually accidentally scratch when

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.820 
don't actually accidentally scratch when
when<00:02:48.570> it's<00:02:48.690> am<00:02:48.870> obviously<00:02:49.110> getting<00:02:49.590> into<00:02:49.739> the

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
when it's am obviously getting into the

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.740 
when it's am obviously getting into the
hands<00:02:50.040> of<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.160> customer<00:02:50.310> but<00:02:51.209> underneath<00:02:51.480> it

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
hands of the customer but underneath it

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.960 
hands of the customer but underneath it
you<00:02:51.870> can<00:02:52.019> see<00:02:52.230> it's<00:02:52.410> all<00:02:52.590> golden<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:53.519> you<00:02:53.790> can

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
you can see it's all golden and you can

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.509 
you can see it's all golden and you can
probably<00:02:54.480> make<00:02:54.810> out<00:02:55.380> Sonic's<00:02:55.920> eyes<00:02:56.130> they're

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
probably make out Sonic's eyes they're

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.400 
probably make out Sonic's eyes they're
not<00:02:57.390> sure<00:02:57.540> how<00:02:57.660> well<00:02:57.780> I'll<00:02:57.930> show<00:02:58.110> up<00:02:58.140> on<00:02:58.320> the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
not sure how well I'll show up on the

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.430 
not sure how well I'll show up on the
camera<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.640> actual<00:03:00.090> inside<00:03:00.870> case<00:03:01.200> is

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
camera and the actual inside case is

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.370 
camera and the actual inside case is
like<00:03:01.590> this<00:03:02.030> I'll<00:03:03.030> show<00:03:03.239> it's<00:03:03.360> like<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.540> web<00:03:03.840> sort

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
like this I'll show it's like a web sort

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.920 
like this I'll show it's like a web sort
of<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:05.250> feels<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:06.060> feels<00:03:06.090> raised<00:03:06.569> it<00:03:06.810> feels

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
of it feels it feels raised it feels

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.960 
of it feels it feels raised it feels
quite<00:03:07.110> nice<00:03:08.720> okay<00:03:09.720> so<00:03:09.780> that's<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.970> alright

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
quite nice okay so that's that alright

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.460 
quite nice okay so that's that alright
then<00:03:12.209> let's<00:03:12.570> take<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:12.780> look<00:03:12.900> at<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.110> other<00:03:13.230> two

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
then let's take a look at the other two

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.009 
then let's take a look at the other two
now<00:03:14.459> this<00:03:14.579> is<00:03:14.760> strange<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.420> this<00:03:15.720> one<00:03:15.900> is

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
now this is strange and this one is

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.310 
now this is strange and this one is
clearly<00:03:16.380> quite<00:03:16.920> golden<00:03:17.549> color<00:03:18.110> whether<00:03:19.110> this

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
clearly quite golden color whether this

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.120 
clearly quite golden color whether this
one<00:03:19.680> is<00:03:20.180> silver<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:21.630> design<00:03:22.410> I'm<00:03:22.769> not<00:03:22.950> sure

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
one is silver and design I'm not sure

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.240 
one is silver and design I'm not sure
why<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.700> length<00:03:24.180> of<00:03:24.390> these<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.920> length<00:03:26.100> of

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
why the length of these the length of

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.340 
why the length of these the length of
the<00:03:26.310> chain<00:03:26.579> is<00:03:26.820> universal<00:03:27.510> it's<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.780> same<00:03:28.079> and

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
the chain is universal it's the same and

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.039 
the chain is universal it's the same and
the<00:03:29.160> actual<00:03:29.640> decoration<00:03:30.239> on<00:03:30.360> the<00:03:30.450> outside<00:03:30.870> of

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
the actual decoration on the outside of

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.410 
the actual decoration on the outside of
the<00:03:31.140> watches<00:03:31.650> is<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.400> same<00:03:32.640> as<00:03:32.820> well<00:03:33.030> but<00:03:33.269> it's

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
the watches is the same as well but it's

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.470 
the watches is the same as well but it's
still<00:03:33.750> amazing<00:03:34.230> quality<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.790> if<00:03:35.910> I'm<00:03:36.060> lucky

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
still amazing quality and if I'm lucky

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.380 
still amazing quality and if I'm lucky
yep<00:03:37.410> but<00:03:37.620> this<00:03:37.739> one<00:03:37.890> flips<00:03:38.130> open<00:03:38.489> here<00:03:39.299> the

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
yep but this one flips open here the

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.729 
yep but this one flips open here the
caps<00:03:39.600> on<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.840> other<00:03:39.989> ones<00:03:40.140> a<00:03:40.200> bit<00:03:40.350> stiff<00:03:40.709> but

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
caps on the other ones a bit stiff but

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.259 
caps on the other ones a bit stiff but
I'm<00:03:40.980> guessing<00:03:41.130> a<00:03:41.310> bit<00:03:41.430> of<00:03:41.519> oil<00:03:41.670> will<00:03:41.850> sort<00:03:42.120> that

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
I'm guessing a bit of oil will sort that

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.990 
I'm guessing a bit of oil will sort that
out<00:03:42.799> probably<00:03:43.799> see<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.070> design<00:03:44.370> on<00:03:44.549> this<00:03:44.700> one

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
out probably see the design on this one

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.050 
out probably see the design on this one
it's<00:03:45.769> Sonic<00:03:46.769> in<00:03:46.890> opposed<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.640> it<00:03:47.730> just<00:03:47.910> say

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
it's Sonic in opposed and it just say

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.699 
it's Sonic in opposed and it just say
Sonic<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.450> Hedgehog<00:03:48.900> on<00:03:49.049> the<00:03:49.140> side<00:03:49.380> and

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
Sonic the Hedgehog on the side and

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.830 
Sonic the Hedgehog on the side and
you've<00:03:50.519> probably<00:03:50.700> probably<00:03:51.209> noticed<00:03:51.660> on<00:03:51.750> the

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
you've probably probably noticed on the

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.780 
you've probably probably noticed on the
other<00:03:51.959> one<00:03:52.109> as<00:03:52.230> well<00:03:52.440> but<00:03:52.769> they<00:03:53.310> do<00:03:53.370> come<00:03:53.760> with

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
other one as well but they do come with
