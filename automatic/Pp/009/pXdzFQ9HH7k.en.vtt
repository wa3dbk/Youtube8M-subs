title nowadays and another reason why I

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.350 
title nowadays and another reason why I
wanted<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.680> make<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.070> video<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.579> the<00:02:00.090> fact

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
wanted to make this video is the fact

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.499 
wanted to make this video is the fact
that<00:02:00.649> Fastlane<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.490> new<00:02:02.759> pay-per-view<00:02:03.329> as

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
that Fastlane is a new pay-per-view as

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.929 
that Fastlane is a new pay-per-view as
you<00:02:03.780> guys<00:02:03.930> probably<00:02:03.960> know<00:02:04.590> it's<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.729> first

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
you guys probably know it's the first

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.619 
you guys probably know it's the first
year<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:07.079> pay-per-view<00:02:07.829> will<00:02:08.759> occur

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
year that the pay-per-view will occur

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.029 
year that the pay-per-view will occur
therefore<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.470> thought<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:10.860> would<00:02:11.009> be

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
therefore I thought that would be

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.080 
therefore I thought that would be
interesting<00:02:11.390> two<00:02:12.390> covers

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
interesting two covers

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.420 
interesting two covers
some<00:02:13.209> of<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.390> matches<00:02:13.810> going<00:02:14.080> down<00:02:14.440> for<00:02:15.370> the

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
some of the matches going down for the

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.339 
some of the matches going down for the
first<00:02:15.640> time<00:02:15.879> in<00:02:16.060> this<00:02:16.150> pay-per-view<00:02:16.390> later<00:02:17.170> on

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
first time in this pay-per-view later on

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.320 
first time in this pay-per-view later on
I<00:02:17.590> could<00:02:17.650> look<00:02:17.890> back<00:02:18.069> and<00:02:18.220> say<00:02:18.370> wow<00:02:18.580> I<00:02:18.849> talked

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
I could look back and say wow I talked

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.690 
I could look back and say wow I talked
about<00:02:19.510> and<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:20.170> make<00:02:20.349> videos<00:02:20.379> about<00:02:20.769> the

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
about and I make videos about the

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.970

first-ever<00:02:22.300> Fastlane<00:02:23.230> pay-per-view<00:02:23.800> and

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
first-ever Fastlane pay-per-view and

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.170 
first-ever Fastlane pay-per-view and

hopefully it's the pay-per-view that
does<00:02:25.930> well<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:26.560> continues<00:02:27.129> to<00:02:27.340> grow<00:02:27.489> and

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230 
somebody maybe there are other people

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.190 
somebody maybe there are other people
waiting<00:05:30.150> that<00:05:31.150> we<00:05:31.270> just<00:05:31.450> don't<00:05:31.600> know<00:05:31.750> yet<00:05:31.840> we

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
waiting that we just don't know yet we

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.810 
waiting that we just don't know yet we
can't<00:05:32.440> see<00:05:32.650> we<00:05:32.770> can't<00:05:32.980> tell<00:05:33.130> the<00:05:33.250> future

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
can't see we can't tell the future

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.670 
can't see we can't tell the future
this<00:05:34.150> is<00:05:34.330> a<00:05:34.360> hard<00:05:34.690> prediction<00:05:35.230> for<00:05:35.380> me<00:05:35.500> because

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
this is a hard prediction for me because

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.350 
this is a hard prediction for me because
I<00:05:35.830> don't<00:05:35.950> know<00:05:36.160> both<00:05:36.370> ways<00:05:36.700> there<00:05:37.120> could<00:05:37.330> be

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
I don't know both ways there could be

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.230 
I don't know both ways there could be
some<00:05:38.290> great<00:05:38.530> outcomes<00:05:39.280> and<00:05:39.610> some<00:05:39.880> great

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
some great outcomes and some great

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.480 
some great outcomes and some great
storylines

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
storylines

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.280 
storylines
to<00:05:42.490> go<00:05:42.610> from<00:05:42.850> here<00:05:43.090> because<00:05:43.630> if<00:05:43.780> Cena<00:05:44.020> wins

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
to go from here because if Cena wins

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.530 
to go from here because if Cena wins
maybe<00:05:44.560> we<00:05:44.770> have<00:05:44.950> closure<00:05:45.340> with<00:05:46.120> this<00:05:46.300> feud

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 
maybe we have closure with this feud

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.140 
maybe we have closure with this feud
because<00:05:46.720> honestly<00:05:47.140> I<00:05:47.170> think<00:05:47.260> the<00:05:47.530> Cena<00:05:48.150> Russa

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
because honestly I think the Cena Russa

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.990 
because honestly I think the Cena Russa
feud<00:05:49.480> is<00:05:49.810> a<00:05:50.200> bit<00:05:50.560> dead<00:05:51.220> I<00:05:51.520> think<00:05:51.880> they're

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
feud is a bit dead I think they're

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.150 
feud is a bit dead I think they're
