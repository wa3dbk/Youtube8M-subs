welcome<00:00:05.029> to<00:00:05.090> the<00:00:05.120> lab<00:00:05.359> today<00:00:06.109> we<00:00:06.529> are<00:00:06.649> going<00:00:06.830> to

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:06.950 
welcome to the lab today we are going to

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.520 
welcome to the lab today we are going to
walk<00:00:07.100> through<00:00:07.660> these<00:00:08.660> current<00:00:09.139> set<00:00:09.320> that<00:00:09.470> were

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:09.530 
walk through these current set that were

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.669 
walk through these current set that were
working<00:00:09.680> on<00:00:09.920> we<00:00:10.610> had<00:00:10.700> a<00:00:10.730> megasquirt<00:00:11.210> 3<00:00:11.719> then<00:00:12.379> we

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:12.679 
working on we had a megasquirt 3 then we

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.919 
working on we had a megasquirt 3 then we
purchased<00:00:13.309> from<00:00:13.490> do<00:00:13.700> yourself<00:00:14.089> on<00:00:14.269> tune<00:00:14.540> we

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:14.929 
purchased from do yourself on tune we

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.350 
purchased from do yourself on tune we
got<00:00:15.080> the<00:00:15.200> unassembled<00:00:15.559> version<00:00:16.070> we<00:00:17.000> built<00:00:17.210> it

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:17.360 
got the unassembled version we built it

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.720 
got the unassembled version we built it
from<00:00:17.420> scratch<00:00:17.510> and<00:00:18.140> it's<00:00:18.920> currently<00:00:19.070> wired<00:00:19.490> up

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
from scratch and it's currently wired up

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.680 
from scratch and it's currently wired up
to<00:00:19.760> a<00:00:20.030> 5.3<00:00:21.610> LSX<00:00:22.610> series<00:00:22.940> motor<00:00:23.180> it's<00:00:23.450> an<00:00:23.540> L

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:23.690 
to a 5.3 LSX series motor it's an L

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.650 
to a 5.3 LSX series motor it's an L
instead<00:00:24.050> of<00:00:24.170> Aryan<00:00:24.820> we<00:00:25.820> use<00:00:25.940> an<00:00:26.030> all-stock<00:00:26.450> and

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
instead of Aryan we use an all-stock and

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.190 
instead of Aryan we use an all-stock and
sensors<00:00:27.110> and<00:00:27.860> then<00:00:28.820> we<00:00:29.300> are<00:00:29.540> here<00:00:29.990> we<00:00:30.080> have

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.200 
sensors and then we are here we have

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.690 
sensors and then we are here we have
hooked<00:00:30.380> up<00:00:30.470> to<00:00:30.620> a<00:00:30.650> laptop<00:00:30.890> running<00:00:31.430> to<00:00:31.610> your

android<00:01:02.719> 2.3<00:01:03.350> for<00:01:03.800> rio<00:01:03.920> and<00:01:04.360> I've<00:01:05.360> built<00:01:05.570> a

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
android 2.3 for rio and I've built a

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.520 
android 2.3 for rio and I've built a
custom<00:01:06.430> app<00:01:07.430> that<00:01:08.360> talks<00:01:08.869> to<00:01:09.170> the<00:01:09.290> Arduino

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
custom app that talks to the Arduino

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.580 
custom app that talks to the Arduino
over<00:01:10.159> Bluetooth<00:01:10.610> and<00:01:11.360> this<00:01:11.509> enables<00:01:12.079> us<00:01:12.409> to

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
over Bluetooth and this enables us to

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.459 
over Bluetooth and this enables us to
fire<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:13.670> motor<00:01:13.820> and<00:01:14.210> control<00:01:15.049> up<00:01:15.229> to<00:01:15.259> eight

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:15.469 
fire the motor and control up to eight

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:18.490 
fire the motor and control up to eight
relays<00:01:16.060> wirelessly<00:01:17.060> from<00:01:17.329> the<00:01:18.020> same<00:01:18.200> Android

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
relays wirelessly from the same Android

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.340 
relays wirelessly from the same Android
device<00:01:18.740> so<00:01:19.399> I'm<00:01:19.460> going<00:01:19.579> to<00:01:19.610> go<00:01:19.759> ahead<00:01:20.229> turn<00:01:21.229> the

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
device so I'm going to go ahead turn the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.649 
device so I'm going to go ahead turn the
motor<00:01:21.500> on<00:01:21.649> I'll<00:01:22.460> leave<00:01:22.610> icons<00:01:22.969> do<00:01:23.240> it<00:01:23.390> and<00:01:23.539> then

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
motor on I'll leave icons do it and then

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.029 
motor on I'll leave icons do it and then
turn<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.020> starter<00:01:24.289> over<00:01:24.560> and<00:01:24.680> hopefully

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
turn the starter over and hopefully

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:27.730 
turn the starter over and hopefully
we'll<00:01:25.219> get<00:01:25.310> to<00:01:25.369> fire<00:01:25.610> it<00:01:25.729> up<00:01:25.820> here<00:01:26.229> here<00:01:27.229> is<00:01:27.500> the

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
we'll get to fire it up here here is the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.100 
we'll get to fire it up here here is the
custom<00:01:28.189> Android<00:01:29.180> app<00:01:29.329> that<00:01:29.539> i<00:01:29.630> wrote<00:01:29.810> to

custom Android app that i wrote to

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.920 
custom Android app that i wrote to
control<00:01:30.680> the<00:01:30.860> arduino<00:01:31.369> and<00:01:31.640> then<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:32.539> arduino

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
control the arduino and then the arduino

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.450 
control the arduino and then the arduino
will<00:01:33.109> subsequently<00:01:33.560> control<00:01:34.130> there<00:01:34.340> were

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
will subsequently control there were

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.609 
will subsequently control there were
those<00:01:34.609> relays<00:01:35.000> and<00:01:35.270> this<00:01:36.170> will<00:01:36.320> allow<00:01:36.439> us<00:01:36.469> to

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619
