that<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:52.060> player<00:03:52.299> could<00:03:52.540> inhabit<00:03:52.900> a

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:53.169 
that the player could inhabit a

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:55.440 
that the player could inhabit a
character<00:03:53.799> that<00:03:53.829> had<00:03:54.280> a<00:03:54.310> personality<00:03:55.000> that

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
character that had a personality that

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.539 
character that had a personality that
was<00:03:55.660> somebody<00:03:56.380> that<00:03:56.440> you<00:03:56.650> wanted<00:03:57.040> to<00:03:57.099> be<00:03:57.340> that

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
was somebody that you wanted to be that

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.089 
was somebody that you wanted to be that
you<00:03:57.669> aspired<00:03:58.150> to<00:03:58.299> be<00:03:58.900> in<00:03:59.049> the<00:03:59.139> game<00:03:59.319> so<00:03:59.980> we

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
you aspired to be in the game so we

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:01.559 
you aspired to be in the game so we
really<00:04:00.370> wanted<00:04:00.549> to<00:04:00.639> advance<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.419> technology

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
really wanted to advance the technology

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.930 
really wanted to advance the technology
of<00:04:02.489> storytelling<00:04:03.489> and<00:04:03.579> character

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
of storytelling and character

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.460 
of storytelling and character
development<00:04:03.970> through<00:04:04.959> character

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
development through character

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.259 
development through character
performances<00:04:06.160> so<00:04:06.280> we<00:04:06.400> have<00:04:06.519> true<00:04:06.819> character

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
performances so we have true character

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.229 
performances so we have true character
performances<00:04:07.870> in<00:04:07.959> our<00:04:08.079> game<00:04:08.400> using<00:04:09.400> full-on

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
performances in our game using full-on

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.390 
performances in our game using full-on
image<00:04:10.959> capture<00:04:11.410> and<00:04:11.650> motion<00:04:12.069> capture

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
image capture and motion capture

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.069 
image capture and motion capture
technologies<00:04:13.090> that<00:04:13.329> were<00:04:13.450> pioneered<00:04:13.930> at

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
technologies that were pioneered at

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.409 
technologies that were pioneered at
Industrial<00:04:14.590> Light<00:04:14.620> magic<00:04:15.280> so<00:04:15.519> we<00:04:15.849> really<00:04:16.150> had

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
Industrial Light magic so we really had

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:17.620 
Industrial Light magic so we really had
to<00:04:16.450> cast<00:04:16.720> an<00:04:16.870> actor<00:04:17.289> the

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
to cast an actor the

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.350 
to cast an actor the
could<00:04:17.780> act<00:04:18.170> not<00:04:18.739> just<00:04:19.070> using<00:04:19.370> their<00:04:19.610> voice<00:04:19.640> but

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:20.360 
could act not just using their voice but

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.570 
could act not just using their voice but
also<00:04:20.510> with<00:04:20.810> their<00:04:20.959> face<00:04:21.200> we're<00:04:22.130> in<00:04:22.220> this<00:04:22.310> room

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
also with their face we're in this room

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.270 
also with their face we're in this room
were<00:04:22.760> surrounded<00:04:23.360> by<00:04:23.480> these<00:04:23.740> cameras<00:04:24.740> at

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
were surrounded by these cameras at

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.740 
were surrounded by these cameras at
first<00:04:25.610> and<00:04:25.790> I<00:04:25.820> was<00:04:25.940> really<00:04:26.180> scared<00:04:26.480> that<00:04:26.630> they

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
first and I was really scared that they

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
first and I was really scared that they
were<00:04:26.810> just<00:04:26.870> going<00:04:27.050> to<00:04:27.110> sit<00:04:27.320> you<00:04:27.350> down<00:04:27.560> in<00:04:27.710> a

spheres on the face in different

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.700 
spheres on the face in different
positions<00:04:37.370> and<00:04:37.910> those<00:04:38.510> cameras<00:04:38.960> know<00:04:39.140> exactly

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
positions and those cameras know exactly

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:40.810 
positions and those cameras know exactly
where<00:04:39.860> every<00:04:40.130> one<00:04:40.250> of<00:04:40.370> those<00:04:40.430> little<00:04:40.580> dots

where every one of those little dots

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.180 
where every one of those little dots
lives<00:04:41.210> in<00:04:41.510> that<00:04:41.750> 3d<00:04:42.080> space<00:04:42.350> and<00:04:42.650> when<00:04:42.800> they

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
lives in that 3d space and when they

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.280 
lives in that 3d space and when they
turn<00:04:43.490> or<00:04:43.730> they<00:04:43.820> changed<00:04:44.150> position<00:04:44.630> the<00:04:45.110> camera

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
turn or they changed position the camera

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.170 
turn or they changed position the camera
tracks<00:04:45.770> that<00:04:45.980> information<00:04:46.580> and<00:04:46.730> that<00:04:46.790> way<00:04:47.030> we

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
tracks that information and that way we

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.060 
tracks that information and that way we
know<00:04:47.210> exactly<00:04:47.540> how<00:04:48.230> our<00:04:48.350> character<00:04:48.680> is<00:04:48.710> moving

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
know exactly how our character is moving

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.330 
know exactly how our character is moving
and<00:04:49.220> we<00:04:49.280> have<00:04:49.400> all<00:04:49.610> that<00:04:49.790> data<00:04:50.030> with<00:04:50.450> that<00:04:50.600> okay

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
and we have all that data with that okay

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.280 
and we have all that data with that okay
hmm<00:04:52.340> it's<00:04:52.640> like<00:04:52.790> acting<00:04:53.300> from<00:04:53.510> the<00:04:53.690> from<00:04:54.260> the

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
hmm it's like acting from the from the

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.140 
hmm it's like acting from the from the
shoulders<00:04:54.800> up<00:04:55.010> and<00:04:55.370> you're<00:04:55.730> trying<00:04:55.880> to<00:04:56.000> give

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
shoulders up and you're trying to give

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.760 
shoulders up and you're trying to give
all<00:04:56.330> of<00:04:56.360> this<00:04:56.600> drama<00:04:56.780> to<00:04:57.230> it<00:04:57.260> and<00:04:57.500> you're<00:04:57.620> and

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
all of this drama to it and you're and

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.140 
all of this drama to it and you're and
you're<00:04:57.800> basically<00:04:58.190> shooting<00:04:58.700> it<00:04:58.820> just<00:04:59.030> like

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
you're basically shooting it just like

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.450 
you're basically shooting it just like
you<00:04:59.300> would<00:04:59.330> have<00:04:59.570> filmed<00:05:00.010> one<00:05:01.010> of<00:05:01.130> the<00:05:01.220> many

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
you would have filmed one of the many

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.970 
you would have filmed one of the many
things<00:05:01.550> that<00:05:01.790> really<00:05:02.090> sets<00:05:02.570> us<00:05:02.720> apart<00:05:02.900> is<00:05:03.350> a

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
things that really sets us apart is a

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.850 
things that really sets us apart is a
collaboration<00:05:04.460> with<00:05:04.610> ILM<00:05:05.120> I<00:05:05.420> 11<00:05:06.410> has<00:05:06.500> a<00:05:06.560> suite

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
collaboration with ILM I 11 has a suite

anyone else we're leveraging that
expertise<00:05:16.490> we're<00:05:16.850> actually<00:05:16.970> using<00:05:17.180> those

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
expertise we're actually using those

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.960 
expertise we're actually using those
tools<00:05:17.930> we're<00:05:18.320> using<00:05:18.530> that<00:05:18.740> facility<00:05:19.370> to

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
tools we're using that facility to

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.360 
tools we're using that facility to
generate<00:05:20.630> all<00:05:20.870> this<00:05:21.140> data<00:05:21.350> and<00:05:21.650> when<00:05:22.070> we<00:05:22.160> have

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
generate all this data and when we have

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.280 
generate all this data and when we have
that<00:05:22.640> the<00:05:23.030> quality<00:05:23.240> bar<00:05:23.600> goes<00:05:23.990> through<00:05:24.200> the

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
that the quality bar goes through the

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.390 
that the quality bar goes through the
roof<00:05:24.410> there<00:05:24.710> are<00:05:24.770> things<00:05:24.950> that<00:05:25.040> we've<00:05:25.220> never

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
roof there are things that we've never

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.370 
roof there are things that we've never
really<00:05:25.610> seen<00:05:25.730> before<00:05:26.210> in<00:05:26.330> a<00:05:26.390> game<00:05:26.600> from<00:05:27.020> kind

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
really seen before in a game from kind

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.990 
really seen before in a game from kind
of<00:05:27.440> a<00:05:27.560> character<00:05:28.100> performance<00:05:28.670> standpoint

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
of a character performance standpoint

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.400 
of a character performance standpoint
and<00:05:29.510> I<00:05:29.570> think<00:05:29.780> that's<00:05:29.900> just<00:05:29.960> gonna<00:05:30.170> draw
