 great was the joy with fans of 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.520
 famous scifi movie rather than saw and 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.230
 gearbox the works aliens colonial 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.120
 marines announced 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.919
 the game is valid thanks to the license 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.869
 on the entire movie as official 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:21.089
 Continuation to James Cameron's cult 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.679
 production succeeds in this 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.599
 promising shooter us in the 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.140
 adds to the sweaty atmosphere 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.489
 tear 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:34.410
 or is that as comfortable as that 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:35.940
 tender hug of a window something 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.350
 went to the uss to marco 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.450
 and who is for the disappearance of 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.010
 entire crew responsible one 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.050
 military rescue team wants 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.760
 find answers to these questions and 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.320
 send your own troop on board 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.970
 after looking at the remains of one 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.980
 Android meets in your shoes 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:58.410
 of corporate winter quickly realized that 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:01:00.120
 any help too late it comes now to 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.800
 first time is the length of the devastated 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.660
 marching and the beeping of the ship 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.750
 motion pictures getting higher and higher stops 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:11.280
 one of the breath and just after that 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.050
 sight of the infected spaces and that 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.340
 first you build up the tension 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.800
 the entire fan of the game already 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.630
 verpulver because what the player after 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.460
 expected a promising start 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.140
 is a poor shooter whose only one 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.880
 quality the optical similarity to 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.770
 elend's film is technically 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.900
 colonial marines an average 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.760
 User control is liquid 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.530
 get a hand of weapons with those 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.570
 one intergalactic about the target funds 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.460
 It should not be difficult to rot 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.710
 the theoretically so threatening elin 'them 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.510
 not very smart even in bigger ones 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.830
 groups are therefore of little more 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.840
 as easy is cannon fodder 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.520
 in the movie are speed and 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.619
 the greatest strengths of 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.270
 own the deadly aliens in the game 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.979
 viecher none of these characteristics 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.080
 they obviously have big problems 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.940
 to navigate on ceilings and walls 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.680
 but they are usually on the ground too 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.450
 overwhelmed and offer themselves for 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.549
 me as an attack surface for the soaps 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.780
 sometimes experienced the assault rifle 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.130
 then how things are in the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.350
 Hide darkness around in the right way 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.240
 moment to attack if you then 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.860
 They just stay shelling 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.410
 apparently they have to vegetate anyway 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.390
 have no chance to seem completely 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.530
 they have to be mad at you 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.640
 reason to do so 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.290
 the same applies to the human 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.030
 pages that put you in the way and 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.100
 just as harmless are in theirs 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.020
 intervened they have no tactics on 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.550
 usually they flow from one collected 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.900
 frame refer position behind one 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.990
 Cover from the player as well 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.010
 crappy 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.840
 but even in this simple one 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.990
 Behavior often happens to them rough 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.990
 carver 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.340
 in their search for cover they run 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.230
 not just players over or 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.290
 positions themselves in the glass walls and 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.290
 windows 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.450
 but also your own comrades suffer 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.410
 under the same weak ki 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.100
 That's why they do not have water polo players 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.710
 a lot 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.210
 The marines hope to be a hard one 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.930
 almost always they refuse first 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.930
 to go to doors 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.190
 sometimes seemed haphazard about the game 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.840
 around and are from a room ins 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.030
 next one wins if you take him too fast 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.620
 is the half - baked career on the 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.060
 play everything you really need to know 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.060
 should be action and tension 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.180
 The story can not change that 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.740
 the player with a heap 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.210
 boring soldier without 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.820
 facial expression sends to the war 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.410
 the short cutscenes do not work 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.880
 bit on the characters a 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.250
 therefore none of them disappear 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.820
 another obligatory death by just 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.820
 Interested 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.550
 takkt official licenses access to 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.830
 props succeeded the developers 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.660
 in many places from the movie 11 into the game too 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.640
 transferred both on the lay so was 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.630
 The content will be fans at home 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.190
 feel computer vehicles was from 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:04.030
 stationary gunner for a live game 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:05.980
 a sense of authenticity numerous 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.600
 features and errors diverge quickly 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.070
 Colonial marines have clipping errors 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.630
 they say that through the 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.630
 own comrades can march through 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.290
 did not show the friendly float 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.390
 soldiers clearly above the ground often 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.950
 a lot of shade and mostly 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.180
 spongy textures become stronger 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.070
 Delay loaded 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.780
 You also meet something here and 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:32.500
 fire effects of past consoles 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:34.300
 generation in some moments you have 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.340
 A little change in the ballerei 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.940
 Here you sit in a power or or 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.830
 for that the smartphone also own one 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.470
 Unarmed escape from the nest says 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.030
 momentarily for mood in this level 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.320
 you have to blink at misery 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.520
 however, they creep up 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.230
 noises react 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.940
 In the end, one flees from one 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.680
 Oversized monster and must be hectic 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.480
 behind them the doors weld the 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.730
 breaks it again and again 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.170
 And there are many elements of that 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.880
 play have fun 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.680
 the use of the motion jpeg that is 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.930
 obsolete there is still so warned if 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.550
 approaching opponents when both normal 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.510
 as well as an enemy constantly on the 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.890
 to increase players 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.070
 one wonders why one does not have any 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:15.590
 Comrades have it are extraordinary 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.840
 circumstances a common game track 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.580
 campaign offers aliens colonial marines 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.530
 also some multiplayer modes this 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.040
 definitely leave a better one 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.660
 impression 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.970
 Of course you have the classic here 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.010
 play type with child matches in which one the 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.690
 choice between everyone and marin has the 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.640
 to offer games of escape and survivor 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.780
 a high degree of nervousness and fear 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.650
 that you are also in the main game 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.930
 would wish 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.640
 the miserable because of the stop his 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.470
 get used to taxes and their 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.350
 weak melee attacks only a little 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.060
 opportunities associated king collected the 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.770
 Hear her against the well-armed 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.870
 soldiers mostly the shorter one 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.370
 this circumstance like that still sent 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.660
 balanced as you after the end of the round 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.660
 therefore change must 

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:59.449
 aliens colonial marines on almost everyone 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:01.159
 a forgettable worthy 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:02.899
 story and a laughably bad one 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:03.529
 no left truly bad 

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:05.689
 aftertaste 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:07.459
 the game looks and sounds like 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:10.009
 the film template hours fuller 

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:11.539
 wasted potential windows movies 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:13.639
 become small things like the imprint 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:15.409
 by Lance Henriksen to find joy 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:18.519
 But these elements are just dripping 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:18.519
 a very hot stone
