 construction of a satin center next to taken lucero 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:11.249
 armed structure 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:15.679
 to build and durlock ceilings you will have to build a structure of profiles 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.910
 of steel plate without face on which the fitur loc plates will be fixed 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:25.699
 the structure of the ceiling is made using profiles type hearth of 35 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.699
 millimeters and 34 mm montÃ¡nchez 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.190
 once the height of the future ceiling has been defined and marked, taking care to maintain the 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.870
 same level on the walls will be marked the desired height transporting 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.420
 this measure with level around the perimeter and drawing a line 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.970
 continues with piles and sailed using a laser level 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.710
 the fixings will be made every 60 centimeters backlight and screws 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.360
 Number 8 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.250
 the first solitude will be fixed on the wall of the greater side of the environment 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.250
 repeating this operation on the opposite wall 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.300
 two 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.060
 once the leveling of the bonfires has been verified 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.009
 It will be placed on them transversely to how the 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:13.840
 voters 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.450
 a stile profile leveled with a thread and with a maximum separation of one 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.450
 meter twenty 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.040
 these profiles will be the master lines of the structure and should 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.340
 be suspended from the ceiling by means of rigid candles that are profiles 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.460
 posts placed at least one meter 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.890
 the upright profiles will be cut according to the dimensions of the ceiling 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.280
 calculating approximately one centimeter less than the separation 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.280
 between the soleras that is placed on the walls 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.490
 Within the borders the uprights will be placed every 40 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.210
 centimeters fixing ourselves to these with one-tip type steel screws

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:32.560
 Once the structure is finished, the plates will be placed so that 

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:35.290
 using type t2 steel screws 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.000
 placing them with a separation of 25 to 30 centimeters in the center of the 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.879
 plate and 15 centimeters at the edges that coincide with the axis of a profile 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.879
 at a separation of 10 millimeters from them 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:52.909
 the plates are placed transversely to the frame of uprights 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:57.949
 locking each other in such a way that there are no continuous joints along 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:58.719
 all the ceiling
