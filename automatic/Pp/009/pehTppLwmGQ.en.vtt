Hello! In this video I'll show you how to make a
'printing effect' on polymer clay. 
It is a very particular effect and very simple to implement.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:32.520

I hope you enjoy the video! Enjoy your vision!

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:59.800
Take two different color of polymer clay: 
a darker and a lighter one. 
Stretch the darker color in a layer 2 mm, instead
stretch the lighter color into a sheet of 1 mm.
To do that, I used a machine, but you can use a ruler.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:17.840
Combine the two sheets, as shown in the video. 
Use again the machine or ruler, 
to eliminate the bubbles present.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:03:19.240
To create the 'printing effect', use a stamp with text.
Color it with a wet brown.
So impress it on the polymer clay and let it dry.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:58.680
With a square cutter like this, make one square of dough.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:15.480
Before baking, add a headpin.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:31.800
Apply 1\2 layers of fimo liquid. 
Bake again.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:05:04.800
Decorate it according to your tastes: 
for example, apply dried flowers, as shown in the video.
I made a glass effect: I'll make a tutorial for that.
Thanks for watching! I hope you liked this work. 
Stay tuned for the next tutorial. Bye bye
