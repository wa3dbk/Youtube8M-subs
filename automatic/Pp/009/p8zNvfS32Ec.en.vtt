so you can see that we're running at

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.089 
so you can see that we're running at
full<00:02:06.100> speed<00:02:06.460> there<00:02:07.470> but<00:02:08.470> if<00:02:08.590> we<00:02:08.649> go<00:02:08.769> back<00:02:08.950> up<00:02:09.069> to

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
full speed there but if we go back up to

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:23.070 
full speed there but if we go back up to
window<00:02:09.489> and<00:02:09.729> show<00:02:10.209> AV<00:02:11.400> move<00:02:12.400> this<00:02:12.640> down

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.110 

so<00:02:25.380> you'll<00:02:26.380> see<00:02:26.650> there<00:02:26.950> that<00:02:27.610> what<00:02:27.760> we've<00:02:27.910> got

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
so you'll see there that what we've got

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.590 
so you'll see there that what we've got
is<00:02:28.330> that<00:02:28.360> we're<00:02:28.660> keeping<00:02:28.810> there<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:30.730> that

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
is that we're keeping there the that

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.120 
is that we're keeping there the that
pitch<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.110> same<00:02:32.350> but<00:02:32.560> we've<00:02:32.650> just<00:02:32.680> slowed<00:02:33.010> it

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
pitch the same but we've just slowed it

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.040 
pitch the same but we've just slowed it
down<00:02:33.160> so<00:02:34.060> hopefully<00:02:34.540> that's<00:02:34.720> going<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:34.930> help

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
down so hopefully that's going to help

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.510 
down so hopefully that's going to help
you<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.260> practice<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.680> lot<00:02:35.770> some<00:02:36.130> things<00:02:36.370> that

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
you to practice a lot some things that

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.180 
you to practice a lot some things that
you<00:02:36.580> might<00:02:36.700> find<00:02:36.970> online
