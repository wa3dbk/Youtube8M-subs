00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
hey guys this is Eric and today we look

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.250 
hey guys this is Eric and today we look
the<00:00:12.260> leanly<00:00:12.500> PC<00:00:13.100> d600<00:00:14.030> now<00:00:14.540> as<00:00:14.719> you<00:00:14.960> can<00:00:15.110> see

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
the leanly PC d600 now as you can see

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.530 
the leanly PC d600 now as you can see
this<00:00:15.410> is<00:00:15.559> a<00:00:15.590> pretty<00:00:15.889> large<00:00:16.309> double-wide<00:00:17.060> case

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:17.540 
this is a pretty large double-wide case

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.780 
this is a pretty large double-wide case
and<00:00:17.869> it<00:00:18.320> separates<00:00:18.800> the<00:00:18.890> components<00:00:19.460> in<00:00:19.550> two

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:19.790 
and it separates the components in two

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.760 
and it separates the components in two
different<00:00:19.970> sections<00:00:20.360> on<00:00:20.750> this<00:00:21.410> side<00:00:21.619> of<00:00:21.710> the

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
and on this side of this case you would

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.940 
and on this side of this case you would
put<00:00:29.210> the<00:00:29.329> hard<00:00:29.599> drives<00:00:29.899> and<00:00:30.200> all<00:00:30.560> your<00:00:30.739> wires

with filtered on them now this front
bezel<00:01:20.750> can<00:01:21.140> be<00:01:21.320> taken<00:01:21.680> off<00:01:21.800> completely<00:01:22.400> we<00:01:22.670> can

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
bezel can be taken off completely we can

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.790 
bezel can be taken off completely we can
do<00:01:22.940> so<00:01:23.150> by<00:01:23.360> removing<00:01:23.870> one<00:01:23.900> thumb<00:01:24.380> screw<00:01:24.590> at<00:01:24.710> the

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
do so by removing one thumb screw at the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.039 
do so by removing one thumb screw at the
bottom<00:01:25.190> of<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.820> case<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:26.299> I've<00:01:26.510> already<00:01:26.840> done

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
bottom of the case and I've already done

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.620 
bottom of the case and I've already done
that<00:01:27.260> and<00:01:27.590> then<00:01:28.190> taking<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:28.790> front<00:01:29.030> bezel<00:01:29.299> and

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
that and then taking the front bezel and

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.710 
that and then taking the front bezel and
popping<00:01:30.320> it<00:01:30.409> off<00:01:30.530> like<00:01:31.130> so<00:01:31.460> pretty<00:01:32.030> easy<00:01:32.299> to<00:01:32.540> do

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
popping it off like so pretty easy to do

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.860 
popping it off like so pretty easy to do
now<00:01:33.100> as<00:01:34.100> I<00:01:34.250> said<00:01:34.310> before<00:01:34.460> we<00:01:34.940> do<00:01:35.150> have<00:01:35.479> these

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
now as I said before we do have these

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.500 
now as I said before we do have these
fan<00:01:36.830> filters<00:01:37.220> on<00:01:37.340> each<00:01:37.490> of<00:01:37.670> our<00:01:37.729> 140

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
fan filters on each of our 140

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.149 
fan filters on each of our 140
millimeter<00:01:38.900> fans<00:01:39.140> and<00:01:39.380> we<00:01:39.440> can<00:01:39.590> take<00:01:39.830> them<00:01:40.010> off

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
millimeter fans and we can take them off

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.520 
millimeter fans and we can take them off
just<00:01:40.670> by<00:01:40.820> popping<00:01:41.060> it<00:01:41.270> off<00:01:41.360> like<00:01:41.630> so<00:01:41.869> for<00:01:42.380> any

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
just by popping it off like so for any

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.700 
just by popping it off like so for any
maintenance<00:01:42.799> or<00:01:43.100> cleaning<00:01:43.520> and<00:01:44.380> these<00:01:45.380> front

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
maintenance or cleaning and these front

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.350 
maintenance or cleaning and these front
but<00:01:45.950> these<00:01:46.130> front<00:01:46.400> covers<00:01:46.700> can<00:01:46.880> be<00:01:46.970> taken<00:01:47.270> off

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
but these front covers can be taken off

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.620 
but these front covers can be taken off
as<00:01:47.600> well<00:01:48.020> too<00:01:48.440> and<00:01:48.710> they<00:01:48.920> can<00:01:49.369> see<00:01:49.520> our<00:01:49.820> filter

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630
