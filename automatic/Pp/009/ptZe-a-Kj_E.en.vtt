00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:09.900
 the television also because I like the 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.519
 skillet idea and I'll use some salmon 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.440
 the world tool of the fish 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.500
 what I like most has an omega 3 omega 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.660
 6 easy to cook its flavor is very 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.820
 internal we can do it in sweet salty 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.980
 and bittersweet it's worth it and in this 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.390
 chance to more is not going to be crispy I 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.560
 I'm not going to put you on anything else 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.740
 to be and I already have a few 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.720
 holes made we can see there and 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.470
 it's time to put them 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.470
 in the pan 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.920
 let's put 3 nothing else I fall 3 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.359
 with the skin down very well it seems 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.250
 very well here that is perfect we are going to 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:45.960
 collect 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.350
 have taken us a little bit because 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.090
 it was medium strong is the heat and we 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.370
 we're going to bake nothing more than 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:59.450
 cook let's put so much salt 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.370
 and how will I forget you? 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.030
 I like the song the truth the truth 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.960
 the net truth of the planet I like 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.670
 I have not done it for a long time 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.770
 song that I feel good like 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.510
 that I feel like I feel it from the 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.490
 heart background 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.200
 as if it were yesterday we are not going to mix 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.450
 vinegar 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.450
 and garlic very easy 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.820
 they are ready our salmon has already become golden 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.310
 so what are we are crispy 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.110
 down the skin this is going much better 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.710
 taste 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:38.400
 let's see how it goes 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.740
 it's ready and goes to the oven 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.159
 It's art 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.810
 is to use what I can put in the oven 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.369
 It is very important that you check it 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.649
 to freedom my huachinangos are 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.380
 spectacular and good or a little 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.610
 a little here because if they do not go to me 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.259
 say that as I am cooking here 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.259
 good so much olive oil to heat 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:02.090
 I have a mixture of shake with vinegar 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.729
 and we are going to put it on the endives 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.950
 for people who do not know the endives 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:13.170
 are these is an nvidia and its color is 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.750
 because most of the time it occurs in 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.310
 greenhouse does not get much light 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.239
 they allow you to all of them why on 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:25.220
 everything is white has much more this 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.220
 flavonoids that chlorophyll ok 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.640

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.080
 well we have our skillet ready and 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.720

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.230
 salmon that we put enough 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.230
 envy 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.239
 just like lettuce like the 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.939
 spinach its consistency its greatest 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:48.109
 Consistency is water and will let 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:48.109
 Cook in a little while 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.450

 The vinegar 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:16.430
 to the mouth and what I want to do is that 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.280
 are not overcooked the taste of 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.319
 envy is a bit bitter and the 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.870
 true the combination of the vinagrito of 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.880
 the acid of vinegar and garlic comes out 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.310
