00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.910
 which is the rival and how many times have you 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.200
 listened to the mother card no longer 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.350
 works 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.539
 sure more than you should know 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.369
 what causes this problem and how can you 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.550
 fix it in a fast way and 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.650
 The technology is already in Mexico 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.349
 that will allow you to optimize your equipment and 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.560
 its electronic components knows its 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.270
 rubber or technology currently all 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.370
 electronic equipment and its components 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.710
 they work through a motherboard 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.870
 also known as mother bold or 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.580
 motherboard through which 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.100
 execute the main operations 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.800
 so that the devices work well and 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.570
 everyone has one since television be 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.820
 of computer electronics 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.280
 video game consoles to machinery 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.579
 for construction tellers time 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.800
 casino machines and so on 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.219
 the motherboards are manufactured in 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.170
 industrial furnaces 96% are 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.409
 manufactured through a massive process 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.020
 through the system of gea which is the 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.890
 gea system in its acronym in English 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.630
 bold grid array the dga is a system of 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.820
 industrial manufacturing where no 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.920
 workers work welding components 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.409
 to the plates but the components 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.530
 they simply overlap in it and 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.420
 it is baked obtaining a fast paste of 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.880
 thousands and millions of computers in little 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.710
 time each solder ball is a 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.539
 connection that executes a function 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.789
 determined by connecting with the 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.159
 circuit if you get to take off it 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.170
 they lose functions has happened to you 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.840
 wifi stops operating or that bluetooth 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.990
 it warmed up red lights appeared 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.149
 in your xbox 360 playstation3 stopped 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.789
 operate your laptop filled with lights 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.740
 blue or it went out without any sense 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.560
 mobile device is heated so 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.020
 exaggerated in your pocket these and other 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.479
 similar situations are very common and 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.900
 it's because the solder balls of 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.030
 the ones we talked about in the previous paragraph 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.860
 subject to a circuit with the purpose 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.899
 to provide certain functions to your 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.050
 electronic devices are being 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.720
 cracking the experts calculate that 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.330
 about 80% of the teams there 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.819
 in the world will ever present this 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.370
 problem 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.620
 the micro fissures can cause 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.780
 the death of the component and with it the 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.219
 total loss of your equipment however 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.799
 this problem can be solved 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:33.249
 by a specialized technique that 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:35.170
 it is known as we work global your success 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:37.389
 depends on the level of knowledge that the 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.400
 Technical have on the subject and the 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:42.549
 equipment that you use to fix the 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.969
 damage that is the work global river and the 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.409
 term work or re work is the term 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:49.510
 which is used in electronics for 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.760
 name the manual application of 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.359
 repair techniques to recover 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.340
 equipment that is not operational the most 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:03:00.489
 successful and professional of these techniques 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.560
 is the rival call the rba link consists of 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.510
 in extracting and cleaning the components of 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.879
 a mother card and reattach them 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.219
 with welding balls of the most form 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.139
 Perfect possible cleaning and precision 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:14.379
 of this work will determine the result 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:16.540
 of it and its duration as it becomes a 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.189
 good rival for the team to return to 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.590
 operate in an appropriate manner and so 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:21.860
 remain for a long period the 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.710
 correct technique 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.450
 and it should not be done manually like 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.820
 that with the surgical work of a good 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.130
 doctor repairing a computer to 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.990
 through the rba it demands elements 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.600
 Suitable as good welding 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.120
 quality precision tools and 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.680
 high-level welding machinery in 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.900
 this industry to the world leaders 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.570
 they come from united states germany 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.420
 Japan and China - the Chinese laboratory 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.370
 human technology belonging to one of 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.140
 The three most important companies in 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.330
 world in the manufacture of machinery of 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.970
 Rabbani and the most important of his country 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.980
 brings to Mexico professional team of 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.260
 precision for rivals 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.599
 the rba link is a wonderful technique 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.049
 that allows you to recover resources that in 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:07.360
 many cases are considered dead 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.769
 recycling is important nowadays 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.080
 teach people not to bounce and 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.510
 replace equipment but to review them and 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.250
 repair them is a very ecological concept 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.769
 important that we want to transmit in 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.930
 Walt sector points out Alvaro engineer 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.790
 lÃ³pez director of walsh story 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.790
 exclusive representative of human 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.800
 technology mexico invite you to know 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.380
 the technique of revalidation and machinery 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.699
 specialized in precision the technique of 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.479
 revalidation can be applied in different 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:37.370
 industries among which are 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:39.440
 medical equipment repair preparation 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.590
 of laptops servers and pcs of 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.880
 desktop video game consoles 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.280
 cell phones equipment 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.490
 construction casino machineries 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.310
 haitien bank tellers machinery of 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.190
 construction electronic boards 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.350
 cars and a host of other things if this 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.479
 electronics was probably built 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:03.760
 through the system of gea what indicates 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.760
 that at some point they will need to rebut
