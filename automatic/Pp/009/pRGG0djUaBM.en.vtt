00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.270 

hello<00:00:05.640> youtubers<00:00:06.270> so<00:00:06.979> you<00:00:07.979> might<00:00:08.160> have

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
hello youtubers so you might have

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.580 
hello youtubers so you might have
remembered<00:00:08.550> me<00:00:08.910> that<00:00:09.120> I<00:00:09.150> recently<00:00:10.139> just

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
remembered me that I recently just

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.980 
remembered me that I recently just
switched<00:00:10.769> out<00:00:10.950> my<00:00:11.010> power<00:00:11.370> supply<00:00:11.719> because<00:00:12.719> I

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
switched out my power supply because I

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.609 
switched out my power supply because I
bought<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.440> courser<00:00:14.419> GTX<00:00:15.419> 750<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.289> swapped

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
bought the courser GTX 750 and I swapped

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.689 
bought the courser GTX 750 and I swapped
it<00:00:16.830> out<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.910> so<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.570> my<00:00:18.660> old<00:00:18.840> power<00:00:19.080> supply

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
it out of so this is my old power supply

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.130 
it out of so this is my old power supply
and<00:00:20.699> what<00:00:20.880> I'm<00:00:20.970> going<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.330> do<00:00:21.449> today<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.960> I'm

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
and what I'm going to do today is I'm

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.650 
and what I'm going to do today is I'm
going<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.439> open<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:23.670> up<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.029> I'm<00:00:24.150> going<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.359> see

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
going to open it up and I'm going to see

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.700 
going to open it up and I'm going to see
if<00:00:24.750> there's<00:00:24.929> any<00:00:25.369> leaky<00:00:26.369> capacitors<00:00:27.179> and

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
if there's any leaky capacitors and

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.249 
if there's any leaky capacitors and
usually<00:00:28.710> that's<00:00:28.890> what<00:00:29.160> causes<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:30.259> hardware

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259 
usually that's what causes a hardware

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:36.170 
usually that's what causes a hardware
failure<00:00:32.060> leaky<00:00:33.060> capacitors<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:35.030> with<00:00:36.030> the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
failure leaky capacitors and with the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.330 
failure leaky capacitors and with the
courser<00:00:36.600> they<00:00:37.140> guarantee<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.100> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
courser they guarantee that the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.279 
courser they guarantee that the
capacitors<00:00:39.180> they<00:00:39.329> have<00:00:39.480> are<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.960> highest

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:40.289 
capacitors they have are the highest

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:43.790 
capacitors they have are the highest
grade<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.940> Japanese<00:00:41.940> capacitors<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:42.809> anyways

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
grade of Japanese capacitors so anyways

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.560 
grade of Japanese capacitors so anyways
I'm<00:00:43.920> going<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.160> unscrew<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:44.850> I'll<00:00:45.210> open

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
I'm going to unscrew this and I'll open

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.200 
I'm going to unscrew this and I'll open
it<00:00:45.809> up<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.140> see<00:00:47.129> if<00:00:47.219> there's<00:00:47.430> anything<00:00:47.730> off

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
it up and see if there's anything off

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.849 
it up and see if there's anything off
with<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:51.230> so<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.530> just<00:00:52.559> unscrewed<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:54.559> box<00:00:55.559> here

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 
with it so I just unscrewed the box here

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:58.189 
with it so I just unscrewed the box here
so<00:00:56.039> yeah<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:57.239> make<00:00:57.390> sure<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.629> get<00:00:57.809> all<00:00:57.989> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
and see if there's anything off with the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.020 
and see if there's anything off with the
power<00:01:09.570> supply<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:12.590> yeah<00:01:13.590> now<00:01:14.250> if<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.700> want<00:01:14.939> to

the link there so so I just adding up
the<00:01:30.780> pop<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.530> plastic<00:01:32.009> well<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.880> metal<00:01:33.149> part

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
the pop to plastic well the metal part

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.030 
the pop to plastic well the metal part
off<00:01:33.840> here<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.280> it<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.430> pretty<00:01:35.759> dusty<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:37.040> this

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
off here and it is pretty dusty so this

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.679 
off here and it is pretty dusty so this
is<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.340> best<00:01:38.520> way<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.700> clean<00:01:39.000> your<00:01:39.030> bar<00:01:39.420> supply

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
is the best way to clean your bar supply

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.679 
is the best way to clean your bar supply
as<00:01:39.840> well<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.310> so<00:01:41.310> make<00:01:41.640> sure<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.909> always<00:01:42.299> come

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
as well so so make sure you always come

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.249 
as well so so make sure you always come
off<00:01:42.720> check<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.770> fan<00:01:44.070> here<00:01:44.659> here's<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.840> I

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
off check the fan here here's that I

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.580 
off check the fan here here's that I
think<00:01:47.250> it's<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.430> 135<00:01:48.240> millimeter<00:01:48.719> fan<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.619> and

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
think it's a 135 millimeter fan so and

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:58.370 
think it's a 135 millimeter fan so and
that<00:01:53.509> it<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.689> pretty<00:01:55.200> dusty<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:57.110> now<00:01:58.110> I'm<00:01:58.259> going

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
that it is pretty dusty so now I'm going

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.289 
that it is pretty dusty so now I'm going
to<00:01:58.439> take<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.590> look<00:01:58.770> at<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.950> capacitors<00:01:59.549> here<00:01:59.820> so

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
to take a look at the capacitors here so

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.270 
to take a look at the capacitors here so
hopefully<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.049> can<00:02:01.170> take<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.469> look<00:02:01.680> as<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:02.009> as

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
hopefully you can take a look as that as

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:17.210 
hopefully you can take a look as that as
well<00:02:02.719> see<00:02:03.719> if<00:02:03.869> there's<00:02:04.140> anything<00:02:04.560> off<00:02:04.979> with<00:02:05.310> it

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.270 

I<00:02:17.280> don't<00:02:17.970> see<00:02:18.480> anything<00:02:18.840> off<00:02:19.260> with<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.950> right

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
I don't see anything off with it right

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.340 
I don't see anything off with it right
now<00:02:21.080> but<00:02:22.080> I'm<00:02:22.260> going<00:02:22.410> to<00:02:22.500> make<00:02:23.160> sure<00:02:23.190> here<00:02:23.790> you

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:51.790 

might<00:02:28.350> just<00:02:28.530> need<00:02:28.740> a<00:02:28.800> good<00:02:29.010> cleaning<00:02:29.370> so

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.650 

and<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.790> way<00:02:52.910> to<00:02:52.940> find<00:02:53.240> out<00:02:53.390> if<00:02:53.540> your

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
and the way to find out if your

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.230 
and the way to find out if your
capacitors<00:02:54.260> are<00:02:54.470> off<00:02:54.650> is<00:02:55.040> that<00:02:55.490> these<00:02:56.060> things

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
capacitors are off is that these things

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.880 
capacitors are off is that these things
will<00:02:56.450> pop<00:02:56.660> up<00:02:56.690> words<00:02:58.180> so<00:02:59.530> thanks<00:03:00.530> for<00:03:00.620> watching
