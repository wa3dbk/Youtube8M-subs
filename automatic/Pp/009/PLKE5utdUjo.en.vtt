00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:06.509
 and ironically the profane mind if they move I have six hundred preference 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.820
 and sixty-seven years of presence last week 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.119
 portal 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.869
 included in the package gave the boxes 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.590
 others offer me a totally new mug based on the solution of 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:35.730
 puzzle-challenging logic in the reasoning formula is based on the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.980
 free and obscure patella drug 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.210
 pete rouse the idea of 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.410
 the use of different portals 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.140
 for solving puzzles 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.100
 the agenda including him 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.760
 hired its responsible for the development of portugal 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.160
 The game is divided into phases with progressive difficulty, with each 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.739
 one of them offers cachaÃ§a 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:58.790
 and those of logic 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.100
 and sometimes skill 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.750
 the player embodies the young shell who woke up a chamber of laboratories 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.549
 until June without knowing about his past 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.200
 the same that makes the line although minted minuet exists 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.080
 but only the clues found in secret places of the 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:18.830
 moratorium complex 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.980
 information conveyed by the omnipresent fire of idols 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.890
 endowed with an electronic voice 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.210
 incredibly magical as well as a sense of a world that is in Israel. 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.210
 unique and bizarre 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.710
 all challenges require the use of the port channel 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.579
 a portable device 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.170
 for creating force laughs 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.730
 you can create input and output ports on certain flat surfaces 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.210
 be close to the wall the pull 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.509
 a seemingly insurmountable hole for example 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.590
 after being easily passed with the weapon 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.539
 just creating an entry before it 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.929
 and an exit from the other side 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:14.020
 obviously this year heads will go 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.720
 much more of this involving mobile platforms buttons that open passages like 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.459
 those necessary to overcome obstacles 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.040
 magnetic fields 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.140
 and even trucks the portals also preserve the oms with which with 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.609
 yours crosses 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:32.500
 if you create a portal on the ground 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.220
 from above a raised platform for example 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.180
 you will be rewarded at the same speed as your 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.089
 output 

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:44.419
 what is needed in solving many puzzles 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:56.829
 such challenges require considerable skill with the controls to have the ability to 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.739
 think fast 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.519
 to players who feel so hard easily with first-person games 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.379
 notice 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:09.219
 portal is one of the most dizzying experiences of all time 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:14.479
 it is necessary to think almost mathematically to solve the 

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:18.579
 girls of the more advanced stages that lasted half an hour or more 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.989
 depending on your logical thinking 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.279
 despite the complexity the gate is very intuitive 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:29.499
 each puzzle brings a series of indications 

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:33.359
 and cones that helped the player to understand it just a little bit of 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.769
 reasoning and some attempts to make the solution appear 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.000
 and there is nothing more gratifying 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.109
 on the 6th action to reach the end of the phase 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:48.109
 having solved a complex in lima for your own card is not just a 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:52.189
 puzzle game is also a real landmark for games 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:57.430
 electronics in terms of loan will be your futuristic clean look 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.430
 was undoubtedly one inspired by the classic science fiction 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.979
 2001 an odyssey in space 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:07.079
 while the claustrophobic and mystery climate 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.759
 carry a bit of the intriguing with the goal 

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:12.280
 despite the simplicity of the scenarios 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.170
 which are restricted to completely enclosed and generally small areas 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.010
 the staff is awesome 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.879
 thanks to the beautiful textures 

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:24.879
 the surface until the light according to your material 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:31.649
 of the objects with which you interact are very well modeled mainly 

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:35.499
 rounded and have no visible polygons 

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:37.480
 the robot goalkeepers in turn 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.990
 brings humorously intelligent been the backpackers guide of the galaxies 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.050
 enough to be considered one of the best 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.050
 history of miners 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:06.450
 the soundtrack could not be more appropriate 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.330
 to convey the mood of title mystery 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.930
 the player feels every time to the side in milan under disturbing asylum 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.900
 while finding ways to get out of the shelter 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.630
 the songs help to increase the tension 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.800
 the electronic stenchers sinister 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.800
 and distorted sounds in the heaviest moments 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:29.900
 perhaps the only weakness of the portal is its short duration 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.740
 around four or five hours 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:33.550
 Yet 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.289
 taking into consideration that it is a puzzle game 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:39.319
 the duration is of class 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:42.319
 otherwise it could fall into repetition 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:45.879
 to compensate for the apple replay factor 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:50.979
 there are different phases mode against time you have the possibility to enable 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:54.550
 comments from the developers during the game 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.550
 or by the curiosity about its process of creation 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.529
 Cool would be the right word 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:02.409
 to qualify portal 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:05.639
 a title that will make anyone speechless 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:11.030
 complexity of its mechanics and puzzle-solving, the level of challenge is 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.169
 high but just put your head to work everything so that you get to a 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:18.449
 solution which is highly rewarding 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:23.759
 the most claustrophobic and disturbing atmosphere that is 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:25.770
 you feel threatened 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.289
 being that minimum in the game 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:29.530
 it can be short 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.920
 but it is one of the most intensive and intriguing dynamics ever launched whose 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.410
 experience will be remembered for a long time. 

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:45.329
 even so
