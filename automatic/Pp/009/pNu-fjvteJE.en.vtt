00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.500
 hi everyone so today I 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.700
 am going to make a short video about gta 5 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.350
 so this is the first time I'm doing 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.120
 a commented video usually makes 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.860
 videos with music all that but 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.200
 there in fact I just had I just 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.519
 find out something online so they 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.670
 good technical you had to see type of 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.900
 the video for drift and without mode so 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.430
 you'll see it's very simple I 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.380
 discovered it completely by chance and 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.760
 it works great cars it's 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.310
 real soap after doing 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.380
 slip so if you want what you 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.670
 will have to forgive is to get you 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.260
 this car so she's called the 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.780
 picador we have too easily in the 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.130
 desert ba 110 hp pushed back to the 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.440
 coal to provide in soul mode or what 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.670
 and good after I have not tried that 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.520
 other cars if it works the way 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.410
 I was here it is here once 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.850
 you are procured this car you 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.039
 go make the glitch to belittle it 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.140
 then the pitch to belittle it for 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.969
 those who do not know if it's not 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.559
 by putting a competition suspension 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.050
 it's basically you take a weapon 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.489
 I have no more there and you shoot a 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.550
 precise place for 5 goals chase is 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.250
 known you shoot at the center of the rims 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.539
 here and it's going to break the big suspensions 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.720
 it's going to belittle the car 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.979
 really stuck it to the ground and after having 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.990
 does what the car says is going great 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.729
 well slipped you'll see so I was at 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.979
 so always specify those who 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.159
 do not know what glitch it takes 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.420
 remove the tires we call them 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.189
 bullet-proof tires otherwise you 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.450
 to do otherwise it will not work so 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.130
 here's once you're done 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.360
 a place where there is nobody if possible 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.520
 also like that you will not be wanted 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.920
 by the cops you put so launched 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.320
 also on your weapon that the cops you 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.920
 will not do that and then you empty your 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.920
 chargers here 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.590
 so we can see that it's a bit 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.060
 come down in fact we can lower the 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.290
 suspension two notches we had to 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.530
 still shoot until the second 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.940
 big up to the cbc at cbc on the second 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.080
 big so it's good time we go 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.080
 do the same here 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.260
 so here I discovered it by chance 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.120
 you then I was actually I'm having fun 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.010
 belittle cars come discover 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.080
 the glitch if you want I'm having fun 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.310
 belittle little cars of 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.350
 pickups of the four helps all that 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.429
 Well, I called six back like that 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.990
 for fun and I realized 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.210
 that she slips is super good a fair 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.870
 to go down here I am really happy 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.510
 of discovery to do that will serve to 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.650
 you who are watching this video 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.650
 here it is really really fun 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.660
 that's good, there is still a wheel to belittle 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.640
 one side abc 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.640
 but after between officers 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.709
 after that I will also try with two 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.380
 cars if it works if dominator 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.330
 the cars they say well from no 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.920
 see if it works and now I know 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.209
 that with that there is the only car 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.890
 I was with my two cars 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.239
 the other cars that I belittle 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.470
 if he wanted she could not slip 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.760
 because it was pulls 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.790
 society of the four cadres of 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:02.610
 pickups like that so here you are 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:04.450
 see that it costs something slip here 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.129
 it really is 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.129
 the church really great what 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.409
 like it's a bit like we had 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.750
 car code reports in mode 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:16.370
 solo we do for those who already have 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.760
 tried I think you 'll have what 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.760
 I speak 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.849
 on the other hand against auterive tf1 is not 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.019
 believe must train me I'm not 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:26.860
 super strong actually I discovered a 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.810
 so I do not have time to 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.220
 to train and basically in drift or not 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.120
 in the same way according to high speed 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.069
 with this technique 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.569
 charles saw that I'm gently for 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.709
 slide I just have to give a shot of 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.750
 handbrake accelerate thoroughly and that 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.159
 slide alone if you take 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.780
 big bends on the road I tried 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:41.860
 it's not at all the same 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.030
 big shot too low but I try to 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.319
 do the same to take a lot 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.560
 of English to speed up right there I do not arrive 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.319
 more actually I do not know I have no 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.489
 everything at the right pace actually there is 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.690
 ordered a speed to find for 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.340
 get to do the good brics is a 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.530
 little particular to take more than 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.359
 speed 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.609
 so basically that's it I managed by the 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:02.109
 see when you want to stay must either 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.269
 went very fast either very slowly 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.400
 big to summarize at medium speed 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:09.579
 like the sade riveta but not great 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:14.620
 compared to when we are slowly 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:16.479
 when we start there to give them to 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.169
 everything and to talk about them like that it's 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.169
 Super good 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.160
 by cons I can not seem to 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.360
 control I'm not trained yet 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.710
 but hey right now that I have 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.290
 discovered that I'm going to do that that I 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.860
 think like that I 'll be able to make 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.860
 crazy bricks 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.880
 so basically I explain to you to avoid the 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.020
 technique if you are if you ride 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.510
 gently for example who is a little 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.440
 turn really happened in first doing 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.820
 really great said roy 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.520
 a listening will do but you accelerate to 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.060
 background and its bar if not if you 're 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.100
 faster 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.680
 I showed you their victims and 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.950
 I 'm going back to where I'm going to take a 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.510
 little speed when you basically 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.240
 give a big forehand but like that 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.040
 you take a lot of angles and that's it 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.330
 the sadrists a trip and get in a 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.700
 nice turn was not waiting for me to do a 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.840
 trick as well honestly 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.690
 Here bah after he'll just 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.800
 practice dribbling what the 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.450
 Belgian bank village of equity the 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.760
 video i'm going to go try with 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.140
 other cars if it works here bah 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.460
 I hope you have done more 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.950
 especially since it will have served you 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.970
 will now be able to stay online 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.260
 whereas before we could not because 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.930
 if we do not belittle cars in fact 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.550
 the problem is when we skid when 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.350
 one accelerates just after to the power 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.150
 block has more power than 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.860
 big it's impossible to drift and and there 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.910
 I feel that recalling without the 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.240
 car it allows to have the 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.240
 power 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:39.020
 the power but when we drift so 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.250
 that's good I'll go hi hi 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.280
 everyone thanks for watching the 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.280
 video and see you soon for a next 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.280
 edition
