now<00:00:01.140> in<00:00:01.410> this<00:00:01.560> experiment<00:00:01.979> students<00:00:02.909> are

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
now in this experiment students are

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.610 
now in this experiment students are
actually<00:00:03.179> going<00:00:03.540> to<00:00:03.629> measure<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.200> speed<00:00:04.230> of

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
actually going to measure the speed of

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.099 
actually going to measure the speed of
light<00:00:04.890> and<00:00:05.270> this<00:00:06.270> is<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.450> really<00:00:06.990> great

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
light and this is a really great

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.990 
light and this is a really great
experiment<00:00:07.680> for<00:00:07.890> grade<00:00:08.069> six<00:00:08.429> seventh<00:00:08.849> and

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
experiment for grade six seventh and

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.459 
experiment for grade six seventh and
eighth<00:00:09.120> grade<00:00:09.420> because<00:00:09.690> it<00:00:09.960> not<00:00:10.139> only<00:00:10.170> teaches

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
eighth grade because it not only teaches

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.650 
eighth grade because it not only teaches
the<00:00:10.950> students<00:00:11.280> about<00:00:11.550> light<00:00:11.880> speed<00:00:12.210> it<00:00:12.450> also

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
the students about light speed it also

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.110 
the students about light speed it also
teaches<00:00:13.049> them<00:00:13.259> about<00:00:13.440> how<00:00:14.130> light<00:00:14.400> travels<00:00:14.969> as

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
teaches them about how light travels as

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.210 
teaches them about how light travels as
a<00:00:15.150> wave<00:00:15.240> they're<00:00:16.199> going<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.680> learn<00:00:16.859> how<00:00:17.160> to

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
a wave they're going to learn how to

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.189 
a wave they're going to learn how to
measure<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:18.029> speed<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.300> light<00:00:18.570> basically

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
measure the speed of light basically

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.560 
measure the speed of light basically
using<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.650> bar<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:19.980> chocolate<00:00:20.250> are<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:21.180> ready

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
spots on your chocolate bar measure the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.370 
spots on your chocolate bar measure the
distance<00:01:08.880> from<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.450> Centers<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.080> hot

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
distance from the Centers of the hot

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.649 
distance from the Centers of the hot
spots<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:11.070> centimeters<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:11.909> divide<00:01:12.390> your

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
spots in centimeters and divide your

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.719 
spots in centimeters and divide your
number<00:01:12.990> by<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.200> hundred<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.979> get<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.280> distance

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
number by a hundred to get the distance

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.020 
number by a hundred to get the distance
in<00:01:14.939> meters<00:01:15.530> multiply<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.590> number<00:01:16.950> by<00:01:17.130> two<00:01:17.340> to

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
in meters multiply this number by two to

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.330 
in meters multiply this number by two to
get<00:01:18.210> your<00:01:18.360> wavelength<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.710> distance<00:01:20.189> you

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
get your wavelength the distance you

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.249 
get your wavelength the distance you
measure<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.939> only<00:01:21.150> four<00:01:21.570> half<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.020> wavelength

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
measure is only four half the wavelength

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.320 
measure is only four half the wavelength
so<00:01:22.830> that's<00:01:23.009> why<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.280> need<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.640> multiply<00:01:23.850> by

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
so that's why you need to multiply by

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.780 
so that's why you need to multiply by
two<00:01:24.619> for<00:01:25.619> example<00:01:26.040> if<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.250> measured<00:01:26.670> a

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
two for example if you measured a

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.249 
two for example if you measured a
distance<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.330> six<00:01:27.600> point<00:01:27.869> two<00:01:28.020> centimeters

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
distance of six point two centimeters

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.620 
distance of six point two centimeters
your<00:01:28.890> wavelength<00:01:29.430> will<00:01:29.670> be<00:01:29.820> zero<00:01:30.090> point<00:01:30.420> one

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
your wavelength will be zero point one

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.890 
your wavelength will be zero point one
