00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello to you evgeny basic 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.750
 you are on miss a pale channel than he 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.840
 worse than a cold summer when they go constantly 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.599
 always come out wet and sit down 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.000
 the sun does not shine on the bench and all this 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.180
 in summer it can only be worse if you 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.960
 you 'll get sick of what i did guys 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.400
 now the literature has curtailed the throat 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.949
 you probably hear me talking 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.849
 but don't be offended anyway, I decided 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.289
 beat out of the schedule so recorded 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.040
 finally the second part of the eating for 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.110
 teapots 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.460
 namely how to download a movie to your iphone 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.190
 ipod or ipad 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.920
 but we put the apraxin steel actually 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.309
 there were other ideas in my head about the second 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.520
 parts of it for dummies but for all those 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.870
 comments and post kidney I understood 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.629
 what you need to write and the people 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.949
 how to download before launch most often 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.199
 ask me about it well here I am 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.180
 the second part here after some pair 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.080
 seconds we will start with the video itself 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.090
 but hides I wanted to say one thing is two 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.040
 type of people with people who are adequately 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:14.040
 evaluate the situation and understand everything that I 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:22.409
 I will do on this channel and the second part 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:25.320
 people in general this this rubric for this 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.049
 teapots can even say so I created 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.600
 specifically to help people 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.790
 who recently started dating 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.220
 devices 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.079
 particular with the program and go for the most 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.890
 In fact, this is the birth of no one can 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.240
 just like me and many of you 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.909
 got acquainted with this program and nato 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.340
 Someone showed somewhere I saw somewhere 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.140
 Santa drove like this Like this Like this 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.939
 little by little we master any 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.280
 the program is not only a fuss 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.259
 like this it is always laid by man 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.840
 subconscious 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.500
 step by step or achieve something and 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.170
 beat ourselves 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.259
 big heights so here are some people 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.750
 who know like me all the devices from 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.420
 apple all programs interpol all 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.840
 policy and structure and the floor is even better 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.640
 me 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:17.220
 write it together yes it knew this video 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.920
 nothing really useful 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.110

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.400

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.470
 naturally included this video to you 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.870
 I wonder how to download music because 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.520
 you need his skillful iphone 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.500
 You can listen to the player and I do not know what 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.140
 do it because you bought it a day ago 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.700
 iphone and the first time you were holding 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.780
 watched this video now you know 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.540
 like surround music how to do 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.730
 This is how to make it and it’s all flat 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:49.230
 without binding a visa and so on so on 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.970
 so on for this and need my show well 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.370
 okay what's up there just talking 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.080
 I ask you to appreciate everything adequately if 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.819
 you are no longer interested can not look at 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.879
 we have a bunch of other shows 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.300
 so just who looks like put 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:05.700
 who supports me and I think it is 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.320
 really adequate right and who 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.120
 agree with me also like 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.310
 subscribe to the channel 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.830
 and now we let's see the second 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.810
 part of altius for dummies how to download 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:20.750
 movie to your iphone ipod or 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.750
 I advise you to look better in the end go 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.490
 he 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.560
 and so you need to download the movie 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.810
 on your device for example 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.060
 iTunes and iTunes preferably last 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.050
 versions and natural film that you 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.920
 download to your iphone ipod or ipad 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.500
 drag the movie into the folder 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.730
 video devices and everything with you was not 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.730
 sub channel all bye 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.830
 ok only 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.350
 Perhaps we will not start with a search 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.810
 suitable format of your movie personal 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.720
 sorting through a bunch of formats supported 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.940
 apple can say for sure that mp4 is the most 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.640
 there is no quality format well 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.070
 Who am I compared to you ? I am asking you 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.470
 I can not therefore list all possible 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:36.640
 video formats for reading by devices 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:40.570
 apple mp4 and m4v 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.730
 and all these formats and device read without 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.070
 conversions and now if you 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:48.250
 made sure it was easier to listen to me and 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.950
 find the mp4 format rather than m4v then 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.810
 move on and what if I don’t 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.370
 I will find my film broke out on us 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.770
 mp4 primer 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.720
 the answer is simple there are many programs 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.240
 which can change file formats 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.070
 I use the format factor and therefore 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.900
 I can download absolutely any video and 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.940
 then overtake him at the right for me 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.910
 format for this program I will leave 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.160
 link in the description now we have 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.570
 itunes preferably the latest version like me 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.370
 already said device for 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.740
 play your movie well and 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.960
 of course the movie itself is in the right format 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.330
 preferably in mp4 now the most important thing 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.150
 connect our device to computer 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.310
 then buy things on the left choose a playlist 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.010
 their movies and just dragging our 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.080
 enzyme in the window section after loading 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.720
 go back to our device and 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.850
 click the movies tab and mark there 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.860
 tick the item sync movies and 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.860
 choose the ones you need from the playlist 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.050
 In this case, I want to throw myself two 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.540

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.390

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.689
