00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.030
 true that I spend a lot of violence 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.650
 but just because we have a lot of stuff 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.960

 makes a typo 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.210
 but eventually I got that it was 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.890
 not bad and anyway I could not have m 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.640

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.309

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.510
 is called dunamis on this fucking game 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:51.120

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:53.370

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.520
 comrade judged yes it's clear 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:24.470
 yes it's clear it's a little under the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:28.590
 train so to begin 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:32.490
 presentation of this dock lation 12.5 12.5 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.250
 of 5 12 5 2 5 2 5 because I do not want 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.799
 not be in 12.6 with this thing 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.829
 and this thing both of them get up in pm in 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.060
 vain both sets me base at 5pm so 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.540
 that's pretty handy 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.979
 so that's pretty cool so we're going 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.290
 to make the staff of carrot dofus 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.790
 60 beds in the account so now on 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.460
 get silly to the tales games is what is 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.960
 what both of us up to 22 76 we 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.090
 asks players finally I do not want you 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.060
 come out of a little player 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:05.250
 major initiator and seven players 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.290
 major such as a major so chancey 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.690
 and initiatives in all these little ones 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.150
 stuff and the turbulent obviously that's it 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.790
 so let's go back to the headdress stuff of the 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.970
 torre which is just a pretty decent 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.830
 who does not create it myself I have enough 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.660
 correct contemporary art so I had 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.520
 cowardly favorite roger put their accounts 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.080
 currents for the country in less when he 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.530
 must when we are at peace 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.040
 in me 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.620
 the step less it destabilizes a lot 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.940
 more than when I make necklace with 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.680
 my little molds level 100 there 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.940
 it's really there the father in less is 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.650
 really stuffed and the bonus cc it's from 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.290
 10 on both which makes these wines 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.640
 so it's downright huge then to 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.270
 their help sun the g 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.190
 well sent the normal cap 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.140
 I do not know no I think I have not 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.319
 well hope off because it's I 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.959
 just changed the sandals here you go 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:03.880
 you see you must then belt 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.650
 of donors this is the jem ppm and I'm going 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.600
 to sell 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.080
 I think it's the quest I do not sell 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:17.370
 that and that because the prices are going 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.370
 soon tripled I believe they even more 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:30.900
 but we are waiting for snow 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.930
 present in this sense 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.810
 I asked him if can not 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:04:02.430
 complicate then hop or do I 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.900
 was well here is almost everything 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.469
 that I have to say so here after I 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.000
 little useless stuff that my ex that 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:12.569
 it serves me flaccid explosive jaw 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.609
 wood that their name so nutile it's just 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:22.380
 for that because it's cool the 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.639
 line of sight quite bad but good 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.440
 did not do that before that I think I 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:33.630
 could make additions the circle I 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:36.210
 remember me well I do not know anymore and that I 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.539
 am I going to do a little more d and 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:44.409
 So here is the small low point in 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:47.349
 follows with effect here is 308 to blah blah blah 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:49.289
 a pm 308 to but like super fmg not 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:53.919
 many goals to 1 much better 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:56.979
 so we go fast and I give the video a 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:05:09.879
 very likely video fit but 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:12.009
 never never be here so I'm just going 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:19.469
 show you some jets that I find 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:19.469
 pretty correct h and more 

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:30.539
 oh yes yes yes by against this guy 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:38.979
 so I showed you quickly made light 

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:43.499
 that I am at ko globo then bowl 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:43.499
 frankly I like it cgc dg 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:58.150
 I had 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:17.710
 here is a big wave to the soul in the 500 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:23.050
 aulas what I'm not 5 seconds and in 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:25.300
 big here are the 1068 stocks of stuff 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.960
 so frankly that's okay and that has 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:31.990
 written it is very correct 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:33.340
 I in fact this is what is right 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:40.720
 vittek that annoys me that's why I 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:41.920
 go rosstat good go food there was 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.980
 soon l istat 

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.960
 and I go I think rest to multiple 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:50.890
 knowing that I'm already by shaw 101 to 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:53.460
 him I'm just going to stage back up the 

00:06:50.890 --> 00:07:01.400
 vita la vita la vita 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:07:01.400
 make life you're here 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:15.710
 vim 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:17.860
 then down to hockey this is what I 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:20.270
 I think it's already quite correct 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:24.400
 this is a small video enough 

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:27.259
 short presentation of sleeve and r panda 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.120

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:31.970
 tell me what I should do to 

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.110
 this is all I had 

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:35.030
 to tell you hi everyone this was 

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:37.639
