metalworker<00:00:26.340> now<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.490> have<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.730> little<00:00:27.090> bit<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.240> a

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
metalworker now I have a little bit of a

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.330 
metalworker now I have a little bit of a
history<00:00:27.599> with<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:27.930> deck<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.439> took<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.130> little

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
history with this deck I took a little

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.160 
history with this deck I took a little
over<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.609> year<00:00:29.670> off<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.240> my<00:00:30.720> first<00:00:30.990> tournament

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
over a year off and my first tournament

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.260 
over a year off and my first tournament
back<00:00:31.470> was<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.099> invitational<00:00:32.669> in<00:00:32.700> atlanta<00:00:33.090> and

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
back was the invitational in atlanta and

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.910 
back was the invitational in atlanta and
i<00:00:33.360> placed<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.780> top<00:00:33.899> 16<00:00:34.380> using<00:00:34.770> the

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
i placed in the top 16 using the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.340 
i placed in the top 16 using the
metalworker<00:00:35.280> deck<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.540> was<00:00:36.630> very<00:00:36.840> fun<00:00:37.110> and

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
metalworker deck and it was very fun and

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.530 
metalworker deck and it was very fun and
I'm<00:00:37.440> excited<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.829> run<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.129> back<00:00:38.280> here<00:00:38.520> again<00:00:38.610> so

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
I'm excited to run it back here again so

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.709 
I'm excited to run it back here again so
the<00:00:40.280> idea<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.579> deck<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.360> utilize

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
the idea of this deck is to utilize

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.680 
the idea of this deck is to utilize
metalworker<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.800> generate<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.430> bunch<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.450> mana

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
metalworker to generate a bunch of mana

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.240 
metalworker to generate a bunch of mana
and<00:00:46.020> then<00:00:46.170> just<00:00:46.350> put<00:00:46.530> everything<00:00:46.739> into<00:00:46.980> play

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
and then just put everything into play

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.130 
and then just put everything into play
so<00:00:47.969> we<00:00:48.120> have<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.270> couple<00:00:48.510> different<00:00:48.750> moving

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
so we have a couple different moving

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.660 
so we have a couple different moving
pieces<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.680> go<00:00:49.770> alongside<00:00:50.070> with

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
pieces that go alongside with

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.520 
pieces that go alongside with
metalworker

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
metalworker

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.869 
metalworker
called<00:00:52.530> off<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.739> forge<00:00:52.980> master<00:00:53.430> we<00:00:53.610> can<00:00:53.760> get

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
called off the forge master we can get

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.610 
called off the forge master we can get
out<00:00:54.000> very<00:00:54.030> quickly<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.809> then<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.170> allows<00:00:55.379> us

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
out very quickly and then it allows us

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.799 
out very quickly and then it allows us
to<00:00:55.890> just<00:00:56.520> put<00:00:56.670> any<00:00:56.820> artifact<00:00:57.300> from<00:00:57.480> our

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
to just put any artifact from our

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.369 
to just put any artifact from our
library<00:00:58.199> into<00:00:58.469> play<00:00:58.649> then<00:00:59.370> we<00:00:59.489> have<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.609> couple

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
library into play then we have a couple

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.049 
library into play then we have a couple
exciting<00:01:01.379> ones<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.710> we<00:01:01.800> can<00:01:01.980> get<00:01:02.160> be<00:01:02.940> it

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
exciting ones that we can get be it

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.460 
exciting ones that we can get be it
white<00:01:03.300> steel<00:01:03.510> Colossus<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.140> kill<00:01:04.350> our

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
white steel Colossus to kill our

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.649 
white steel Colossus to kill our
opponent<00:01:04.920> if<00:01:05.790> we<00:01:05.880> have<00:01:05.970> lightning<00:01:06.180> greens<00:01:06.479> we

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
opponent if we have lightning greens we

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:07.670 
opponent if we have lightning greens we
can<00:01:06.750> just<00:01:06.900> actually<00:01:07.140> kill<00:01:07.320> them<00:01:07.439> right<00:01:07.470> away

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
can just actually kill them right away

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.980 
can just actually kill them right away
you<00:01:08.040> know<00:01:08.310> Platinum<00:01:09.000> empyrion<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.659> make<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.900> so

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
you know Platinum empyrion to make it so

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.620 
you know Platinum empyrion to make it so
our<00:01:10.080> opponent<00:01:10.439> can't<00:01:10.619> kill<00:01:10.799> us<00:01:11.390> you<00:01:12.390> can<00:01:12.510> also

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
our opponent can't kill us you can also

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.230 
our opponent can't kill us you can also
go<00:01:12.960> get<00:01:13.170> spine<00:01:13.710> abyss<00:01:13.950> sha<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.460> remove<00:01:14.939> a

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
go get spine abyss sha to remove a

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.390 
go get spine abyss sha to remove a
troublesome<00:01:15.630> permanent<00:01:16.200> or<00:01:16.710> if<00:01:17.040> we<00:01:17.189> have<00:01:17.369> a

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
troublesome permanent or if we have a

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.190 
troublesome permanent or if we have a
metalworker<00:01:17.759> employee<00:01:18.330> we<00:01:18.540> can<00:01:18.689> go<00:01:18.810> get<00:01:18.960> staff

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
metalworker employee we can go get staff

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.170 
metalworker employee we can go get staff
of<00:01:19.350> domination<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.640> can<00:01:20.759> basically<00:01:20.939> go

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
have three one coil engines so is you

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.380 
have three one coil engines so is you
know<00:01:32.430> there's<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.880> lot<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.090> sorts<00:01:33.299> to

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
know there's a lot of sorts to

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.240 
know there's a lot of sorts to
plowshares<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.840> legacy<00:01:34.320> but<00:01:34.770> not<00:01:34.890> every<00:01:35.130> deck

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
plowshares and legacy but not every deck

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.069 
plowshares and legacy but not every deck
has<00:01:35.430> them<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.210> lot<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.600> decks<00:01:36.840> just

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
has them and a lot of decks just

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.780 
has them and a lot of decks just
actually<00:01:37.290> can't<00:01:37.710> beat<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.920> six<00:01:38.340> six<00:01:38.520> life

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
actually can't beat a six six life

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.969 
actually can't beat a six six life
linking<00:01:39.119> creature<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.659> there's<00:01:39.930> also<00:01:40.110> the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
best card in the deck yeah to prevent

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.630 
best card in the deck yeah to prevent
sorts<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.439> plowshares<00:01:46.860> from<00:01:47.009> destroying<00:01:47.340> one

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640
