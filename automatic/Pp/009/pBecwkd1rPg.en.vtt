converter a common misconception is

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.470 
converter a common misconception is
installing<00:00:42.890> a<00:00:43.070> converter<00:00:43.489> and<00:00:43.820> you've<00:00:44.450> just

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
installing a converter and you've just

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.450 
installing a converter and you've just
rotated<00:00:45.440> a<00:00:45.500> couple<00:00:45.770> of<00:00:45.860> times<00:00:46.100> to<00:00:46.309> the<00:00:46.430> right

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
rotated a couple of times to the right

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.520 
rotated a couple of times to the right
and<00:00:46.940> you<00:00:47.360> believe<00:00:47.720> you<00:00:47.900> have<00:00:47.930> it<00:00:48.170> installed

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
and you believe you have it installed

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.920 
and you believe you have it installed
all<00:00:48.830> the<00:00:48.890> way<00:00:49.250> so<00:00:50.030> I'm<00:00:50.330> going<00:00:50.449> to<00:00:50.480> go<00:00:50.629> over<00:00:50.660> the

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
all the way so I'm going to go over the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.680 
all the way so I'm going to go over the

first<00:02:30.860> you<00:02:30.980> have<00:02:31.129> the<00:02:31.280> lid<00:02:31.489> in<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.790> hub<00:02:33.910> then

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
first you have the lid in the hub then

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.369 
first you have the lid in the hub then
you<00:02:35.030> have<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:35.629> stator<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:38.020> then<00:02:39.020> you<00:02:39.140> have

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
you have the stator and then you have

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.580 
you have the stator and then you have
the<00:02:39.590> turbine<00:02:40.510> with<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.630> lock-up<00:02:42.020> circuit<00:02:42.440> and

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
the turbine with the lock-up circuit and

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.790 
the turbine with the lock-up circuit and
the<00:02:43.460> clutch<00:02:43.700> mechanism<00:02:44.200> this<00:02:45.200> is<00:02:45.350> a<00:02:45.380> turbine

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
the clutch mechanism this is a turbine

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.420 
the clutch mechanism this is a turbine
and<00:02:45.860> this<00:02:46.190> is

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
and this is

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.520 
and this is
the<00:02:46.549> lock-up<00:02:47.390> clutch<00:02:47.629> in<00:02:47.930> this<00:02:48.140> converter

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
the lock-up clutch in this converter

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.630 
the lock-up clutch in this converter
okay

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
okay

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.069 
okay
and<00:02:49.819> how<00:02:50.180> this<00:02:50.359> works<00:02:50.599> is<00:02:51.489> when<00:02:52.489> you<00:02:52.609> install

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
and how this works is when you install

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.830 
and how this works is when you install
the<00:02:54.079> converter<00:02:54.530> onto<00:02:55.219> the<00:02:55.310> transmission<00:02:55.969> the

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
the converter onto the transmission the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.500 
the converter onto the transmission the
transmission<00:02:57.069> has<00:02:58.069> an<00:02:58.430> input<00:02:58.609> shaft<00:02:59.090> and<00:02:59.390> a

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
transmission has an input shaft and a

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.899 
transmission has an input shaft and a
pump<00:02:59.750> stator<00:03:00.049> as<00:03:00.290> well<00:03:00.980> as<00:03:01.129> pump<00:03:01.370> gears<00:03:01.700> and

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
pump stator as well as pump gears and

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:06.220 
pump stator as well as pump gears and
the<00:03:02.510> way<00:03:02.689> that<00:03:02.930> works<00:03:03.170> is<00:03:03.439> this<00:03:04.189> is<00:03:04.400> a<00:03:05.230> drum

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
the way that works is this is a drum

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.319 
the way that works is this is a drum
with<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:06.829> pump<00:03:07.069> stator<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.760> pump<00:03:08.000> gears

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
with the pump stator and the pump gears

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.990 
with the pump stator and the pump gears
when<00:03:09.319> you<00:03:09.439> stall<00:03:09.709> us<00:03:09.829> into<00:03:10.099> the<00:03:10.189> transmission

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.699 

the<00:03:14.000> input<00:03:14.389> shaft<00:03:14.659> is<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.019> first<00:03:15.290> component

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
the input shaft is the first component

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.250 
the input shaft is the first component
that<00:03:16.519> gets<00:03:16.819> that<00:03:17.120> goes<00:03:17.329> into<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.719> trans<00:03:17.959> goes

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
that gets that goes into the trans goes

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.170 
that gets that goes into the trans goes
into<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:18.620> torque<00:03:18.829> inverter<00:03:19.159> so<00:03:19.760> as<00:03:19.970> you

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
into the torque inverter so as you

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.780 
into the torque inverter so as you
install<00:03:20.569> the<00:03:20.750> converter<00:03:20.930> onto<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.829> input

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.230 
the second clunk is actually this hub
this<00:04:41.630> hub<00:04:41.870> mechanism<00:04:42.500> this<00:04:43.220> is<00:04:43.490> what<00:04:44.030> goes

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
this hub mechanism this is what goes

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.990 
this hub mechanism this is what goes
into<00:04:44.449> the<00:04:45.409> pump<00:04:45.830> gears<00:04:46.130> of<00:04:46.340> the<00:04:46.400> transmission

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
into the pump gears of the transmission

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.589 
into the pump gears of the transmission
this<00:04:47.960> is<00:04:48.020> what<00:04:48.320> the<00:04:48.440> pump<00:04:48.680> gear<00:04:48.860> looks<00:04:49.159> like

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:49.599 
this is what the pump gear looks like

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:53.020 
this is what the pump gear looks like
outside<00:04:50.599> the<00:04:51.020> pump<00:04:51.440> assembly<00:04:51.740> if<00:04:52.159> you<00:04:52.639> notice

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
outside the pump assembly if you notice

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.610 
outside the pump assembly if you notice
there<00:04:53.570> is<00:04:53.780> two<00:04:54.050> tabs<00:04:54.669> two<00:04:55.669> tabs<00:04:56.080> that<00:04:57.080> need<00:04:57.380> to

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
there is two tabs two tabs that need to

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.159 
there is two tabs two tabs that need to
index<00:04:58.130> itself<00:04:58.490> or<00:04:58.760> line<00:04:59.060> up<00:04:59.300> with

index itself or line up with
the<00:05:00.680> two<00:05:00.979> slots<00:05:01.490> on<00:05:01.930> the<00:05:03.460> front<00:05:04.460> of<00:05:04.639> the<00:05:04.729> torque

00:05:04.989 --> 00:05:04.999 
the two slots on the front of the torque

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:08.350 
the two slots on the front of the torque
inverter<00:05:05.300> these<00:05:06.020> are<00:05:06.169> the<00:05:06.229> two<00:05:06.409> hubs<00:05:06.969> now<00:05:07.969> once

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
inverter these are the two hubs now once

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.689 
inverter these are the two hubs now once

teeth line up properly into the hub that

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.129 
teeth line up properly into the hub that
is<00:05:16.610> how<00:05:16.819> they're<00:05:17.029> supposed<00:05:17.330> to<00:05:17.419> fit<00:05:17.689> this<00:05:17.960> is

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
is how they're supposed to fit this is

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:20.739 
is how they're supposed to fit this is
your<00:05:18.319> second<00:05:18.770> clump<00:05:19.039> that<00:05:20.029> you<00:05:20.210> hear<00:05:20.509> when<00:05:20.689> you

00:05:20.739 --> 00:05:20.749 
your second clump that you hear when you

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:22.809 
your second clump that you hear when you
install<00:05:21.080> a<00:05:21.110> converter<00:05:21.560> if<00:05:21.860> you<00:05:22.400> do<00:05:22.490> not<00:05:22.610> hear

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:22.819 
install a converter if you do not hear

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:25.119 
install a converter if you do not hear
that<00:05:22.969> second<00:05:23.360> clunk<00:05:23.599> or<00:05:23.810> you're<00:05:24.740> not<00:05:24.919> sure

00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:25.129 
that second clunk or you're not sure

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:27.100 
that second clunk or you're not sure
it's<00:05:25.279> in<00:05:25.460> all<00:05:25.639> the<00:05:25.669> way<00:05:25.789> one<00:05:26.569> way<00:05:26.749> of<00:05:26.870> checking

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
it's in all the way one way of checking

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.369 
it's in all the way one way of checking
is<00:05:27.639> that<00:05:28.639> you<00:05:29.479> should<00:05:29.659> not<00:05:29.840> be<00:05:29.930> able<00:05:30.139> to<00:05:30.199> fit

00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:30.379 
is that you should not be able to fit

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:32.170 
is that you should not be able to fit
your<00:05:30.529> hand<00:05:30.830> between<00:05:31.189> the<00:05:31.610> front<00:05:31.969> of<00:05:32.090> the

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
your hand between the front of the

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.519 
your hand between the front of the
converter<00:05:32.569> and<00:05:32.870> the<00:05:33.080> front<00:05:33.349> of<00:05:33.439> the

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:33.529 
converter and the front of the

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:35.800 
converter and the front of the
transmission<00:05:33.939> we'll<00:05:34.939> demonstrate<00:05:35.120> that<00:05:35.599> in<00:05:35.750> a

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
transmission we'll demonstrate that in a

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:36.219 
transmission we'll demonstrate that in a
minute

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
minute

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:38.950 
minute
so<00:05:36.800> on<00:05:37.189> the<00:05:37.610> higher<00:05:37.789> stall<00:05:38.150> smaller<00:05:38.539> converter

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
so on the higher stall smaller converter

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.540 
so on the higher stall smaller converter
you<00:05:39.439> can<00:05:39.469> probably<00:05:39.740> still<00:05:39.949> get<00:05:40.069> your<00:05:40.189> hand<00:05:40.400> in

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
you can probably still get your hand in

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.050 
you can probably still get your hand in
but<00:05:40.699> this<00:05:40.939> is<00:05:41.090> the<00:05:41.240> primary<00:05:42.219> failure<00:05:43.219> during

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
but this is the primary failure during

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.450 
but this is the primary failure during
installation<00:05:44.509> is<00:05:45.050> that<00:05:45.830> this<00:05:46.539> hub<00:05:47.539> is<00:05:47.840> not

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
installation is that this hub is not

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.219 
installation is that this hub is not
installer<00:05:49.460> indexed<00:05:50.240> with<00:05:50.479> the<00:05:50.689> pomp<00:05:50.930> gear

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
installer indexed with the pomp gear

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:53.950 
installer indexed with the pomp gear
okay<00:05:52.129> if<00:05:52.310> it<00:05:52.669> is<00:05:52.699> on<00:05:52.909> top<00:05:53.180> of<00:05:53.360> the<00:05:53.449> pump<00:05:53.689> comp

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
okay if it is on top of the pump comp

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.100 
okay if it is on top of the pump comp
gear<00:05:54.289> then<00:05:55.250> it<00:05:55.879> will<00:05:56.150> obviously<00:05:56.300> damage

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
gear then it will obviously damage

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.010 
gear then it will obviously damage
destroyed<00:05:57.650> this<00:05:58.009> rotor<00:05:58.460> mechanism<00:05:59.180> and<00:05:59.360> end

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
destroyed this rotor mechanism and end

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.170 
destroyed this rotor mechanism and end
up<00:06:00.229> to<00:06:00.529> the<00:06:00.979> vehicle<00:06:01.370> not<00:06:01.520> moving<00:06:01.939> at<00:06:02.029> all

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
up to the vehicle not moving at all

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.600 
up to the vehicle not moving at all
you'll<00:06:02.539> lose<00:06:02.719> all<00:06:02.930> forward<00:06:03.469> and<00:06:03.650> reverse<00:06:04.250> gear

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
you'll lose all forward and reverse gear

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.369 
you'll lose all forward and reverse gear
so<00:06:04.849> if<00:06:04.969> you<00:06:05.060> install<00:06:05.330> a<00:06:05.360> transmission<00:06:05.900> you<00:06:06.199> and

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:06.379 
so if you install a transmission you and

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:09.670 
so if you install a transmission you and
it's<00:06:06.800> not<00:06:06.979> moving<00:06:07.490> after<00:06:08.020> just<00:06:09.020> installing<00:06:09.439> it

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
it's not moving after just installing it

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.469 
it's not moving after just installing it
and<00:06:09.889> it's<00:06:10.069> and<00:06:10.490> you<00:06:10.610> show<00:06:10.819> it<00:06:10.849> full<00:06:11.180> of<00:06:11.210> oil

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 
and it's and you show it full of oil

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:15.959 
and it's and you show it full of oil
this<00:06:12.289> is<00:06:12.529> usually<00:06:12.770> where<00:06:13.129> the<00:06:13.370> failure<00:06:13.759> is

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:15.969 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:18.820 

I'll<00:06:16.969> show<00:06:17.330> you<00:06:17.419> what<00:06:17.659> can<00:06:17.839> happen<00:06:18.020> when<00:06:18.319> with

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
I'll show you what can happen when with

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.550 
I'll show you what can happen when with
the<00:06:19.009> converter<00:06:19.939> is<00:06:20.120> not<00:06:20.300> properly<00:06:20.659> installed

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.300 

this<00:06:24.560> is<00:06:24.620> a<00:06:24.800> pump<00:06:25.129> out<00:06:25.339> of<00:06:25.580> a<00:06:26.080> transmission

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
this is a pump out of a transmission

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.689 
this is a pump out of a transmission
that<00:06:28.310> came<00:06:28.550> back<00:06:28.729> and<00:06:29.529> this<00:06:30.529> is<00:06:30.800> the<00:06:31.460> pump

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:31.699 
that came back and this is the pump

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:35.260 
that came back and this is the pump
gears<00:06:32.000> that<00:06:32.180> are<00:06:32.240> broken<00:06:33.219> okay<00:06:34.219> and<00:06:34.460> you<00:06:35.120> can

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
gears that are broken okay and you can

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.709 
gears that are broken okay and you can
see<00:06:35.539> by<00:06:36.050> examining<00:06:36.770> the<00:06:37.610> the<00:06:38.360> gears

00:06:38.709 --> 00:06:38.719 
see by examining the the gears

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:41.740 
see by examining the the gears
themselves<00:06:39.319> closely<00:06:39.860> on<00:06:40.069> how<00:06:41.000> the<00:06:41.509> whole

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750 
themselves closely on how the whole

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.600 
themselves closely on how the whole
inside<00:06:42.319> edge<00:06:42.740> of<00:06:43.099> that<00:06:43.219> hub<00:06:43.819> is<00:06:44.149> chewed<00:06:44.599> away

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.610 
inside edge of that hub is chewed away

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.679 
inside edge of that hub is chewed away
because<00:06:46.610> it<00:06:46.759> was<00:06:46.909> not<00:06:47.089> indexed<00:06:48.279> into<00:06:49.689> the

00:06:50.679 --> 00:06:50.689 
because it was not indexed into the

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:53.110 
because it was not indexed into the
component<00:06:51.289> properly<00:06:51.770> instead<00:06:52.550> of<00:06:52.699> sliding

00:06:55.809 --> 00:06:55.819 
into the slot here it was actually

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:59.800 
into the slot here it was actually
resting<00:06:56.419> on<00:06:56.599> top<00:06:56.930> of<00:06:57.520> the<00:06:58.520> pump<00:06:58.759> it<00:06:59.629> was

00:06:59.800 --> 00:06:59.810 
resting on top of the pump it was
