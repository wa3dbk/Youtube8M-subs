00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.900 

when<00:00:05.710> you<00:00:05.800> come<00:00:05.950> to<00:00:05.980> a<00:00:06.130> river<00:00:06.250> you're<00:00:06.610> going<00:00:06.790> to

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:06.910 
when you come to a river you're going to

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.030 
when you come to a river you're going to
sample<00:00:07.120> Pam<00:00:07.450> and<00:00:07.750> that<00:00:08.530> means<00:00:08.710> you<00:00:08.770> take<00:00:08.889> your

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:09.040 
sample Pam and that means you take your

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.879 
sample Pam and that means you take your
gold<00:00:09.160> pan<00:00:09.400> if<00:00:10.240> you<00:00:10.330> look<00:00:10.480> around<00:00:10.809> at<00:00:11.469> some<00:00:11.710> of

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:11.889 
gold pan if you look around at some of

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:13.140 
gold pan if you look around at some of
the<00:00:11.950> most<00:00:12.070> promising<00:00:12.340> spots<00:00:12.670> and<00:00:12.910> you<00:00:12.970> grab

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.150 
the most promising spots and you grab

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.759 
the most promising spots and you grab
your<00:00:13.300> scoop<00:00:13.510> and<00:00:13.900> you<00:00:14.080> go<00:00:14.230> out<00:00:14.380> there<00:00:14.410> and<00:00:14.710> you

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:14.769 
your scoop and you go out there and you

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.620 
your scoop and you go out there and you
do<00:00:14.950> some<00:00:15.099> sampling<00:00:15.550> and<00:00:15.730> random<00:00:16.090> places<00:00:16.299> and

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 
do some sampling and random places and

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.570 
do some sampling and random places and
you<00:00:16.689> see<00:00:16.840> what<00:00:16.960> pays<00:00:17.110> off<00:00:17.349> don't<00:00:18.040> stop<00:00:18.279> at<00:00:18.430> one

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.580 
you see what pays off don't stop at one

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.310 
you see what pays off don't stop at one
even<00:00:18.820> if<00:00:18.880> you<00:00:18.939> hit<00:00:19.029> a<00:00:19.090> good<00:00:19.210> strike<00:00:19.540> the<00:00:20.110> very

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
even if you hit a good strike the very

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.510 
even if you hit a good strike the very
first<00:00:20.560> time<00:00:20.770> because<00:00:20.800> you<00:00:21.190> want<00:00:21.340> to<00:00:21.369> keep

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
first time because you want to keep

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.100 
first time because you want to keep
looking<00:00:21.880> because<00:00:22.000> you<00:00:22.720> might<00:00:22.869> find<00:00:23.050> even

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.110 
looking because you might find even

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.230 
looking because you might find even
better<00:00:23.440> strike<00:00:23.770> over<00:00:24.100> there<00:00:24.279> over<00:00:24.609> there<00:00:24.820> so

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
better strike over there over there so

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.300 
better strike over there over there so
make<00:00:25.960> yourself<00:00:26.260> take<00:00:26.500> a<00:00:26.529> half<00:00:26.740> a<00:00:26.859> dozen<00:00:26.949> pans

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
make yourself take a half a dozen pans

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.120 
make yourself take a half a dozen pans
or<00:00:27.460> so<00:00:27.670> pan<00:00:28.630> it<00:00:28.750> out<00:00:28.900> and<00:00:29.109> then<00:00:29.859> you'll<00:00:29.980> know

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
or so pan it out and then you'll know

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.830 
or so pan it out and then you'll know
and<00:00:30.850> we'll<00:00:30.970> teach<00:00:31.090> you<00:00:31.119> how<00:00:31.210> to<00:00:31.359> sample<00:00:31.570> pan

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
and we'll teach you how to sample pan

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.970 
and we'll teach you how to sample pan
now<00:00:32.019> because<00:00:32.320> it's<00:00:32.439> a<00:00:32.470> little<00:00:32.590> bit<00:00:32.710> different

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
now because it's a little bit different

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.130 
now because it's a little bit different
than<00:00:33.070> regular<00:00:33.190> panning<00:00:33.960> okay

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
than regular panning okay

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.020 
than regular panning okay
so<00:00:35.650> I<00:00:35.680> pick<00:00:36.070> a<00:00:36.100> spot<00:00:36.340> on<00:00:36.400> the<00:00:36.610> other<00:00:36.729> side<00:00:36.970> of

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
so I pick a spot on the other side of

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.729 
so I pick a spot on the other side of
this<00:00:37.089> river<00:00:37.300> here<00:00:37.510> oh<00:00:37.570> it's<00:00:38.229> got<00:00:38.379> a<00:00:38.409> nice<00:00:38.530> big

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
this river here oh it's got a nice big

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.229 
this river here oh it's got a nice big
rock<00:00:39.010> in<00:00:39.190> it<00:00:39.309> it's<00:00:39.430> got<00:00:39.550> a<00:00:39.580> likely<00:00:39.909> probability

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
rock in it it's got a likely probability

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.850 
rock in it it's got a likely probability
of<00:00:40.420> having<00:00:40.510> some<00:00:40.780> gold<00:00:40.960> behind<00:00:41.199> it<00:00:41.320> and<00:00:41.500> so<00:00:41.710> I'm

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
of having some gold behind it and so I'm

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.920 
of having some gold behind it and so I'm
going<00:00:41.979> to<00:00:42.040> do<00:00:42.100> a<00:00:42.129> sample<00:00:42.339> pan<00:00:42.610> here<00:00:42.820> so<00:00:43.659> first

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
going to do a sample pan here so first

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.719 
going to do a sample pan here so first
and<00:00:44.920> we<00:00:44.979> look<00:00:45.129> at<00:00:45.220> the<00:00:45.280> way<00:00:45.370> the<00:00:45.460> water<00:00:45.640> flows

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:45.729 
and we look at the way the water flows

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:48.000 
and we look at the way the water flows
now<00:00:46.690> right<00:00:46.900> now<00:00:47.049> the<00:00:47.110> water<00:00:47.440> comes<00:00:47.650> down<00:00:47.799> here

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
now right now the water comes down here

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.039 
now right now the water comes down here
and<00:00:48.100> flows<00:00:48.309> that<00:00:48.549> way<00:00:48.729> and<00:00:49.510> come<00:00:49.659> down<00:00:49.870> here

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:50.049 
and flows that way and come down here

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:51.750 
and flows that way and come down here
and<00:00:50.140> flows<00:00:50.320> that<00:00:50.589> way<00:00:50.769> if<00:00:51.070> not<00:00:51.370> straight

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
and flows that way if not straight

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.969 
and flows that way if not straight
downstream<00:00:52.330> like<00:00:52.449> it<00:00:52.570> should<00:00:52.750> be<00:00:52.870> but<00:00:53.110> you<00:00:53.830> got

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:53.979 
downstream like it should be but you got

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:55.710 
downstream like it should be but you got
to<00:00:54.040> remember<00:00:54.190> gold<00:00:54.820> isn't<00:00:54.909> flowing<00:00:55.299> right<00:00:55.540> now

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
to remember gold isn't flowing right now

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.630 
to remember gold isn't flowing right now
because<00:00:55.930> it's<00:00:56.199> late<00:00:56.350> fall<00:00:56.619> so<00:00:57.010> water<00:00:57.339> level<00:00:57.580> is

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
because it's late fall so water level is

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.030 
because it's late fall so water level is
really<00:00:57.729> really<00:00:57.940> low<00:00:58.320> when<00:00:59.320> gold<00:00:59.530> is<00:00:59.619> flowing

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
really really low when gold is flowing

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.890 
really really low when gold is flowing
is<00:01:00.159> when<00:01:00.309> springtime<00:01:00.729> comes<00:01:00.970> when<00:01:01.659> the<00:01:01.720> water

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:01.900 
is when springtime comes when the water

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.289 
is when springtime comes when the water
levels<00:01:02.199> like<00:01:02.320> up<00:01:02.470> to<00:01:02.500> here<00:01:02.619> oh<00:01:02.830> so<00:01:03.820> then<00:01:04.059> the

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
levels like up to here oh so then the

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:05.940 
levels like up to here oh so then the
water<00:01:04.420> would<00:01:04.659> be<00:01:04.780> going<00:01:04.900> straight<00:01:05.320> past<00:01:05.619> here

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
water would be going straight past here

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.190 
water would be going straight past here
and<00:01:06.130> not<00:01:06.880> coming<00:01:07.240> around<00:01:07.330> and<00:01:07.570> curving<00:01:07.869> behind

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
and not coming around and curving behind

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.289 
and not coming around and curving behind
it<00:01:08.350> and<00:01:08.770> that<00:01:08.799> means<00:01:09.100> your<00:01:09.729> spots<00:01:09.939> going<00:01:10.090> back

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
it and that means your spots going back

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.719 
it and that means your spots going back
there<00:01:10.600> not<00:01:11.590> over<00:01:11.770> here<00:01:12.039> where<00:01:12.399> it<00:01:12.490> is<00:01:12.579> right

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
there not over here where it is right

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.730 
there not over here where it is right
now<00:01:12.789> the<00:01:13.750> dead<00:01:13.930> spot<00:01:14.140> right<00:01:14.259> now<00:01:14.409> is<00:01:14.590> right

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
now the dead spot right now is right

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.380 
now the dead spot right now is right
here<00:01:14.979> the<00:01:15.520> water<00:01:15.700> comes<00:01:15.909> around<00:01:16.119> like<00:01:16.210> that

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
here the water comes around like that

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.870 
here the water comes around like that
dead<00:01:17.380> spot<00:01:17.590> in<00:01:17.649> the<00:01:17.710> wintertime<00:01:17.890> it's<00:01:18.369> going

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
dead spot in the wintertime it's going

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.940 
dead spot in the wintertime it's going
to<00:01:18.939> go<00:01:19.030> around<00:01:19.090> here<00:01:19.390> like<00:01:19.570> that<00:01:19.750> so<00:01:20.020> that's

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
to go around here like that so that's

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.090 
to go around here like that so that's
what<00:01:21.070> I'm<00:01:21.130> going<00:01:21.219> to<00:01:21.280> dig<00:01:21.429> oh<00:01:25.920> quick<00:01:26.920> way<00:01:27.070> to

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
what I'm going to dig oh quick way to

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.730 
what I'm going to dig oh quick way to
fill<00:01:27.729> up<00:01:27.850> a<00:01:27.909> pan<00:01:28.119> put<00:01:28.750> it<00:01:28.840> under<00:01:29.020> water<00:01:29.170> take

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
fill up a pan put it under water take

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.469 
fill up a pan put it under water take
your<00:01:29.859> scoop<00:01:30.070> and<00:01:30.609> just<00:01:30.880> scoop<00:01:31.299> up<00:01:31.420> into<00:01:31.539> it

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.490 

at<00:01:36.479> least<00:01:36.719> get<00:01:36.899> you<00:01:36.990> some<00:01:37.110> rocks<00:01:37.289> to<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
at least get you some rocks to the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.660 
at least get you some rocks to the
bottom<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.130> not<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.310> do<00:01:38.399> a<00:01:38.430> whole

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
bottom of it so you not to do a whole

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.560 
bottom of it so you not to do a whole
thing<00:01:43.670> now<00:01:44.670> take<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.060> sit<00:01:45.270> up<00:01:45.390> out<00:01:45.479> of

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
thing now take that and sit up out of

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.630 
thing now take that and sit up out of
the<00:01:45.630> way<00:01:46.009> pull<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.100> biggest<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.460> rocks

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
the way pull the biggest of the rocks

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:56.529 
the way pull the biggest of the rocks
out<00:01:49.460> and<00:01:50.460> try<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.759> scoot<00:01:50.939> some<00:01:51.060> more<00:01:51.149> dirt<00:01:51.270> in

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.240 

there's<00:01:57.539> a<00:01:57.600> lot<00:01:57.720> of<00:01:57.899> large<00:01:58.649> rocks<00:01:58.950> down<00:01:59.189> here

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
there's a lot of large rocks down here

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.859 
there's a lot of large rocks down here
I'm<00:01:59.520> having<00:01:59.759> trouble<00:01:59.970> getting<00:02:00.000> actually<00:02:00.479> any

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
I'm having trouble getting actually any

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.260 
I'm having trouble getting actually any
soil<00:02:01.549> so<00:02:02.549> it's<00:02:02.789> gonna<00:02:02.909> be<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.030> little<00:02:03.119> bit

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
soil so it's gonna be a little bit

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:12.330 
soil so it's gonna be a little bit
harder<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.479> sample<00:02:03.869> right<00:02:03.990> here

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.550 

as<00:02:13.330> I<00:02:13.420> mentioned<00:02:13.690> before<00:02:13.720> these<00:02:14.050> videos<00:02:14.380> art

going to be in these large clean rocks

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.949 
going to be in these large clean rocks
we<00:02:57.670> really<00:02:57.849> have<00:02:57.940> practically<00:02:58.239> no<00:02:58.420> soil<00:02:58.720> all

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
we really have practically no soil all

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.059 
we really have practically no soil all
there<00:02:59.230> so<00:02:59.380> I'm<00:02:59.440> gonna<00:02:59.530> have<00:02:59.650> to<00:02:59.709> take<00:02:59.799> a<00:02:59.860> lot

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
there so I'm gonna have to take a lot

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.320 
there so I'm gonna have to take a lot
deeper<00:03:00.280> if<00:03:00.459> I'm<00:03:00.549> going<00:03:00.670> to<00:03:00.730> find<00:03:00.940> any<00:03:01.150> dirt

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
deeper if I'm going to find any dirt

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.240 
deeper if I'm going to find any dirt
that<00:03:01.360> can<00:03:01.630> find<00:03:01.870> gold<00:03:02.019> in<00:03:02.230> here<00:03:02.380> I'm<00:03:02.890> getting

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
that can find gold in here I'm getting

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.250 
that can find gold in here I'm getting
on<00:03:03.400> top<00:03:03.549> to<00:03:03.670> just<00:03:03.849> gravel<00:03:04.209> probably<00:03:05.049> it's<00:03:05.200> just

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
on top to just gravel probably it's just

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.500 
on top to just gravel probably it's just
overly<00:03:05.769> washed<00:03:06.040> through<00:03:06.489> here<00:03:06.730> oh<00:03:06.760> and<00:03:06.940> all

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
overly washed through here oh and all

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.390 
overly washed through here oh and all
the<00:03:07.630> soils<00:03:07.989> on<00:03:08.110> the<00:03:08.200> bottom<00:03:08.560> like<00:03:09.010> I<00:03:09.099> had<00:03:09.220> dig

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
the soils on the bottom like I had dig

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.000 
the soils on the bottom like I had dig
do<00:03:09.489> a<00:03:09.519> lot<00:03:09.670> more<00:03:09.819> stuff<00:03:09.970> to<00:03:10.090> get<00:03:10.180> to<00:03:10.360> it<00:03:10.510> so<00:03:11.110> I'm

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
do a lot more stuff to get to it so I'm

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.620 
do a lot more stuff to get to it so I'm
going<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.250> look<00:03:12.459> at<00:03:12.580> that<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:13.180> if<00:03:13.480> I<00:03:13.510> don't

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
going to look at that and if I don't

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.550 
going to look at that and if I don't
think<00:03:13.750> it's<00:03:13.870> practical<00:03:13.959> to<00:03:14.349> move<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.530> a

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
think it's practical to move to a

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.900 
think it's practical to move to a
different<00:03:14.590> spot<00:03:14.860> because<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.670> whole<00:03:15.790> purpose

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
different spot because the whole purpose

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.250 
different spot because the whole purpose
of<00:03:16.090> sampling<00:03:16.420> is<00:03:16.570> you<00:03:16.660> want<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.870> spend<00:03:17.019> 20<00:03:17.230> or

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
of sampling is you want to spend 20 or

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.900 
of sampling is you want to spend 20 or
30<00:03:17.470> minutes<00:03:17.620> looking<00:03:18.519> around<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.760> river

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
30 minutes looking around the river

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.310 
30 minutes looking around the river
trying<00:03:19.150> to<00:03:19.209> find<00:03:19.359> a<00:03:19.420> good<00:03:19.540> spot<00:03:19.630> and<00:03:20.109> then<00:03:20.260> you

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
trying to find a good spot and then you

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.569 
trying to find a good spot and then you
pick<00:03:20.440> one<00:03:20.620> and<00:03:20.680> then<00:03:20.739> you<00:03:20.890> work<00:03:21.040> you<00:03:21.430> don't

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
pick one and then you work you don't

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.090 
pick one and then you work you don't
spend<00:03:21.730> all<00:03:21.880> day<00:03:22.000> doing<00:03:22.150> this<00:03:22.620> I'm<00:03:23.620> a<00:03:23.650> pianist

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
spend all day doing this I'm a pianist

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.960 
spend all day doing this I'm a pianist
and<00:03:24.220> real<00:03:24.340> quick

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:37.190 

even<00:03:29.970> though<00:03:30.030> it's<00:03:30.150> mostly<00:03:30.330> gravel<00:03:36.080> and<00:03:37.080> it's

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
even though it's mostly gravel and it's

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.360 
even though it's mostly gravel and it's
okay<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.470> scrape<00:03:37.710> like<00:03:37.920> this<00:03:38.070> when<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.250> got

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
okay to scrape like this when you got

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.680 
okay to scrape like this when you got
nothing<00:03:38.430> but<00:03:38.640> rocks<00:03:38.880> and<00:03:39.180> we're<00:03:39.420> sampling

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
nothing but rocks and we're sampling

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.470 
nothing but rocks and we're sampling
panning<00:03:40.340> there<00:03:41.340> may<00:03:41.460> be<00:03:41.520> gold<00:03:41.850> here<00:03:42.120> oh<00:03:42.150> so<00:03:42.390> you

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
panning there may be gold here oh so you

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.460 
panning there may be gold here oh so you
can<00:03:42.600> have<00:03:42.690> dig<00:03:42.870> down<00:03:42.990> a<00:03:43.050> lot<00:03:43.140> deeper<00:03:43.290> to<00:03:43.440> find

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
can have dig down a lot deeper to find

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.660 
can have dig down a lot deeper to find
it<00:03:43.770> and<00:03:43.890> I'm<00:03:43.980> not<00:03:44.100> prepared<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.400> walk<00:03:44.550> that

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
it and I'm not prepared to walk that

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.830 
it and I'm not prepared to walk that
hard<00:03:44.880> right<00:03:45.030> now<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.180> we'll<00:03:45.390> go<00:03:45.450> to<00:03:45.540> an<00:03:45.600> easier

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
hard right now and we'll go to an easier

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.330 
hard right now and we'll go to an easier
spot<00:03:46.050> because<00:03:46.320> when<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.010> first<00:03:47.160> get

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
spot because when you first get

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.860 
spot because when you first get
someplace<00:03:47.550> why<00:03:47.970> fight<00:03:48.240> the<00:03:48.360> hard<00:03:48.540> thing<00:03:48.720> well

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
someplace why fight the hard thing well

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.920 
someplace why fight the hard thing well
you<00:03:48.960> can<00:03:49.080> work<00:03:49.170> with<00:03:49.260> a<00:03:49.320> easier<00:03:49.560> spot<00:03:50.840> so<00:03:51.840> now

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
you can work with a easier spot so now

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.840 
you can work with a easier spot so now
I'm<00:03:51.990> going<00:03:52.110> to<00:03:52.170> walk<00:03:52.230> up<00:03:52.410> a<00:03:52.440> little<00:03:52.770> ways<00:03:52.950> to

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
I'm going to walk up a little ways to

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.040 
I'm going to walk up a little ways to
another<00:03:54.060> promising<00:03:54.420> spot<00:03:54.660> that<00:03:54.810> I<00:03:54.870> have<00:03:54.960> it

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
another promising spot that I have it

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.500 
another promising spot that I have it
walked<00:03:55.170> out<00:03:55.290> before<00:03:55.700> so<00:03:56.700> this<00:03:56.850> isn't<00:03:57.030> bedrock

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
walked out before so this isn't bedrock

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.300 
walked out before so this isn't bedrock
but<00:03:57.690> it's<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:57.870> large<00:03:58.080> enough<00:03:58.200> rock<00:03:58.590> that<00:03:58.890> it's

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
but it's a large enough rock that it's

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.250 
but it's a large enough rock that it's
going<00:03:59.520> to<00:03:59.580> mess<00:03:59.730> up<00:03:59.880> the<00:03:59.970> water<00:04:00.150> flow<00:04:00.390> some<00:04:00.660> so

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
going to mess up the water flow some so

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.970 
going to mess up the water flow some so
I'm<00:04:01.320> going<00:04:01.440> to<00:04:01.500> pull<00:04:01.590> out<00:04:01.710> some<00:04:01.740> of<00:04:01.890> the

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
I'm going to pull out some of the

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.160 
I'm going to pull out some of the
biggest<00:04:02.130> rocks<00:04:02.400> from<00:04:02.550> underneath<00:04:02.760> it<00:04:03.170> by

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
biggest rocks from underneath it by

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.220 
biggest rocks from underneath it by
underneath<00:04:04.470> I<00:04:04.590> mean<00:04:04.740> down<00:04:04.890> stream<00:04:05.250> and<00:04:06.230> then

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
underneath I mean down stream and then

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.350 
underneath I mean down stream and then
we'll<00:04:07.740> try<00:04:07.860> scooping<00:04:08.190> out<00:04:08.250> here

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.640 

bedrock<00:04:12.360> isn't<00:04:12.660> far<00:04:12.870> away<00:04:12.990> I<00:04:13.140> can<00:04:13.380> see<00:04:13.410> it

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
bedrock isn't far away I can see it

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.160 
bedrock isn't far away I can see it
poking<00:04:13.950> up<00:04:14.070> here<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:14.430> there<00:04:14.610> so<00:04:14.970> if<00:04:15.540> I<00:04:15.690> do<00:04:15.750> find

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
poking up here and there so if I do find

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.810 
poking up here and there so if I do find
gold<00:04:16.440> here<00:04:16.530> it'll<00:04:17.190> be<00:04:17.250> a<00:04:17.340> good<00:04:17.459> place<00:04:17.670> to

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
gold here it'll be a good place to

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.120 
gold here it'll be a good place to
continue<00:04:18.060> all<00:04:18.330> the<00:04:18.360> way<00:04:18.480> down<00:04:18.750> because<00:04:19.200> if

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
continue all the way down because if

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.500 
continue all the way down because if
gold<00:04:20.400> stops<00:04:20.670> here<00:04:20.850> it's<00:04:20.970> going<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.150> keep<00:04:21.270> going

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
gold stops here it's going to keep going

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.270 
gold stops here it's going to keep going
down<00:04:21.630> and<00:04:21.989> down<00:04:22.020> and<00:04:22.140> down<00:04:22.350> towards<00:04:22.950> bedrock

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
down and down and down towards bedrock

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.560 
down and down and down towards bedrock
and<00:04:23.520> those<00:04:23.820> are<00:04:23.940> the<00:04:24.000> best<00:04:24.150> places<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.480> find

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
and those are the best places to find

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:31.070 
and those are the best places to find
gold<00:04:28.910> so<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:30.030> idea<00:04:30.240> here<00:04:30.300> is<00:04:30.510> to<00:04:30.690> get<00:04:30.780> as<00:04:30.900> much

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
gold so the idea here is to get as much

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.180 
gold so the idea here is to get as much
dirt<00:04:31.440> in<00:04:31.590> here<00:04:31.710> as<00:04:31.830> you<00:04:31.890> can<00:04:31.980> and<00:04:33.560> then<00:04:34.560> pan<00:04:35.100> it

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
dirt in here as you can and then pan it

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.340 
dirt in here as you can and then pan it
down<00:04:35.310> all<00:04:35.490> at<00:04:35.640> once<00:04:35.930> because<00:04:36.930> the<00:04:37.050> more<00:04:37.170> dirt

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
down all at once because the more dirt

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.860 
down all at once because the more dirt
you<00:04:37.440> work<00:04:37.590> the<00:04:38.070> better<00:04:38.220> sampling<00:04:38.970> you<00:04:39.060> have<00:04:39.240> of

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
you work the better sampling you have of

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.640 
you work the better sampling you have of
what<00:04:40.080> quality<00:04:40.530> material<00:04:41.040> can<00:04:41.130> be<00:04:41.190> walking

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
what quality material can be walking

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.440 
what quality material can be walking
then<00:04:43.650> I'm<00:04:43.770> gonna<00:04:43.890> wash<00:04:44.760> off<00:04:44.970> these<00:04:45.120> big<00:04:45.300> rocks

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
then I'm gonna wash off these big rocks

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:53.380 
then I'm gonna wash off these big rocks
off<00:04:45.660> the<00:04:45.780> top<00:04:47.240> and<00:04:48.240> plug<00:04:48.540> them<00:04:48.660> out<00:04:51.860> and

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
off the top and plug them out and

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.220 
off the top and plug them out and
contrary<00:04:54.390> let<00:04:54.510> me<00:04:54.600> see<00:04:54.720> my<00:04:54.870> a<00:04:54.900> Mac<00:04:55.110> you're

here's<00:05:04.760> have<00:05:04.880> a<00:05:04.940> sample<00:05:05.210> pan<00:05:07.720> shake<00:05:08.720> it<00:05:08.840> really

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
here's have a sample pan shake it really

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
was not to find every piece of gold it's

was not to find every piece of gold it's
to<00:05:35.270> find<00:05:35.450> it<00:05:35.510> if<00:05:35.600> there's<00:05:35.780> significant<00:05:36.260> gold

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
to find it if there's significant gold

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.960 
to find it if there's significant gold
here<00:05:36.650> oh<00:05:36.680> and<00:05:36.950> I<00:05:37.220> will<00:05:37.340> not<00:05:37.460> have<00:05:37.550> missed<00:05:37.760> much

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
settling down into the corner doing it

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.970 
settling down into the corner doing it
again<00:05:47.000> another<00:05:47.900> inch<00:05:48.140> and<00:05:48.169> a<00:05:48.290> half<00:05:48.320> or<00:05:48.560> so

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
settle and now we're down to a

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.720 
settle and now we're down to a
manageable<00:05:54.260> level<00:05:54.560> that<00:05:54.830> you<00:05:54.890> can<00:05:55.010> clean<00:05:55.610> out

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:55.730 
manageable level that you can clean out

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.710 
manageable level that you can clean out
very<00:05:55.910> quickly<00:05:56.090> the<00:05:56.300> ordinary<00:05:56.660> way<00:05:56.840> one<00:05:57.800> two

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
very quickly the ordinary way one two

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:05.110 
very quickly the ordinary way one two
three<00:06:01.060> one<00:06:02.060> two<00:06:03.160> three<00:06:04.190> I'm<00:06:04.669> down<00:06:04.880> to<00:06:04.910> black

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
three one two three I'm down to black

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:12.610 
three one two three I'm down to black
sand<00:06:05.390> so<00:06:06.200> I'm<00:06:06.260> going<00:06:06.380> to<00:06:06.440> rotate<00:06:10.030> wash<00:06:11.050> and<00:06:12.050> I

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
sand so I'm going to rotate wash and I

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.960 
sand so I'm going to rotate wash and I
see<00:06:12.770> no<00:06:12.890> significant<00:06:13.400> gold<00:06:13.550> do<00:06:13.700> a<00:06:15.850> couple<00:06:16.850> tiny

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970 
see no significant gold do a couple tiny

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.760 
see no significant gold do a couple tiny
specks<00:06:17.270> but<00:06:17.419> I'm<00:06:17.510> not<00:06:17.600> worried<00:06:17.870> about<00:06:17.900> that<00:06:18.140> so

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
specks but I'm not worried about that so

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.010 
specks but I'm not worried about that so
so<00:06:19.220> wash<00:06:19.400> it<00:06:19.550> out<00:06:19.669> and<00:06:19.910> move<00:06:20.660> on<00:06:20.810> to<00:06:20.900> another

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
so wash it out and move on to another

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.900 
so wash it out and move on to another
hole<00:06:21.260> this<00:06:21.620> one<00:06:21.770> didn't<00:06:22.010> pan<00:06:22.160> out<00:06:22.190> which<00:06:22.790> is

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:22.910 
hole this one didn't pan out which is

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.040 
hole this one didn't pan out which is
the<00:06:23.000> origin<00:06:23.300> of<00:06:23.330> the<00:06:23.419> expression<00:06:23.450> by<00:06:23.840> the<00:06:23.900> way

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
the origin of the expression by the way

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.020 
the origin of the expression by the way
so<00:06:24.919> now<00:06:24.979> we'll<00:06:25.130> try<00:06:25.220> some<00:06:25.400> other<00:06:25.520> places<00:06:25.729> until

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.030 
so now we'll try some other places until

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.010 
so now we'll try some other places until
we<00:06:26.090> find<00:06:26.240> a<00:06:26.300> spot<00:06:26.450> we're<00:06:26.540> going<00:06:26.570> to<00:06:26.720> walk<00:06:26.840> in

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
we find a spot we're going to walk in

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.050 
we find a spot we're going to walk in
and<00:06:27.229> that's<00:06:27.800> how<00:06:27.890> you<00:06:27.950> sample<00:06:28.340> pan<00:06:28.490> and<00:06:28.970> how

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 
and that's how you sample pan and how

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.860 
and that's how you sample pan and how
you<00:06:29.150> pick<00:06:29.300> that<00:06:29.390> what<00:06:29.510> you're<00:06:29.600> going<00:06:29.720> to<00:06:29.780> walk

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
you pick that what you're going to walk

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:30.880 
you pick that what you're going to walk
in<00:06:29.990> the<00:06:30.050> river<00:06:30.200> and<00:06:30.410> how<00:06:30.530> you're<00:06:30.680> going<00:06:30.800> to

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:30.890 
in the river and how you're going to

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.640 
in the river and how you're going to
walk<00:06:31.040> once<00:06:31.760> you<00:06:31.850> figure<00:06:32.090> that<00:06:32.120> out<00:06:32.650> then

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650 
walk once you figure that out then

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:34.690 
walk once you figure that out then
you'll<00:06:33.800> know<00:06:33.950> which<00:06:34.400> of<00:06:34.430> the<00:06:34.580> following

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:34.700 
you'll know which of the following

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.630 
you'll know which of the following
videos<00:06:34.910> you<00:06:35.300> need<00:06:35.419> to<00:06:35.510> follow
