and<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.569> GTA<00:01:36.990> 5<00:01:37.259> especially<00:01:37.710> when<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.889> like<00:01:38.100> a

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
and in GTA 5 especially when I like a

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.639 
and in GTA 5 especially when I like a
clear<00:01:38.429> lane<00:01:38.700> or<00:01:38.939> something<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:40.049> why<00:01:40.319> don't<00:01:40.560> I

clear lane or something so why don't I

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.770 
clear lane or something so why don't I
wasn't<00:01:41.340> really<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.549> huge<00:01:41.670> fan<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.999> it<00:01:42.240> tell<00:01:42.719> me

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
wasn't really a huge fan of it tell me

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.989 
wasn't really a huge fan of it tell me
what<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.020> guys<00:01:43.139> think<00:01:43.200> about<00:01:43.499> this<00:01:43.829> but<00:01:44.159> the

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:44.999 
what you guys think about this but the

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:46.429 
what you guys think about this but the
cops<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.450> think<00:01:45.479> it'd<00:01:45.689> be<00:01:45.719> pretty<00:01:45.960> cool<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.289> see

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
cops I think it'd be pretty cool to see

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.639 
cops I think it'd be pretty cool to see
a<00:01:46.889> girl<00:01:47.399> cop<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.569> one<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.990> screenshots

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
a girl cop and in one of the screenshots

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.029 
a girl cop and in one of the screenshots
will<00:01:49.859> artwork<00:01:50.579> /<00:01:50.759> screenshot<00:01:51.539> we<00:01:52.439> see<00:01:52.679> a<00:01:52.709> girl

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
will artwork / screenshot we see a girl

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.449 
will artwork / screenshot we see a girl
cop<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.700> maybe<00:01:54.689> there<00:01:55.530> will<00:01:55.649> be<00:01:55.709> girl<00:01:55.979> cops<00:01:56.280> in

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:56.459 
cop so maybe there will be girl cops in

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:58.730 
cop so maybe there will be girl cops in
GTA<00:01:56.579> 5<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:56.999> I<00:01:57.479> think<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.749> is<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:58.139> new<00:01:58.709> thing

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
GTA 5 and I think this is a new thing

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.199 
GTA 5 and I think this is a new thing
for<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.189> game<00:01:59.369> it's<00:01:59.549> gonna<00:01:59.639> be<00:01:59.789> pretty<00:01:59.909> cool

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:00.209 
for the game it's gonna be pretty cool

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:04.209 
for the game it's gonna be pretty cool
and<00:02:01.189> lots<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.280> cops<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.700> GTA<00:02:02.850> four<00:02:03.359> were<00:02:03.569> very

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
and lots of cops in GTA four were very

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.919 
and lots of cops in GTA four were very
fat<00:02:05.219> so<00:02:05.579> it's<00:02:05.729> kind<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:05.939> stereotypical<00:02:06.509> that

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
fat so it's kind of stereotypical that

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:08.600 
fat so it's kind of stereotypical that
they<00:02:07.049> eat<00:02:07.259> like<00:02:07.289> so<00:02:07.679> many<00:02:07.829> donuts<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.399> stuff

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
they eat like so many donuts and stuff

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.850 
they eat like so many donuts and stuff
but<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.850> think<00:02:09.030> that's<00:02:09.149> kind<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.390> funny<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:10.649> adds

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
but I think that's kind of funny it adds

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.210 
but I think that's kind of funny it adds
a<00:02:11.009> little<00:02:11.160> bit<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.400> um<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:12.630> know<00:02:12.830> comedy<00:02:13.830> to

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
a little bit of um you know comedy to

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.429 
a little bit of um you know comedy to
the<00:02:14.700> police<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.360> I<00:02:15.629> think<00:02:15.900> it's<00:02:16.019> really<00:02:16.049> cool

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
the police and I think it's really cool

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.320 
the police and I think it's really cool
and<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.040> think<00:02:17.129> the<00:02:17.280> police<00:02:17.549> should<00:02:17.610> be<00:02:17.939> a<00:02:18.120> bit

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
and I think the police should be a bit

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.180 
and I think the police should be a bit
more<00:02:18.629> lifelike

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
more lifelike

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.830 
more lifelike
like<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.610> can<00:02:20.760> find<00:02:21.060> them<00:02:21.240> and<00:02:21.330> like<00:02:21.480> donut

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
like you can find them and like donut

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.210 
like you can find them and like donut
shops<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.380> stuff<00:02:22.470> like<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.680> I<00:02:22.890> think<00:02:23.130> that'd

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
shops and stuff like that I think that'd

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.000 
shops and stuff like that I think that'd
be<00:02:23.340> really<00:02:23.550> really<00:02:23.760> sick<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.440> maybe<00:02:25.440> they<00:02:25.980> can

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
be really really sick and maybe they can

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.670 
be really really sick and maybe they can
have<00:02:26.250> some<00:02:26.460> like<00:02:26.900> funny<00:02:27.900> lines<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.590> stuff

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
have some like funny lines and stuff

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.280 
have some like funny lines and stuff
like<00:02:28.860> that<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.490> as<00:02:30.450> far<00:02:30.660> as<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.930> wanted

like that and as far as the wanted

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.310 
like that and as far as the wanted
system<00:02:31.650> go<00:02:31.860> goes<00:02:32.580> in<00:02:33.240> in<00:02:33.720> one<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:33.960> my<00:02:34.080> older

much<00:02:51.780> into<00:02:51.840> that<00:02:52.230> into<00:02:52.680> depth<00:02:52.890> with<00:02:52.980> that

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
much into that into depth with that

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.750 
much into that into depth with that
police<00:02:54.450> cars<00:02:54.780> um<00:02:55.230> i<00:02:55.800> guess<00:02:56.310> they<00:02:56.610> could

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
police cars um i guess they could

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.570 
police cars um i guess they could
modernize<00:02:57.450> them<00:02:57.780> bits<00:02:58.170> like<00:02:58.590> in<00:02:58.740> GTA<00:02:59.040> or<00:02:59.310> they

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
modernize them bits like in GTA or they

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.610 
modernize them bits like in GTA or they
just<00:02:59.610> look<00:03:00.120> kind<00:03:00.330> of<00:03:00.390> old<00:03:00.630> school<00:03:00.750> so<00:03:01.590> i

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
just look kind of old school so i

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.740 
just look kind of old school so i
wouldn't<00:03:02.220> be<00:03:02.280> too<00:03:02.430> bad<00:03:02.460> if<00:03:02.640> they<00:03:02.880> you<00:03:03.720> know

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
wouldn't be too bad if they you know

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.590 
wouldn't be too bad if they you know
amped<00:03:04.470> it<00:03:04.560> up<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.770> bit<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:05.190> made<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.150> cars<00:03:06.390> look

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
amped it up a bit and made the cars look

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.840 
amped it up a bit and made the cars look
sweet<00:03:07.010> more<00:03:08.010> sweet<00:03:08.220> than<00:03:08.250> they<00:03:08.430> already<00:03:08.550> are

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
sweet more sweet than they already are

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.080 
sweet more sweet than they already are
but<00:03:09.390> i<00:03:09.420> think<00:03:09.930> that's<00:03:10.560> pretty<00:03:10.890> much<00:03:11.130> it<00:03:11.340> from

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
but i think that's pretty much it from

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.780 
but i think that's pretty much it from
cops<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.140> stuff<00:03:13.200> like<00:03:13.470> that<00:03:13.530> on<00:03:13.980> one<00:03:14.580> last

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
cops and stuff like that on one last

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.410 
cops and stuff like that on one last
thing<00:03:14.970> i<00:03:15.090> want<00:03:15.300> to<00:03:15.360> add<00:03:15.630> with<00:03:15.930> cops<00:03:16.260> is<00:03:16.560> uh<00:03:17.460> that

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
thing i want to add with cops is uh that

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.080 
thing i want to add with cops is uh that
you<00:03:19.020> know<00:03:19.140> in<00:03:19.440> gta4<00:03:20.040> they<00:03:20.550> did<00:03:20.760> give<00:03:20.940> you<00:03:21.030> a

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
you know in gta4 they did give you a

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.930 
you know in gta4 they did give you a
chance<00:03:21.510> for<00:03:22.380> them<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.530> arrest<00:03:23.070> you<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.580> then

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
chance for them to arrest you and then

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.250 
chance for them to arrest you and then
