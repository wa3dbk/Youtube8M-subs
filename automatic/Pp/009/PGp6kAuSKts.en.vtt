li tutorial but my i guess you could
call<00:00:36.980> it<00:00:37.040> that<00:00:37.130> for<00:00:37.370> taking<00:00:37.700> down<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:38.239> boss

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
call it that for taking down the boss

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.590 
call it that for taking down the boss
with<00:00:39.110> the<00:00:39.200> RPG<00:00:39.890> in<00:00:40.040> here<00:00:40.280> so<00:00:40.879> if<00:00:41.059> you<00:00:41.210> want<00:00:41.540> to

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
with the RPG in here so if you want to

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.880 
with the RPG in here so if you want to
stick<00:00:41.780> around<00:00:41.809> for<00:00:42.170> that<00:00:42.200> you<00:00:42.559> know<00:00:42.680> just

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
stick around for that you know just

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.690 
stick around for that you know just
stick<00:00:43.430> to<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.579> end<00:00:47.710> these<00:00:48.710> are<00:00:49.039> golden

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700

trophies<00:00:50.239> are<00:00:50.539> actually<00:00:51.020> treasures<00:00:51.890> i<00:00:52.100> should

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
trophies are actually treasures i should

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.970 
trophies are actually treasures i should
say<00:00:52.579> are<00:00:52.789> pretty<00:00:53.210> relatively<00:00:53.690> easy<00:00:54.500> to<00:00:54.680> find

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
say are pretty relatively easy to find

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.369 
say are pretty relatively easy to find
because<00:00:55.820> you'll<00:00:56.329> usually<00:00:56.510> see<00:00:56.780> them<00:00:56.960> within<00:00:57.230> a

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
because you'll usually see them within a

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.229 
because you'll usually see them within a
cutscene<00:00:57.829> after<00:00:58.129> you<00:00:58.250> kill<00:00:58.699> off<00:00:58.879> so<00:00:59.120> many

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
cutscene after you kill off so many

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:00.910 
cutscene after you kill off so many
people<00:00:59.690> you're<00:00:59.840> going<00:00:59.960> to<00:01:00.020> see<00:01:00.199> them<00:01:00.379> like

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
people you're going to see them like

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.520 
people you're going to see them like
right<00:01:01.460> here<00:01:01.820> after<00:01:02.390> cutscene<00:01:02.899> just<00:01:03.140> jump<00:01:03.469> to

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
right here after cutscene just jump to

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.100 
right here after cutscene just jump to
the<00:01:03.770> bottom<00:01:04.100> right<00:01:04.220> here<00:01:04.489> and<00:01:04.670> you<00:01:05.420> got<00:01:05.600> one<00:01:05.990> of

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
the bottom right here and you got one of

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.070 
the bottom right here and you got one of
the<00:01:06.939> trophy<00:01:07.939> yeah<00:01:08.119> I<00:01:08.299> don't<00:01:08.659> know<00:01:08.720> why<00:01:08.840> I<00:01:08.869> keep

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
the trophy yeah I don't know why I keep

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.010 
the trophy yeah I don't know why I keep
calling<00:01:09.560> trophies<00:01:10.600> one<00:01:11.600> of<00:01:11.689> the<00:01:11.780> going

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
calling trophies one of the going

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.719 
calling trophies one of the going
treasures<00:01:12.470> and<00:01:12.860> there's<00:01:13.100> another<00:01:13.490> one<00:01:13.700> right

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
treasures and there's another one right

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.719 
treasures and there's another one right
here<00:01:14.299> and<00:01:14.479> I<00:01:15.320> mean<00:01:15.500> there's<00:01:15.710> like<00:01:15.770> they're<00:01:16.549> all

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
here and I mean there's like they're all

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.850 
here and I mean there's like they're all
crowded<00:01:17.630> together<00:01:17.750> pretty<00:01:18.200> much<00:01:18.350> so<00:01:18.680> they're

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
crowded together pretty much so they're

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.730 
crowded together pretty much so they're
pretty<00:01:19.460> easy<00:01:19.490> to<00:01:19.790> find<00:01:19.939> like<00:01:20.180> I<00:01:20.299> said<00:01:20.740> move

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
pretty easy to find like I said move

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.160 
pretty easy to find like I said move
right<00:01:22.040> along<00:01:22.189> up<00:01:22.549> here<00:01:22.909> I<00:01:23.180> believe<00:01:23.689> this<00:01:23.930> was

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
right along up here I believe this was

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.230 
right along up here I believe this was
like<00:01:24.650> in<00:01:24.680> wave<00:01:25.040> one<00:01:25.070> there<00:01:25.580> was<00:01:25.670> one<00:01:25.700> right<00:01:26.119> in

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
like in wave one there was one right in

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.560 
like in wave one there was one right in
here<00:01:26.509> as<00:01:26.600> well<00:01:26.630> so<00:01:27.229> another<00:01:28.130> pretty<00:01:29.119> easy<00:01:29.330> one

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
here as well so another pretty easy one

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.499 
here as well so another pretty easy one
to<00:01:29.659> find<00:01:29.979> you<00:01:30.979> get<00:01:31.130> this<00:01:31.340> next<00:01:31.700> one<00:01:31.850> after<00:01:32.150> you

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.240 
the fortune hundred mini game and at
first<00:02:06.509> sight<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.140> took<00:02:07.320> me<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.530> couple<00:02:07.590> tries<00:02:08.039> to

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
first sight it took me a couple tries to

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.499 
first sight it took me a couple tries to
actually<00:02:08.369> kind<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.880> figure<00:02:09.119> out<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.360> best

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
actually kind of figure out the best

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.870 
actually kind of figure out the best
possible<00:02:09.840> method<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.500> take<00:02:10.709> him<00:02:10.830> down<00:02:10.860> all<00:02:11.400> the

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
possible method to take him down all the

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.729 
possible method to take him down all the
while<00:02:12.030> keeping<00:02:12.300> your<00:02:12.600> accuracy<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.380> because

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
while keeping your accuracy it because

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.400 
while keeping your accuracy it because
that's<00:02:13.890> what<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.310> was<00:02:14.580> trying<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.880> get<00:02:14.970> at

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
that's what I was trying to get at

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.750 
that's what I was trying to get at
trying<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.470> get<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.590> best<00:02:16.769> accuracy<00:02:17.130> I<00:02:17.430> could

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
trying to get the best accuracy I could

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.089 
trying to get the best accuracy I could
so<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:17.970> could<00:02:18.180> get<00:02:18.300> that<00:02:18.569> uh<00:02:18.650> other<00:02:19.650> challenge

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
so I could get that uh other challenge

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.910 
so I could get that uh other challenge
done<00:02:20.310> get<00:02:20.610> wave<00:02:20.880> 1<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:21.480> 2<00:02:21.660> with<00:02:21.930> sixty<00:02:22.769> percent

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
done get wave 1 and 2 with sixty percent

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.790 
done get wave 1 and 2 with sixty percent
or<00:02:23.190> higher<00:02:23.370> accuracy<00:02:23.850> so<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:25.110> this<00:02:25.380> is<00:02:25.620> what

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
or higher accuracy so that this is what

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.290 
or higher accuracy so that this is what
I<00:02:25.830> found<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.190> best<00:02:26.400> possible<00:02:26.700> method<00:02:27.209> you

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
I found the best possible method you

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.300 
I found the best possible method you
gotta<00:02:27.480> get<00:02:27.720> up<00:02:27.840> real<00:02:28.290> close<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:28.769> him<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.100> get

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
gotta get up real close to him and get

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.550 
gotta get up real close to him and get
