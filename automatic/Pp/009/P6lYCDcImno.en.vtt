00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
how to develop the cap not a calf muscle

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.370 
how to develop the cap not a calf muscle
are<00:00:11.550> very<00:00:11.910> interesting<00:00:12.450> because<00:00:12.960> they're

are very interesting because they're

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.650 
are very interesting because they're
usually<00:00:13.679> underdeveloped<00:00:14.580> because<00:00:15.269> people

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
usually underdeveloped because people

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.390

into you have the top part which is the
gastrocnemius<00:00:30.050> right<00:00:31.050> underneath<00:00:31.289> the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
gastrocnemius right underneath the

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.620 
gastrocnemius right underneath the
gastro<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.399> soleus<00:00:32.880> muscle<00:00:33.210> now<00:00:33.570> i'm

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
gastro is the soleus muscle now i'm

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.840 
gastro is the soleus muscle now i'm
going<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.840> show<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.170> two<00:00:34.980> exercises<00:00:35.520> that

called the soleus muscle all right in

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.799 
called the soleus muscle all right in
order<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.190> left<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.730> developer<00:00:51.210> muscle<00:00:51.570> very

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
order to left the developer muscle very

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.600 
order to left the developer muscle very
important<00:00:52.260> factor<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:53.010> want<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.280> ask<00:00:53.370> that

important factor you want to ask that

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.250 
important factor you want to ask that
muscle<00:00:53.940> tees<00:00:54.059> more<00:00:54.360> work<00:00:54.600> than<00:00:54.780> it's<00:00:54.960> used<00:00:55.170> to

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
muscle tees more work than it's used to

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.500 
muscle tees more work than it's used to
like<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.860> said<00:00:56.160> from<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.489> very<00:00:56.520> beginning<00:00:57.090> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
like I said from the very beginning the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.720 
like I said from the very beginning the
cap<00:00:57.780> or<00:00:58.050> usually<00:00:58.469> underdeveloped<00:00:58.949> because<00:00:59.579> we

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
cap or usually underdeveloped because we

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.369 
cap or usually underdeveloped because we
