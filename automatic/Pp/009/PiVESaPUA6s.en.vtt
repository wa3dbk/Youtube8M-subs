incredibly<00:04:48.599> too<00:04:48.870> powerful<00:04:49.349> I<00:04:49.440> mean<00:04:49.620> there<00:04:50.069> are

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
incredibly too powerful I mean there are

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.619 
incredibly too powerful I mean there are
a<00:04:50.220> few<00:04:50.490> scenes<00:04:50.759> this<00:04:50.940> week<00:04:51.090> where<00:04:51.240> he<00:04:51.270> looked<00:04:51.539> a

00:04:51.619 --> 00:04:51.629 
a few scenes this week where he looked a

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:53.420 
a few scenes this week where he looked a
little<00:04:51.900> surprised<00:04:52.409> but<00:04:52.650> for<00:04:52.979> the<00:04:53.099> most<00:04:53.310> part

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
little surprised but for the most part

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.790 
little surprised but for the most part
he<00:04:53.789> had<00:04:53.909> complete<00:04:54.419> control<00:04:54.599> of<00:04:54.990> this<00:04:55.349> battle

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
he had complete control of this battle

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.589 
he had complete control of this battle
so<00:04:56.159> I<00:04:56.190> really<00:04:56.490> can't<00:04:56.699> wait<00:04:56.819> to<00:04:56.940> see<00:04:57.090> more<00:04:57.360> from

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:57.599 
so I really can't wait to see more from

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:59.809 
so I really can't wait to see more from
him<00:04:57.870> and<00:04:58.110> what's<00:04:59.039> going<00:04:59.219> to<00:04:59.250> happen<00:04:59.610> in<00:04:59.729> the

00:04:59.809 --> 00:04:59.819 
him and what's going to happen in the
