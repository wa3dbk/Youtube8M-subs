00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.290
 great effect 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:15.389
 here we are in the kitchen of the gray 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:18.449
 gray chester just me as ingredients 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.760
 simple the big sense today is not 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.160
 Christmas if you don't cook this attack 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.910
 of the stuffed in the oven and it is not christmas if 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.820
 you don't have a tree so what you need 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.359
 an already clean 34 kg turkey 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.600
 300 g of dried chestnuts 300 grams of 

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:40.079
 apples 300 g of per 200 grams of prunes 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.289
 dried 100 g of walnut oil 50 g of 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.600
 veal pulp 50 g of pancetta 50 g 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:48.149
 of butter half a glass of cognac broth 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.449
 sage rosemary and a glass of wine 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.819
 white salt oil but who knows if mine 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.620
 assistant will have made a tree of 

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:57.780
 I think Christmas certainly has it too 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.620
 nice done let's start the recipe immediately 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.620
 he rejected it 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.799
 already but her 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.190
 hello merry christmas nor fine 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:13.590
 nice compliments but not straighten up 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:15.150
 nothing and therefore nothing today today 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.800
 the tree we start from the chestnut of 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.390
 then dry chestnuts on those 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.770
 let it soften for 12 hours 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.710
 in the water and then we boiled 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.450
 40 minutes prunes and prunes also 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.310
 those on the dry ones did 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.140
 to boil, to give the twenties sat e 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.150
 so is the pancetta 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.400
 we have prepared it 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.950
 cut the veal meat into cubes 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.290
 we made it the china king mandic net 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.780
 clearly now we have to peel the 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.230
 apple and pear and then slice too 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.440
 that 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.440
 be nice 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.690
 today, in short, it's all up to me 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:02:06.490
 here it is and for good 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:11.580
 we add the chestnuts so we put it 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.580
 the pancetta its own 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:32.110
 here we turn seaweed well 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.940
 all of the ingredients we are also fixing 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.940
 a little bit of salt 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:47.730
 here we give from spoon here is here 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:53.830
 let's say there is no retina profile 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:56.560
 mixed effect 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.920
 we begin to fill it having made it 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:11.709
 prepare clean from your friend 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:13.690
 butcher here we are here very well yes 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:24.010
 know then now we go to clearly a 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:26.850
 sew a knot in this way and then 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:37.640
 we give the races also 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:40.140
 so at this point we make it brown 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.370
 five minutes turning it all over 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.550
 then it was butter in small pieces 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:50.240
 lighted stoves we put our aromas 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.240
 sage rosemary 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.210
 but I would say that it is always all we do 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.210
 brown 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:12.170
 let's say that a drop of oil a field of 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:12.170
 so go up above massaging 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:21.620
 let's see so it looks like downhill 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.180
 wine on morning 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:41.930
 no you can't do it today I would say you went 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:46.350
 in today's hot oven in the nine 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:48.540
 we turn off here now three hours in the oven on 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.400
 we use broth to keep it wet then 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.740
 check it every now and then 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:59.970
 the cooking surface is too dry 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:05:06.690
 so let's see the ports in three hours 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:13.260
 provole here is the best thing about it 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:17.520
 water he got there then ready 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:20.010
 understood three hours to three hours is crazy that 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.410
 the mind must be cut served me 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.710
 I recommend the sauce then pour 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:37.770
 on the meat when you cut one 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:40.340
 very special show very well 68 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.340
 let's hope
