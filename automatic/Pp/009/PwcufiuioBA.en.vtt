00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.670 
months they're going to be like down
here<00:05:26.120> because<00:05:26.300> they<00:05:26.690> didn't<00:05:27.050> take<00:05:27.200> that<00:05:27.410> one

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
here because they didn't take that one

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.260 
here because they didn't take that one
to<00:05:27.800> get<00:05:27.890> my<00:05:28.040> bangs<00:05:28.250> like<00:05:28.460> that<00:05:28.670> the<00:05:28.820> last<00:05:28.970> time
