00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.400
 more excited than ever that if horse 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.690
 every year good the thing is that I did 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.669
 a long time that I was not Jorge 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.070
 because because I installed Jorge in his day 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:16.230
 and I deleted all the main map 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.609
 I had an error I do not know why a small 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.859
 I failed and everything that is the 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.000
 map I had gave of my survival and it 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.400
 I deleted all minecraft and I had to 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.750
 restart it and reinstall it and I got angry 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.169
 a lot but good , I've already missed the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.660
 anger 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:30.269
 so now I 'm going to install it and 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.560
 I installed a mod that is fine cinnamon and 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.880
 good as I liked it so much and I come 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.620
 so excited I decided that I'm going to 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.880
 start uploading a new series that 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.350
 going to call minecraft bots 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.550
 where will I teach by the mod that I 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.350
 I found and it's super pimps from minecraft 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.150
 and what can be done with them like this 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.620
 what are we going to see with the first one 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.600
 I suppose that already with the same title already 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.340
 you will know that, rather, as the 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.810
 name of the mode itself indicates what we 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.940
 will allow this mode will be play 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.170
 As some authentic transform we will 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.360
 allow us to transform into 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.830
 authentic war machines destroy 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.600
 everything in our path and be able to fly by 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.910
 aires symbols lot what I was already 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.160
 testing and is for you ip total but 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.780
 well first I want to show what we can 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.920
 do with the various objects that 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.480
 we are going to meet him at the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.280
 world is to say 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.870
 let's find these objects that 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.350
 let's good these are not hidden from 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.910
 here 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.260
 these three objects and with it we are going to 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.630
 have to want to create all the other 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.190
 things that you see here for example you 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.660
 you find the transforming material 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.760
 now they are going to have to transform it into 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.260
 transform um and with this material that 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.540
 you're going to have to make the head the 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.490
 body the feet all the normal course or 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.900
 normal to then be able to create art to 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.580
 the robot armors themselves that the 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.190
 I have saved here but I'm going to 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.720
 teach yet to generate more ip and in 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.430
 here we can see for example some 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.760
 aircraft wing an airplane cockpit 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.220
 also with propeller turbines of all 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.450
 Here we can see everything good one 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.560
 the first things from before he deals with 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.190
 the armor that this is the good thing that 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.110
 have this mod 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.870
 you have to teach this this material of 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.940
 here this is flame display pillar us 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.220
 to allow to put these five small 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.450
 Transformer decorations over this 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.640
 it is simply because to decorate not 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.320
 we look at putting a chevrolet here 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.950
 to put an other sports stroller here 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.360
 a tank stand tank widget and a pair 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.470
 of planes there in plan of this one 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.390
 just to decorate but cool a 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.740
 Look, it's that these are the 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.240
 own transformers in this we're going to 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.709
 transform now you go to fields that 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.150
 we're going to freak out, we're going with the good 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.990
 of the mod that is here within this 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.940
 chest 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.850
 let's see how our things look in 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.220
 first place we have transformers sky 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.870
 strike I do not know who in truth I have not 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.450
 seen does not sound like the movie or anything 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.250
 but I'm going to take things and I'm going to 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.920
 teach how this is going 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:33.120
 I'm a robot do what I order you to do 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.830
 equipped with this whole armor 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.420
 robot and transformer me how is 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.210
 logical and now to see what to do 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.040
 well this robot together with another one that is 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.570
 there I have a hidden one that comes 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.459
 with a special weapon is the weapon of the 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.440
 This robot that is called is a crossbow 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.300
 it's called skies taken the crossbow gong the 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.670
 enercon crossbow of the sky strike 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.800
 that works with nerd crystals with 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.750
 this weapon that makes good apart from your 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.820
 hit so he gets 5 damage does not get 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.310
 a lot to melee but this is what is cool 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.310
 little lamb sheep let's see 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.940
 it's a kind of energy flamethrower 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.180
 that cool a lot goodbye poor donkey and 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.180
 I am on top 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.410
 mola montonazo and let's see now what 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.450
 good what's good what I like the most 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.160
 and attentive to the sound because it comes over 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:26.660
 with sound and everything to fly 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.190
 I'm a plane I'm flying really good 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.520
 good good this is too much this is already 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.520
 too 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.020
 circulate 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:49.720
 already this but good already positions and 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.720
 scattered masses 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:59.480
 I'm bad the next robot 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.680
 this robot is called a purge that also 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.750
 it comes with a special weapon that is the 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.280
 purge catana and with a kind of 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.840
 red thing in the middle of the screen that does not 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.730
 I know what you suppose it will be to simulate 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.380
 the viewer of the robot or something but good that 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.230
 now yes it's great let's kill this 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:18.489
 bow the sword not tested it seems that 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:18.489
 a lot of damage out there 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.480
 account but let's see what we 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.890
 we transform now with this sir this one 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.260
 He knew that the tank will not have paints 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:31.300
 of 70 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:33.870
 if this fires, it is firing if 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.870
 we shoot 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.450
 and shoot balls 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.920
 also ahead so can I can not 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.560
 look ahead walking ahead 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.350
 but good and more or less do the idea 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:55.050
 super I transformed to deny what is 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.310
 good not to fly is not that fly is 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.140
 that has creative mode is worth not what 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.120
 have a survey let's see the 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.710
 next with this so white robot 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.400
 It looks like a fridge with uncle's legs 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.880
 good the house this this robot says 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.740
 it does not have no special but 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.290
 yes it has a cool feature 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.370
 heap that if when we transform 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.760
 we have even up to a liter that I do not know 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.630
 how it is done 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.190
 ok I know how it is done with control and 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.860
 all milk is passed by the goodbye map 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.319
 protesters 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.180
 my mother, my mother, like this this 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:27.530
 it is simply to run we are going to 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.689
 hurry up the map so that we 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.310
 put eight billion fines and 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:32.710
 when is it is not that this does not have 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.939
 a lot so let's see the next 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.949
 This gives me a situation of being a kind 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:38.780
 of police robot something like that but I like 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:40.099
 I like this style more 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.969
 does not have any special weapons either 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:44.680
 the last ones that are simply 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:46.909
 then back to transport or to 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.039
 It is also this other car like the 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:51.050
 previous also has for its liter and 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:53.090
 little more is not simply because this 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.120
 to go full steam on the map and nothing 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.070
 plus 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.660
 well and now to finish then show you the 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.860
 last robot that I have left only you 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.330
 come 5 in this mode is a very 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.500
 tiny but good today so that 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.419
 they are updating it and that they go 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.800
 getting more stuff because it's brutal to me 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:07.229
 I love it and for any fan of the 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.150
 movie will also like this this 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:10.800
 robot is called cloud trap and honors 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.169
 his name is to you 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.120
 Transforms me into a piece of 7 in a 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:17.430
 piece of airplane that cool a come on goes a 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.960
 montonazo but is that not only that this 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.490
 this plane has a couple of 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.169
 special characteristics that is what 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.300
 for me they make it the best robot of all 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:27.810
 and over the most fun one is the 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:31.650
 liter has nitro you can fly to all 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.699
 milk by the map very much and the second 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.729
 is that you can disperse the 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:37.320
 protesters in a beautiful way and 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:40.590
 elegant as it is by throwing 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:43.919
 goodbye missiles goodbye gentlemen 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:46.260
 protesters good and this has been all 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:48.479
 for today's video the truth that has 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:51.539
 I really enjoyed playing minecraft with 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:53.789
 well played models because I had already had 

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:55.650
