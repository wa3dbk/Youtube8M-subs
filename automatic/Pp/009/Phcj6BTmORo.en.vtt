that<00:01:38.070> when<00:01:38.490> no<00:01:38.700> more<00:01:38.940> oil<00:01:39.000> comes<00:01:39.510> out<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.870> it's

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
that when no more oil comes out and it's

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.190 
that when no more oil comes out and it's
just<00:01:40.050> gurgling<00:01:40.970> trips<00:01:41.970> just<00:01:42.330> sucking<00:01:42.960> air<00:01:43.170> in

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
just gurgling trips just sucking air in

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.380 
just gurgling trips just sucking air in
and<00:01:43.380> out<00:01:43.500> that's<00:01:44.130> done<00:01:44.550> then<00:01:44.850> put<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.150> screw

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
and out that's done then put the screw

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.090 
and out that's done then put the screw
back<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.810> there's<00:01:46.410> a<00:01:46.500> little<00:01:46.620> copper<00:01:46.950> washer

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
back in there's a little copper washer

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.060 
back in there's a little copper washer
right<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:48.300> coming<00:01:48.630> close<00:01:48.840> I'll<00:01:49.020> show<00:01:49.200> you

right and coming close I'll show you
look<00:01:50.220> there<00:01:50.430> behind<00:01:50.550> the<00:01:50.820> screw<00:01:51.090> there's<00:01:51.390> a

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
look there behind the screw there's a

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.570 
look there behind the screw there's a
little<00:01:51.690> copper<00:01:51.870> washer<00:01:52.130> don't<00:01:53.130> lose<00:01:53.370> that

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
little copper washer don't lose that

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.460 
little copper washer don't lose that
make<00:01:53.790> sure<00:01:53.940> it<00:01:54.030> goes<00:01:54.150> back<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.840> just<00:01:55.290> put<00:01:55.440> a

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
make sure it goes back in and just put a

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.620 
make sure it goes back in and just put a
little<00:01:55.530> tiny<00:01:55.860> double<00:01:56.220> grease<00:01:56.430> on<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.270> wind

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
little tiny double grease on it and wind

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.840 
little tiny double grease on it and wind
it<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:57.930> touch<00:01:58.200> winding<00:01:58.800> in<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.190> tight<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.580> snap

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
it in touch winding in so tight you snap

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.880 
it in touch winding in so tight you snap
it<00:01:59.880> because<00:02:00.330> that's<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.870> real<00:02:01.050> roller<00:02:01.470> to<00:02:01.740> get

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
it because that's a real roller to get

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.460 
it because that's a real roller to get
out<00:02:02.040> just<00:02:02.520> nip<00:02:02.730> that<00:02:02.760> back<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.330> and<00:02:03.780> wipe<00:02:04.290> it

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
out just nip that back in and wipe it

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.260 
out just nip that back in and wipe it
nice<00:02:04.650> and<00:02:04.680> dry<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.340> there's<00:02:05.640> nothing<00:02:05.970> on<00:02:06.090> there

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
nice and dry so there's nothing on there

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.990 
nice and dry so there's nothing on there
then<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.900> get<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.200> oil<00:02:07.230> that<00:02:07.860> came<00:02:08.099> out<00:02:08.310> and

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
then you get the oil that came out and

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.520 
then you get the oil that came out and
you<00:02:09.030> put<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.420> into<00:02:09.569> your<00:02:09.780> measuring<00:02:09.929> jug<00:02:10.349> and

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
you put it into your measuring jug and

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.470 
you put it into your measuring jug and
you<00:02:10.890> measure<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.280> quantity<00:02:11.820> so<00:02:12.180> you've<00:02:12.330> got<00:02:12.450> a

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
you measure the quantity so you've got a

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.690 
you measure the quantity so you've got a
known<00:02:12.810> quantity<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.590> oil<00:02:13.770> that's<00:02:14.250> how<00:02:14.520> much

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
known quantity of oil that's how much

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.900 
known quantity of oil that's how much
has<00:02:14.880> come<00:02:14.940> out

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
has come out

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.360 
has come out
well<00:02:16.240> as<00:02:16.360> in<00:02:16.540> there<00:02:16.720> is<00:02:16.840> probably<00:02:17.020> I<00:02:17.560> can't

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
well as in there is probably I can't

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.830 
well as in there is probably I can't
guess<00:02:18.670> at<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:19.000> amount<00:02:19.300> but<00:02:19.480> I<00:02:19.540> would<00:02:19.660> imagine

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
guess at the amount but I would imagine

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.900 
guess at the amount but I would imagine
it's<00:02:20.110> less<00:02:20.320> than<00:02:20.500> you<00:02:20.560> put<00:02:20.770> in<00:02:20.860> a<00:02:20.920> teacup<00:02:21.280> it's

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
it's less than you put in a teacup it's

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.310 
it's less than you put in a teacup it's
a<00:02:21.970> very<00:02:22.180> small<00:02:22.360> amount<00:02:22.420> of<00:02:22.690> oil<00:02:22.840> but<00:02:23.050> that

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
a very small amount of oil but that

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.860 
a very small amount of oil but that
amount<00:02:23.680> of<00:02:23.830> oil<00:02:23.950> that<00:02:24.220> comes<00:02:24.610> out<00:02:24.910> that's<00:02:25.720> the

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
amount of oil that comes out that's the

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.660 
amount of oil that comes out that's the
amount<00:02:26.050> of<00:02:26.170> all<00:02:26.320> you<00:02:26.410> put<00:02:26.590> back<00:02:26.770> in<00:02:26.980> really<00:02:27.490> say

the bike up off the ground you need to

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.530 
the bike up off the ground you need to
get<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.620> forks<00:02:35.860> fully<00:02:36.670> extended<00:02:37.270> so<00:02:37.390> there's

take<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.030> cap<00:02:40.270> off<00:02:40.450> here<00:02:40.780> now<00:02:41.440> there's<00:02:41.620> a

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
take the cap off here now there's a

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.840 
take the cap off here now there's a
couple<00:02:41.770> of<00:02:41.890> ways<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.040> take<00:02:42.310> this<00:02:42.460> cap<00:02:42.700> off

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
couple of ways to take this cap off

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.700 
couple of ways to take this cap off
first<00:02:43.450> of<00:02:43.570> all<00:02:43.690> it's<00:02:44.080> an<00:02:44.230> inch<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.770> 3/8<00:02:45.330> bolt

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
first of all it's an inch and 3/8 bolt

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.320 
first of all it's an inch and 3/8 bolt
effectively<00:02:47.710> it's<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:47.920> big<00:02:48.130> metal<00:02:48.730> screw<00:02:49.060> cap

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
effectively it's a big metal screw cap

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.090 
effectively it's a big metal screw cap
and<00:02:49.990> you<00:02:50.080> need<00:02:50.200> to<00:02:50.260> get<00:02:50.350> an<00:02:50.440> inch<00:02:50.650> or<00:02:50.800> 3/8

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
and you need to get an inch or 3/8

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.530 
and you need to get an inch or 3/8
spanner<00:02:51.370> which<00:02:51.460> i<00:02:51.640> think<00:02:51.700> is<00:02:51.820> 34<00:02:52.300> million

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
spanner which i think is 34 million

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.930 
spanner which i think is 34 million
European<00:02:53.140> and<00:02:53.530> just<00:02:53.770> a<00:02:53.890> more<00:02:54.430> in-depth<00:02:54.730> bolt

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
European and just a more in-depth bolt

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.180 
European and just a more in-depth bolt
it's<00:02:55.360> a<00:02:55.390> big<00:02:55.600> old<00:02:55.750> spanner<00:02:56.380> so<00:02:56.680> get<00:02:56.890> that<00:02:56.920> off

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
it's a big old spanner so get that off

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.670 
it's a big old spanner so get that off
you<00:02:57.670> might<00:02:57.850> take<00:02:58.120> this<00:02:58.330> off<00:02:58.570> if<00:02:58.990> it<00:02:59.200> was<00:02:59.230> me<00:02:59.560> and

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
you might take this off if it was me and

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.440 
you might take this off if it was me and
I<00:02:59.770> was<00:02:59.950> doing<00:03:00.130> it<00:03:00.310> I'll<00:03:00.640> take<00:03:00.940> these<00:03:01.120> two<00:03:01.300> bolts

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
I was doing it I'll take these two bolts

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.000 
I was doing it I'll take these two bolts
off<00:03:01.780> here<00:03:02.440> and<00:03:02.590> here

then<00:03:37.930> you<00:03:38.050> put<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:38.320> cap<00:03:38.500> back<00:03:38.740> on<00:03:39.010> now<00:03:39.490> you<00:03:39.550> may

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
then you put the cap back on now you may

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.540 
then you put the cap back on now you may
have<00:03:39.850> to<00:03:39.970> fiddle<00:03:40.180> about<00:03:40.480> it<00:03:41.230> may<00:03:41.470> be<00:03:41.530> that<00:03:42.010> it's

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
have to fiddle about it may be that it's

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.550 
have to fiddle about it may be that it's
quite<00:03:42.790> possible<00:03:43.270> that<00:03:43.960> you<00:03:44.080> can't<00:03:44.290> get<00:03:44.440> that

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
quite possible that you can't get that

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.530 
quite possible that you can't get that
back<00:03:44.770> on<00:03:44.950> easily<00:03:45.430> so<00:03:46.030> when<00:03:46.180> you've<00:03:46.270> got<00:03:46.300> the

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
that changing for call it has to be done

periodically<00:04:52.290> the<00:04:52.560> reason<00:04:52.770> you<00:04:52.860> know<00:04:52.950> you've

periodically the reason you know you've

periodically the reason you know you've
got<00:04:53.250> to<00:04:53.310> do<00:04:53.400> it<00:04:53.550> is<00:04:53.850> because<00:04:54.180> changing<00:04:54.750> four

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
got to do it is because changing four

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.720 
got to do it is because changing four
coil<00:04:55.260> has<00:04:55.620> to<00:04:55.800> be<00:04:55.890> done<00:04:56.040> I<00:04:56.070> think<00:04:56.310> it's<00:04:56.400> every

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
coil has to be done I think it's every

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.540 
coil has to be done I think it's every
two<00:04:57.510> years<00:04:57.540> or<00:04:58.410> possibly<00:04:58.920> even<00:04:59.010> every<00:04:59.310> four

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
two years or possibly even every four

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.190 
two years or possibly even every four
years<00:04:59.730> but<00:04:59.940> four<00:05:00.210> coil<00:05:00.450> must<00:05:00.630> be<00:05:00.840> changed

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
years but four coil must be changed

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.110 
years but four coil must be changed
because<00:05:01.320> it's<00:05:01.590> a<00:05:01.650> hydraulic<00:05:02.070> oil<00:05:02.280> and<00:05:02.490> it<00:05:02.910> does

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
because it's a hydraulic oil and it does

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.730 
because it's a hydraulic oil and it does
deteriorate<00:05:03.690> over<00:05:03.720> time<00:05:03.960> so<00:05:04.350> it's<00:05:04.470> good<00:05:04.620> to

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
deteriorate over time so it's good to

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.900 
deteriorate over time so it's good to
change<00:05:04.919> it<00:05:05.130> because<00:05:05.340> it<00:05:05.430> keeps<00:05:05.550> the<00:05:05.730> back

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
change it because it keeps the back

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.240 
change it because it keeps the back
handle<00:05:06.300> incredibly<00:05:06.690> pretty<00:05:07.650> much<00:05:07.830> is<00:05:07.980> it<00:05:08.160> I

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
handle incredibly pretty much is it I

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.890 
handle incredibly pretty much is it I
