00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.060 
and we're going to install this today
the<00:01:36.260> first<00:01:36.470> thing<00:01:36.590> we're<00:01:36.710> going<00:01:36.799> to<00:01:36.860> want<00:01:36.979> to

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
the first thing we're going to want to

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.940 
the first thing we're going to want to
do<00:01:37.190> is<00:01:37.780> drain<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:38.990> coolant<00:01:39.170> we're<00:01:39.710> going<00:01:39.830> to

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
do is drain the coolant we're going to

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.080 
do is drain the coolant we're going to
get<00:01:40.040> the<00:01:40.130> coolant<00:01:40.430> low<00:01:40.520> enough<00:01:40.729> that<00:01:40.940> it's<00:01:41.030> not

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
get the coolant low enough that it's not

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.719 
get the coolant low enough that it's not
going<00:01:41.180> to<00:01:41.330> leak<00:01:41.479> all<00:01:41.630> over<00:01:41.900> us<00:01:42.020> when<00:01:42.200> we<00:01:42.320> go<00:01:42.470> to

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
going to leak all over us when we go to

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.420 
going to leak all over us when we go to
splice<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:43.790> lines<00:01:44.090> so<00:01:44.990> right<00:01:45.290> here<00:01:45.530> is<00:01:46.130> the

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
splice the lines so right here is the

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:55.940 
splice the lines so right here is the
coolant<00:01:46.790> drain<00:01:48.580> or<00:01:49.580> run<00:01:49.820> chop

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:15.720 

and<00:01:56.950> this<00:01:57.100> just<00:01:57.310> turns

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:26.170 

the<00:02:16.730> core<00:02:24.220> so<00:02:25.220> it's<00:02:25.340> a<00:02:25.370> good<00:02:25.459> idea<00:02:25.579> to<00:02:25.819> do<00:02:26.060> this

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
the core so it's a good idea to do this

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.089 
the core so it's a good idea to do this
when<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.450> engine<00:02:26.689> is<00:02:26.720> cold<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:27.739> when<00:02:27.950> there's

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
when the engine is cold and when there's

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.580 
when the engine is cold and when there's
no<00:02:28.220> pressure<00:02:28.459> on<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.730> court<00:02:28.970> bottles<00:02:29.590> take

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
no pressure on the court bottles take

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.699 
no pressure on the court bottles take
this<00:02:30.739> off<00:02:30.980> so<00:02:31.370> suck<00:02:32.269> some<00:02:32.420> air<00:02:32.540> and<00:02:32.720> drink<00:02:32.930> all

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
this off so suck some air and drink all

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:34.990 
this off so suck some air and drink all
right<00:02:33.769> while<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.159> cooling<00:02:34.430> straining<00:02:34.849> we're

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
right while the cooling straining we're

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.910 
right while the cooling straining we're
gonna<00:02:35.120> get<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.870> filter<00:02:36.170> head<00:02:36.290> installed

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
gonna get the filter head installed

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.009 
gonna get the filter head installed
enhance<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:38.239> flipping<00:02:38.540> head<00:02:38.629> goes<00:02:38.810> right

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
enhance the flipping head goes right

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.699 
enhance the flipping head goes right
here<00:02:39.260> on<00:02:39.920> this<00:02:40.099> bolt<00:02:40.370> so<00:02:40.790> there's<00:02:41.150> a<00:02:41.209> little

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
here on this bolt so there's a little

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.009 
here on this bolt so there's a little
tab<00:02:42.709> here<00:02:42.950> that<00:02:42.980> holds<00:02:43.340> a<00:02:43.659> battery<00:02:44.659> cable<00:02:44.959> on

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
tab here that holds a battery cable on

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.379 
tab here that holds a battery cable on
there<00:02:45.230> when<00:02:45.799> I<00:02:45.829> remove<00:02:46.099> that<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:47.120> then<00:02:47.180> right

there when I remove that and then right

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:48.460 
there when I remove that and then right
below<00:02:47.510> those<00:02:47.750> would<00:02:47.959> be<00:02:48.049> a<00:02:48.079> ten<00:02:48.290> millimeter

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
below those would be a ten millimeter

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:58.449 
below those would be a ten millimeter

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
right now okay next I have the Sinister

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.149 
right now okay next I have the Sinister
:<00:03:07.970> folder<00:03:08.209> head<00:03:08.359> and<00:03:08.510> bracket<00:03:08.840> and<00:03:09.680> if<00:03:09.859> you<00:03:09.980> can

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 
: folder head and bracket and if you can

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.440 
: folder head and bracket and if you can
see<00:03:10.400> this<00:03:10.579> I'm<00:03:11.239> sure<00:03:11.530> there's<00:03:12.530> a<00:03:12.590> little<00:03:12.799> tab

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
see this I'm sure there's a little tab

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.759 
see this I'm sure there's a little tab
that<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.569> bracket<00:03:14.930> fits<00:03:15.139> into<00:03:15.409> there<00:03:15.590> and

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
that the bracket fits into there and

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.890 
that the bracket fits into there and
then<00:03:16.400> we'll<00:03:16.519> go<00:03:16.700> up<00:03:16.730> mount<00:03:17.150> it<00:03:17.420> against<00:03:17.659> where

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
then we'll go up mount it against where

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.180 
then we'll go up mount it against where
that<00:03:18.109> bolt<00:03:18.680> was<00:03:19.090> so<00:03:20.090> I'll<00:03:20.780> see<00:03:21.049> this<00:03:21.230> loop<00:03:22.040> it

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
that bolt was so I'll see this loop it

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:34.679 
that bolt was so I'll see this loop it
around<00:03:22.280> here<00:03:22.669> and<00:03:22.699> put<00:03:22.879> the<00:03:23.000> bolt<00:03:23.180> in<00:03:23.299> there

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:34.689 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:37.839 

and<00:03:35.689> you<00:03:36.170> can't<00:03:36.409> be<00:03:36.500> clever<00:03:36.769> here<00:03:37.010> you<00:03:37.640> gotta

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
and you can't be clever here you gotta

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:39.699 
and you can't be clever here you gotta
put<00:03:38.420> the<00:03:38.540> brake<00:03:38.689> down<00:03:38.870> first<00:03:39.140> if<00:03:39.379> you<00:03:39.439> put<00:03:39.620> the

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
put the brake down first if you put the

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:40.630 
put the brake down first if you put the
coolant<00:03:39.980> folding<00:03:40.250> on<00:03:40.340> there<00:03:40.459> you're<00:03:40.549> not

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
coolant folding on there you're not

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:59.080 
coolant folding on there you're not
gonna<00:03:40.730> build<00:03:55.420> a<00:03:56.769> nice<00:03:57.769> you<00:03:57.920> know<00:03:57.980> okay<00:03:58.819> you<00:03:58.879> can

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
gonna build a nice you know okay you can

gonna build a nice you know okay you can
see<00:03:59.239> that<00:03:59.269> I've<00:03:59.510> mounted<00:03:59.629> the<00:03:59.959> coolant<00:04:00.470> filled

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
see that I've mounted the coolant filled

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.259 
see that I've mounted the coolant filled
their<00:04:00.769> head<00:04:00.920> I've<00:04:01.310> tightened<00:04:01.670> up<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:01.909> bracket

I'll give it a shot okay I ended up just

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:40.810 
I'll give it a shot okay I ended up just
using<00:04:39.470> both<00:04:39.889> my<00:04:40.099> hands<00:04:40.310> because<00:04:40.550> I<00:04:40.639> needed

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
using both my hands because I needed

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.700 
using both my hands because I needed
them<00:04:41.030> to<00:04:41.060> connect<00:04:41.360> these<00:04:41.449> lines<00:04:41.720> up<00:04:41.930> but<00:04:42.620> this

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
them to connect these lines up but this

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.379 
them to connect these lines up but this
one<00:04:42.770> connects<00:04:43.130> into<00:04:43.310> this<00:04:43.430> line<00:04:44.060> right<00:04:44.210> there

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
one connects into this line right there

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:45.490 
one connects into this line right there
that<00:04:44.539> runs<00:04:44.630> from<00:04:44.810> back<00:04:45.020> and<00:04:45.169> forth<00:04:45.320> from<00:04:45.440> the

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
that runs from back and forth from the

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.129 
that runs from back and forth from the
radiator<00:04:45.830> to<00:04:45.889> the<00:04:46.070> overflow<00:04:46.669> bottle<00:04:46.970> I<00:04:47.240> put<00:04:48.110> a

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
radiator to the overflow bottle I put a

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:49.360 
radiator to the overflow bottle I put a
little<00:04:48.260> zip<00:04:48.500> tie<00:04:48.650> right<00:04:48.860> here<00:04:49.010> to<00:04:49.130> hold<00:04:49.280> it

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
little zip tie right here to hold it

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.089 
little zip tie right here to hold it
better<00:04:49.610> but<00:04:49.820> and<00:04:50.060> it<00:04:50.120> fits<00:04:50.330> real<00:04:50.510> nice<00:04:51.099> and

better but and it fits real nice and
then<00:04:52.310> I<00:04:52.430> connected<00:04:52.760> up<00:04:52.880> the<00:04:53.000> other<00:04:53.120> one<00:04:53.300> that

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 
then I connected up the other one that

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.719 
then I connected up the other one that
runs<00:04:53.570> over<00:04:53.840> here<00:04:53.960> to<00:04:54.050> the<00:04:54.139> heater<00:04:54.289> hose<00:04:54.729> it
