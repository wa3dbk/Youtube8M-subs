 returning here to youtube in this 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.480
 I will explain how to make 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.940
 the installation of the nexus 2 with all its 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.400
 expansions that are not asking you 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.689
 a lot here are all the links that go 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.210
 to need I'll leave it in the 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.789
 description of the video and the first thing that 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.429
 I'll explain is that we're going to 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.039
 download by torrent and need this 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:29.259
 program that is called pic torrent is 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.899
 here you open the page from the 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.670
 start i 'm going to do the demonstration 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:35.620
 ok they give you where they say downloads 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.050
 bittorrent for windows will open the 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.870
 window that I already had open and they're going 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.140
 to give where it says free download a 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.570
 Once this starts to download the 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.860
 program as such you are going to give 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.380
 next next next 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.120
 installation is a typical installation 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.300
 once they have the program they are going to 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:59.970
 have something like this now they need the 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:03.540
 torrent here I'll leave the link 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.280
 all these link the sub and myself 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.690
 we are waiting for you advertising this is a 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.100
 protection method that I used to 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.780
 protect the links so that they do not 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.270
 delete me they are going to remove advertising and go to 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.860
 appear the mediafire link once 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.110
 download it, they will download the 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.480
 torrent and then to appear something like 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.940
 what I'm going to show you like this 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.500
 here is the torrent you for 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.560
 download it you can double click or 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.150
 just drag them program here 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.360
 everything is going to come out 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.720
 install this you verify it and they go to 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.119
 see that this the nexus is riding a 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.210
 virtual image then they need a 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.570
 program called daemon tools that 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.760
 Here is the link was also left them 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.430
 so they do not have problems 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.910
 I'm waiting for the advertising four 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.910
 seconds 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.100
 and they will remove advertising according 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.600
 then it will appear 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.939
 is 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.770
 to seem all this and leonard to download 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.069
 they download it is also an installation 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.970
 typical as the vector in next and 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.340
 then you dismount in the image this 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.420
 then to remove an image where 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.870
 you look for the folder where 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:22.620
 they made and let appear something like 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.959
 like this and they need to download 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.920
 Sorry for downloading do not install the setup 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.440
 of the double nexus will appear 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.459
 exactly this then we give it double 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.459
 Click to start the installation 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.220
 and we're going to give this following what 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:42.120
 let's leave by default where it's going 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:47.400
 to be the next nexus folder 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.750
 next perfect was made by the 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.319
 installation has been carried out successfully 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.930
 then they will go local disk team 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.909
 and they will look for the files of 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.939
 probably an oscar the nexus dl 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:02.370
 perfect then they are going to cut it and we 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:05.159
 let's go to imagine line that is the 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.170
 efe folder the studio we open the 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:09.180
 efe study 11 the folder and then the 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.000
 folder that says plugins and then the 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.400
 folder that is going to say be etc 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.280
 there we are going to copy our dll we are going 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.530
 to give continue this way we are going to 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.689
 can open open from the nexus the 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.599
 program now how do we do 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:26.969
 have them the nexus bookstores are going to 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:31.169
 back to your folder that you downloaded 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:34.490
 with the virtual image they will see where 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:37.420
 says nexus content what they are going to copy 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.760
 and we go again 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:45.599
 Behcet the folder is the same where 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.599
 we paste the nexus dl we copy 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.400
 we hope this takes a little bit 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.780
 perfect my people once we have 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:04:00.269
 that we have finished passing it 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.010
 contents of the nexus now we are going to 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.970
 perform the installation of the 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.190
 expansions 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.520
 then how do we go again to 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.160
 the virtual image we are going to expansions 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.870
 nexus 2 and we give you to copy 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.410
 we are going to copy it inside the folder 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:20.200
 of f the study of banknotes 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.080
 bs 3 open the nexus folder 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.910
 content again and there we are going to paste 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.910
 this folder of expansions 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.680
 perfect 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.090
 now that we have this we are going to open 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.090
 the study f 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:48.990
 and let's insert we put more love 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.750
 let's refresh a quick scan and 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.639
 here the link appears and we open it and he 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.010
 will start scanning automatically 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:58.320
 those that come by default but not the 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.000
 expansions I explain then what 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.600
 have to do is go to this little button 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.669
 that says that and that system 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.060
 they are going to give way that I have a 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:11.910
 expansion already installed by default 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.310
 then the woman is imported and we are going to 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:18.180
 have to go and find where 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:20.639
 find our our expansions 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:24.090
 let's go to local disk program files 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:28.530
 let's imagine line efe study 11 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:30.960
 vst plugins nexus content and we're going to 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:34.660
 Nexus expansions these are the 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:37.900
 files that are installed 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:41.770
 I only have two because to do 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.240
 the quick video in English there 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.680
 many very many expansions 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.630
 very many but in this case I'm going to 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.460
 teach how to install only two for 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.190
 make the video fast then once 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.720
 Find him you give him to open the most 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.940
 It is advisable that they open one by one and 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.650
 that are quite heavy and if you do not have 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.540
 a good machine is probably you 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.760
 paste the program and much more if he is 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.010
 the study is cracked then it 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.760
 we are going to open the it is going to scan 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.760
 quickly 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.230
 I have it here ok that error that you 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.250
 they saw this 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:18.300
 it's because I do not have the nexus created 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:21.030
 many times you download him 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.129
 they say that the nexus comes complete but 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.949
 it's false you need another program that I 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:27.720
 I brought them here that is called air licenses 

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:30.150
 but from the nexus exclusively not 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:33.840
 so here I also left the link 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:38.020
 they are going to open it is also protected 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:42.539
 against so they do not erase it 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.539
 and they will remove advertising 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:50.050
 they will download it in the same way and 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.520
 they will appear this then they will 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.720
 double click is very simple 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.720
 they simply execute it 

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.480
 a following install 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.480
 We will wait for you 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:08.370
 and we're going to finish it ok then now 

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:12.009
 let's import the other file 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:14.050
 quickly perfect 

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:16.240
 excuse me that's not an error is this 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:19.550
 indicating that it is correct 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:22.310
 installation then here you are 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:24.820
 already its volume 1 expansions was that 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:28.420
 we install and this one that is here 

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:30.850
 so good my people this was 

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:34.310
 this was the whole tutorial in this 

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:37.809
 I can not show you how 

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:40.789
 that really work because 

00:07:37.809 --> 00:07:42.680
 I have used the card to the plate 

00:07:40.789 --> 00:07:45.139
 sound with the program of qantas and 

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.969
 study that is to record and I do not have 

00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:49.039
 Two outputs to record at the same time 

00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:51.080
 with the fl but I hope that there 

00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:53.330
 served a lot this 

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:56.240
 if you want me to do some other tutorial 

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:57.710
 upload to some other program ask you what 

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.689
 please that I would upload it with much 

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:01.370
 Then, we are talking about 

00:07:59.689 --> 00:08:03.650
 my people enjoy in this great package 

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:05.419
 that was pretty cool pretty 

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:08.860
 complete has very good things and good 

00:08:05.419 --> 00:08:08.860
 I salute my people, take care
