00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.560
 Amigos and wild comeback at the new 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:23.989
 training tutorial today an exercise 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.180
 for the breast 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:30.419
 you see here now a picture of what I am in 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.540
 I have not found internet 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:36.239
 away from that one says yes our chest 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.960
 middle breast above so post inner breast 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:43.159
 outer breast no there is the - and the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.610
 major upper part lower part and dazit 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:49.799
 With this exercise I want in the red 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.059
 area probably too big here 

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:54.540
 is drawn 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.799
 I 've been experimenting with it for a long time 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.280
 Bank postponed 

00:00:55.799 --> 00:01:01.170
 the height of the cable this and that and so 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.890
 I made it with this angle 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.610
 really isolated in the top part 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.060
 to meet the fund and only this one 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.060
 Point 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.760
 the first was at 28 is the height of yours 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:26.660
 Poor ones are now that would be wrong and 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:29.930
 optimal would be adapted to the bank like 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.040
 a right angle one straight 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.830
 be supported 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.979
 take care that this is not a hollow cross 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.800
 fixate you really pushes you in 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.530
 in the bank with the basin then belly 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.640
 easy chat and remain so stable 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:49.880
 I cross over the arms in front and you 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.800
 always see the lower arm is more or 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.550
 less pretty much on this green 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.300
 line 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:59.270
 and so was the ideal point for me 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.070
 the ideal attraction was here 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.310
 most decisive is or what I give you 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.970
 want to show here is the height of the cable 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.580
 So finally he comes from there 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:15.530
 the burden and many underestimate 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:17.390
 the importance of this place you see 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.870
 if not with the poor go down it 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.850
 just below the upper arm of the line 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.190
 set and I did not go deeper 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.440
 down because otherwise I lose the 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.620
 tension in the chest and that attracts me 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.860
 then too strong in the shoulder 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.049
 So people now it's up to you 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.900
 tried tested varies with the 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.650
 heights with the angles for that always that 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.860
 decisive 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.209
 i hope we like best by 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.640
 thanks for turning it on 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.080

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.330

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:56.890
