ago for baraka and didn't have trouble
debt<00:00:19.410> this<00:00:19.710> should<00:00:19.859> be<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:19.980> piece<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.340> cake

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
debt this should be a piece of cake

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.179 
debt this should be a piece of cake
because<00:00:22.140> there's<00:00:22.289> no<00:00:22.410> dashes<00:00:22.680> obviously

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
because there's no dashes obviously

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.640 
because there's no dashes obviously
involved<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:23.820> just<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.689> few<00:00:24.720> pauses<00:00:25.050> and

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
involved and just a few pauses and

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.009 
involved and just a few pauses and
timing<00:00:26.430> with<00:00:26.519> this<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.849> pretty<00:00:27.269> damn<00:00:27.449> easy<00:00:27.630> but

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
timing with this is pretty damn easy but

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.200 
timing with this is pretty damn easy but
anyways<00:00:28.260> start<00:00:28.980> with<00:00:29.070> up<00:00:29.250> for<00:00:29.490> triangle<00:00:29.970> which

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
anyways start with up for triangle which

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.209 
anyways start with up for triangle which
is<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.449> diagonal<00:00:30.810> jump<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.230> then<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.830> triangle

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
is the diagonal jump and then I triangle

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.910 
is the diagonal jump and then I triangle
triangle<00:00:32.399> trying<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.940> put<00:00:33.090> square<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.920> you

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
triangle trying to put square and you

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.860 
triangle trying to put square and you
see<00:00:35.160> already<00:00:35.399> it's<00:00:36.000> starting<00:00:36.390> off<00:00:36.510> just<00:00:36.809> like

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
see already it's starting off just like

and<00:00:42.360> recently<00:00:43.260> Brock<00:00:43.590> actually<00:00:44.010> got<00:00:44.160> buffed<00:00:44.399> a

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
and recently Brock actually got buffed a

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.440 
and recently Brock actually got buffed a
bit<00:00:45.500> being<00:00:46.500> better<00:00:46.770> not<00:00:47.129> worse<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.180> speed

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
bit being better not worse and the speed

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.940 
bit being better not worse and the speed
also<00:00:48.480> got<00:00:48.840> increased<00:00:49.200> including<00:00:49.860> his

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
also got increased including his

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.889 
also got increased including his
uppercut<00:00:50.219> speed<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.969> just<00:00:51.239> general<00:00:51.570> walking

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
uppercut speed and just general walking

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.240 
uppercut speed and just general walking
speed<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.410> dashing<00:00:52.649> speeding<00:00:52.949> everything

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
speed and dashing speeding everything

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.240 
speed and dashing speeding everything
there<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.180> step<00:00:54.449> two<00:00:54.920> we're<00:00:55.920> going<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.070> add<00:00:56.219> a

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
there is step two we're going to add a

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.340 
there is step two we're going to add a
pause<00:00:56.520> back<00:00:56.910> x<00:00:57.120> square<00:00:57.360> another<00:00:57.809> paul<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.170> back

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
pause back x square another paul is back

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.400 
pause back x square another paul is back
x<00:00:58.620> squared<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.370> with<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.210> pauses<00:01:00.629> pretty

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
x squared and with the pauses pretty

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.260 
x squared and with the pauses pretty
much<00:01:01.620> going<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.010> want<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.430> input<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.879> back<00:01:03.059> x

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
much going to want to input the back x

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.969 
much going to want to input the back x
square<00:01:03.600> both<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:04.049> them<00:01:04.199> one<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.619> are<00:01:04.710> about

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
square both of them one that are about

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.260 
square both of them one that are about
in<00:01:05.519> like<00:01:05.700> mid<00:01:06.090> level<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.720> Broca's<00:01:07.590> body<00:01:07.799> and

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
in like mid level of Broca's body and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.490 
in like mid level of Broca's body and
the<00:01:09.270> reason<00:01:09.510> for<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.869> because<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.140> back

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
the reason for this is because that back

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.750 
the reason for this is because that back
x<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> low<00:01:11.430> hit<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.630> kick<00:01:13.049> also<00:01:13.760> so

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
x is a low hit and it is a kick also so

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.929 
x is a low hit and it is a kick also so
that<00:01:15.479> actually<00:01:15.600> has<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.409> lowest<00:01:16.590> hip<00:01:17.070> hop<00:01:17.280> hip

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
that actually has the lowest hip hop hip

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.890 
that actually has the lowest hip hop hip
hawks<00:01:18.210> range<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:19.259> want<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.500> hit<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.770> as<00:01:20.900> late

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
hawks range you want to hit that as late

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.530 
hawks range you want to hit that as late
as<00:01:21.930> possible<00:01:22.110> but<00:01:22.770> uh<00:01:22.830> just<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.820> be<00:01:23.909> safe<00:01:24.180> you

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
as possible but uh just to be safe you

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.570 
as possible but uh just to be safe you
might<00:01:24.720> want<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.020> hit<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.409> just<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.310> mid-level

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
might want to hit it just that mid-level

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.660 
might want to hit it just that mid-level

said<00:01:38.369> before<00:01:38.430> Brock<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.090> actually<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.479> lot<00:01:39.630> more

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
said before Brock is actually a lot more

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.510 
said before Brock is actually a lot more
usable<00:01:40.200> now<00:01:40.350> when<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.799> game<00:01:41.009> first<00:01:41.040> came<00:01:41.310> out

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
usable now when the game first came out

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.010 
usable now when the game first came out
no<00:01:41.759> one<00:01:41.909> used<00:01:42.060> him<00:01:42.210> because<00:01:42.390> he<00:01:42.479> was<00:01:42.570> terrible

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
no one used him because he was terrible

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.830 
no one used him because he was terrible
and<00:01:43.290> now<00:01:44.159> he's<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.820> think<00:01:45.630> he's<00:01:45.720> very

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
and now he's a I think he's very

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.899 
and now he's a I think he's very
underrated<00:01:46.409> character<00:01:46.799> he's<00:01:47.189> very<00:01:47.310> usable

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
underrated character he's very usable

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.450 
underrated character he's very usable
now<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.329> he<00:01:49.259> has<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.409> few<00:01:49.619> safe<00:01:49.860> strings<00:01:50.220> that

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
now and he has a few safe strings that

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.469 
now and he has a few safe strings that
are<00:01:50.520> good<00:01:51.680> but<00:01:52.680> um<00:01:52.860> hopefully<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:54.119> see<00:01:54.360> online

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
are good but um hopefully I see online

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.469 
are good but um hopefully I see online
hopefully<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.320> lot<00:01:55.500> more<00:01:55.680> people<00:01:55.890> using

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
hopefully a lot more people using

the controller as always that enhanced
is<00:02:25.000> not<00:02:25.150> needed<00:02:25.420> but<00:02:25.780> uh<00:02:25.840> for<00:02:26.230> more<00:02:26.410> damage<00:02:26.800> you

whatever<00:02:34.630> and<00:02:35.130> it'll<00:02:36.130> actually<00:02:36.250> be<00:02:36.520> a<00:02:36.820> pretty

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
whatever and it'll actually be a pretty

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.390 
whatever and it'll actually be a pretty
much<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.020> same<00:02:38.230> just<00:02:38.290> starts<00:02:38.890> off<00:02:39.070> a<00:02:39.100> bit

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
much the same just starts off a bit

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.580 
much the same just starts off a bit
different<00:02:39.880> and<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:41.050> reason<00:02:41.320> for<00:02:41.350> this<00:02:41.530> is

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
different and the reason for this is

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.380 
different and the reason for this is
just<00:02:42.190> for<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.370> people<00:02:42.550> who<00:02:42.760> have<00:02:43.090> trouble

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
just for the people who have trouble

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.590 
just for the people who have trouble
remembering<00:02:43.630> combos<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:45.850> timing<00:02:46.210> of<00:02:46.300> it<00:02:46.450> will

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
remembering combos the timing of it will

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.530 
remembering combos the timing of it will
actually<00:02:46.750> be<00:02:47.110> a<00:02:47.350> little<00:02:48.190> harder<00:02:48.730> but<00:02:48.970> just

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
actually be a little harder but just

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.300 
actually be a little harder but just
remembering<00:02:50.140> it<00:02:50.290> they'll<00:02:50.770> be<00:02:51.070> a<00:02:51.100> lot<00:02:51.250> easier

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
remembering it they'll be a lot easier

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.980 
remembering it they'll be a lot easier
and<00:02:51.700> you<00:02:51.730> guys<00:02:51.880> see<00:02:52.240> that<00:02:52.270> when<00:02:52.570> it<00:02:52.660> comes<00:02:52.840> out
