00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
work my way through all the layers so

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.940 
work my way through all the layers so
pinning<00:02:22.780> my<00:02:22.870> hair<00:02:23.050> up<00:02:23.200> like<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:23.590> doing

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
pinning my hair up like that and doing

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.620 
pinning my hair up like that and doing

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.450 
this bit and then pinning it up and
doing<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.870> underneath<00:02:26.380> I<00:02:26.560> left<00:02:26.860> it<00:02:27.010> on<00:02:27.100> for<00:02:27.160> a

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
doing the underneath I left it on for a

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.070 
doing the underneath I left it on for a
quite<00:02:28.030> a<00:02:28.060> lot<00:02:28.270> longer<00:02:28.390> than<00:02:28.570> I<00:02:28.780> should<00:02:28.990> have

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
done actually that's only because my

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.130 
done actually that's only because my
shower<00:02:30.610> decided<00:02:31.150> it<00:02:31.240> wasn't<00:02:31.570> going<00:02:31.750> to<00:02:31.870> turn
