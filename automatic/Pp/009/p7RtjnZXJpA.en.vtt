we're gonna get our wires and we're
gonna<00:01:30.930> make<00:01:31.170> two<00:01:31.350> crimps<00:01:33.380> evenly<00:01:34.380> spaced<00:01:34.680> out

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.130

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
crimps turn it around

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.030 
crimps turn it around
same<00:01:44.220> thing<00:01:44.899> I'm<00:01:45.899> using<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.350> short<00:01:46.619> cord<00:01:46.890> right

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
you can always you can make it to

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.109 
you can always you can make it to
whatever<00:01:52.350> length<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.770> want<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.820> don't<00:01:53.939> want

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
whatever length you want you don't want

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.420 
whatever length you want you don't want
to<00:01:54.210> loop<00:01:54.390> that's<00:01:54.630> too<00:01:54.840> big<00:01:55.049> or<00:01:55.350> too<00:01:55.409> small<00:01:55.680> you

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
to loop that's too big or too small you

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.859 
to loop that's too big or too small you
just<00:01:56.460> want<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.850> loop<00:01:57.030> that's<00:01:57.210> good<00:01:57.420> enough<00:01:57.540> to

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
just want to loop that's good enough to

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.539 
just want to loop that's good enough to
where<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.079> can<00:01:58.229> be<00:01:58.350> able<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.710> retrieve<00:01:59.399> your

weight and pass it pass the line through

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.770 
weight and pass it pass the line through
the<00:02:10.920> way

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
the way

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.230

just<00:02:13.080> like<00:02:13.230> so<00:02:14.930> this<00:02:15.930> decoy<00:02:16.350> here<00:02:17.000> is<00:02:18.000> one<00:02:18.150> of

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
just like so this decoy here is one of

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.830 
just like so this decoy here is one of
the<00:02:18.330> decoys<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:18.870> found<00:02:19.110> on<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.350> field<00:02:19.650> I

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
the decoys that I found on the field I

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.930 
the decoys that I found on the field I
come<00:02:21.840> across<00:02:22.110> them<00:02:22.319> all<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.530> time<00:02:22.740> this<00:02:23.730> one

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
come across them all the time this one

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.940 
come across them all the time this one
here<00:02:24.209> I<00:02:24.240> had<00:02:24.480> some<00:02:24.660> fun<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:24.990> other<00:02:25.080> day<00:02:25.200> found

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
here I had some fun the other day found

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.770 
here I had some fun the other day found
an<00:02:26.069> old<00:02:26.250> flam<00:02:26.490> blue<00:02:26.670> decoy<00:02:27.090> didn't<00:02:27.450> have<00:02:27.600> any

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
an old flam blue decoy didn't have any

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.290 
an old flam blue decoy didn't have any
paint<00:02:28.050> on<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.430> patched<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.730> up<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.600> painted<00:02:31.530> it

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
paint on it patched it up and painted it

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.970 
paint on it patched it up and painted it
so<00:02:33.300> I<00:02:33.330> can<00:02:33.540> turn<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:33.900> into<00:02:34.050> a<00:02:34.170> canvas<00:02:34.380> back<00:02:34.739> to

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
so I can turn it into a canvas back to

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.860 
so I can turn it into a canvas back to
work<00:02:35.130> really<00:02:35.340> well<00:02:35.430> I<00:02:35.880> got<00:02:36.300> two<00:02:36.480> more<00:02:36.630> on<00:02:36.690> my

the crimp and then pass your line
through<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.900> keel<00:02:52.250> if<00:02:53.250> your<00:02:53.489> decoy<00:02:53.820> does<00:02:54.060> not

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
through the keel if your decoy does not

decoys line next thing we're going to do

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.120 
decoys line next thing we're going to do
is<00:03:06.300> we're<00:03:06.390> going<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.540> pass<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:06.959> in<00:03:07.200> back<00:03:07.800> into

real tight you want to leave yourself a

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.830 
real tight you want to leave yourself a
decent<00:03:17.100> loop<00:03:17.549> so<00:03:18.120> that<00:03:18.150> way<00:03:18.390> you<00:03:18.450> have<00:03:18.600> some

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
play in it that way your decoy can be

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.670 
play in it that way your decoy can be
free<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.680> swim<00:03:23.090> so<00:03:24.090> after<00:03:24.450> that<00:03:24.630> you<00:03:25.410> can<00:03:25.530> go

free to swim so after that you can go

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.150 
free to swim so after that you can go
ahead<00:03:25.799> and<00:03:26.070> crimp<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:28.760> two<00:03:29.760> crimps<00:03:31.160> evenly
