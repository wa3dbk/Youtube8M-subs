00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
over so if i come on to make and i can

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.690 
over so if i come on to make and i can
then<00:01:34.259> see<00:01:34.560> some<00:01:34.950> new<00:01:35.070> creatures<00:01:35.460> let's<00:01:35.579> have

that one oops hit his red nose to make

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.990 
that one oops hit his red nose to make
one<00:01:39.229> there<00:01:40.229> we<00:01:40.290> go<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:41.189> now<00:01:41.369> joins<00:01:41.820> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
one there we go and this now joins the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.999

bit<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.360> world<00:01:42.990> field<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.530> we<00:01:43.590> play<00:01:43.770> again

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
bit the world field and we play again

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.889 
bit the world field and we play again
and<00:01:44.250> it's<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.759> sort<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.030> endless<00:01:45.270> runner<00:01:45.570> kind

and it's a sort of endless runner kind
of<00:01:46.020> game<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.860> keeps<00:01:47.009> going<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.549> keep
