00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:14.840
 the radio r 9 280 x direct the top two 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.030
 asus was already considered one of the best 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:21.289
 video cards of the world with the chip 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:24.560
 radeon r 9 280 x from md but the company 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:27.199
 surpassed and launched radeon r 9 280 x 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.939
 matrix platinum model with power of 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.740
 even higher overclocking 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.620
 developed for those who seek to beat 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.230
 records factory plate comes with the 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.989
 working cut at 1100 megahertz mhz 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.640
 above a reference model of yours 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.309
 project with changes not realizing 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.500
 original high quality components and 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.960
 robust cloud system occupying three 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.359
 pci express lots makes it possible to 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.730
 high-end coffee shops offering 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:55.640
 advanced controls for voltages and 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.739
 temperature differentials as other 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.109
 plate has a button called turbo fan 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.140
 who puts his fans working 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:05.570
 in 100% rotation still has the function 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.430
 safe mode to clear the board cuts 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.500
 and buttons to increase and decrease 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.260
 coke making it possible to overclock in time 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.600
 without the need for 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.460
 thanks to the factory settings, 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.180
 faster than the vast majority of 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.430
 radeon hd 6970 ghz models 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.710
 edition as well as being a product intended 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.870
 especially overclockers 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.400
 those who seek to break records is a 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.950
 model that will please a lot to 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.810
 enthusiastic users their connections are 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.710
 different from traditional models with 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.900
 this chip 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.570
 the pacino matrix has six connectors 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.790
 two duties and 4 displayport 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.890
 this way you can connect six 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.850
 monitors through technology to 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.860
 infinity 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.600
 an important detail is that occupying 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.670
 three slots pci express 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.260
 it can generate some limitations with the 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.180
 crossfire technology 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.860
 you can not use it for example 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.080
 as the first video card of the 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.090
 combination without generating a limitation of 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.370
 a maximum of three boards connected in the 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.980
 system even though the motherboard has this 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:07.070
 support for four blue video cards 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:10.280
 radio r 9 280 x matheus platinum is 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.860
 costing $ 380 at launch 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.409
 the price is 80 dollars above models 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.090
 and 70 dollars above the 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:18.680
 direct the top two 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.520
 even though it is a rather 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.560
 differentiated 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.870
 this difference justifies the interest 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.940
 the search for records and do 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.630
 overclocking including 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.630
 Liquid nitrogen
