00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
onto your face I just use my fingers the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.890 
onto your face I just use my fingers the
consistency<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.570> very<00:01:12.780> thick<00:01:14.360> so<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.390> kind<00:01:15.840> of

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
consistency is very thick so I kind of

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.399 
consistency is very thick so I kind of
have<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.080> squeeze<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.619> out<00:01:17.540> so<00:01:18.540> that's<00:01:19.110> what

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
have to squeeze it out so that's what

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.990 
have to squeeze it out so that's what
the<00:01:19.530> consistency<00:01:20.310> looks<00:01:20.520> like<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.820> doesn't

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
the consistency looks like it doesn't

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.020 
the consistency looks like it doesn't
run<00:01:21.360> at<00:01:21.659> all<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:22.470> when<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.860> applies<00:01:23.220> though<00:01:23.700> it

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
run at all and when it applies though it

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.690 
run at all and when it applies though it
applies<00:01:24.930> more<00:01:25.259> like<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> tinted<00:01:26.100> moisturizer

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
applies more like a tinted moisturizer

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.179 
applies more like a tinted moisturizer
in<00:01:27.360> my<00:01:27.540> opinion<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.409> goes<00:01:28.680> on<00:01:30.560> kind<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.710> sheer

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
in my opinion it goes on kind of sheer

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.920 
in my opinion it goes on kind of sheer
but<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.549> can<00:01:32.700> build<00:01:32.939> up<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> coverage<00:01:33.720> I

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
but you can build up the coverage I

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.230 
but you can build up the coverage I
usually<00:01:34.560> put<00:01:34.829> on<00:01:34.979> about<00:01:35.189> one<00:01:35.579> layer<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:36.030> my

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
usually put on about one layer on my

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.130 
usually put on about one layer on my
face<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.930> then<00:01:37.470> I'm<00:01:37.650> problem<00:01:38.400> areas<00:01:38.909> I'll<00:01:39.180> dab

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
face and then I'm problem areas I'll dab

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.190 
face and then I'm problem areas I'll dab
a<00:01:40.170> little<00:01:40.320> bit<00:01:40.650> more<00:01:40.829> on<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.840> blend<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.049> in

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
a little bit more on and blend it in

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.389 
a little bit more on and blend it in
more<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:44.159> does<00:01:44.930> help<00:01:45.930> with<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:47.070> guess

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
more it does help with the I guess

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.940 
more it does help with the I guess

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
wear foundation in the summer because I

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.360 
wear foundation in the summer because I
think<00:04:12.850> foundation<00:04:13.480> is<00:04:13.750> a<00:04:14.530> little<00:04:14.860> too<00:04:15.100> heavy

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
think foundation is a little too heavy

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.980 
think foundation is a little too heavy
and<00:04:15.700> my

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
and my

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.680 
and my
opinion<00:04:16.410> and<00:04:18.620> foundation<00:04:19.620> it's<00:04:20.209> you<00:04:21.209> have<00:04:21.450> to

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
opinion and foundation it's you have to

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.370 
opinion and foundation it's you have to
make<00:04:22.650> sure<00:04:22.680> that<00:04:22.950> you<00:04:23.040> blot<00:04:23.520> because<00:04:24.260> you<00:04:25.260> know

does<00:04:31.500> go<00:04:31.650> on<00:04:31.680> a<00:04:31.770> little<00:04:31.980> bit<00:04:32.190> white<00:04:32.490> but<00:04:32.970> it

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
does go on a little bit white but it

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.350 
does go on a little bit white but it
oxidizes<00:04:33.780> to<00:04:33.930> my<00:04:34.080> skin<00:04:34.500> color<00:04:34.800> and<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:36.090> finish

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
oxidizes to my skin color and the finish

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.680 
oxidizes to my skin color and the finish
that<00:04:36.510> it<00:04:36.630> gives<00:04:36.930> it<00:04:37.490> kind<00:04:38.490> of<00:04:38.610> goes<00:04:38.790> on<00:04:39.090> like<00:04:39.660> a

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
that it gives it kind of goes on like a

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.460 
that it gives it kind of goes on like a
powder<00:04:40.110> finish<00:04:40.530> in<00:04:40.830> my<00:04:40.950> opinion<00:04:41.280> I<00:04:42.170> set<00:04:43.170> a

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
powder finish in my opinion I set a

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.780 
powder finish in my opinion I set a
little<00:04:44.300> make<00:04:45.300> up<00:04:45.330> for<00:04:45.690> ever<00:04:45.870> HD<00:04:46.380> powder<00:04:47.190> onto

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
little make up for ever HD powder onto

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.930 
little make up for ever HD powder onto
my<00:04:48.330> forehead<00:04:48.810> because<00:04:49.020> it<00:04:49.500> does<00:04:49.830> kind<00:04:50.610> of<00:04:50.700> go

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
my forehead because it does kind of go

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.030

does anything over a long period of time
to<00:06:12.870> correct<00:06:13.230> discoloration<00:06:14.130> like<00:06:14.640> it<00:06:14.790> says<00:06:15.000> it

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
to correct discoloration like it says it

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.410 
to correct discoloration like it says it
