00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.820
 not now 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.820
 now 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.150
 what one is 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.150
 190 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.500
 just outside phoenix arizona 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.050
 you will find the museum expand fighter aircraft that has a 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.050
 magnificent collection of historical assets 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.500
 among other excellent examples this model of foc that hulk 190 results 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.700
 Awesome 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.400
 is an immaculate example of one of the largest aircraft of the second 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.390
 World War 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.010
 revered by the pilots of both sides lfw 190 in their manifolds 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.310
 versions rendered service on all fronts where the lupa faith fought from 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.310
 1941 onwards 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.040
 something remarkable about the 190 is that despite its success in principle was an airplane 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.379
 that nobody wanted to be seen as a kind of insurance policy that never 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.379
 should be used 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.249
 but well before the end of the war 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:28.409
 it would become the backbone of the hunting units being 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.809
 constantly improved and modified 

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:35.279
 ados calando general of the hunting weapon of the magnifying glass fe recommended to cancel the 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:38.759
 production of the other interceptors with piston motor to concentrate 

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:42.349
 in the manufacture of the fighter-bomber sw 190 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:47.089
 Great knowledge is needed in many areas and disciplines to 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:49.140
 develop a device like 190 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.069
 and the final result is due to the effort of a work team but if 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.400
 someone can be credited with the success of this model and the effort to make it 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.990
 adopted by the magnifying glass c that someone was short thanks 

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:06.059
 thanks I had already designed aircraft for the seal gulf when this company 

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:09.460
 had tried unsuccessfully to compete against the mythical 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.519
 mixed messer df 109 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.740
 certainly at the end of the 30s 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.150
 the bc 109 was seen as invincible and did not seem to need any substitute in 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.150
 the years that would come 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.489
 aerodynamic and very effective the 109 was a compendium of the most advanced 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.489
 technologies of the time while the less competitive tank design 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.569
 I still had high frost type parasol 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.569
 a concept that seemed to belong to the previous decade 

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:46.169
 in 1937 a great number of times 109 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:49.169
 began to be produced for the digital faith loupe 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:56.349
 after the failure of his first kazakhstan he concentrated on others 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.099
 developments 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.739
 being like a born hawthorn leader other designers and at the beginning of 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.100
 1936 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.129
 had managed to bring together a group of talents that would produce 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:12.529
 one of the most advanced line aircraft of that time lc w200 condor 

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:15.479
 a design that would not have been out of place among the commercial aircraft of the 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:17.259
 postwar period 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:21.859
 meanwhile the needs of the war made tcc w200 will go into 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.599
 service as long-range maritime reconnaissance aircraft patrolling 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:29.149
 over the Atlantic in conjunction with the herds of submarines and there were 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.860
 his only weak point was the weakness of his landing gear 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:48.520
 Another example of tank creativity was the 189 jib nicknamed 'the cuckoo' 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.779
 a twin-engine triplazo of recognition and direct support whose cell that is 

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:55.590
 nothing remembered a flying greenhouse 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.830
 despite its really light structure 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.830
 the boxer showed extraordinary resistance 

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:05.889
 on more than one occasion 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.349
 they returned to their bases, missing large portions of planes and tails 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:12.860
 ripped off with Soviet aircraft that tried to shoot down by collision 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:19.499
 very appreciated by all who flew this simple and effective design 

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:22.689
 would be in service throughout the entire Second World War being 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:25.689
 probably the best of its kind on both sides 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:33.079
 in 1937 the war still seemed far away and in addition to beginning to discover 

00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:35.199
 its tragic followed prosperity 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:38.819
 the third root had brought order and a renewed sense of national pride 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:42.849
 to a nation that had suffered the harsh conditions of the rivers and 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:45.319
 the post-World War I treaties 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:48.529
 which demands a tremendous economic depression 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:52.659
 but now they had a motivation and concrete plans plans a new 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:56.240
 germany with much wider borders and plans for a new europe 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.730
 Much of the success of the messerschmitt df 109 was due I assume ilerdense cake 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:06.979
 600 series a bright engineering sample 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:10.400
 had a configuration of 12 cylinders in inverted v arranged in 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.169
 two lines this design 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:15.430
 followed the trends of the time that considered a long and 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.180
 narrowed it offered a more aerodynamic silhouette that would allow lips to be 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.430
 faster 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.970
 The 600 series was also used in the twin-engine fighter tables vip bs 110 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.490
 Finally, the same advantages of low resistance to advance that allowed 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.050
 gain speed since the design of a fighter is a continuous struggle to obtain 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.050
 higher speed 

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:46.659
 in 1937 the engines relieved and v 

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:50.119
 they were almost universal in hunting planes 

00:06:50.119 --> 00:06:54.449
 the manufacture in singles is used the face and add the one that provided the 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:57.679
 same combination of a powerful engine in an aerodynamic fuselage 

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:03.849
 this is position 141 an American pre-war design that does not 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:07.319
 it would be finally accepted but from which a copy was sold japan 

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:11.610
 subsequently, this model was established, this model would lay the foundations for the 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.229
 own designs of empire houses 

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:17.990
 instead of a linear motor he used the concept of the refrigerated radial engine 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.719
 by air whose foundations were arranged forming a star 

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:23.710
 around the crankshaft 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.350
 - Aerodynamic that the linear radial engines are stars were 

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.830
 despite everything very popular in the American Navy because it was more 

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.979
 reliable and did not need the added complexity of a radiator 

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:37.340
 it was also shorter and so a greater number of airplanes could be 

00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:40.339
 transported on the decks of the aircraft carriers 

00:07:43.119 --> 00:07:46.269
 the pratt &amp; whitney company in particular continued with the development 

00:07:46.269 --> 00:07:50.089
 of the radial engine as an alternative to the more stylized linear motors 

00:07:50.089 --> 00:07:51.979
 refrigerated by liquid 

00:07:51.979 --> 00:07:55.400
 but apart from the iu is my life his main employment was in airplanes 

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.889
 commercials are bombers where speed was not so critical 

00:08:04.749 --> 00:08:08.960
 in the early 30s some of these robust pratt radial engines 

00:08:08.959 --> 00:08:12.369
 &amp; whitney were sold germany being subsequently manufactured under 

00:08:12.369 --> 00:08:12.739
 level
