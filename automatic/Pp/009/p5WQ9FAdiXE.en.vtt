you've<00:04:40.000> got<00:04:40.150> weighted<00:04:40.509> keys<00:04:40.720> which<00:04:40.990> really

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 
you've got weighted keys which really

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
important things that you need when

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.230 
important things that you need when

you're pressing harder you're getting a

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.680 
you're pressing harder you're getting a

louder sound and if you're pressing

louder sound and if you're pressing
softer<00:04:53.110> you<00:04:53.229> get<00:04:53.320> a<00:04:53.349> quieter<00:04:53.770> sound<00:04:53.949> the

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
softer you get a quieter sound the

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.950 
softer you get a quieter sound the

weighted Keys gives you the kind of the

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.689 
weighted Keys gives you the kind of the
hammer<00:04:56.169> action<00:04:56.410> feel<00:04:56.830> you<00:04:57.039> would<00:04:57.160> get<00:04:57.370> if<00:04:57.639> you

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
hammer action feel you would get if you

00:04:57.699 --> 00:04:59.730 
hammer action feel you would get if you
were<00:04:58.030> playing<00:04:58.660> on<00:04:58.810> an<00:04:58.900> acoustic<00:04:59.139> or<00:04:59.440> a<00:04:59.470> grand

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
were playing on an acoustic or a grand

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.089 
were playing on an acoustic or a grand
piano<00:04:59.919> for<00:05:00.250> example-<00:05:01.470> points<00:05:02.470> for<00:05:02.680> this<00:05:02.860> I

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:03.099 
piano for example- points for this I

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:05.909 
piano for example- points for this I
suppose<00:05:03.669> whilst<00:05:04.570> the<00:05:04.810> feel<00:05:05.050> of<00:05:05.080> this<00:05:05.349> is<00:05:05.530> not

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
suppose whilst the feel of this is not

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.740 
suppose whilst the feel of this is not
too<00:05:06.160> bad<00:05:06.340> I<00:05:06.610> feel<00:05:06.940> that<00:05:07.150> there<00:05:07.300> is<00:05:07.330> perhaps

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
too bad I feel that there is perhaps

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.400 
too bad I feel that there is perhaps
just<00:05:07.930> maybe<00:05:08.590> a<00:05:08.680> little<00:05:09.009> bit<00:05:09.340> to<00:05:09.699> wait<00:05:10.410> maybe

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
just maybe a little bit to wait maybe

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.080 
just maybe a little bit to wait maybe
personally<00:05:11.919> for<00:05:12.099> me<00:05:12.190> that<00:05:12.370> I<00:05:12.400> feel<00:05:12.820> there's<00:05:13.060> a

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
personally for me that I feel there's a

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.820 
personally for me that I feel there's a
little<00:05:13.150> bit<00:05:13.330> to<00:05:13.509> weight<00:05:13.780> behind<00:05:13.960> too<00:05:14.650> much

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
little bit to weight behind too much

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.830 
little bit to weight behind too much
weight<00:05:15.039> behind<00:05:15.220> the<00:05:15.460> keys<00:05:15.699> so<00:05:16.210> it<00:05:16.300> feels<00:05:16.510> quite

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
weight behind the keys so it feels quite

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.930 
weight behind the keys so it feels quite
heavy<00:05:17.260> so<00:05:17.289> I<00:05:17.770> suppose<00:05:18.400> what<00:05:18.550> I<00:05:18.610> mean<00:05:18.760> by<00:05:18.909> that

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
heavy so I suppose what I mean by that

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.820 
heavy so I suppose what I mean by that
when<00:05:19.120> I'm<00:05:19.419> when<00:05:19.780> I'm<00:05:19.870> playing<00:05:20.139> when<00:05:20.740> I'm

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
when I'm when I'm playing when I'm

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.640 
when I'm when I'm playing when I'm
playing<00:05:21.070> the<00:05:21.250> notes<00:05:22.199> when<00:05:23.199> I'm<00:05:23.289> putting

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
playing the notes when I'm putting

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.330 
playing the notes when I'm putting
putting<00:05:24.039> some<00:05:24.280> chords<00:05:24.610> down<00:05:24.789> or<00:05:24.940> some<00:05:25.090> notes

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
putting some chords down or some notes

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.189 
putting some chords down or some notes
and<00:05:27.340> finding<00:05:27.729> it<00:05:27.820> quite<00:05:27.849> hard<00:05:28.479> to<00:05:28.599> push<00:05:28.930> the

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 
and finding it quite hard to push the

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:30.480 
and finding it quite hard to push the
keys<00:05:29.380> all<00:05:29.560> the<00:05:29.710> way<00:05:29.800> to<00:05:29.860> the<00:05:30.039> bottom<00:05:30.310> before

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
keys all the way to the bottom before

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.279 
keys all the way to the bottom before
they<00:05:30.729> need<00:05:30.820> to<00:05:30.940> come<00:05:31.120> back<00:05:31.270> up<00:05:31.419> again<00:05:31.570> so<00:05:31.870> you

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
they need to come back up again so you

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:33.870 
they need to come back up again so you
might<00:05:32.590> find<00:05:32.770> if<00:05:32.949> you're<00:05:33.070> doing<00:05:33.280> quite<00:05:33.400> quite

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
might find if you're doing quite quite

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.200 
might find if you're doing quite quite
quite<00:05:34.949> intricate<00:05:35.949> finger<00:05:36.729> work<00:05:36.909> with<00:05:37.090> you're

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
quite intricate finger work with you're

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.610 
quite intricate finger work with you're
doing<00:05:37.330> chromatic<00:05:37.720> scales<00:05:38.110> whatever<00:05:38.440> it<00:05:38.530> is

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
doing chromatic scales whatever it is

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.230 
doing chromatic scales whatever it is
you<00:05:38.770> might<00:05:38.949> find<00:05:39.250> those<00:05:39.460> just<00:05:39.789> that<00:05:39.970> there's<00:05:40.120> a

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
you might find those just that there's a

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.879 
you might find those just that there's a
little<00:05:40.599> bit<00:05:40.750> harder<00:05:41.080> in<00:05:41.169> your<00:05:41.199> fingers<00:05:41.590> having

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:41.889 
little bit harder in your fingers having

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:43.770 
little bit harder in your fingers having
to<00:05:41.979> work<00:05:42.130> harder<00:05:42.610> to<00:05:43.060> kind<00:05:43.270> of<00:05:43.330> get<00:05:43.479> the<00:05:43.570> keys

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
to work harder to kind of get the keys

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.080 
to work harder to kind of get the keys
down<00:05:43.990> so<00:05:44.320> I<00:05:44.530> think<00:05:45.190> there's<00:05:45.550> just<00:05:45.729> a<00:05:45.820> little

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
down so I think there's just a little

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.450 
down so I think there's just a little
bit<00:05:46.389> too<00:05:46.659> much<00:05:46.840> weight<00:05:47.080> behind<00:05:47.349> them<00:05:47.560> but

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
bit too much weight behind them but

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.879 
bit too much weight behind them but
other<00:05:48.610> than<00:05:48.849> that<00:05:48.909> the<00:05:49.300> the<00:05:49.750> overall<00:05:50.050> feel<00:05:50.530> is

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
other than that the the overall feel is

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:52.890 
other than that the the overall feel is
is<00:05:51.340> quite<00:05:51.699> no<00:05:51.880> so<00:05:52.180> I<00:05:52.210> know<00:05:52.479> it<00:05:52.599> sounds<00:05:52.780> a<00:05:52.810> bit

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
is quite no so I know it sounds a bit

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.560 
is quite no so I know it sounds a bit
silly<00:05:53.110> but<00:05:53.380> the<00:05:54.190> keys<00:05:54.370> don't<00:05:54.580> feel<00:05:54.880> cheap<00:05:55.330> and

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
silly but the keys don't feel cheap and

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.600 
silly but the keys don't feel cheap and
plasticky<00:05:56.139> where<00:05:56.320> some<00:05:56.560> of<00:05:56.590> them<00:05:56.770> do<00:05:56.949> and<00:05:57.310> the

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
plasticky where some of them do and the

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.610 
plasticky where some of them do and the
little<00:05:58.210> lip<00:05:58.449> that<00:05:58.690> kind<00:05:58.930> of<00:05:59.050> sticks<00:05:59.320> out<00:05:59.470> at

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
little lip that kind of sticks out at

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.490 
little lip that kind of sticks out at
the<00:05:59.710> end<00:05:59.860> there<00:06:00.130> that<00:06:00.159> kind<00:06:00.669> of<00:06:00.729> doesn't<00:06:00.909> feel

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
the end there that kind of doesn't feel

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.200 
the end there that kind of doesn't feel
like<00:06:02.500> it<00:06:02.680> cuts<00:06:02.889> in<00:06:03.099> too<00:06:03.520> much<00:06:03.699> like<00:06:03.970> some<00:06:04.150> of

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
like it cuts in too much like some of

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.180 
like it cuts in too much like some of
the<00:06:04.270> other<00:06:04.389> ones<00:06:04.599> do<00:06:04.780> so<00:06:04.930> it<00:06:05.050> has<00:06:05.199> a<00:06:05.229> nice<00:06:05.590> has<00:06:06.159> a

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
the other ones do so it has a nice has a

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.999 
the other ones do so it has a nice has a
nice<00:06:06.430> feel<00:06:06.759> to<00:06:06.789> it<00:06:07.470> but<00:06:08.470> yeah<00:06:08.590> just<00:06:08.800> probably

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:09.009 
nice feel to it but yeah just probably

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:10.800 
nice feel to it but yeah just probably
just<00:06:09.130> a<00:06:09.280> little<00:06:09.460> bit<00:06:09.550> too<00:06:09.699> much<00:06:09.880> weight<00:06:10.120> so

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
just a little bit too much weight so

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.140 
just a little bit too much weight so
overall<00:06:11.380> I<00:06:11.770> would<00:06:12.009> recommend<00:06:12.520> this<00:06:12.789> for<00:06:13.060> the

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150 
overall I would recommend this for the

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.230 
overall I would recommend this for the
price<00:06:13.389> for<00:06:14.380> 300<00:06:14.949> pound<00:06:15.159> this<00:06:15.610> really<00:06:16.120> isn't

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
price for 300 pound this really isn't

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.300 
price for 300 pound this really isn't
bad<00:06:16.479> it's<00:06:16.630> a<00:06:16.750> nice<00:06:16.960> entry<00:06:17.470> level<00:06:17.740> as<00:06:17.860> well<00:06:18.009> if

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
bad it's a nice entry level as well if

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.370 
bad it's a nice entry level as well if
you're<00:06:18.430> moving<00:06:18.669> from<00:06:18.880> a<00:06:19.300> keyboard<00:06:19.539> then<00:06:20.259> you

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
you're moving from a keyboard then you

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.810 
you're moving from a keyboard then you
want<00:06:20.560> to<00:06:20.710> get<00:06:20.830> yourself<00:06:21.130> a<00:06:21.279> nice<00:06:21.370> digital

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:21.820 
want to get yourself a nice digital

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.360 
want to get yourself a nice digital
piano<00:06:22.060> of<00:06:22.210> some<00:06:22.419> sort<00:06:22.690> 300<00:06:23.529> pound<00:06:23.710> isn't<00:06:24.010> too

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
piano of some sort 300 pound isn't too

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.040 
piano of some sort 300 pound isn't too
unreasonable<00:06:24.729> at<00:06:25.120> all<00:06:25.330> it's

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050 
unreasonable at all it's

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.659 
unreasonable at all it's
probably<00:06:26.349> about<00:06:26.740> the<00:06:26.949> cheapest<00:06:27.400> that<00:06:27.550> you

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:27.669 
probably about the cheapest that you

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:29.790 
probably about the cheapest that you
will<00:06:27.819> pay<00:06:28.000> to<00:06:28.599> get<00:06:28.750> something<00:06:29.169> like<00:06:29.289> a<00:06:29.319> digital

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
will pay to get something like a digital

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.850 
will pay to get something like a digital
piano<00:06:30.060> full-size<00:06:31.060> weighted<00:06:31.840> top<00:06:32.169> sensitivity

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:32.860 
piano full-size weighted top sensitivity

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.409 
piano full-size weighted top sensitivity
with<00:06:33.159> maybe<00:06:33.400> a<00:06:33.490> few<00:06:33.729> other<00:06:33.879> little

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:34.419 
with maybe a few other little

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:36.210 
with maybe a few other little
accessories<00:06:34.990> as<00:06:35.139> well<00:06:35.169> that<00:06:35.860> go<00:06:36.009> with<00:06:36.159> the

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:36.220 
accessories as well that go with the

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.820 
accessories as well that go with the
piano<00:06:36.370> so<00:06:37.210> this<00:06:37.629> would<00:06:37.810> suit<00:06:38.020> an<00:06:38.139> intermediate

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 
piano so this would suit an intermediate

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.430 
piano so this would suit an intermediate
person<00:06:39.310> as<00:06:39.669> well<00:06:39.879> I<00:06:40.659> don't<00:06:41.050> think<00:06:41.259> it<00:06:41.349> would

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 
person as well I don't think it would

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.510 
person as well I don't think it would
take<00:06:41.620> you<00:06:41.650> probably<00:06:41.919> any<00:06:42.159> higher<00:06:42.370> than

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 
take you probably any higher than

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.369 
take you probably any higher than
intermedia<00:06:43.090> by<00:06:43.389> the<00:06:43.449> time<00:06:43.690> you<00:06:43.870> got<00:06:44.020> to<00:06:44.199> more

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:44.379 
intermedia by the time you got to more

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:46.290 
intermedia by the time you got to more
advanced<00:06:44.650> level<00:06:45.069> you'd<00:06:45.460> probably<00:06:45.759> want<00:06:46.150> to<00:06:46.210> be

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
advanced level you'd probably want to be

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.809 
advanced level you'd probably want to be
playing<00:06:46.539> on<00:06:46.690> something<00:06:47.229> else<00:06:47.580> having<00:06:48.580> said
