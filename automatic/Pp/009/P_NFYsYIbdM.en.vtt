drive but none of them are on and then

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.410 
drive but none of them are on and then
it<00:02:37.840> goes<00:02:37.960> into<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.490> master<00:02:39.490> which<00:02:39.910> everything

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
it goes into a master which everything

00:02:40.420 --> 00:03:01.509 
it goes into a master which everything
is<00:02:40.450> taken<00:02:40.780> out<00:02:40.900> of<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.050> loop<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:42.220> it's<00:02:42.760> just

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
volumes at about noon these two inputs

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.970 
volumes at about noon these two inputs
I<00:03:06.120> think<00:03:06.300> ones<00:03:06.480> hide<00:03:06.690> one<00:03:07.019> is<00:03:07.140> low<00:03:07.349> I<00:03:07.620> don't

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
I think ones hide one is low I don't

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.229 
I think ones hide one is low I don't
notice<00:03:08.069> much<00:03:08.370> of<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.550> difference<00:03:08.580> let's<00:03:09.090> see

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
notice much of a difference let's see

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:28.089 
notice much of a difference let's see
what<00:03:09.420> we<00:03:09.480> got

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:48.650 

got<00:03:28.700> some<00:03:28.879> crap<00:03:29.510> going<00:03:29.810> on<00:03:29.900> there

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.270 

it's<00:03:49.660> got<00:03:49.810> some<00:03:50.050> noise<00:03:50.530> in<00:03:50.860> there<00:03:51.010> may<00:03:51.250> be

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
it's got some noise in there may be

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.770 
it's got some noise in there may be
easily<00:03:51.700> cleaned<00:03:52.000> out<00:03:52.120> or<00:03:52.270> something<00:03:52.600> I'm<00:03:52.690> not

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:11.930 

let's<00:04:04.480> go<00:04:04.600> back<00:04:04.780> to<00:04:04.900> the<00:04:04.990> long<00:04:05.110> that<00:04:06.870> problems

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.300 

just<00:04:12.940> really<00:04:13.330> clear<00:04:13.660> it's<00:04:14.230> awesome<00:04:14.709> super

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
just really clear it's awesome super

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.030 
just really clear it's awesome super
loud<00:04:15.459> though<00:04:15.700> that's<00:04:15.910> gonna<00:04:16.060> be<00:04:16.269> something

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
loud though that's gonna be something

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.080 
loud though that's gonna be something
right<00:04:18.040> now<00:04:18.190> the<00:04:18.250> master<00:04:18.640> of<00:04:18.700> all<00:04:18.790> them<00:04:18.910> if<00:04:19.000> you

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
right now the master of all them if you

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.509 
right now the master of all them if you
can<00:04:19.269> see<00:04:19.510> it<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:20.530> master<00:04:20.829> volume<00:04:21.010> in<00:04:21.310> the<00:04:21.370> back

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
can see it the master volume in the back

00:04:21.519 --> 00:05:08.550 
can see it the master volume in the back
looks<00:04:21.760> like<00:04:21.850> that<00:04:23.010> so<00:04:24.010> I<00:04:24.040> have<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:25.590> preamp

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:37.220 

this<00:05:08.680> is<00:05:08.880> will<00:05:09.880> drive<00:05:10.090> now<00:05:10.300> full<00:05:10.570> drive<00:05:10.840> off
