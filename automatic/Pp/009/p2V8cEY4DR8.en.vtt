biology<00:05:26.780> class<00:05:27.020> where<00:05:27.320> a<00:05:27.500> cell<00:05:28.160> is<00:05:28.400> splitting

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
biology class where a cell is splitting

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.360 
biology class where a cell is splitting
into<00:05:28.940> two<00:05:29.270> and<00:05:30.050> that's<00:05:30.530> exactly<00:05:31.070> you<00:05:31.220> have<00:05:31.250> to

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
into two and that's exactly you have to

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.820 
into two and that's exactly you have to
do<00:05:31.550> just<00:05:31.790> keep<00:05:32.000> dashing<00:05:32.840> it's<00:05:33.470> kind<00:05:33.800> of

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
do just keep dashing it's kind of

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:34.900 
do just keep dashing it's kind of
difficult<00:05:34.220> because<00:05:34.280> you<00:05:34.430> got<00:05:34.580> to<00:05:34.700> get<00:05:34.760> it

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
difficult because you got to get it

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.610 
difficult because you got to get it
perfectly<00:05:35.360> aligned<00:05:35.750> right<00:05:36.080> in<00:05:36.260> the<00:05:36.350> middle

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
perfectly aligned right in the middle

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.680 
perfectly aligned right in the middle
but<00:05:37.100> eventually<00:05:37.400> it<00:05:37.790> will<00:05:37.820> split<00:05:38.300> into<00:05:38.540> two

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
but eventually it will split into two

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.500 
but eventually it will split into two
and<00:05:39.110> at<00:05:39.710> this<00:05:39.860> point<00:05:40.100> you<00:05:40.670> want<00:05:40.970> to<00:05:41.090> equip

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
and at this point you want to equip

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.930 
and at this point you want to equip
rocks<00:05:42.200> feather<00:05:42.530> because<00:05:42.830> every<00:05:43.340> time<00:05:43.550> one<00:05:43.820> of

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
rocks feather because every time one of

rocks feather because every time one of
the<00:05:44.030> eyes<00:05:44.210> falls<00:05:44.720> if<00:05:45.350> it<00:05:45.590> hits<00:05:45.830> the<00:05:46.010> ground

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
the eyes falls if it hits the ground

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.940 
the eyes falls if it hits the ground
link<00:05:47.000> will<00:05:47.240> get<00:05:47.450> stunned<00:05:47.810> and<00:05:48.110> there's<00:05:48.620> a<00:05:48.710> high

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
link will get stunned and there's a high

link will get stunned and there's a high
chance<00:05:48.980> that<00:05:49.400> slime<00:05:50.060> eyes<00:05:50.270> will<00:05:50.510> fall<00:05:50.930> on<00:05:51.110> top

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
chance that slime eyes will fall on top

whatever it drops to the ground jump and
