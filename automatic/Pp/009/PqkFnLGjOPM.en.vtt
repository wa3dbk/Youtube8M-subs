00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.789 
does that by using peptides we hear
peptides<00:01:42.570> all<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.840> time<00:01:42.990> yeah<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> lot<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.530> the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
peptides all the time yeah a lot of the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.350 
peptides all the time yeah a lot of the
over-the-counter<00:01:44.159> skincare<00:01:44.640> products<00:01:45.240> are

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
over-the-counter skincare products are

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.880 
over-the-counter skincare products are
now<00:01:45.450> advertising<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.200> they<00:01:46.350> have<00:01:46.530> peptides

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
now advertising that they have peptides

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.230 
now advertising that they have peptides
and<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.369> an<00:01:47.490> important<00:01:47.909> point<00:01:48.119> that

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
and this is an important point that

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.929 
and this is an important point that
differentiates<00:01:49.049> lift<00:01:49.680> SP<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.159> SP<00:01:50.490> beauty<00:01:50.820> is

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
differentiates lift SP and SP beauty is

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.330 
differentiates lift SP and SP beauty is
that<00:01:51.240> we<00:01:51.570> use<00:01:51.810> high<00:01:52.170> concentrations<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.189> these

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
that we use high concentrations of these

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.889 
that we use high concentrations of these
peptides<00:01:53.610> maybe<00:01:54.060> four<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.479> five<00:01:54.659> times

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
peptides maybe four to five times

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.270 
peptides maybe four to five times
stronger<00:01:55.290> than<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.710> available<00:01:55.799> in<00:01:56.189> the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
stronger than is available in the

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
of using one or two of these peptides we

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.179 
of using one or two of these peptides we
use<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.509> six<00:02:00.869> most<00:02:01.200> potent<00:02:01.710> peptides<00:02:02.070> that

use the six most potent peptides that
are<00:02:02.340> known<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.820> what<00:02:03.360> these<00:02:03.509> peptides<00:02:03.780> do<00:02:04.259> is

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
are known and what these peptides do is

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.920 
are known and what these peptides do is
they<00:02:04.799> stimulate<00:02:05.399> collagen<00:02:05.689> underneath<00:02:06.689> those

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
they stimulate collagen underneath those

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.169 
they stimulate collagen underneath those
wrinkles<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.500> fill<00:02:07.799> them<00:02:08.009> in<00:02:08.039> plus<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:09.030> helps

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
wrinkles to fill them in plus it helps

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.449 
wrinkles to fill them in plus it helps
relax<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.810> muscles<00:02:10.259> in<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.530> face<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:11.190> kind<00:02:11.400> of

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
relax the muscles in the face to kind of

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.130 
relax the muscles in the face to kind of
reduce<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.970> wrinkling<00:02:12.270> that<00:02:12.480> way

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
reduce the wrinkling that way

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.230 
reduce the wrinkling that way
