00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
fit in unless you pull this back then

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.310 
fit in unless you pull this back then
you<00:01:01.739> can<00:01:01.890> close<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.340> top<00:01:02.550> thing<00:01:02.930> I'll<00:01:03.930> explain

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
you can close the top thing I'll explain

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.090 
you can close the top thing I'll explain
how<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.739> works<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.159> just<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.489> second<00:01:07.010> one<00:01:08.010> of

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
how this works in just a second one of

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.740 
how this works in just a second one of
the<00:01:08.189> hardest<00:01:08.549> things<00:01:08.790> about<00:01:08.909> designing<00:01:09.450> this

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
the hardest things about designing this

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.530 
the hardest things about designing this
is<00:01:09.960> when<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.680> put<00:01:10.860> three<00:01:11.130> balls<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.760> all<00:01:12.150> then

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
is when you put three balls and all then

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.060 
is when you put three balls and all then
we'll<00:01:12.659> just<00:01:12.840> fall<00:01:13.049> down<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.530> be<00:01:13.590> launched<00:01:13.979> at

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
we'll just fall down and be launched at

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.859 
we'll just fall down and be launched at
the<00:01:14.159> same<00:01:14.400> time<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.970> didn't<00:01:15.570> want<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.750> to

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
the same time I didn't want that to

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.090 
the same time I didn't want that to
happen<00:01:16.049> that's<00:01:17.009> why<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.520> add<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:19.100> what

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
happen that's why I add it in this what

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.090 
happen that's why I add it in this what
does<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.640> we<00:01:20.790> set<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> balls<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.659> there<00:01:22.100> that

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
does is we set the balls in there that

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.249 
does is we set the balls in there that
this<00:01:23.460> piece<00:01:23.729> will<00:01:24.090> push<00:01:24.360> them<00:01:24.540> one<00:01:24.750> at<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.930> time

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
this piece will push them one at a time

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:36.240 
this piece will push them one at a time
down<00:01:26.040> into<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> barrel<00:01:30.439> like<00:01:31.439> so

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250
