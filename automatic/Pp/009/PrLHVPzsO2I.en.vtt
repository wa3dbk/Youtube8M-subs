cupcakes ever now do this I also need a

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.939 
cupcakes ever now do this I also need a
quarter<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.670> cup<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.090> flour<00:00:55.079> just

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
all-purpose flour goes in here and then

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.280 
all-purpose flour goes in here and then
give<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.870> stir<00:01:02.539> it's<00:01:03.539> really<00:01:03.899> important

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
give it a stir it's really important

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.719 
give it a stir it's really important
that<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.409> cream<00:01:04.739> cheese<00:01:04.769> be<00:01:05.220> at<00:01:05.460> room

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
that that cream cheese be at room

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.240 
that that cream cheese be at room
temperature<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:06.990> it's<00:01:07.290> easy<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.740> combine

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
temperature so that it's easy to combine

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.310 
temperature so that it's easy to combine
all<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.580> those<00:01:09.090> dry<00:01:09.390> ingredients<00:01:10.140> together

all of those dry ingredients together

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.710 
all of those dry ingredients together
now<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.280> reason<00:01:11.700> why<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.850> added<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.420> extra

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
now the reason why I added the extra

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.740 
now the reason why I added the extra
flour<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.890> because<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.820> liquid<00:01:15.390> with<00:01:15.720> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
flour is because the liquid with the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.719 
flour is because the liquid with the
extract<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.799> egg<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.250> gonna<00:01:17.400> make<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
extract and that egg is gonna make the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.280 
extract and that egg is gonna make the
dough<00:01:17.880> too<00:01:17.939> soft<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.750> need<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.990> keep<00:01:19.170> this

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
dough too soft and you need to keep this

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.200 
dough too soft and you need to keep this
