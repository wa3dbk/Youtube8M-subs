so<00:03:06.870> much<00:03:07.319> when<00:03:08.190> I<00:03:08.220> launched<00:03:08.640> shake<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:08.940> photo

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
so much when I launched shake it photo

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.789 
so much when I launched shake it photo
for<00:03:09.329> the<00:03:09.360> first<00:03:09.629> couple<00:03:09.750> of<00:03:09.900> times<00:03:09.989> I<00:03:10.379> realized

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
for the first couple of times I realized

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.319 
for the first couple of times I realized
right<00:03:10.980> away<00:03:11.040> that<00:03:11.250> their<00:03:11.670> user<00:03:11.879> interface

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
right away that their user interface

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.360 
right away that their user interface
could<00:03:12.540> use<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:12.720> little<00:03:12.989> work<00:03:13.139> it's<00:03:13.739> not<00:03:13.920> obvious

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
could use a little work it's not obvious

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.770 
could use a little work it's not obvious
that<00:03:14.549> you<00:03:14.609> have<00:03:14.760> an<00:03:14.880> alternate<00:03:15.269> option<00:03:15.630> than

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
that you have an alternate option than

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.030 
that you have an alternate option than
using<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.139> camera<00:03:16.350> which<00:03:16.709> is<00:03:16.829> the<00:03:16.920> default

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
using the camera which is the default

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.099 
using the camera which is the default
you'll<00:03:17.730> have<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:18.030> hit<00:03:18.150> cancel<00:03:18.389> first<00:03:18.810> again<00:03:19.019> an

you'll have to hit cancel first again an

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
little impatient i guess if developers

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.240 
little impatient i guess if developers
thought<00:04:02.470> this<00:04:02.650> might<00:04:02.770> happen<00:04:02.920> because

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
thought this might happen because

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.590 
thought this might happen because
there's<00:04:03.640> a<00:04:03.700> preference<00:04:04.060> setting<00:04:04.390> that<00:04:04.480> allows

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
for fast shaking or quick processing

for fast shaking or quick processing
nice<00:04:07.390> huh<00:04:07.660> i<00:04:07.930> think<00:04:08.470> that<00:04:08.590> this<00:04:08.680> satisfies<00:04:09.220> a

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
nice huh i think that this satisfies a

nice huh i think that this satisfies a

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
there's more to be desired in terms of

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.640 
there's more to be desired in terms of
features<00:04:16.480> so<00:04:16.750> I<00:04:16.810> kept<00:04:17.110> looking<00:04:17.290> for<00:04:17.470> other

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
features so I kept looking for other

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.240 
features so I kept looking for other
options<00:04:17.920> and<00:04:18.400> behold<00:04:19.200> hipstamatic<00:04:20.200> they<00:04:21.040> say

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
options and behold hipstamatic they say

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.310 
options and behold hipstamatic they say
that<00:04:21.459> digital<00:04:21.880> photography<00:04:22.510> never<00:04:22.870> looks<00:04:23.140> so

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
that digital photography never looks so

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.020 
that digital photography never looks so
analog<00:04:23.800> and<00:04:24.070> you'll<00:04:24.430> see<00:04:24.700> that<00:04:24.880> they

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
analog and you'll see that they

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.450 
analog and you'll see that they
definitely<00:04:25.360> deliver<00:04:25.930> this<00:04:26.740> app<00:04:27.010> is<00:04:27.160> a<00:04:27.220> bit

definitely deliver this app is a bit

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.710 
definitely deliver this app is a bit
more<00:04:27.580> involved<00:04:27.820> but<00:04:28.030> it<00:04:28.090> really<00:04:28.330> feels<00:04:28.630> like

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
more involved but it really feels like

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.480 
more involved but it really feels like
