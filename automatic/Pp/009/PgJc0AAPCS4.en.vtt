Todd<00:04:52.550> read<00:04:53.120> prevention<00:04:53.630> a<00:04:53.720> little<00:04:53.960> bit<00:04:54.080> but

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
Todd read prevention a little bit but

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.680 
Todd read prevention a little bit but
Todd's<00:04:54.980> the<00:04:55.190> person<00:04:55.640> that's<00:04:55.700> got<00:04:55.910> control<00:04:56.420> so

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
Todd's the person that's got control so

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.660 
Todd's the person that's got control so
you<00:04:56.840> can<00:04:57.020> either<00:04:57.350> slide<00:04:57.740> down<00:04:58.040> on<00:04:58.250> one<00:04:58.400> side<00:04:58.430> or

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
you can either slide down on one side or

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.780 
you can either slide down on one side or
the<00:04:58.940> other<00:04:58.970> it<00:04:59.780> is<00:04:59.990> easier<00:05:00.500> I<00:05:00.800> know<00:05:01.400> Todd

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
the other it is easier I know Todd

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.820 
the other it is easier I know Todd
mentioned<00:05:02.030> earlier<00:05:02.570> I<00:05:02.630> like<00:05:03.020> it<00:05:03.170> as<00:05:03.320> well<00:05:03.350> to

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
mentioned earlier I like it as well to

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.710 
mentioned earlier I like it as well to
have<00:05:04.100> the<00:05:04.130> victim<00:05:04.610> slanted<00:05:05.150> more<00:05:05.390> toward<00:05:05.660> the

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
have the victim slanted more toward the

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.770 
have the victim slanted more toward the
legs<00:05:06.080> because<00:05:06.980> the<00:05:07.250> the<00:05:07.490> most<00:05:08.000> of<00:05:08.150> the<00:05:08.270> mass<00:05:08.510> is

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
legs because the the most of the mass is

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.050 
legs because the the most of the mass is
on<00:05:08.960> this<00:05:09.170> arm<00:05:09.560> if<00:05:10.130> this<00:05:10.310> arms<00:05:10.640> a<00:05:10.700> little<00:05:10.820> bit

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
on this arm if this arms a little bit

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.180 
on this arm if this arms a little bit
higher<00:05:11.270> than<00:05:11.510> the<00:05:11.570> other<00:05:11.780> one<00:05:12.020> it<00:05:12.410> kind<00:05:13.070> of

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
higher than the other one it kind of

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.959 
higher than the other one it kind of
takes<00:05:13.430> what's<00:05:13.790> born<00:05:14.120> the<00:05:14.300> mass

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:15.969 
takes what's born the mass

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:19.469 
takes what's born the mass
that<00:05:16.779> makes<00:05:16.929> sense<00:05:17.309> so<00:05:18.309> that's<00:05:19.089> going<00:05:19.299> to<00:05:19.360> go

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
that makes sense so that's going to go

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.859 
that makes sense so that's going to go
ahead<00:05:19.539> and<00:05:19.749> start<00:05:19.869> sliding<00:05:20.199> what<00:05:20.739> happens<00:05:21.129> if

00:05:21.859 --> 00:05:21.869 
ahead and start sliding what happens if

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:24.419 
ahead and start sliding what happens if
what<00:05:22.869> happens<00:05:23.229> if<00:05:23.349> the<00:05:23.469> victim<00:05:23.829> starts<00:05:24.159> going

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:24.429 
what happens if the victim starts going

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:29.389 
what happens if the victim starts going
faster<00:05:24.969> to<00:05:25.119> talk<00:05:25.329> to<00:05:25.449> his<00:05:25.599> chest<00:05:25.869> pin<00:05:26.589> it<00:05:26.709> in

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:29.399 

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:33.299
