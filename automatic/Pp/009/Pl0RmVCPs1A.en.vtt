 more than canals sgb tutorials already this 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.160
 new video that was presenting a 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.849
 new break your device the day and 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.849
 400 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.050
 The first thing we are going to do is going to be 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.690
 downloaded the files that are in the 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.300
 destruction of this video that is the rom 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.920
 it's called slim being v2 ok it 'll be 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.529
 in the description of the video and they are going to 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.140
 move to your sd card once this is done 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.000
 let's go to the recovery mode if it's the 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.130
 the first time you start the recovery mode 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.780
 you're going 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.280
 I'm going to leave a video here below 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.860
 so you know how to get in first 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.450
 once to the recovery mode if it's not the first 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.850
 then we will enter with the keys 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.550
 volume up the home key and the key 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.050
 turned off at the same time a 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.360
 Once this is done, let's hope that 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.060
 do not start the way traveled ok so 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.090
 how good are we going to simply wait for 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.110
 it does not start record mode and a 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.540
 Once this is done, we are going to 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.340
 move with the keys the key of 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.830
 it struck off we're going to use it as ok 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.690
 the volume keys above can be 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.729
 to scroll down likewise the 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.800
 menu key down the key 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.510
 home up ok so let's go 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.210
 to the first cool guy who is Güipe de 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.780
 datafactory reset and we will give in ok 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.659
 today at 10 and it's already after we're going to 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.600
 go to the second cool that is the wing white 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.050
 cache for prison and we will give it in 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.260
 And it is 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.410
 and let's wait and then we'll go to 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.940
 advanced and we are going to zeeuw and peking 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.230
 cache and this I recommend that it be done 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.210
 about three times since many times 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.430
 It usually fails so well I'm going to 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.660
 do three times for anything to 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.660
 that nothing bad is going to come out 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.240
 then let's go back with the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.940
 backward technique many times to 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.820
 subscriber in this council then it is 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.620
 the sit from sd card 8 cecyt from sd card 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.150
 and will open us a browser type of 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.650
 files where we are going to look for what 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.870
 that would be the rom where the 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.180
 we have saved either in some 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.100
 folder or in the root and or this time 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.260
 I have it in the root that is the slim and 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.950
 novelty so I give it to him and we're going to 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:13.140
 give in yes install is limpid new 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.380
 icon like that with now we're just going to 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.650
 wait until you finish saving this 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.200
 thing ok as well as good this branch what 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.360
 command leonardo ortiz a greeting to whom 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.130
 I really appreciate it very much to 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.910
 goodbye just return it with the key 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.200
 back and well we started with this 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.850
 this screen animation that I like 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.820
 too much the truth I like 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.370
 it 's a pass I like it too 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.250
 too much the truth I would not know what 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.920
 tell how good this rum is very 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.490
 fast I love it also because 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.170
 or it does not take anything to start start 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.470
 very fast right now let's see it not 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.140
 it takes more than it will be 23 minutes in 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.480
 start the first time ok that is a 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.370
 gone as you see then it is already or is not 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.930
 it took more than 2 minutes when it started 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:07.150
 and good now let's wait 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.650
 simply to which it is then well load 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.230
 well not also a knot like that after 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.540
 let's give the ok ok let's give it the ok 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.010
 ok ok just like we are not going to give 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.350
 to the menu how to show an appearance 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.989
 style of living the bar 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.850
 notifications you could do or head mod 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.360
 it seems to me that this version said no hit 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.310
 modesty no head mode 9.1 so good 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.569
 the truth is very well let's go to the 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.030
 configurations that is something that 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.890
 I want to teach new that is good 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.750
 First set the language well 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.239
 in English so we 're just going to go 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.620
 to the input language and let's see where 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.269
 says spanish ok 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.430
 once this will change the rom 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.390
 totally in Spanish as well as not now 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.209
 let's go to what would be 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.630
 About the phone brings us Android 4.0 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:52.750
 4 and with a new kernel designed by 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:55.570
 david castellanos this channel is so 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.359
 empty performance we will accept in 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.130
 processor and then in patterns of 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:03.250
 exceeded it brings us new patterns like 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.470
 example the smart v2 the leis and he knows 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.260
 heads end 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.760
 the east that is lionheart ok the most 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.560
 recommended that I have heard is the 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.750
 smart v2 although the truth or good 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.690
 you can try and on the frequency 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.030
 maximum we can put 1100 megahertz 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.670
 although I do not recommend it, I recommend 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.140
 that they put less because there 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.940
 odds that 1100 will be put 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.610
 reboots so I for example put 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.470
 1050 and I'm already testing if you 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.650
 I can increase more and not me here 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.380
 I put 600 for example and you're done with this 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.270
 well 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:41.010
 the device is going to go super well 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:43.080
 like the 3 that works equally the 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.490
 wifi and we will activate it are the only 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.130
 two things I'm going to show I do not want 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.160
 take a long time with this video sorry if I 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.230
 I'm getting a little hoarse but good 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:56.010
 and as I say send a greeting also to 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:58.650
 leonardo martínez who is the one who has 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.900
 sent this 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:04.639
 this rom that I really like 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.639
 very much although as I say this 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.999
 yes it's true that I'm going a little slower 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.099
 that some other branches is no longer very 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:13.050
 fluid so it's good if it's fluid but 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:15.930
 well there are times that if you stay 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.060
 a little stuck no and well also another 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.189
 thing that same in failure when I tried it 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.680
 I do not know if it was because he had been wrong 

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:25.229
 or something but it's the theme of the player 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.960
 the issue of the support player gave me 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:29.340
 mistakes because I was after changing 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.159
 several songs for example and also 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.009
 that I have just put a song 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:36.330
 I'm going to put the widget for easier and 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:38.700
 this at the time of changing several 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.810
 songs at the same time 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.340
 this happens to me 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.320
 and that the application has been had 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.180
 then the music keeps sounding but at 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.010
 put to accept by the music is removed and 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.780
 you have to put the plan back and 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:53.050
 this happened to me very often 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:55.090
 just as it does not I see it is a 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.919
 error that I have found I recommend 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.630
 so they download another player and 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:01.849
 that this one that comes by default is 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:04.550
 very very bad not again there 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:06.259
 or good is a mistake that the truth 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.819
 then very serious because then many people 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:10.459
 how do I use the music player 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:12.319
 so then there is a need for 

00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:14.029
 download another I do not expect that soon 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:16.879
 in some update fix it 

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:18.559
 leonardo so good young then in 

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:19.929
 this mistake I did not even put the song and 

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:22.490
 alone has been put as well as not 

00:06:19.929 --> 00:06:25.009
 basically this would be the revised the 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.370
 round is very good the wifi works and 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:28.440
 good 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:31.160
 everything will be in the description so that 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.160
 download it 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.330
 and good guys up here the video
