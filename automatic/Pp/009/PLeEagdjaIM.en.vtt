00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
sound that a lot a bit more interesting

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.070 
sound that a lot a bit more interesting
you<00:01:26.470> can<00:01:26.530> almost<00:01:26.710> turn<00:01:27.040> swears<00:01:27.490> so<00:01:28.390> you<00:01:28.450> can't

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
you can almost turn swears so you can't

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.359 
you can almost turn swears so you can't
even<00:01:29.200> tell<00:01:29.500> that<00:01:29.530> there<00:01:29.740> was<00:01:29.770> a<00:01:29.860> word<00:01:30.070> there<00:01:30.280> in

even tell that there was a word there in
the<00:01:30.460> first<00:01:30.670> place<00:01:30.760> and<00:01:31.030> it<00:01:31.090> almost<00:01:31.210> makes<00:01:31.659> the

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
the first place and it almost makes the

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
the first place and it almost makes the
production<00:01:32.229> sound<00:01:32.350> a<00:01:32.470> little<00:01:32.560> bit<00:01:32.710> more

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
production sound a little bit more

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.380 
production sound a little bit more
polished<00:01:33.250> it's<00:01:33.430> a<00:01:33.549> little<00:01:33.760> plugin<00:01:33.970> that<00:01:34.150> I<00:01:34.240> use

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
polished it's a little plugin that I use

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.380 
polished it's a little plugin that I use
called<00:01:34.720> effect<00:01:35.200> ryx<00:01:35.520> which<00:01:36.520> you<00:01:36.700> can<00:01:36.880> see<00:01:36.909> I'm

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
called effect ryx which you can see I'm

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.240 
called effect ryx which you can see I'm
here<00:01:38.260> and<00:01:38.409> basically<00:01:38.560> all<00:01:38.799> it<00:01:38.890> does<00:01:39.070> is<00:01:39.220> it

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
here and basically all it does is it

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.890 
here and basically all it does is it
sequences<00:01:39.820> itself<00:01:40.180> through<00:01:40.479> lots<00:01:40.750> of

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
sequences itself through lots of

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.660 
sequences itself through lots of
different<00:01:41.260> types<00:01:41.560> of<00:01:41.740> effects<00:01:42.100> like<00:01:42.340> delay

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
different types of effects like delay

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.359 
different types of effects like delay
stop<00:01:43.119> a<00:01:43.150> reverse<00:01:43.540> scratch<00:01:43.990> affects<00:01:44.380> all<00:01:45.159> that

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
stop a reverse scratch affects all that

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:46.679 
stop a reverse scratch affects all that
type<00:01:45.549> of<00:01:45.580> stuff<00:01:45.729> that<00:01:45.970> basically<00:01:46.090> mashes<00:01:46.659> the

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
type of stuff that basically mashes the

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.510 
type of stuff that basically mashes the
beats<00:01:46.960> up<00:01:47.170> so<00:01:47.439> all<00:01:47.590> you<00:01:47.680> do<00:01:47.830> is<00:01:47.950> simply<00:01:48.280> turn

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
beats up so all you do is simply turn

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.940 
beats up so all you do is simply turn
this<00:01:48.700> plugin<00:01:49.030> on<00:01:49.330> over<00:01:50.229> the<00:01:50.320> offending<00:01:50.740> word

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
this plugin on over the offending word

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.260 
this plugin on over the offending word
so<00:01:51.189> you<00:01:51.280> can<00:01:51.400> hear<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.640> effects<00:01:52.030> I<00:01:52.060> mean<00:01:52.180> this

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
so you can hear the effects I mean this

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.480 
so you can hear the effects I mean this
is<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.510> truck<00:01:52.750> normally<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.740> then<00:01:57.250> you<00:01:57.369> can

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
is the truck normally and then you can

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.859

stuff<00:02:50.630> pop<00:02:50.810> music<00:02:51.140> anyway<00:02:51.410> but<00:02:51.590> it's

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
stuff pop music anyway but it's

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.710

surprisingly<00:02:52.100> on<00:02:52.340> air<00:02:52.490> the<00:02:52.910> killer<00:02:53.330> fact<00:02:53.600> that

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
surprisingly on air the killer fact that

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.150 
surprisingly on air the killer fact that
you<00:02:53.780> won't<00:02:53.900> talk<00:02:54.110> about<00:02:54.260> will<00:02:54.590> always<00:02:54.890> just

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
you won't talk about will always just

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.770 
you won't talk about will always just
jump<00:02:55.670> out<00:02:55.820> of<00:02:55.850> your<00:02:55.910> head<00:02:56.120> at<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:56.270> wrong<00:02:56.510> time
