Felicia callous in your muscle cells you
can<00:00:19.830> basically<00:00:19.980> reduce<00:00:20.430> fatigue<00:00:20.610> if<00:00:21.330> you<00:00:21.449> can

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
can basically reduce fatigue if you can

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.359 
can basically reduce fatigue if you can
reduce<00:00:21.810> fatigue<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.800> means<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.070> can<00:00:23.190> do

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
reduce fatigue that means you can do

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.460 
reduce fatigue that means you can do
more<00:00:23.610> this<00:00:24.119> means<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.359> can<00:00:24.449> lift<00:00:24.720> more<00:00:24.930> which

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
more this means you can lift more which

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.320 
more this means you can lift more which
means<00:00:25.500> you'll<00:00:25.830> be<00:00:25.859> stronger<00:00:26.250> than<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.550> gym<00:00:26.760> or

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
means you'll be stronger than the gym or

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
lived in you're doing at the end of the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.689 
lived in you're doing at the end of the
day<00:00:30.570> if<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:31.019> can<00:00:31.140> lift<00:00:31.320> more<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:32.279> can<00:00:32.399> wait<00:00:32.579> to

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:32.699 
day if you can lift more you can wait to

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.760 
day if you can lift more you can wait to
get<00:00:32.820> more<00:00:33.210> stronger<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:34.260> can<00:00:34.290> increase<00:00:34.739> the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
get more stronger you can increase the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.410 
get more stronger you can increase the
muscle<00:00:35.220> and<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.940> can<00:00:36.059> increase<00:00:36.360> your

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
muscle and you can increase your

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.270 
muscle and you can increase your
metabolic<00:00:36.630> rate<00:00:37.020> but<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.890> can<00:00:38.010> increase<00:00:38.160> your

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
metabolic rate but you can increase your

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.410 
metabolic rate but you can increase your
metabolic<00:00:38.489> rate<00:00:38.820> you're<00:00:39.030> going<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.210> lose<00:00:39.360> that

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
metabolic rate you're going to lose that

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.750 
metabolic rate you're going to lose that
so<00:00:40.410> overall<00:00:40.770> you're<00:00:41.130> going<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.309> be<00:00:41.399> stronger

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
so overall you're going to be stronger

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.610 
so overall you're going to be stronger
you're<00:00:42.300> going<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.480> be<00:00:42.570> leaner<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.140> going<00:00:43.559> to

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
you're going to be leaner and going to

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.950 
you're going to be leaner and going to
be<00:00:43.680> more<00:00:43.800> muscular<00:00:44.130> and<00:00:44.540> if<00:00:45.540> it's<00:00:45.780> good<00:00:45.930> enough

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
be more muscular and if it's good enough

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.610 
be more muscular and if it's good enough
for<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.440> South<00:00:47.280> Korea<00:00:47.670> winter<00:00:48.420> olympics<00:00:48.840> and

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
for the South Korea winter olympics and

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.290 
for the South Korea winter olympics and
I<00:00:49.710> think<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:49.950> good<00:00:50.100> enough<00:00:50.250> for<00:00:50.309> me<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:51.180> with

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
I think it's good enough for me and with

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.420 
I think it's good enough for me and with
all<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.570> studies<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.200> are<00:00:52.379> behind<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.950> full

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
all the studies that are behind it full

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.040 
all the studies that are behind it full
of<00:00:53.460> backing<00:00:53.910> that's<00:00:54.090> behind<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.570> like<00:00:54.719> roger

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
of backing that's behind it like roger

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.200 
of backing that's behind it like roger
harris<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.500> put<00:00:55.800> together<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.550> push

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
harris you put together and push

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.330 
harris you put together and push
creative<00:00:57.989> into<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.649> forefront<00:00:58.890> into<00:00:59.250> the

creative into the forefront into the
mainstream<00:00:59.550> i<00:01:00.059> think<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.230> going<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.559> be<00:01:01.860> the

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
mainstream i think it's going to be the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.140 
mainstream i think it's going to be the
next<00:01:02.789> big<00:01:03.449> thing

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150

reps 20 bucks on a good day on the
different<00:01:15.910> bar<00:01:16.060> so<00:01:16.300> today<00:01:16.630> we're<00:01:17.020> going<00:01:17.110> to

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
different bar so today we're going to

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.660 
different bar so today we're going to
see<00:01:17.320> what<00:01:17.410> we<00:01:17.470> can<00:01:17.590> do<00:01:17.710> up<00:01:17.830> to<00:01:17.860> five<00:01:18.190> weeks<00:01:18.490> of

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
see what we can do up to five weeks of

00:01:18.670 --> 00:02:00.510 
see what we can do up to five weeks of
taking<00:01:18.820> beta<00:01:19.150> element

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.899 

so<00:02:01.090> there<00:02:01.180> we<00:02:01.270> have<00:02:01.299> 32<00:02:02.310> that's<00:02:03.310> just<00:02:03.399> taking

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
so there we have 32 that's just taking

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.230 
so there we have 32 that's just taking
up<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:05.229> three<00:02:05.469> or<00:02:05.590> four<00:02:05.770> weeks<00:02:05.950> makes<00:02:06.820> me<00:02:06.909> six

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
up to three or four weeks makes me six

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.869 
up to three or four weeks makes me six
months<00:02:07.479> a<00:02:07.539> day<00:02:07.719> and<00:02:08.560> our<00:02:08.800> last<00:02:09.069> week<00:02:09.340> I've
