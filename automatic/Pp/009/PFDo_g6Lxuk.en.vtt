hi<00:00:01.350> I'm<00:00:01.560> Thea<00:00:01.860> Watson<00:00:02.399> and<00:00:02.730> this<00:00:03.659> is<00:00:03.810> Emily<00:00:04.200> go

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
hi I'm Thea Watson and this is Emily go

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.950 
hi I'm Thea Watson and this is Emily go
via<00:00:04.620> and<00:00:05.270> we're<00:00:06.270> just<00:00:06.330> going<00:00:06.450> to<00:00:06.629> show<00:00:06.779> you<00:00:06.839> a

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
via and we're just going to show you a

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.509 
via and we're just going to show you a
little<00:00:07.170> prototype<00:00:07.740> of<00:00:07.980> something<00:00:08.340> we've<00:00:08.490> been

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
little prototype of something we've been

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.190 
little prototype of something we've been
working<00:00:08.639> on<00:00:09.059> with<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.450> Microsoft<00:00:10.139> Kinect

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
working on with the Microsoft Kinect

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.390 
working on with the Microsoft Kinect
sort<00:00:13.200> of<00:00:13.290> like<00:00:13.440> an<00:00:13.590> interactive<00:00:14.160> life

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
sort of like an interactive life

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.000 
sort of like an interactive life
puppeteering<00:00:15.030> tool<00:00:15.450> that<00:00:16.260> tracks<00:00:16.710> the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
puppeteering tool that tracks the

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.090 
puppeteering tool that tracks the
silhouette<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.760> your<00:00:17.910> arm<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.420> then<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.890> uses

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
silhouette of your arm and then it uses

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.109 
silhouette of your arm and then it uses
that<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:22.670> controller<00:00:24.170> digital<00:00:25.170> puppet<00:00:26.119> and

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
that to controller digital puppet and

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:38.030 
that to controller digital puppet and
yeah<00:00:35.300> so<00:00:36.300> when<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.510> open<00:00:36.750> your<00:00:36.809> hand<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.680> sees

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
yeah so when you open your hand it sees

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.060 
yeah so when you open your hand it sees
the<00:00:38.250> points<00:00:38.610> ago<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.000> then<00:00:39.739> opens<00:00:40.739> his<00:00:40.890> mouth

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
the points ago and then opens his mouth

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:55.980 
the points ago and then opens his mouth
and<00:00:41.360> screeches

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:55.990 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:05.170 

huh<00:00:57.460> hey<00:00:58.460> yeah<00:01:03.640> there's<00:01:04.640> like<00:01:04.730> a<00:01:04.790> bunch<00:01:05.000> of

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
huh hey yeah there's like a bunch of

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.340 
huh hey yeah there's like a bunch of
different<00:01:05.480> postures<00:01:05.900> you<00:01:06.050> can<00:01:06.200> do<00:01:06.850> but<00:01:08.350> it's

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
different postures you can do but it's

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.010 
different postures you can do but it's
tracking<00:01:09.830> the<00:01:09.920> elbow<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.700> rest<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.630> tips<00:01:11.870> of

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
tracking the elbow the rest the tips of

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.020 
tracking the elbow the rest the tips of
your<00:01:12.110> fingers<00:01:12.200> and<00:01:12.530> your<00:01:12.800> thumb<00:01:14.020> and<00:01:15.760> yeah<00:01:16.760> I

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
your fingers and your thumb and yeah I

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.250 
your fingers and your thumb and yeah I
think<00:01:17.180> next<00:01:17.510> thing<00:01:17.750> we're<00:01:17.900> going<00:01:17.990> to<00:01:18.050> look<00:01:18.110> at

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
think next thing we're going to look at

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.680 
think next thing we're going to look at
maybe<00:01:18.560> taking<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:19.550> depth<00:01:19.760> information<00:01:20.090> into

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
maybe taking the depth information into

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.390 
maybe taking the depth information into
account<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.229> using<00:01:21.710> it<00:01:21.860> so<00:01:22.040> that<00:01:22.190> you<00:01:22.280> can

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
account and using it so that you can

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:38.310 
account and using it so that you can
turn<00:01:23.259> these<00:01:24.259> people

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:55.400 

eat<00:01:39.280> some<00:01:39.490> food<00:01:39.700> for<00:01:39.850> my<00:01:40.000> head<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:46.780> reach<00:01:46.930> that

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.050 

cool<00:01:56.410> so<00:01:56.680> maybe<00:01:56.860> I'll<00:01:56.979> just<00:01:57.130> show<00:01:57.910> you<00:01:57.940> a

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
cool so maybe I'll just show you a

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:06.180 
cool so maybe I'll just show you a
little<00:01:58.210> bit<00:01:58.420> hard<00:01:58.660> way<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.869> it's<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.740> Xbox

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
little bit hard way so it's the Xbox

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.300 
little bit hard way so it's the Xbox
Kinect<00:02:06.580> this<00:02:07.060> with<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.690> free<00:02:08.619> net<00:02:08.800> drivers

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
Kinect this with the free net drivers

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.420 
Kinect this with the free net drivers
free<00:02:10.000> net<00:02:10.179> and<00:02:10.509> then<00:02:11.440> this<00:02:11.650> is<00:02:11.800> open<00:02:12.160> framework

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
free net and then this is open framework

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.780 
free net and then this is open framework
during<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.350> computer<00:02:14.350> vision<00:02:14.680> with<00:02:14.860> opencv<00:02:15.340> and

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
during a computer vision with opencv and

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.510 
during a computer vision with opencv and
it's<00:02:16.570> sort<00:02:16.959> of<00:02:17.080> running<00:02:17.320> a<00:02:17.680> skeletonization'

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
it's sort of running a skeletonization'

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.000 
it's sort of running a skeletonization'
code<00:02:19.180> on<00:02:19.510> your<00:02:19.540> silhouette<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:20.470> then

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
code on your silhouette and then

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.979 
code on your silhouette and then
tracking<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.700> points<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.300> elbows<00:02:22.690> the

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
tracking the points to the elbows the

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.970 
tracking the points to the elbows the
wrists<00:02:23.730> fingertips<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.690> then<00:02:26.200> mapping<00:02:26.620> that

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
wrists fingertips and then mapping that

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.979 
wrists fingertips and then mapping that
those<00:02:27.220> points<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.150> kind<00:02:28.420> of<00:02:28.450> movement<00:02:28.720> of

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
those points to the kind of movement of

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:36.300 
those points to the kind of movement of
the<00:02:29.020> bird<00:02:29.350> and<00:02:30.540> yeah<00:02:32.489> pretty<00:02:33.489> fun<00:02:35.070> kinect<00:02:36.070> for

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
the bird and yeah pretty fun kinect for

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.959 
the bird and yeah pretty fun kinect for
xbox<00:02:36.959> 360
