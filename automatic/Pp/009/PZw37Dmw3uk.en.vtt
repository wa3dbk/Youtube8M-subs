00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.970
 experience will allow you to put in 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.599
 evidence that the phenomenon of tension 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.219
 superficial 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.480
 for her this experience you have 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.630
 well a bottle filled with water as well 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.950
 than a strainer while maintaining the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.879
 colander a few centimeters the water 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.879
 will flow without any problem 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.870
 on the other hand if you place the colander 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.579
 on the neck of the bottle 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.910
 a thin membrane not secret and prevent 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.910
 the water to flow 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.489
 now we will push 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.230
 the experience is a little further 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.290
 for that you are a piece of canvas 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.070
 of mosquito nets well behind empty 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.100
 start by setting the canvas as 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:15.390
 this one on the green now you 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:16.979
 can fill it without any problem to 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.390
 present if you return the green set to 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.390
 a few drops will not flow 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.040
 we will move on to the illusion 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.369
 cleanest optics that I 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.619
