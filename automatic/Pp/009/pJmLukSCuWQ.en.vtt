00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:05.659
 m 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.850
 Baptist Jean practices the smile 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.680
 in other words, slope flight 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.750
 he constantly uses the wind that 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.730
 comes knocking against a generating obstacle 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.690
 so an upward flow and he 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.670
 to stay in the air 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.920
 a technique that once perfectly 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.010
 mastered suggests a crowd of 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.050
 possibilities wise or less wise but 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.760
 without necessarily putting himself in danger and 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.860
 all this gives rise to feats and 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.860
 so just amazing pictures 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.470
 the basic idea that is since 2011 I 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.940
 to share the feeling of flying by 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.200
 Image whoever shifts 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.730
 barriers we always come back to this to 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.200
 this common thread there is to share 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.910
 the sensation of flight by the image 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.170
 from there, you have to adapt 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.880
 a little bit his driving to this idea 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.290
 that is, if when I ask myself 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.870
 puts me as an elephant and I arrive 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.300
 on the ground carry a very violent very 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.960
 aggressive and all that in the end 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.880
 aggression it's okay to share 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.590
 an image of extreme but it does not go 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.730
 to share the sweet thing we this 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.930
 we want without boarding people the 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.130
 flight we have a very very sweet image of 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.620
 flight we do not have a catastrophic image 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.810
 the flight we saw rather peter pan 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.160
 the superman is actually what is 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.869
 really nice is to touch the ground 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.790
 but to do a little bit as if the 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.170
 the feet drag there actually somewhere 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.940
 ie we were going we are connected 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.740
 with the soil in fact we have no weight 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.479
 on our feet so far so far 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.250
 i love doing cdc hanging out 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.360
 behind is really being let loose for 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.220
 really have a feeling of lightness 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.870
 and that really helps the image is 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.180
 really to the understanding of 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.930
 to feel this sensation and in 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.450
 buzz matter 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.040
 he has on jv urban side on the one hand but 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.630
 also others who gathered on the 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.170
 canvas one million seven hundred thousand 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.000
 visitors 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.530
 a nice spotlight on a 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.720
 rather little media discipline 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.000
 and then lately he wanted to replay 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.830
 a cult scene of a cult film and 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.910
 put in the shoes of a certain marty 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.080
 mcfly the batteries for the same speed 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.030
 than car since the flash freezing 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.990
 okay but on the other hand you have to 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.490
 you really are not far from the ground 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.600
 since I put the camera on 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.980
 flush with the ground make you agree 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.340
 with the beautiful attitude and then you me 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.330
 do now 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.950
 I built when I hear 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.570
 ok now we did it was words 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.560
 and go so we can make me 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.480
 when I see the car in 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.610
 do you have the top of the neck of the 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.480
 car that gets me right on the big 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.220
 time that it moves away and we will pass that 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.550
 that but the action is a bit in fashion 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.550
 specific 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.160
 okay
