used to the base you wanna make sure

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.039 
used to the base you wanna make sure
that's<00:01:41.040> really<00:01:41.430> really<00:01:41.640> fine<00:01:41.880> yep<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:42.960> like

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
that's really really fine yep just like

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.899 
that's really really fine yep just like
that<00:01:43.140> that's<00:01:43.619> good<00:01:43.799> then<00:01:44.490> you're<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.640> melt<00:01:44.850> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
that that's good then you're a melt the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.569 
that that's good then you're a melt the
butter<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:46.079> saucepan<00:01:46.259> then<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:47.399> add<00:01:47.549> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
butter in a saucepan then you add the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.609 
butter in a saucepan then you add the
ginger<00:01:47.850> nuts<00:01:48.180> will<00:01:48.840> crush<00:01:49.049> dumped<00:01:49.290> its<00:01:49.409> nuts

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
ginger nuts will crush dumped its nuts

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.859 
ginger nuts will crush dumped its nuts
to<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.909> then<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.270> stay<00:01:51.479> around<00:01:51.659> until

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
to it and then you stay around until

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.690 
to it and then you stay around until
like<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.439> then<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.130> could<00:01:53.310> we<00:01:53.399> use<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
like that then this could we use the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.930 
like that then this could we use the
base<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.060> put<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.479> into<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> dish<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.530> can<00:01:55.649> see

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
base you put it into a dish you can see

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.770 
base you put it into a dish you can see
and<00:01:56.060> then<00:01:56.810> you<00:01:56.900> just<00:01:58.150> flash<00:01:59.150> it<00:01:59.180> down<00:01:59.480> really

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
and then you just flash it down really

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.410 
and then you just flash it down really
until<00:02:00.110> it<00:02:00.470> looks<00:02:00.590> like<00:02:00.800> that<00:02:00.950> so<00:02:01.460> then<00:02:02.180> you<00:02:02.270> put

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
until it looks like that so then you put

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.740 
until it looks like that so then you put
that<00:02:02.510> in<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.660> fridge<00:02:02.690> to<00:02:02.990> cool<00:02:03.110> down<00:02:03.340> okay<00:02:04.750> now

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
that in the fridge to cool down okay now

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.140 
that in the fridge to cool down okay now
you<00:02:06.170> get<00:02:06.740> three<00:02:07.100> tablespoons<00:02:07.580> of<00:02:07.670> water<00:02:07.790> and

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:08.150 
you get three tablespoons of water and

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.180 
you get three tablespoons of water and
add<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.690> gelatin<00:02:08.990> sassy<00:02:09.500> to<00:02:09.800> it<00:02:09.920> but<00:02:10.100> I'll

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
add the gelatin sassy to it but I'll

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.130 
add the gelatin sassy to it but I'll
just<00:02:10.310> let<00:02:10.460> that<00:02:10.610> swell<00:02:10.940> up<00:02:11.090> until<00:02:11.720> it<00:02:11.840> becomes

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
just let that swell up until it becomes

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.400 
just let that swell up until it becomes
like<00:02:12.320> an<00:02:12.470> opaque<00:02:13.840> well<00:02:14.840> then<00:02:14.990> you<00:02:15.050> want<00:02:15.230> to
