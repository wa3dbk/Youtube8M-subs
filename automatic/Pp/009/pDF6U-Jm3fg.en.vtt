00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
say that it was lackluster i think is an

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.779 
say that it was lackluster i think is an
understatement<00:01:01.930> the<00:01:02.379> hype<00:01:02.620> was<00:01:02.920> just<00:01:03.610> out<00:01:03.760> of

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
understatement the hype was just out of

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:05.730 
understatement the hype was just out of
control<00:01:04.000> and<00:01:04.660> by<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.199> time<00:01:05.259> the<00:01:05.530> fight

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
control and by the time the fight

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.580 
control and by the time the fight
actually<00:01:05.979> came<00:01:06.399> came<00:01:06.880> about<00:01:07.210> it<00:01:07.840> did<00:01:08.200> not<00:01:08.380> live

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
actually came came about it did not live

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.010

you could make an argument to say that

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.979 
you could make an argument to say that
Carlos<00:01:54.550> running<00:01:54.819> away<00:01:55.030> should<00:01:55.569> not<00:01:55.720> really

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:55.989 
Carlos running away should not really

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:58.050 
Carlos running away should not really
you<00:01:56.500> know<00:01:56.619> in<00:01:56.860> pushing<00:01:57.220> the<00:01:57.399> page<00:01:57.580> he<00:01:57.880> should

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
you know in pushing the page he should

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.790 
you know in pushing the page he should
have<00:01:58.149> won<00:01:58.239> a<00:01:58.270> fight<00:01:58.539> instead<00:01:58.869> so<00:01:59.530> it<00:01:59.649> was

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
have won a fight instead so it was

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.889

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
was a really disappointing performance

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.970 
was a really disappointing performance
for<00:03:51.549> Diaz<00:03:51.819> you<00:03:52.090> know<00:03:52.209> he<00:03:52.720> got<00:03:52.930> manhandle<00:03:53.859> he

got ragdoll he got everything you know

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.819 
got ragdoll he got everything you know
he's<00:03:57.489> taller<00:03:57.850> than<00:03:58.030> GSB<00:03:58.690> right<00:03:59.230> so<00:03:59.560> it's<00:03:59.739> gonna

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
he's taller than GSB right so it's gonna

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.590 
he's taller than GSB right so it's gonna
be<00:03:59.950> harder<00:04:00.250> for<00:04:00.280> him<00:04:00.549> to<00:04:00.579> make<00:04:01.000> weight<00:04:01.299> with

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
be harder for him to make weight with

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.539 
be harder for him to make weight with
more<00:04:01.840> body<00:04:02.139> like<00:04:02.590> if<00:04:02.739> he<00:04:02.829> puts<00:04:03.069> on<00:04:03.160> more<00:04:03.400> muscle

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
more body like if he puts on more muscle

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.629 
more body like if he puts on more muscle
mass<00:04:03.989> but<00:04:04.989> he<00:04:05.380> definitely<00:04:05.680> I<00:04:05.950> would<00:04:06.069> say<00:04:06.370> has

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:06.639 
mass but he definitely I would say has

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:07.979 
mass but he definitely I would say has
to<00:04:06.819> put<00:04:06.970> on<00:04:07.060> a<00:04:07.090> little<00:04:07.359> bit<00:04:07.480> more<00:04:07.600> muscle<00:04:07.750> mass

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
to put on a little bit more muscle mass

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.990 
to put on a little bit more muscle mass
to<00:04:08.350> mess<00:04:08.530> with<00:04:08.739> GSP<00:04:09.040> he's<00:04:09.430> just<00:04:09.670> going<00:04:09.790> to<00:04:09.910> get

disappointing I think GSP's karate

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.090 
disappointing I think GSP's karate
coming<00:05:16.150> in<00:05:16.240> and<00:05:16.390> out<00:05:16.450> just<00:05:16.780> just<00:05:17.380> just<00:05:17.590> just

GSP<00:05:22.330> win<00:05:22.600> obviously<00:05:22.810> but<00:05:23.260> I<00:05:23.290> hoped<00:05:23.530> Nick<00:05:24.010> Diaz

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
GSP win obviously but I hoped Nick Diaz

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.460 
GSP win obviously but I hoped Nick Diaz
would<00:05:24.520> win<00:05:24.670> and<00:05:24.910> just<00:05:25.060> because<00:05:25.420> if<00:05:25.960> he<00:05:26.260> did

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
would win and just because if he did

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:27.750 
would win and just because if he did
would<00:05:26.710> have<00:05:26.860> made<00:05:27.010> things<00:05:27.040> more<00:05:27.550> interesting

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
would have made things more interesting

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.460 
would have made things more interesting
would<00:05:28.270> have<00:05:28.360> been<00:05:28.480> a<00:05:28.510> lot<00:05:28.600> of<00:05:28.720> fun<00:05:29.020> you<00:05:29.260> know<00:05:29.410> to

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
would have been a lot of fun you know to

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.130 
would have been a lot of fun you know to
see<00:05:29.650> maybe<00:05:30.040> a<00:05:30.190> rematch<00:05:30.610> or<00:05:30.910> you<00:05:31.450> know<00:05:31.600> it's

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
see maybe a rematch or you know it's

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.950 
see maybe a rematch or you know it's
just<00:05:32.230> GSP's<00:05:33.010> his<00:05:33.550> wrestling<00:05:34.270> is<00:05:34.390> on<00:05:34.510> the<00:05:34.780> level

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
just GSP's his wrestling is on the level

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.130 
just GSP's his wrestling is on the level
G<00:05:35.290> Diaz's<00:05:36.280> wrestling<00:05:36.669> KMS<00:05:37.120> with<00:05:37.270> it<00:05:37.390> so<00:05:38.110> i

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140 
G Diaz's wrestling KMS with it so i

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.640 
G Diaz's wrestling KMS with it so i
think<00:05:38.500> at<00:05:38.950> this<00:05:39.100> point<00:05:39.690> d<00:05:40.690> as<00:05:40.840> being<00:05:41.169> so<00:05:41.410> you

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
think at this point d as being so you

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.110 
think at this point d as being so you
know<00:05:41.770> he's<00:05:41.860> that<00:05:42.010> he's<00:05:42.130> two-dimensional<00:05:42.880> you

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
know he's that he's two-dimensional you

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.330 
know he's that he's two-dimensional you
know<00:05:43.210> his<00:05:43.330> jiu-jitsu<00:05:43.660> and<00:05:44.080> his<00:05:44.260> boxing<00:05:44.770> that's

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
know his jiu-jitsu and his boxing that's

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.340 
know his jiu-jitsu and his boxing that's
it<00:05:45.640> other<00:05:45.910> than<00:05:46.120> that<00:05:46.180> he's<00:05:46.480> got<00:05:46.660> nothing<00:05:47.080> so

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
it other than that he's got nothing so

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.680 
it other than that he's got nothing so
he<00:05:48.130> probably<00:05:48.430> at<00:05:48.730> this<00:05:48.850> point<00:05:49.120> should<00:05:49.330> retire

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
he probably at this point should retire

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.090 
he probably at this point should retire
because<00:05:50.080> I'm<00:05:50.350> he's<00:05:50.500> not<00:05:50.680> going<00:05:50.860> to<00:05:50.890> develop

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
because I'm he's not going to develop

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.840 
because I'm he's not going to develop
the<00:05:51.280> wrestling<00:05:51.610> skills<00:05:53.160> in<00:05:54.160> the<00:05:54.250> UFC<00:05:54.490> he's

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.530 
down he's going to get beaten just from
decisions<00:06:00.460> it's<00:06:00.640> going<00:06:00.790> to<00:06:00.850> happen<00:06:01.060> more<00:06:01.300> and

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:01.540

more<00:06:01.780> just<00:06:01.900> like<00:06:02.020> it<00:06:02.080> did<00:06:02.229> when<00:06:02.350> he<00:06:02.410> used<00:06:02.560> to<00:06:02.620> be

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
more just like it did when he used to be

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.070 
more just like it did when he used to be
in<00:06:02.800> the<00:06:02.890> UFC<00:06:03.100> Sean<00:06:03.790> Sherk<00:06:04.120> I<00:06:04.419> did<00:06:04.780> to<00:06:04.990> him

in the UFC Sean Sherk I did to him
before<00:06:05.460> GSP<00:06:06.460> of<00:06:06.640> course<00:06:06.880> will<00:06:07.120> do<00:06:07.300> to<00:06:07.479> him<00:06:07.540> even

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
before GSP of course will do to him even

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.570

if<00:06:07.930> they<00:06:08.020> have<00:06:08.110> a<00:06:08.140> rematch<00:06:08.530> it's<00:06:09.130> not<00:06:09.370> going<00:06:09.490> to

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
if they have a rematch it's not going to

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.060 
if they have a rematch it's not going to
happen<00:06:09.669> less<00:06:10.000> he<00:06:10.120> improves<00:06:10.419> his<00:06:10.800> wrestling<00:06:11.800> so

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
happen less he improves his wrestling so

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.650 
happen less he improves his wrestling so
that<00:06:12.430> being<00:06:12.669> said<00:06:12.760> he<00:06:13.030> probably<00:06:13.180> should

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660 
that being said he probably should

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.060 
that being said he probably should
retire<00:06:13.930> he's<00:06:14.110> not<00:06:14.200> give<00:06:14.320> me<00:06:14.380> a<00:06:14.440> champion<00:06:14.680> and

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
retire he's not give me a champion and

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.460 
retire he's not give me a champion and
he<00:06:15.700> can't<00:06:15.940> really<00:06:16.120> move<00:06:16.419> down<00:06:16.720> and<00:06:16.990> wait<00:06:17.169> I

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470 
he can't really move down and wait I

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.920 
he can't really move down and wait I
mean<00:06:17.800> you<00:06:17.890> could<00:06:18.010> go<00:06:18.250> up<00:06:18.460> but<00:06:19.210> if<00:06:19.660> you<00:06:19.750> fight

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
mean you could go up but if you fight

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.630 
mean you could go up but if you fight
anything<00:06:20.169> like<00:06:20.410> you<00:06:20.530> did<00:06:20.740> you<00:06:21.250> know<00:06:21.370> tonight

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.640 
anything like you did you know tonight

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.060 
anything like you did you know tonight
what's<00:06:22.450> the<00:06:22.600> point<00:06:22.870> might<00:06:23.650> as<00:06:23.740> well<00:06:23.800> just

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.070 
what's the point might as well just

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.830 
what's the point might as well just
retire<00:06:24.400> I<00:06:24.430> think<00:06:25.300> that's<00:06:25.419> what<00:06:25.570> he<00:06:25.630> probably

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
retire I think that's what he probably

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:26.969 
retire I think that's what he probably
should<00:06:26.200> do<00:06:26.290> even<00:06:26.500> though<00:06:26.590> it's<00:06:26.740> a<00:06:26.800> really

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:26.979 
should do even though it's a really

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:29.130 
should do even though it's a really
exciting<00:06:27.400> fighter<00:06:27.610> at<00:06:28.330> this<00:06:28.540> point<00:06:28.810> I<00:06:28.990> mean

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140 
exciting fighter at this point I mean

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.840 
exciting fighter at this point I mean
it's<00:06:29.350> not<00:06:29.470> going<00:06:29.590> to<00:06:29.680> be<00:06:29.740> champion<00:06:30.250> probably

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:30.850 
it's not going to be champion probably

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.480 
it's not going to be champion probably
never<00:06:30.970> will<00:06:31.180> be<00:06:31.890> doesn't<00:06:32.890> seem<00:06:32.979> like<00:06:33.100> he<00:06:33.250> wants

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490

never will be doesn't seem like he wants
to<00:06:33.520> do<00:06:33.669> it<00:06:33.790> anymore<00:06:33.940> should<00:06:34.750> just<00:06:34.930> retire

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:35.200 
to do it anymore should just retire

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.260

exciting is not competitive you know so
hopefully<00:07:16.120> Johny<00:07:16.330> Hendricks<00:07:16.419> can<00:07:16.870> stop<00:07:17.110> those

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.279 
anyway that's it for this video guys my
thoughts<00:07:24.039> on<00:07:24.280> it<00:07:24.479> will<00:07:25.479> probably<00:07:25.750> be<00:07:25.870> doing<00:07:26.020> a

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:26.289 
thoughts on it will probably be doing a

00:07:26.289 --> 00:07:28.409 
thoughts on it will probably be doing a
prediction<00:07:26.590> for<00:07:26.949> Johny<00:07:27.610> Hendricks<00:07:27.699> against

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:28.419 
prediction for Johny Hendricks against

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:30.450 
prediction for Johny Hendricks against
she<00:07:28.539> has<00:07:28.630> to<00:07:28.720> be<00:07:28.780> pretty<00:07:29.050> soon<00:07:29.380> but<00:07:30.100> in<00:07:30.280> terms

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:30.460 
she has to be pretty soon but in terms

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.760 
she has to be pretty soon but in terms
of<00:07:30.669> Nick<00:07:30.850> Diaz<00:07:31.030> very<00:07:31.780> disappointing<00:07:32.470> Diaz

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:32.770 
of Nick Diaz very disappointing Diaz

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:34.320 
of Nick Diaz very disappointing Diaz
think<00:07:33.370> you<00:07:33.460> should<00:07:33.639> just<00:07:33.820> retire<00:07:34.060> at<00:07:34.210> this

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:34.330 
think you should just retire at this

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.530 
think you should just retire at this
point<00:07:34.570> later<00:07:34.870> guys<00:07:35.050> peace
