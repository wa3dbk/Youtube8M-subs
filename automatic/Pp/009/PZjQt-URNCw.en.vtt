00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849 
assisted game which i guess is actually

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:35.220 
assisted game which i guess is actually
pretty<00:03:34.030> decent<00:03:34.239> really<00:03:34.630> for<00:03:34.780> a<00:03:34.810> strike<00:03:35.049> right

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
pretty decent really for a strike right

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.150 
pretty decent really for a strike right
there<00:03:35.290> really<00:03:35.560> tend<00:03:35.769> to<00:03:35.829> get<00:03:35.950> that<00:03:36.040> many

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.710 
there really tend to get that many
assists<00:03:36.519> with<00:03:36.760> them<00:03:36.880> so<00:03:37.269> it's<00:03:37.299> quite<00:03:37.510> happy

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720
