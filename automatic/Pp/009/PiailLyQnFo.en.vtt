00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:12.540
 hello to you athlon 1987 and recently 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.759
 I dug out my hangar so interesting 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.949
 tank like tantra his name 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.670
 certainly longer but I will not be there 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.800
 scrutinize peer due to lack 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:26.670
 cash in the form of game gold 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.740
 I have no desire or time to download 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.349
 something more so farm it sometimes 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.110
 for example, and occasionally stumble upon 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.559
 tank level ten and in this battle as 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.110
 once again decided to choose patton 3 which 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.690
 has a huge size and medium 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.450
 the tank is purely nominally van yao hiding 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.789
 the bushes are empty purely nominally 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.870
 covers my body he does me 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:57.420
 no help but i think that at least 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:00.180
 as you know from such as to take costs 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.579
 empty next to you can hide behind it 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.460
 leaves from 7 which is arrogant here 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.280
 trying to kill our out of some decoction 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.189
 The new tank was never seen strangely 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.729
 such and and we begin to breed it here 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:18.210
 three trunks of course from the cellar is that 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.240
 one dies and 4 which you to be targets 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.530
 the shaft drives up to us but it is occupied by others 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.170
 by deed he kills e100 i kill him and 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.299
 I'm starting to aim 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.970
 leopards who are trying to trade 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.850
 through the tower he probably doesn't know what 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.329
 him nothing to tank and so I 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.310
 I drink it quietly in a mask I know what 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.920
 he will now go by trying to knock off 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.380
 me and my task is just so native and 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.630
 kill on avtopritsele that I actually 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.210
 saying and make a score of 67 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.979
 I remember it was thick on this map 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.100
 the forest and now you don't even know where 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.990
 hide in the goal 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.420
 t30 punching it and 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.320
 I hit some holes with the next shot 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.869
 shave 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.560
 fig you will understand the day and stand there leaves 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.660
 704 I put him on the rink he 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.090
 repaired but with the next shot I 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.580
 his 5 kill the same capture base 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.090
 happening at the base no one recall 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.940
 to you that this is a head- on battle 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.170
 at a speed of 45 kilometers per hour I'm flying 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.660
 knock down the base and 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.450
 I only had one thing in mind 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.180
 any way knock the base there my boys 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.200
 will pull up due to decides this 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.269
 will be 13 90 trying to knock me off but 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.239
 I know that I can't catch him all 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:41.160
 equal trying now hopeless i thought well 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.430
 okay now amid you anyway 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.780
 you will be near the base and there we are with you 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.049
 let's talk like a man 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.450
 wafer vytselit I'm trying but it did not 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.239
 shoot because she is out of range 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.910
 shooting and then start to plant me 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.370
 and did not understand what was happening in what 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.640
 I was engaged here that this get me up 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.130
 start carousel two tanks i'm trying 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.829
 to focus on one decides for yourself 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.890
 that you need to kill t-54 and the drummer is all 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:13.859
 equal when they are discharged and come 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.980
 the time when I will take revenge on him and this 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:19.769
 the moment came my task just not 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.260
 turns him there anyway he 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.900
 such a dog manages me once 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.739
 punch but he paid for his 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.650
 boldness 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:32.100
 the battle will continue to go wrong 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.230
 Intensely remained one devyasnoik 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.600
 whom we will drive on the map 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.940
 will come back and we will come and I will become like 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.359
 usually taste that won't be me 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.970
 close here is such a dynamic battle 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:47.310
 I got it of course it turned out 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.639
 due to the fact that I set the speed to 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:54.590
 x2 so this sad shit is not going to hell 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:58.670
 does not always shoot and only a box of cola 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.910
 helps with viskar we will not be okay 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.160
 farther 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.130
 I recently stumbled upon fascinating

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.690
