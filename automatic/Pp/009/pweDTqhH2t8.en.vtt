running efficiently the cars don't have
much<00:00:27.090> power<00:00:27.619> and<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:29.609> lot<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.240> has<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.539> do

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
much power and a lot of it has to do

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.139 
much power and a lot of it has to do
with<00:00:30.689> your<00:00:30.960> fuel<00:00:31.230> quality<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:32.790> lot<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.059> it

with your fuel quality and a lot of it

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.690 
with your fuel quality and a lot of it
has<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.270> do<00:00:33.480> with<00:00:33.570> ethanol<00:00:34.370> there<00:00:35.370> was<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.550> think

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
has to do with ethanol there was I think

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.790 
has to do with ethanol there was I think
a<00:00:35.969> law<00:00:36.180> or<00:00:36.450> some<00:00:36.780> sort<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.110> bill<00:00:37.260> passed<00:00:37.530> in

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
a law or some sort of bill passed in

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.780 
a law or some sort of bill passed in
2010<00:00:38.870> in<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.020> fall<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.410> 2010<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.100> now<00:00:41.250> pumps

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
2010 in the fall of 2010 that now pumps

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.330 
2010 in the fall of 2010 that now pumps
are<00:00:41.910> able<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.390> put<00:00:42.680> more<00:00:43.680> than<00:00:43.739> 10<00:00:44.040> percent

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
are able to put more than 10 percent

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.420 
are able to put more than 10 percent
ethanol<00:00:44.460> into<00:00:45.000> their<00:00:45.570> pumps<00:00:46.160> some<00:00:47.160> are<00:00:47.309> even

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
ethanol into their pumps some are even

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.910 
ethanol into their pumps some are even
up<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.730> 15<00:00:48.090> percent<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:49.350> problem<00:00:49.770> with

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
up to 15 percent and the problem with

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.279 
up to 15 percent and the problem with
that<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.370> these<00:00:50.579> little<00:00:50.789> motors<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.539> old

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
that is that these little motors and old

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.930 
that is that these little motors and old
even<00:00:52.590> vintage<00:00:52.860> car<00:00:53.039> motors<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.460> general<00:00:53.789> just

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
even vintage car motors in general just

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.680 
even vintage car motors in general just
do<00:00:54.510> not<00:00:54.690> like<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.440> stuff<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.690> what's

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
do not like this stuff and what's

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.720 
do not like this stuff and what's
happening<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.320> ethanol<00:00:58.980> when<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.370> sits<00:00:59.550> for

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
happening is is ethanol when it sits for

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.729 
happening is is ethanol when it sits for
a<00:00:59.789> while<00:00:59.969> in<00:01:00.149> your<00:01:00.180> gas<00:01:00.449> tank<00:01:00.480> what<00:01:01.350> happens<00:01:01.649> is

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
a while in your gas tank what happens is

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.280 
a while in your gas tank what happens is
it<00:01:01.859> creates<00:01:02.070> moisture<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.180> now<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.080> have

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
it creates moisture and now you have

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.109 
it creates moisture and now you have
water<00:01:04.589> kind<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.369> like<00:01:05.549> running<00:01:05.760> through<00:01:05.850> your

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
water kind of like running through your

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.390 
water kind of like running through your
lines<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:07.290> also<00:01:07.439> eats<00:01:07.710> away<00:01:07.890> your<00:01:08.040> lines

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
lines and it also eats away your lines

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.250 
lines and it also eats away your lines
as<00:01:08.640> well<00:01:08.760> if<00:01:08.939> your<00:01:09.060> lines<00:01:09.299> are<00:01:09.570> not<00:01:09.659> made<00:01:10.020> for

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
as well if your lines are not made for

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.929 
as well if your lines are not made for
the<00:01:10.320> ethanol<00:01:10.560> stuff<00:01:10.950> most<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.340> our<00:01:11.400> VW's<00:01:11.850> are

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
the ethanol stuff most of our VW's are

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.920 
the ethanol stuff most of our VW's are
not<00:01:12.590> and<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.799> eats<00:01:14.159> away<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:15.210> lines<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
not and it eats away the the lines the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.450 
not and it eats away the the lines the
metal<00:01:16.140> lines<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.680> even<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.979> rubber<00:01:17.130> lines

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
metal lines and even the rubber lines

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.190 
metal lines and even the rubber lines
now<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.150> gets<00:01:18.299> into<00:01:18.479> your<00:01:18.540> carburetor<00:01:19.080> it

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
now that gets into your carburetor it

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.260 
now that gets into your carburetor it
gets<00:01:19.320> into<00:01:19.530> your<00:01:19.650> fuel<00:01:19.890> pump<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.759> basically

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
gets into your fuel pump so basically

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.120 
gets into your fuel pump so basically
what<00:01:21.479> happens<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.110> your<00:01:22.650> motor<00:01:22.920> is

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
what happens is is that your motor is

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.490 
what happens is is that your motor is
running<00:01:23.369> lean<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.750> when<00:01:24.930> your<00:01:25.049> motor<00:01:25.229> runs

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
running lean so when your motor runs

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.940 
running lean so when your motor runs
lean<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.189> runs<00:01:26.610> hot<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.360> if<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.290> runs<00:01:28.439> hot<00:01:28.560> now

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
lean it runs hot and if it runs hot now

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.350 
lean it runs hot and if it runs hot now
you<00:01:29.009> that's<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:29.820> start<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.150> overheat

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
you that's it and I start to overheat

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.069 
you that's it and I start to overheat
and<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.810> can<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.200> can<00:01:31.320> damage<00:01:31.500> your<00:01:31.710> motor

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
and you can you can damage your motor

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.630 
and you can you can damage your motor
thankfully<00:01:34.079> we<00:01:34.229> came<00:01:34.439> across<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.799> product<00:01:35.430> and

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
thankfully we came across a product and

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.609 
thankfully we came across a product and
only<00:01:36.060> because<00:01:36.479> my<00:01:36.509> father<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.079> landscaper

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
only because my father is a landscaper

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.710 
only because my father is a landscaper
has<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.860> landscaping<00:01:38.100> company<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:39.000> his<00:01:39.420> lawn

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
has a landscaping company and his lawn

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.149 
has a landscaping company and his lawn
mowers<00:01:40.170> have<00:01:40.439> actually<00:01:40.770> been<00:01:40.860> going<00:01:41.040> through

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
mowers have actually been going through

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.600 
mowers have actually been going through
the<00:01:41.280> same<00:01:41.490> problem<00:01:41.939> with<00:01:42.119> ethanol<00:01:42.840> stuff<00:01:43.610> so

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
the same problem with ethanol stuff so

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.819 
the same problem with ethanol stuff so
he<00:01:45.119> went<00:01:45.360> into<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.990> guess<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.320> basic<00:01:46.680> lawnmower

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
he went into I guess a basic lawnmower

every fill up on your beetle we

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.700 
every fill up on your beetle we
basically<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.780> put<00:02:13.200> about<00:02:13.379> two

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
basically I put about two

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.490 
basically I put about two
capfuls<00:02:14.310> in<00:02:14.610> they<00:02:15.120> say<00:02:15.390> about<00:02:15.570> I<00:02:15.780> don't<00:02:16.380> know

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
capfuls in they say about I don't know

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.190 
capfuls in they say about I don't know
one<00:02:17.370> full<00:02:17.640> ounce<00:02:17.820> to<00:02:18.120> every<00:02:18.390> six<00:02:18.690> gallons<00:02:19.080> of

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
one full ounce to every six gallons of

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.620 
one full ounce to every six gallons of
gasoline<00:02:19.460> so<00:02:20.460> if<00:02:20.880> you<00:02:20.970> put<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.210> in<00:02:21.300> a<00:02:21.390> little

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
gasoline so if you put it in a little

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.790 
gasoline so if you put it in a little
more<00:02:21.810> it's<00:02:21.990> believing<00:02:22.380> it's<00:02:22.500> not<00:02:22.590> going<00:02:22.740> to

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
more it's believing it's not going to

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.880 
more it's believing it's not going to
hurt<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.270> try<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.600> do<00:02:24.870> this<00:02:25.110> every<00:02:25.860> time

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
hurt it and I try to do this every time

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.370 
hurt it and I try to do this every time
I<00:02:26.070> fill<00:02:26.400> up<00:02:26.580> because<00:02:26.730> I<00:02:27.270> was<00:02:27.570> noticing<00:02:27.900> with<00:02:28.200> my

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
I fill up because I was noticing with my

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.070 
I fill up because I was noticing with my
55<00:02:29.040> here<00:02:29.460> after<00:02:30.300> running<00:02:30.600> it<00:02:30.690> for<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.900> long

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
55 here after running it for a long

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.600 
55 here after running it for a long
period<00:02:31.410> of<00:02:31.440> time<00:02:31.530> my<00:02:31.860> little<00:02:32.010> oil<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:32.430> was

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
period of time my little oil I was

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.100 
period of time my little oil I was
starting<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:32.880> come<00:02:33.090> on<00:02:33.240> and<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.600> was<00:02:33.720> feeling<00:02:33.960> my

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
starting to come on and I was feeling my

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.190 
starting to come on and I was feeling my
motor<00:02:34.290> actually<00:02:34.470> running<00:02:34.800> hot

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
motor actually running hot

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.470 
motor actually running hot
just<00:02:37.200> what<00:02:37.350> happens<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:37.740> again<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.190> if<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.330> eats

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
just what happens is again it if it eats

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.990 
just what happens is again it if it eats
away<00:02:39.660> all<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.200> lines<00:02:40.470> in<00:02:40.830> your<00:02:41.250> in<00:02:41.610> your<00:02:41.730> car

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
away all the lines in your in your car

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.660 
away all the lines in your in your car
and<00:02:42.900> then<00:02:43.080> little<00:02:43.350> in<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.590> system<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.190> then

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
and then little in the system and then

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.250 
and then little in the system and then
sometimes<00:02:45.090> even<00:02:45.360> if<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:45.690> have<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:45.840> fuel<00:02:46.080> filter

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
sometimes even if you have a fuel filter

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.530 
sometimes even if you have a fuel filter
in<00:02:46.590> there<00:02:46.800> or<00:02:47.100> even<00:02:47.700> have<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:47.940> screen<00:02:48.300> in<00:02:48.510> your

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
in there or even have the screen in your

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.150 
in there or even have the screen in your
gas<00:02:48.870> tank<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:49.290> lot<00:02:49.380> of<00:02:49.500> times<00:02:49.710> this<00:02:49.830> ethanol

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
gas tank a lot of times this ethanol

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.650 
gas tank a lot of times this ethanol
stuff<00:02:50.490> just<00:02:50.670> eats<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:51.090> stuff<00:02:51.360> away<00:02:51.510> and

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
stuff just eats that stuff away and

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.010 
stuff just eats that stuff away and
coagulates<00:02:52.530> things<00:02:52.830> and<00:02:53.070> it'll<00:02:53.610> kind<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:54.020> you

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
coagulates things and it'll kind of you

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.800 
coagulates things and it'll kind of you
know<00:02:55.110> condense<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:57.060> shorten<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.570> space

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
know condense and and shorten the space

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.660 
know condense and and shorten the space
for<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.200> gas<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.650> flow<00:02:58.890> through<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.550> then

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
for the gas to flow through and then

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.890 
for the gas to flow through and then
you're<00:02:59.760> running<00:02:59.910> lean<00:03:00.270> again<00:03:00.540> it's<00:03:00.690> kind<00:03:00.870> of

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
you're running lean again it's kind of

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.350 
you're running lean again it's kind of
it's<00:03:01.080> creating<00:03:01.410> blockage<00:03:01.920> so<00:03:02.700> just<00:03:03.150> kind<00:03:03.330> of

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
it's creating blockage so just kind of

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.610 
it's creating blockage so just kind of
you<00:03:03.510> having<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.780> heart<00:03:03.930> attack<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:04.230> car<00:03:04.530> is

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.950 
this stuff I was hearing some evidence
that<00:03:13.860> electric<00:03:14.610> fuel<00:03:14.850> pumps<00:03:15.210> handle<00:03:15.840> the

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
that electric fuel pumps handle the

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.350 
that electric fuel pumps handle the
ethanol<00:03:16.290> better<00:03:16.770> than<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.610> standard<00:03:18.060> usual

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
ethanol better than the standard usual

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.210 
ethanol better than the standard usual
fuel<00:03:18.630> pump<00:03:18.870> that<00:03:19.020> was<00:03:19.080> on<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.380> VW<00:03:19.830> motors<00:03:20.130> I

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
fuel pump that was on the VW motors I

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.400 
fuel pump that was on the VW motors I
have<00:03:20.340> not<00:03:20.520> tried<00:03:20.700> that<00:03:20.820> out<00:03:20.880> myself<00:03:21.360> yet<00:03:21.690> but<00:03:22.380> I

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
have not tried that out myself yet but I
