 four corners of the country and create a 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.260
 collection with the face of the Brazilian woman 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:31.590

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.900
 very unworthy I was in this place of 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.980
 Bahian woman representing thousands of 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.660

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.400
 but all with one point in common this 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.739

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.500
 life for me is a stage she put the 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:00.330

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.629
 What happens? I was walking in the 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:04.680
 pillory and made me want to take 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.170

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.200
 I've been spinning for example, I also want to 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:15.159
 although a republic with four young people 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.750
 different artists clothing represents my 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.450
 state of mind 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.470

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.539

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:46.929
 in consideration is that you know who is who 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.640
