this<00:03:44.570> this<00:03:45.080> guy<00:03:45.320> yep<00:03:45.740> there<00:03:46.040> you<00:03:46.070> go<00:03:46.220> 201

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
this this guy yep there you go 201

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.960 
this this guy yep there you go 201
seconds<00:03:47.450> and<00:03:48.050> so<00:03:48.350> you<00:03:49.280> can<00:03:49.460> see<00:03:49.610> the<00:03:49.760> huge

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970
