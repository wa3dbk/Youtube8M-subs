00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
welcome to electron line here we're

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.230 
welcome to electron line here we're
going<00:00:02.100> to<00:00:02.190> take<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.370> little<00:00:02.610> closer<00:00:02.790> look<00:00:02.970> on

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
going to take a little closer look on

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.210 
going to take a little closer look on
how<00:00:03.300> we<00:00:03.449> measure<00:00:03.720> the<00:00:04.110> mass<00:00:04.380> and<00:00:04.680> intensity<00:00:05.130> of

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
how we measure the mass and intensity of

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.769 
how we measure the mass and intensity of
the<00:00:05.339> earth<00:00:05.460> now<00:00:05.940> of<00:00:06.060> course<00:00:06.270> remember<00:00:06.509> the

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
the earth now of course remember the

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.740 
the earth now of course remember the
density<00:00:07.200> of<00:00:07.290> any<00:00:07.440> object<00:00:08.090> is<00:00:09.090> simply<00:00:09.300> equal<00:00:09.719> to

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
density of any object is simply equal to

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.749 
density of any object is simply equal to
the<00:00:09.929> ratio<00:00:10.200> of<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.469> mass<00:00:10.679> divided<00:00:11.070> by<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.340> by

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
the ratio of the mass divided by a by

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.799 
the ratio of the mass divided by a by
its<00:00:11.910> volume<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:13.670> so<00:00:14.670> let's<00:00:15.000> first<00:00:15.269> figure<00:00:15.570> out

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
its volume and so let's first figure out

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.920 
its volume and so let's first figure out
how<00:00:15.990> they<00:00:16.250> calculated<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.369> mass<00:00:17.640> so<00:00:18.300> when<00:00:18.810> we

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
how they calculated the mass so when we

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.170 
how they calculated the mass so when we
drop<00:00:19.529> an<00:00:19.710> object<00:00:19.830> above<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.970> Earth's<00:00:21.150> surface

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
drop an object above the Earth's surface

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.150 
drop an object above the Earth's surface
and<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.660> comes<00:00:21.869> down<00:00:22.080> we<00:00:22.439> can<00:00:22.619> measure<00:00:22.800> the

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
and it comes down we can measure the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.820 
and it comes down we can measure the
acceleration<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:24.119> be<00:00:24.240> equal<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.539> G<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.170> when

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
acceleration to be equal to G and when

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.620 
acceleration to be equal to G and when
we<00:00:25.949> experimentally<00:00:26.310> measure<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.180> let's<00:00:27.480> say

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
we experimentally measure that let's say

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.439 
we experimentally measure that let's say
we<00:00:27.779> came<00:00:27.960> out<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.289> being<00:00:28.500> nine<00:00:29.400> point<00:00:29.849> eight<00:00:30.150> oh

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
we came out to being nine point eight oh

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.490 
we came out to being nine point eight oh
five<00:00:30.960> meters<00:00:31.949> per<00:00:32.279> second<00:00:32.969> squared<00:00:33.360> all<00:00:34.290> right

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
five meters per second squared all right

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.650 
five meters per second squared all right
then<00:00:35.040> we<00:00:35.399> plug<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.790> into<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.149> equation

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
then we plug that into the equation

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.410 
then we plug that into the equation
where<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.290> force<00:00:37.620> due<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.670> acceleration

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
where the force due to the acceleration

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
where the force due to the acceleration
to<00:00:39.540> gravity<00:00:39.570> equals<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.770> force<00:00:41.239> duty<00:00:42.440> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
to gravity equals the force duty the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.020 
to gravity equals the force duty the
force<00:00:43.649> between<00:00:43.920> any<00:00:44.219> two<00:00:44.489> objects<00:00:44.940> in

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
force between any two objects in

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.340 
force between any two objects in
universe<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:46.110> we<00:00:46.410> say<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:47.039> MA<00:00:47.520> or<00:00:47.780> mg<00:00:48.780> is

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
universe so we say that the MA or mg is

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.840 
universe so we say that the MA or mg is
equal<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:50.360> G<00:00:51.360> times<00:00:52.050> M<00:00:52.410> Big<00:00:53.070> M<00:00:53.250> divided<00:00:53.730> by<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
equal to G times M Big M divided by the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.459 
equal to G times M Big M divided by the
distance<00:00:54.180> between<00:00:54.420> them<00:00:54.840> squared<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.320> with

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
distance between them squared so with

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.610 
distance between them squared so with
the<00:00:55.949> force<00:00:56.370> due<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.730> Newton's<00:00:57.180> law<00:00:57.320> equals<00:00:58.320> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
the force due to Newton's law equals the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.279 
the force due to Newton's law equals the
universal<00:00:59.219> force<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.730> gravity<00:01:00.660> set<00:01:00.989> those<00:01:01.140> two

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
universal force of gravity set those two

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.290 
universal force of gravity set those two
equal<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.590> each<00:01:01.710> other<00:01:01.920> right<00:01:02.760> away<00:01:02.879> we<00:01:03.180> can

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
equal to each other right away we can

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.420 
equal to each other right away we can
see<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.220> masses<00:01:05.299> of<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.869> object<00:01:07.430> cancel

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
see that the masses of the object cancel

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.160 
see that the masses of the object cancel
out<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:08.909> now<00:01:09.299> all<00:01:09.330> we<00:01:09.570> have<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.750> do<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:09.900> find

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
out and so now all we have to do is find

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.080 
out and so now all we have to do is find
the<00:01:10.290> mass<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> earth<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.400> solve<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.880> for

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
the mass of the earth so solve that for

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.980 
the mass of the earth so solve that for
M<00:01:12.270> we<00:01:12.479> get<00:01:12.659> M<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:13.470> equal<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:13.950> G<00:01:14.490> times<00:01:15.030> R<00:01:15.479> squared

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
M we get M is equal to G times R squared

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.230 
M we get M is equal to G times R squared
divided<00:01:16.560> by<00:01:16.710> big<00:01:16.950> G<00:01:17.220> moving<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> R<00:01:17.939> square

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
divided by big G moving the R square

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.660 
divided by big G moving the R square

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
over here the big G down here now flip

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.700 
over here the big G down here now flip
the<00:01:20.820> equation<00:01:20.939> around<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.530> course

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
the equation around and that of course

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.660 
the equation around and that of course
is<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:22.979> one<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.400> will<00:01:23.549> go<00:01:23.759> up<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.360> here<00:01:25.670> so

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
is the one that will go up in here so

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.429 
is the one that will go up in here so
first<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.210> all<00:01:27.330> let's<00:01:27.750> calculate<00:01:28.049> what<00:01:28.409> that

thousand meters and we have to square

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.139 
thousand meters and we have to square
that<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.680> we<00:01:43.979> divide<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.340> whole<00:01:44.399> thing<00:01:44.490> by<00:01:44.729> G

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.930 
terms of grams but in terms of kilograms
it's<00:03:40.980> about<00:03:41.220> 2600<00:03:42.500> kilograms<00:03:43.500> per<00:03:43.940> cubic

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
it's about 2600 kilograms per cubic

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.760 
it's about 2600 kilograms per cubic

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
meter of course that depends upon what

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.410 
meter of course that depends upon what
metal<00:03:55.770> we're<00:03:55.920> dealing<00:03:56.280> with<00:03:56.310> here<00:03:56.640> but<00:03:56.850> we

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
metal we're dealing with here but we

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.480 
metal we're dealing with here but we
think<00:03:57.450> it's<00:03:57.810> primarily<00:03:58.020> iron<00:03:58.620> nickel<00:03:59.040> and<00:03:59.280> so

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
think it's primarily iron nickel and so

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.100 
think it's primarily iron nickel and so
forth<00:03:59.820> then<00:04:00.240> you<00:04:00.270> can<00:04:00.510> see<00:04:00.630> that<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.930> average

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
forth then you can see that the average

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.949 
forth then you can see that the average
of<00:04:01.350> those<00:04:01.500> numbers<00:04:01.560> is<00:04:02.150> approximately<00:04:03.150> 5,500

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
of those numbers is approximately 5,500

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.130 
of those numbers is approximately 5,500

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
density is actually higher because

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.650 
density is actually higher because

the earth is made up of about half rock
and<00:04:16.830> half<00:04:17.340> metal<00:04:17.790> and<00:04:17.970> that's<00:04:18.359> how<00:04:18.510> we<00:04:18.570> figure

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
and half metal and that's how we figure

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.560 
and half metal and that's how we figure
that<00:04:19.020> out<00:04:19.080> okay<00:04:19.440> so<00:04:20.370> now<00:04:20.730> you<00:04:20.790> can<00:04:20.970> see<00:04:21.150> how<00:04:21.510> we

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
that out okay so now you can see how we

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.540 
that out okay so now you can see how we
can<00:04:21.810> use<00:04:22.020> the<00:04:22.229> universal<00:04:22.500> equation<00:04:23.130> gravity

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
can use the universal equation gravity

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.670 
can use the universal equation gravity
to<00:04:23.940> determine<00:04:24.450> the<00:04:24.570> density<00:04:24.750> of<00:04:25.169> the<00:04:25.650> earth

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
to determine the density of the earth

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.540 
to determine the density of the earth
and<00:04:26.010> also<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.790> approximate

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
and also the approximate

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.099 
and also the approximate
of<00:04:27.879> the<00:04:28.060> earth<00:04:28.289> all<00:04:29.289> interesting<00:04:29.889> stuff
