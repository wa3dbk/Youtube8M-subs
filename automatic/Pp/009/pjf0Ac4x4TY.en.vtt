00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.740

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.740
 I can fix it 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.169
 time to close last game all 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.169
 outside 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.490
 two 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.579
 my name is breaking, I've been doing it for 30 years 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.570
 this 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:41.250
 and it's hard to enjoy your work when 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.250
 nobody else likes what you do 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.899
 it must be good that to be the good 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:54.280
 many real thanks as bad as we are 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.280
 all that we understand 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.480

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.480
 it means that you are wrong 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.049
 zhang made the labels do not give you 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.049
 the happiness 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.439
 I do not want to be evil anymore 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.300

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.140
 and the one who breaks everything go to the 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.140
 thin seasons 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.270
 everything is going to change now 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.260
 where they will be expected as they speak 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.260
 these little birds 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.580
 real has gone to subtle spin 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.030
 to break rolls and you because you're tamega 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.770
 invest threatening entities stop 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.960
 play the classics and let's give them 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.159
 cane since when video games are from 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.670
 slow action 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:12.010
 I try to be nice you are imitating 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.150
 imitating is a rude and this 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.150
 conversation is over 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.310
