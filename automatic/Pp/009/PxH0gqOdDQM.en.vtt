00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:13.910 

I<00:00:11.269> think<00:00:12.269> what's<00:00:12.450> important<00:00:13.080> about<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.710> camp

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
at this

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.210 
at this
I<00:01:40.960> think<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.079> friends<00:01:42.380> you<00:01:42.470> meet<00:01:42.619> at<00:01:42.740> camp<00:01:43.009> are

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
I think the friends you meet at camp are

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.560 
I think the friends you meet at camp are
special<00:01:43.670> because<00:01:43.759> you<00:01:44.030> meet<00:01:44.210> them<00:01:44.390> in<00:01:44.479> an

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
special because you meet them in an

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.300 
special because you meet them in an
environment<00:01:45.110> where<00:01:45.200> you<00:01:45.259> are<00:01:45.530> yourself<00:01:45.979> so

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
environment where you are yourself so

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.929 
environment where you are yourself so
they<00:01:47.149> know<00:01:47.390> who<00:01:47.780> you<00:01:47.840> are<00:01:47.990> instead<00:01:48.590> of<00:01:48.740> who

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
they know who you are instead of who

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.080 
they know who you are instead of who
maybe<00:01:49.939> you<00:01:50.600> pretend<00:01:51.500> to<00:01:51.619> be<00:01:51.710> or<00:01:52.189> if<00:01:52.549> you're

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
maybe you pretend to be or if you're

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.940 
maybe you pretend to be or if you're
being<00:01:53.299> shy<00:01:53.659> because<00:01:54.170> you<00:01:54.289> can't<00:01:54.590> really<00:01:54.740> be

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
being shy because you can't really be

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.950 
being shy because you can't really be
shy<00:01:55.159> at<00:01:55.310> camp<00:01:55.549> after<00:01:55.729> the<00:01:55.970> first<00:01:56.180> few<00:01:56.329> days<00:01:56.570> so

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
shy at camp after the first few days so

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.590 
shy at camp after the first few days so
you're<00:01:57.920> yourself<00:01:58.430> with<00:01:58.640> them<00:01:58.820> and<00:01:59.060> you<00:01:59.420> make

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
you're yourself with them and you make

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.950 
you're yourself with them and you make
lasting<00:02:00.380> friendship<00:02:00.890> instead<00:02:01.159> of<00:02:01.960> something

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
lasting friendship instead of something

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.889 
lasting friendship instead of something
that's<00:02:03.170> on<00:02:03.439> the<00:02:03.950> surface<00:02:04.130> it's<00:02:05.000> a<00:02:05.390> more

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
that's on the surface it's a more

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.100 
that's on the surface it's a more
natural<00:02:06.409> sort<00:02:06.710> of<00:02:06.799> friendship<00:02:07.490> I<00:02:07.610> guess<00:02:08.110> the

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
natural sort of friendship I guess the

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.930 
natural sort of friendship I guess the
three<00:02:09.289> things<00:02:09.590> i<00:02:09.830> like<00:02:09.979> about<00:02:10.009> camp<00:02:10.580> is<00:02:10.819> you
