00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.110
 Pretty neat the food cold by 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.329

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.149
 You know you will not have time to have lunch. 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.480
 Look how beautiful this salad is

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.180

 She looks beautiful and healthy. She knows well. 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.750
 You know the lunch box, with a little something 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.689
 This is an acerola juice with enough 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.820
 vitamin c in this small lunch then the 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.439
 person will exhibit to leave home only 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.360
 have a meal in the morning she will have 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.970
 what to have lunch and your afternoon snack outside 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.100
 from home without and without any time she already 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.830
 made lunch 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.159
 the dessert fruity and teaching store 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.380
 in the video and here the afternoon snack 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.759
 the cereal with yogurt that people 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.130
 times found in the 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.470
 industrialized so ready only until 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.689
 brought is interesting to show that 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.180
 have the sugar of the people choose a 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.570
 cereal that is sugar free 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.710
 I improve because it is better understood 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.649
 better for health 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.079
 Now this is the lunchbox diet for 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.810
 you take everything that is healthy for the 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.280
 your day and do not get hungry and 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.720
 that feeling of weight to eat everything 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.310
 after i'm starving 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.649
 I have not eaten in a long time. 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.079
 It has two effects going without food causes 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.750
 that the metabolism falls so I do not know 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.579
 what is it if she fails to state that 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.250
 lose weight slowly 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:11.970
 then if for example the weight loss would be 5 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.819
 kilos in a month she slims 2 doing the 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.939
 times the same amount of calories 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.909
 only with very large spaces so 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:22.909
 the more you eat is not 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:25.310
 during the day a short period of time 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:27.170
 shall be every three hours that the 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.060
 metabolism acts faster on you 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.400
 lose weight faster exactly one 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.049
 encouragement is arriving fuel 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.450
 we do not have to go into economic mode 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.340
 of calorie expenditure then it goes into 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.170
 The weather is not very economical. 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.079
 burn enough to know that from here 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.879
 three more hours and will insert and there 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.980
 You are joining grease here, fat. 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.959
 there and you lose weight that fat 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.000
 here is another defense 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.639
 not how we are going to form a 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.010
 reserve a defense for her by the time she 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:57.379
 she fails to eat with much time 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.909
 here is that and storage 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:00.799
 only he's going to stay, everybody's alone. 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.739
 Are you going to love your moment in Brazil? 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:08.829
