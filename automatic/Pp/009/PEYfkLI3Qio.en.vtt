00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.490 

so<00:01:24.470> here<00:01:25.010> it<00:01:25.130> is<00:01:25.280> after<00:01:25.550> one<00:01:26.150> light<00:01:26.540> coat<00:01:26.990> I

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
so here it is after one light coat I

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.530 
so here it is after one light coat I
don't<00:01:28.220> actually<00:01:28.430> know<00:01:28.820> if<00:01:29.000> I<00:01:29.090> got<00:01:29.240> this<00:01:29.390> on

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
don't actually know if I got this on

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.810 
don't actually know if I got this on
video<00:01:29.979> because<00:01:30.979> I<00:01:31.010> did<00:01:31.250> get<00:01:31.400> a<00:01:31.460> text<00:01:31.760> message

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
video because I did get a text message

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.570 
video because I did get a text message
so<00:01:32.630> it<00:01:32.750> kind<00:01:32.960> of<00:01:33.050> interrupted<00:01:33.590> it<00:01:33.710> but<00:01:34.310> this<00:01:34.400> is

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
so it kind of interrupted it but this is

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.280 
so it kind of interrupted it but this is
what<00:01:34.790> it<00:01:35.570> looks<00:01:36.259> like<00:01:36.440> with<00:01:36.680> night<00:01:36.950> shades<00:01:37.280> and

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
what it looks like with night shades and

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.200 
what it looks like with night shades and
that<00:01:39.290> is<00:01:39.440> without<00:01:39.590> so<00:01:40.400> I'm<00:01:40.700> going<00:01:40.850> to<00:01:40.940> give<00:01:41.090> it

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
that is without so I'm going to give it

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.859 
that is without so I'm going to give it
a<00:01:41.330> little<00:01:41.600> bit<00:01:42.020> more<00:01:43.060> like<00:01:44.060> right<00:01:44.390> here<00:01:44.750> in

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
a little bit more like right here in

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.960 
a little bit more like right here in
this<00:01:44.990> general<00:01:45.259> area<00:01:45.680> just<00:01:46.520> to<00:01:46.610> give<00:01:46.790> it<00:01:46.820> a

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
this general area just to give it a

00:01:46.970 --> 00:02:09.100 
this general area just to give it a
little<00:01:47.149> bit<00:01:47.330> more<00:01:47.540> darker<00:01:48.140> look

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.040 

yep<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.679> like<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.310> way<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.700> looks<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.420> think

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
yep so I like the way that looks I think

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.220 
yep so I like the way that looks I think
it<00:02:13.170> looks<00:02:13.380> pretty<00:02:13.980> aggressive<00:02:15.110> compared<00:02:16.110> to

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
it looks pretty aggressive compared to

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.820 
it looks pretty aggressive compared to
the<00:02:16.380> original<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:18.170> you<00:02:19.170> know<00:02:19.260> I'm<00:02:19.530> gonna<00:02:19.680> do

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
the same thing to this side to the other

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.920 
the same thing to this side to the other
side<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:21.930> if<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.620> guys<00:02:22.739> like<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:24.690> way<00:02:24.810> it

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
side and if you guys like the way it

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.750 
side and if you guys like the way it
looks<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.410> know<00:02:26.010> leave<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.459> comments

below<00:02:27.080> but<00:02:28.080> that's<00:02:28.260> pretty<00:02:28.380> much<00:02:28.500> how<00:02:28.769> you<00:02:28.800> use

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
below but that's pretty much how you use

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.949 
below but that's pretty much how you use
a<00:02:29.720> nightshades

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
a nightshades

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.920 
a nightshades
it's<00:02:31.500> easy<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.220> of<00:02:32.849> course<00:02:33.090> once<00:02:33.330> it<00:02:33.420> dries<00:02:33.660> it

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
it's easy and of course once it dries it

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.930 
it's easy and of course once it dries it
looks<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.590> lot<00:02:34.709> nice<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.280> can<00:02:35.400> buff<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.819> out

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
looks a lot nice and you can buff it out

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.240 
looks a lot nice and you can buff it out
and<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.180> gives<00:02:36.269> it<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.510> real<00:02:36.690> nice<00:02:36.840> shine<00:02:37.250> other

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
and it gives it a real nice shine other

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.370 
and it gives it a real nice shine other
than<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.549> it's<00:02:38.790> pretty<00:02:39.030> simple<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:39.900> this<00:02:40.200> is

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
than that it's pretty simple and this is

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.170 
than that it's pretty simple and this is
permanent<00:02:40.739> so<00:02:41.069> that's<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.489> only<00:02:41.670> downfall

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
permanent so that's the only downfall

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.390 
permanent so that's the only downfall
once<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:42.840> put<00:02:42.989> it<00:02:43.080> on<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.709> actually<00:02:43.890> can't

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
once you put it on you actually can't

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.059 
once you put it on you actually can't
take<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:44.819> off<00:02:44.970> unless<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:45.930> sand<00:02:46.410> it<00:02:46.560> down<00:02:46.620> or

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
take it off unless you sand it down or

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.430 
take it off unless you sand it down or
something<00:02:47.250> but<00:02:48.120> we<00:02:48.870> try<00:02:49.049> to<00:02:49.110> give<00:02:49.319> you<00:02:49.410> guys

going<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.000> begin<00:03:12.120> with<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:13.079> other<00:03:13.590> side<00:03:13.950> and

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
going to begin with the other side and

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.340 
going to begin with the other side and
we're<00:03:15.450> going<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.630> do<00:03:15.810> is<00:03:15.959> we're<00:03:16.079> going<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.230> try

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
we're going to do is we're going to try

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.590 
we're going to do is we're going to try
to<00:03:16.410> give<00:03:16.650> an<00:03:16.799> even<00:03:17.100> coat<00:03:17.519> so<00:03:18.060> that<00:03:18.090> it<00:03:18.359> looks

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
to give an even coat so that it looks

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.640 
to give an even coat so that it looks
just<00:03:18.720> like<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.470> left<00:03:19.680> side<00:03:21.410> okay

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
just like the left side okay

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.059 
just like the left side okay
so<00:03:23.069> again<00:03:23.750> we're<00:03:24.750> going<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:24.989> give<00:03:25.170> it<00:03:25.319> a<00:03:25.470> test

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
so again we're going to give it a test

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.430 
so again we're going to give it a test
spray<00:03:26.459> down<00:03:26.730> here<00:03:27.180> you<00:03:27.959> can<00:03:28.109> see<00:03:28.260> that<00:03:28.410> a

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
spray down here you can see that a

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:43.160 
spray down here you can see that a
spring<00:03:28.769> evenly

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:51.270 

okay<00:03:45.720> so<00:03:47.040> maybe<00:03:48.040> just<00:03:48.160> a<00:03:48.760> little<00:03:49.180> bit<00:03:50.280> more

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280
