here and later you will see that how

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.440 
here and later you will see that how
powerful<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.140> like<00:01:58.729> take<00:01:59.729> this<00:01:59.939> they're

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
powerful it is like take this they're

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.420 
powerful it is like take this they're
just<00:02:00.689> gonna<00:02:01.140> die<00:02:01.380> really<00:02:01.619> fast<00:02:01.820> and<00:02:04.009> yes<00:02:05.009> right

just gonna die really fast and yes right
here<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:06.210> gold<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.920> code<00:02:08.129> fun<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.879> guess<00:02:09.239> you

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
here the gold the code fun I guess you

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.820 
here the gold the code fun I guess you
can<00:02:09.569> call<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:11.390> it's<00:02:12.390> still<00:02:12.720> slow<00:02:13.050> but

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
can call it I it's still slow but

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.890 
can call it I it's still slow but
if<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.370> upgrade<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:15.150> can<00:02:15.180> like<00:02:15.570> kind<00:02:15.870> of

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
if you upgrade you can like kind of

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.190 
if you upgrade you can like kind of
really<00:02:16.230> fast<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.740> so<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:18.320> mean<00:02:19.320> and<00:02:20.510> oh<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.990> one

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
really fast and so I mean and oh and one

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.490 
really fast and so I mean and oh and one
of<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.470> other<00:02:22.500> strategy<00:02:23.130> is<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.600> if<00:02:24.600> you

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
of the other strategy is that if you

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.250 
of the other strategy is that if you
have<00:02:25.560> resources<00:02:26.160> don't<00:02:26.700> save<00:02:26.970> up<00:02:27.240> don't<00:02:28.080> save

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
have resources don't save up don't save

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.520 
have resources don't save up don't save
it<00:02:28.290> up<00:02:28.500> just<00:02:28.710> use<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.160> you<00:02:29.340> solve<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:30.530> doesn't

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
it up just use it you solve it doesn't

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.110 
it up just use it you solve it doesn't
matter<00:02:31.680> if<00:02:31.770> you<00:02:31.980> don't<00:02:32.340> have<00:02:32.460> resources<00:02:32.610> just

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
matter if you don't have resources just

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.270 
matter if you don't have resources just

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
the buildings will be easier just put

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
all of them like right over here so that

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.180 
all of them like right over here so that
they<00:04:24.240> were<00:04:24.360> like<00:04:24.539> list<00:04:24.810> i<00:04:25.020> do<00:04:25.740> you<00:04:25.890> see<00:04:26.039> how

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
they were like list i do you see how

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.230 
they were like list i do you see how
when<00:04:26.430> you

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
when you

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.370 
when you
try<00:04:28.080> to<00:04:28.139> destroy<00:04:28.680> a<00:04:29.419> building<00:04:30.419> they<00:04:30.870> all<00:04:31.080> go<00:04:31.319> to

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
try to destroy a building they all go to

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.249 
try to destroy a building they all go to
a<00:04:31.770> bag<00:04:32.039> they<00:04:32.250> all<00:04:32.400> line<00:04:32.639> up<00:04:32.669> and<00:04:33.030> stuff<00:04:33.259> that's

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
a bag they all line up and stuff that's

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.740 
a bag they all line up and stuff that's
like<00:04:34.500> kind<00:04:34.710> of<00:04:34.860> way<00:04:35.370> our<00:04:35.580> waste<00:04:36.000> waste<00:04:36.360> of<00:04:36.539> time

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
like kind of way our waste waste of time

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.320 
like kind of way our waste waste of time
so<00:04:37.349> when<00:04:38.099> you<00:04:38.220> like<00:04:38.430> go<00:04:39.419> closer<00:04:41.030> they<00:04:42.030> can<00:04:42.180> like

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
so when you like go closer they can like

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.870 
so when you like go closer they can like
all<00:04:42.509> fire<00:04:42.930> at<00:04:43.259> once<00:04:43.500> well<00:04:44.099> I<00:04:44.130> didn't<00:04:44.580> do<00:04:44.729> it

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
all fire at once well I didn't do it

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.240 
all fire at once well I didn't do it

resources get a lot of villagers and my

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.809 
resources get a lot of villagers and my
strategy<00:06:09.780> is<00:06:09.900> just<00:06:10.169> kind<00:06:10.710> of<00:06:10.830> still<00:06:11.460> getting<00:06:11.759> a

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:11.819 
strategy is just kind of still getting a

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:14.870 
strategy is just kind of still getting a
lot<00:06:11.849> of<00:06:12.000> villagers<00:06:12.479> but<00:06:12.830> use<00:06:13.830> all<00:06:14.130> the<00:06:14.340> card

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
lot of villagers but use all the card

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.279 
lot of villagers but use all the card
that<00:06:15.150> is<00:06:15.509> for<00:06:16.340> soldiers<00:06:17.340> because<00:06:18.169> that's<00:06:19.169> the

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:19.289 
that is for soldiers because that's the

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:23.510 
that is for soldiers because that's the
fastest<00:06:19.710> way<00:06:19.740> to<00:06:19.979> do<00:06:20.400> it<00:06:20.580> and<00:06:20.759> actually<00:06:22.190> well<00:06:23.190> I

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 
fastest way to do it and actually well I

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.059 
fastest way to do it and actually well I
was<00:06:23.909> kind<00:06:24.120> of<00:06:24.180> stupid<00:06:24.419> but<00:06:24.900> if<00:06:25.169> you<00:06:25.409> do<00:06:25.710> all<00:06:25.919> the

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:26.069 
was kind of stupid but if you do all the

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:30.170 
was kind of stupid but if you do all the
trade<00:06:26.490> spot<00:06:26.789> and<00:06:27.120> get<00:06:27.569> a<00:06:27.599> lot<00:06:27.930> of<00:06:29.180> experience

trade spot and get a lot of experience

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.520 
trade spot and get a lot of experience
experience<00:06:31.009> you<00:06:32.009> can<00:06:32.190> actually<00:06:32.370> use<00:06:32.880> all<00:06:33.530> use

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.530 
experience you can actually use all use
