actually was in the incubator and he's

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:09.530 
actually was in the incubator and he's
going<00:00:08.670> to<00:00:08.760> go<00:00:08.849> back<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.120> get<00:00:09.240> it<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.389> get

going to go back and get it and get

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.180 
going to go back and get it and get
better<00:00:09.690> in<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:09.900> few<00:00:10.080> minutes<00:00:10.380> but<00:00:10.590> what

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
better in a few minutes but what

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.890 
better in a few minutes but what
happened<00:00:11.519> was<00:00:11.639> that<00:00:11.910> sometimes<00:00:12.120> when<00:00:12.690> a

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
happened was that sometimes when a

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.320 
happened was that sometimes when a
button<00:00:13.259> quill<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.950> hatching<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:15.059> really

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
button quill is hatching it really

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.060 
button quill is hatching it really
shouldn't<00:00:15.540> take<00:00:15.809> them<00:00:15.990> that<00:00:16.109> long<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.560> hatch

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
shouldn't take them that long to hatch

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.640 
shouldn't take them that long to hatch
they<00:00:17.490> should<00:00:17.670> actually<00:00:17.850> probably<00:00:18.180> hatch<00:00:18.779> from

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
they should actually probably hatch from

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.130 
they should actually probably hatch from
the<00:00:19.859> moment<00:00:20.430> they<00:00:20.550> start<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.970> peep<00:00:21.240> Alder

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
the moment they start to peep Alder

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.950 
the moment they start to peep Alder
around<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:23.070> round<00:00:23.970> part<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.510> egg<00:00:24.689> they

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
around the round part of the egg they

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.420 
around the round part of the egg they
should<00:00:25.170> be<00:00:25.320> kind<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.710> going<00:00:25.949> around<00:00:26.250> in

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
should be kind of going around in

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.990 
should be kind of going around in
circles<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:27.090> breaking<00:00:27.810> their<00:00:27.960> way<00:00:28.080> out<00:00:28.320> and

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
circles and breaking their way out and

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.310 
circles and breaking their way out and
this<00:00:30.000> little<00:00:30.119> button<00:00:30.390> quill<00:00:30.630> can<00:00:30.929> no<00:00:31.050> longer

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
this little button quill can no longer

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.889 
this little button quill can no longer
hatch<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.279> reason<00:00:32.579> why<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:32.850> because<00:00:33.120> this

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
hatch and the reason why is because this

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.229 
hatch and the reason why is because this
part<00:00:34.260> here<00:00:34.469> has<00:00:34.620> dehydrated<00:00:35.489> once<00:00:36.090> it

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
part here has dehydrated once it

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.360 
part here has dehydrated once it
dehydrates<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.079> actually<00:00:37.500> shrinks<00:00:38.129> like<00:00:38.340> a

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
dehydrates it actually shrinks like a

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.000 
dehydrates it actually shrinks like a
shrink<00:00:38.760> wrap<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.750> baby<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.170> still<00:00:40.350> inside

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
shrink wrap and the baby is still inside

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.600 
shrink wrap and the baby is still inside

seconds<00:04:36.770> but<00:04:37.669> quills<00:04:38.030> should<00:04:38.330> really<00:04:38.690> hatch

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
seconds but quills should really hatch

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.050 
seconds but quills should really hatch
probably<00:04:39.919> within<00:04:40.100> three<00:04:40.520> minutes<00:04:40.669> of

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
make sure he pulls away because there

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.719 
make sure he pulls away because there
you<00:05:09.020> go<00:05:09.169> you<00:05:09.229> see<00:05:09.440> that<00:05:09.590> little<00:05:09.890> T<00:05:10.160> piece<00:05:10.550> right

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
you go you see that little T piece right

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:12.820 
you go you see that little T piece right
there<00:05:10.790> that's<00:05:11.750> actually<00:05:11.930> still<00:05:12.320> attached<00:05:12.650> to

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
there that's actually still attached to

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.800 
there that's actually still attached to
him<00:05:13.070> and<00:05:13.220> you<00:05:14.000> don't<00:05:14.090> want<00:05:14.270> to<00:05:14.330> pull<00:05:14.510> that<00:05:14.540> off

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
him and you don't want to pull that off

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.440 
him and you don't want to pull that off
because<00:05:15.050> if<00:05:15.260> you<00:05:15.380> do<00:05:15.560> it<00:05:16.250> could<00:05:16.520> give<00:05:17.270> him<00:05:17.419> a

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
because if you do it could give him a

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.080 
because if you do it could give him a
little<00:05:17.570> infection<00:05:18.080> he<00:05:18.169> could<00:05:18.320> die<00:05:18.470> so<00:05:19.090> that's

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
little infection he could die so that's

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.529 
little infection he could die so that's
why<00:05:20.240> they<00:05:20.479> sit<00:05:20.690> still<00:05:21.039> they<00:05:22.039> kind<00:05:22.280> of<00:05:22.310> just

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
why they sit still they kind of just

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:26.500 
why they sit still they kind of just
exhausted<00:05:23.539> for<00:05:23.660> one<00:05:23.870> they're<00:05:24.770> cold<00:05:25.330> he's<00:05:26.330> not
