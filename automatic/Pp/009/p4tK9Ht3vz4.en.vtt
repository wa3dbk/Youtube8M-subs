Thomas but see my dam is just 22 instead

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.330 
Thomas but see my dam is just 22 instead
of<00:02:09.140> 21<00:02:09.410> 6<00:02:09.800> plus<00:02:09.950> 6<00:02:10.160> is<00:02:10.429> 12<00:02:10.610> 12<00:02:10.970> plus<00:02:11.180> 9<00:02:11.569> is<00:02:11.840> 21<00:02:12.340> but

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
of 21 6 plus 6 is 12 12 plus 9 is 21 but

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.190 
of 21 6 plus 6 is 12 12 plus 9 is 21 but
because<00:02:13.700> these<00:02:13.940> stats<00:02:14.330> are<00:02:14.510> so<00:02:14.690> high<00:02:14.900> it<00:02:15.050> gives

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
because these stats are so high it gives

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.100 
because these stats are so high it gives

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
1% now I would have that but I kind of

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.030 
1% now I would have that but I kind of
didn't<00:02:20.840> have<00:02:20.900> to<00:02:21.290> doubt<00:02:21.410> as<00:02:21.590> much<00:02:21.740> because
