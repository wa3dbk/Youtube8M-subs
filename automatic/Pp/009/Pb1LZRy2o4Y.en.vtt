00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
I just came out I always get asked what

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.749 
I just came out I always get asked what
was<00:00:04.290> the<00:00:04.350> inspiration<00:00:04.830> what<00:00:05.490> was<00:00:05.520> the

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
was the inspiration what was the

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.130 
was the inspiration what was the
experience<00:00:06.000> where<00:00:06.569> did<00:00:06.720> you<00:00:06.839> get<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.109> idea

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
experience where did you get the idea

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.730 
experience where did you get the idea
and<00:00:07.710> I<00:00:08.550> always<00:00:08.790> been<00:00:09.090> sort<00:00:09.330> of<00:00:09.450> baffled<00:00:10.230> even

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
and I always been sort of baffled even

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.620 
and I always been sort of baffled even
though<00:00:10.889> they<00:00:11.370> asked<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.730> question<00:00:12.120> over<00:00:12.599> and

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
though they asked the question over and

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.789 
though they asked the question over and
over<00:00:12.719> so<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:13.019> do<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.230> think<00:00:13.410> i<00:00:13.469> would<00:00:13.590> have<00:00:13.710> an

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
over so I do you think i would have an

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.799 
over so I do you think i would have an
answer<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.280> decided<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:14.940> my<00:00:15.120> new<00:00:15.389> answer

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
answer and decided that my new answer

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.700 
answer and decided that my new answer
and<00:00:15.960> because<00:00:16.830> of<00:00:16.859> Scott<00:00:17.279> who<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.640> my<00:00:17.880> husband

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
and because of Scott who is my husband

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.740 
and because of Scott who is my husband
because<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:20.609> opening<00:00:21.060> scenes<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.570> match

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
because the opening scenes of match

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.040 
because the opening scenes of match
banquet<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.590> based<00:00:23.340> very<00:00:23.850> very<00:00:24.240> largely<00:00:24.689> on

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
banquet is based very very largely on

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.599 
banquet is based very very largely on
the<00:00:25.289> experience<00:00:25.769> that<00:00:25.859> he<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.400> had

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
the experience that he and I had

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.330 
the experience that he and I had
chaperoning<00:00:27.330> junior<00:00:27.689> prom<00:00:27.900> together<00:00:28.340> that's

when I was teaching High School in Provo

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.319 
when I was teaching High School in Provo

was a conversation that triggered the

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.670 
was a conversation that triggered the
idea<00:02:32.340> well<00:02:33.299> whether<00:02:33.569> the<00:02:33.989> government<00:02:34.410> got<00:02:34.500> to

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
idea well whether the government got to

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.160

married how many children is Magic

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.180 
married how many children is Magic
everything<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.079> certainly<00:02:43.560> it's<00:02:43.739> not<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:43.950> new

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
everything and certainly it's not a new

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.800 
everything and certainly it's not a new
idea<00:02:44.220> i<00:02:44.549> mean<00:02:44.579> that<00:02:44.910> Cheney<00:02:45.180> has<00:02:45.420> been<00:02:45.599> around

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
idea i mean that Cheney has been around

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.869 
idea i mean that Cheney has been around
for<00:02:46.049> a<00:02:46.079> long<00:02:46.170> time<00:02:46.230> but<00:02:47.010> Scott<00:02:47.340> was<00:02:47.489> definitely

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
for a long time but Scott was definitely

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.520 
for a long time but Scott was definitely
the<00:02:47.970> one<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.299> thought<00:02:48.480> maybe<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.410> could

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
the one that thought maybe you could

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.600 
the one that thought maybe you could
write<00:02:49.680> an<00:02:49.829> algorithm<00:02:50.160> for<00:02:50.459> that<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:51.329> I<00:02:51.360> picked

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
write an algorithm for that so I picked

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.770 
write an algorithm for that so I picked
any<00:02:53.610> time<00:02:55.730> but<00:02:56.730> he<00:02:56.849> was<00:02:56.879> great<00:02:57.120> at<00:02:57.180> this<00:02:57.450> one

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
any time but he was great at this one

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.509 
any time but he was great at this one
more<00:02:57.989> experience<00:02:58.410> that<00:02:58.620> I<00:02:58.799> think<00:02:59.190> probably

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
more experience that I think probably

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.119 
more experience that I think probably
played<00:02:59.970> in<00:03:00.180> on<00:03:00.299> some<00:03:00.510> of<00:03:00.540> livin<00:03:00.989> on<00:03:01.110> level<00:03:01.410> two

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
played in on some of livin on level two

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:03.650 
played in on some of livin on level two
right<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.670> having<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.030> idea<00:03:03.299> come<00:03:03.540> to

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
right to having the idea come to

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.780 
right to having the idea come to
fruition<00:03:03.840> for<00:03:04.079> the<00:03:04.290> book<00:03:04.470> was<00:03:05.069> when<00:03:05.340> he<00:03:05.549> and<00:03:05.700> I

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
fruition for the book was when he and I

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.759 
fruition for the book was when he and I
