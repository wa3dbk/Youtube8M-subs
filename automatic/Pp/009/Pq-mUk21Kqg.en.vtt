00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
and the gameplay honestly blew me away I

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.179 
and the gameplay honestly blew me away I
was<00:00:21.750> expecting<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.380> lot<00:00:22.590> from<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:23.010> but<00:00:23.130> I

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
was expecting a lot from it but I

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.759 
was expecting a lot from it but I
honestly<00:00:23.400> wasn't<00:00:23.880> expecting<00:00:24.230> this<00:00:25.230> much<00:00:25.500> like

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
honestly wasn't expecting this much like

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.710 
honestly wasn't expecting this much like
it<00:00:25.890> was<00:00:26.070> nearly<00:00:26.400> flawless<00:00:26.880> from<00:00:27.330> this<00:00:27.510> game

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
it was nearly flawless from this game

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.630 
it was nearly flawless from this game
they<00:00:27.900> played<00:00:28.170> if<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.439> had<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.680> pick<00:00:28.710> out<00:00:29.070> any

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
they played if I had to pick out any

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.790 
they played if I had to pick out any
negatives<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.660> they<00:00:30.840> might<00:00:31.080> not<00:00:31.230> even<00:00:31.410> end<00:00:31.679> up

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
negatives and they might not even end up

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.709 
negatives and they might not even end up
being<00:00:32.070> negatives<00:00:32.489> i<00:00:32.700> would<00:00:33.180> say<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.450> there

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
being negatives i would say that there

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.870 
being negatives i would say that there
were<00:00:33.840> quite<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.170> few<00:00:34.290> moving<00:00:34.860> screens<00:00:35.309> which<00:00:35.670> I

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
were quite a few moving screens which I

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.580 
were quite a few moving screens which I
guess<00:00:36.030> can<00:00:36.270> be<00:00:36.450> prevented<00:00:36.899> by<00:00:37.050> just<00:00:37.290> waiting

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
guess can be prevented by just waiting

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.410 
guess can be prevented by just waiting
for<00:00:37.739> your<00:00:37.860> guy<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.040> set<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.460> screen<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.879> then

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
for your guy to set the screen and then

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.630 
for your guy to set the screen and then
also<00:00:39.660> there<00:00:39.989> were<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.140> think<00:00:40.469> three<00:00:40.920> or<00:00:40.950> four<00:00:41.399> I

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
also there were I think three or four I

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.190 
also there were I think three or four I
think<00:00:41.879> there<00:00:42.000> are<00:00:42.030> only<00:00:42.180> three<00:00:42.690> alley-oops

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
think there are only three alley-oops

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.260 
think there are only three alley-oops
during<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.070> game<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.460> they<00:00:44.610> weren't<00:00:44.850> blocked

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
during the game and they weren't blocked

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.790 
during the game and they weren't blocked
and<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:45.899> don't<00:00:46.289> think<00:00:46.530> there<00:00:46.680> were<00:00:46.770> any

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
and that I don't think there were any

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.650 
and that I don't think there were any
other<00:00:47.039> attempts<00:00:47.640> alley-oops<00:00:48.059> but<00:00:48.329> they<00:00:48.420> said

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
other attempts alley-oops but they said

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.240 
other attempts alley-oops but they said
alley-oops<00:00:49.050> can<00:00:49.289> be<00:00:49.440> blocked<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.860> lot<00:00:49.890> easier

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
alley-oops can be blocked a lot easier

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.090 
alley-oops can be blocked a lot easier
so<00:00:50.730> other<00:00:51.210> than<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:52.140> was<00:00:52.260> flawless<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.070> I

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
so other than that it was flawless so I

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.880 
so other than that it was flawless so I
wrote<00:00:53.460> down<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.760> few<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.480> things<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:55.649> I

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
wrote down a few of the things that I

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.380 
wrote down a few of the things that I
noticed<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.640> thought<00:00:56.850> were<00:00:57.000> really<00:00:57.149> cool

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
noticed that I thought were really cool

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.540 
noticed that I thought were really cool
about<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.780> game<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.590> will<00:00:58.859> briefly<00:00:59.160> talk

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
about the game and I will briefly talk

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.069 
about the game and I will briefly talk
about<00:00:59.579> those<00:00:59.940> I'm<00:01:00.090> going<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.300> try<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.539> keep<00:01:00.899> it

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
about those I'm going to try to keep it

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.360 
about those I'm going to try to keep it
short<00:01:01.379> because<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.649> know<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.829> could<00:01:02.039> talk<00:01:02.190> about

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
short because I know I could talk about

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.270 
short because I know I could talk about
this<00:01:02.489> for<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.879> long<00:01:03.090> time<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.920> I'll<00:01:04.920> try<00:01:05.250> to

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
keep it relatively short but the game

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
as I said so I'll go ahead and jump into

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.929 
as I said so I'll go ahead and jump into
this<00:01:19.110> list<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.280> first<00:01:20.460> thing<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.759> I

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
this list so the first thing that I

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.760 
this list so the first thing that I
noticed<00:01:20.970> after<00:01:21.479> Ernie<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.140> check<00:01:22.380> did<00:01:22.619> their

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
noticed after Ernie and check did their

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.289 
noticed after Ernie and check did their
little<00:01:22.799> thing<00:01:23.040> was<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.549> national<00:01:24.090> anthem

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
little thing was the national anthem

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.020 
little thing was the national anthem
that<00:01:24.570> looks<00:01:25.049> really<00:01:25.350> realistic<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.670> guys<00:01:26.820> saw

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
that looks really realistic you guys saw

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.550 
that looks really realistic you guys saw
a<00:01:27.060> screenshot<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.659> d<00:01:27.930> rose<00:01:28.140> during<00:01:28.350> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
a screenshot of d rose during the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.380 
a screenshot of d rose during the
national<00:01:28.950> anthem<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.460> think<00:01:29.939> that's<00:01:30.119> going<00:01:30.299> to

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
national anthem I think that's going to

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.569 
national anthem I think that's going to
be<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.780> really<00:01:31.560> cool<00:01:31.740> thing<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.189> adds<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.460> lot

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
be a really cool thing and it adds a lot

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.690 
be a really cool thing and it adds a lot
of<00:01:32.700> realism<00:01:33.000> looked<00:01:33.600> great<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.979> crowd<00:01:35.369> I

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
of realism looked great the crowd I

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.039 
of realism looked great the crowd I
really<00:01:35.970> noticed<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.450> lot<00:01:36.630> even<00:01:36.900> though

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
really noticed that a lot even though

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.069 
really noticed that a lot even though
they<00:01:37.380> had<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:38.220> game<00:01:38.610> volume<00:01:38.880> pretty<00:01:39.750> low<00:01:40.020> you

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
they had the game volume pretty low you

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.630 
they had the game volume pretty low you
couldn't<00:01:40.500> hear<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.740> crowd<00:01:40.950> too<00:01:41.159> great<00:01:41.430> I

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
couldn't hear the crowd too great I

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.340 
couldn't hear the crowd too great I
could<00:01:42.090> still<00:01:42.390> notice<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.899> ups<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.259> downs

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
could still notice the ups and downs

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.800 
could still notice the ups and downs
like<00:01:43.740> if<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.549> get<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> steal<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.119> crowd<00:01:45.630> will

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
like if you get a steal the crowd will

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.240 
like if you get a steal the crowd will
get<00:01:45.990> really<00:01:46.259> loud<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.530> then<00:01:46.860> maybe<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.159> gets

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
get really loud and then maybe it gets

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.340 
get really loud and then maybe it gets
stolen<00:01:47.520> back<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.149> just<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.689> crowd<00:01:48.990> gets

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
stolen back and you just the crowd gets

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.810 
stolen back and you just the crowd gets
lower<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.860> can<00:01:50.009> just<00:01:50.159> have<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.549> here

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
lower and you can just have is here

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.719 
lower and you can just have is here
collective<00:01:51.450> all<00:01:51.659> from<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.530> crowd<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:53.250> sounds

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
collective all from the crowd it sounds

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.340 
collective all from the crowd it sounds
really<00:01:53.909> realistic<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.750> think<00:01:54.960> that's<00:01:55.140> going<00:01:55.259> to

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
really realistic I think that's going to

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.080 
really realistic I think that's going to
add<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.500> ton<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:55.829> can't<00:01:56.159> wait<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.490> hear<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.880> crowd

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
add a ton I can't wait to hear the crowd

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.209 
add a ton I can't wait to hear the crowd
at<00:01:57.270> full<00:01:57.479> volume<00:01:57.689> once<00:01:58.439> we<00:01:58.590> get<00:01:58.710> our<00:01:58.860> hands<00:01:59.070> on

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
at full volume once we get our hands on

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.149 
at full volume once we get our hands on
the<00:01:59.369> game<00:02:00.259> another<00:02:01.259> thing<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.710> noticed

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
the game another thing that I noticed

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.490 
the game another thing that I noticed
was<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.820> rim<00:02:03.060> physics<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.930> rim<00:02:04.110> sound

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
was the rim physics and the rim sound

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.170 
was the rim physics and the rim sound
like<00:02:04.770> when<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.009> ball<00:02:05.159> hits<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.430> rim<00:02:05.640> it

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
like when the ball hits the rim it

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.240 
like when the ball hits the rim it
sounds<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.840> lot<00:02:07.079> more<00:02:07.140> realistic<00:02:07.680> this<00:02:08.069> year

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
sounds a lot more realistic this year

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.830 
sounds a lot more realistic this year
and<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.429> looks<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.819> lot<00:02:08.940> more<00:02:09.000> realistic<00:02:09.450> to

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
and it looks a lot more realistic to

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.450 
and it looks a lot more realistic to
like<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.170> see<00:02:10.379> a<00:02:10.410> lot<00:02:10.649> more

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
like you see a lot more

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.400 
like you see a lot more
of<00:02:11.600> animations<00:02:12.600> from<00:02:12.780> when<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.050> ball<00:02:13.200> hits

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
of animations from when the ball hits

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.110 
of animations from when the ball hits
the<00:02:13.500> rim<00:02:13.710> you'd<00:02:14.190> see<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.430> lot<00:02:14.610> more<00:02:14.640> realistic

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
the rim you'd see a lot more realistic

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.730 
the rim you'd see a lot more realistic
ones<00:02:15.510> like<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:15.870> didn't<00:02:16.140> really<00:02:16.260> think<00:02:16.380> that<00:02:16.560> was

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
ones like I didn't really think that was

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.380 
ones like I didn't really think that was
a<00:02:16.770> problem<00:02:17.070> in<00:02:17.340> years<00:02:17.520> past<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.910> never<00:02:17.970> thought

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
a problem in years past I never thought

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.270 
a problem in years past I never thought
about<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.780> at<00:02:18.900> all<00:02:19.050> I<00:02:19.290> thought<00:02:19.770> it<00:02:19.890> was<00:02:19.980> good

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
about it at all I thought it was good

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.070 
about it at all I thought it was good
this<00:02:20.640> year<00:02:20.700> it's<00:02:21.090> definitely<00:02:21.690> an<00:02:21.810> improvement

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
this year it's definitely an improvement

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.570 
this year it's definitely an improvement
that's<00:02:22.500> just<00:02:22.710> a<00:02:22.830> little<00:02:23.070> thing<00:02:23.250> that's<00:02:23.430> going

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
that's just a little thing that's going

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.040 
that's just a little thing that's going
to<00:02:23.640> add<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.060> realism<00:02:24.210> that<00:02:24.570> I<00:02:24.690> think<00:02:24.930> is

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
to add to the realism that I think is

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.980 
to add to the realism that I think is
really<00:02:25.080> good<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:26.310> timeouts<00:02:26.970> were<00:02:27.270> extremely

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
really good the timeouts were extremely

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.050 
really good the timeouts were extremely
in-depth<00:02:28.590> they<00:02:28.920> looked<00:02:29.250> generally<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.880> same

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
in-depth they looked generally the same

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.900 
in-depth they looked generally the same
as<00:02:30.270> 2k14<00:02:30.870> as<00:02:31.200> far<00:02:31.410> as<00:02:31.590> like<00:02:31.800> when<00:02:32.460> the<00:02:32.700> players

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
as 2k14 as far as like when the players

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.280 
as 2k14 as far as like when the players
walk<00:02:33.210> over<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.630> bench<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.050> they<00:02:34.140> have

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
walk over to the bench and they have

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.750 
walk over to the bench and they have
those<00:02:34.530> little<00:02:34.590> cut<00:02:35.100> scenes<00:02:35.370> showing<00:02:35.640> the

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
those little cut scenes showing the

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.670 
those little cut scenes showing the
players<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.270> coaches<00:02:36.330> talking<00:02:37.260> drawing

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
players and the coaches talking drawing

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.130 
players and the coaches talking drawing
up<00:02:37.800> plays<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.220> stuff<00:02:38.370> but<00:02:39.180> they<00:02:39.360> had<00:02:39.570> a<00:02:39.600> ton<00:02:40.110> of

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
up plays and stuff but they had a ton of

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.950 
up plays and stuff but they had a ton of
options<00:02:40.500> they<00:02:40.980> have<00:02:41.150> options<00:02:42.150> for<00:02:42.210> individual

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
options they have options for individual

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.960 
options they have options for individual
players<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.950> can<00:02:43.980> set<00:02:44.490> how<00:02:44.520> you<00:02:44.670> want<00:02:44.940> to

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
players you can set how you want to

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.280 
players you can set how you want to

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
post play them tight deny the ball all

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.830 
post play them tight deny the ball all
kinds<00:02:50.400> of<00:02:50.460> stuff<00:02:50.670> how<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:51.420> want<00:02:51.690> to<00:02:51.720> play

kinds of stuff how you want to play

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.870 
kinds of stuff how you want to play
screens<00:02:52.320> it<00:02:52.560> was<00:02:52.770> really<00:02:53.190> really<00:02:53.400> in-depth

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
screens it was really really in-depth

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.970 
screens it was really really in-depth
the<00:02:54.660> points<00:02:54.960> of<00:02:55.050> emphasis<00:02:55.500> looked<00:02:55.770> really

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
the points of emphasis looked really

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.550 
the points of emphasis looked really
good<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.280> can't<00:02:56.460> wait<00:02:57.000> till<00:02:57.720> we<00:02:57.990> get<00:02:58.230> our<00:02:58.290> hands

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
good I can't wait till we get our hands

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.930 
good I can't wait till we get our hands
on<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.800> game<00:02:58.920> so<00:02:59.070> we<00:02:59.160> can<00:02:59.280> test<00:02:59.460> that<00:02:59.670> stuff

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
on the game so we can test that stuff

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.760 
on the game so we can test that stuff
out<00:03:00.060> online<00:03:00.270> see<00:03:00.750> how<00:03:00.840> big<00:03:01.050> of<00:03:01.110> an<00:03:01.230> impact<00:03:01.380> it

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
out online see how big of an impact it

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.530 
out online see how big of an impact it
will<00:03:01.860> have<00:03:01.920> but<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.310> think<00:03:02.580> strategy<00:03:03.180> will<00:03:03.360> have

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
will have but I think strategy will have

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.320 
will have but I think strategy will have
a<00:03:03.570> huge<00:03:03.870> impact<00:03:04.080> on<00:03:04.500> line<00:03:04.770> in<00:03:05.040> 2k15<00:03:05.820> that

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
a huge impact on line in 2k15 that

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.120 
a huge impact on line in 2k15 that
looked<00:03:06.570> really<00:03:06.750> in-depth<00:03:07.200> hopefully<00:03:07.920> that'll

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
looked really in-depth hopefully that'll

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.740 
looked really in-depth hopefully that'll
be<00:03:08.280> kind<00:03:08.490> of<00:03:08.580> fluid<00:03:08.940> to<00:03:09.090> use<00:03:09.330> as<00:03:09.540> well

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
be kind of fluid to use as well

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.120 
be kind of fluid to use as well
hopefully<00:03:10.080> it<00:03:10.290> won't<00:03:10.470> you<00:03:10.740> know<00:03:10.860> take<00:03:11.100> a

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
hopefully it won't you know take a

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.860 
hopefully it won't you know take a
really<00:03:11.460> long<00:03:11.490> time<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:12.060> set<00:03:12.240> all<00:03:12.360> that<00:03:12.390> stuff<00:03:12.750> I

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
really long time to set all that stuff I

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.420 
really long time to set all that stuff I
doubt<00:03:13.080> it<00:03:13.260> will<00:03:13.410> I<00:03:13.620> think<00:03:14.100> that's<00:03:14.280> definitely

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
doubt it will I think that's definitely

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.070 
doubt it will I think that's definitely
going<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:14.820> be<00:03:14.880> a<00:03:14.940> big<00:03:15.120> positive<00:03:15.300> for<00:03:15.720> online

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
going to be a big positive for online

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.230 
going to be a big positive for online
play<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:16.650> offline<00:03:17.040> play<00:03:17.310> but<00:03:17.490> mainly<00:03:17.760> online

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
play and offline play but mainly online

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.500 
play and offline play but mainly online
play<00:03:18.450> I<00:03:18.480> think<00:03:18.620> um<00:03:19.790> there<00:03:20.790> were<00:03:20.970> a<00:03:21.000> ton<00:03:21.450> of

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
play I think um there were a ton of

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.200 
play I think um there were a ton of
great<00:03:22.140> collision<00:03:22.770> animations<00:03:23.400> like<00:03:23.640> the

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
great collision animations like the

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.610 
great collision animations like the
failed<00:03:24.540> dunks<00:03:25.050> and<00:03:25.170> stuff<00:03:25.440> they<00:03:25.560> were

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
failed dunks and stuff they were

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.980 
failed dunks and stuff they were
probably<00:03:25.830> seven<00:03:26.310> or<00:03:26.370> eight<00:03:26.520> missed<00:03:26.790> dunks<00:03:27.210> or

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
probably seven or eight missed dunks or

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.720 
probably seven or eight missed dunks or
failed<00:03:28.320> dunk<00:03:28.650> attempts<00:03:29.100> in<00:03:29.220> this<00:03:29.370> game<00:03:29.550> and

realistic<00:04:32.380> definitely<00:04:33.370> looks<00:04:33.550> a<00:04:33.670> lot<00:04:33.820> more

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
realistic definitely looks a lot more

another<00:04:42.190> good<00:04:42.370> feature<00:04:42.720> the<00:04:43.720> presentation

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
another good feature the presentation

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.750 
another good feature the presentation
overall<00:04:44.740> which<00:04:44.890> is<00:04:45.010> really<00:04:45.220> good<00:04:45.430> from<00:04:45.640> the

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
overall which is really good from the

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.670 
overall which is really good from the
menus<00:04:46.210> to<00:04:46.450> the<00:04:46.480> postgame<00:04:47.050> thing<00:04:47.350> where<00:04:47.560> they

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
menus to the postgame thing where they

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.380 
menus to the postgame thing where they
show<00:04:47.830> the<00:04:47.980> player<00:04:48.160> of<00:04:48.280> the<00:04:48.370> game<00:04:48.400> everything

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
show the player of the game everything

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.060 
show the player of the game everything
looked<00:04:49.600> very<00:04:49.900> very<00:04:50.140> solid<00:04:50.560> way<00:04:50.710> better<00:04:50.950> than

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
looked very very solid way better than

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.880 
looked very very solid way better than
2k14<00:04:51.640> in<00:04:51.880> my<00:04:52.090> opinion<00:04:52.420> the<00:04:53.200> shot<00:04:53.440> meter<00:04:53.680> was

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
2k14 in my opinion the shot meter was

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.650 
2k14 in my opinion the shot meter was
something<00:04:54.190> I<00:04:54.310> didn't<00:04:54.670> even<00:04:54.850> pay<00:04:55.030> attention<00:04:55.060> to

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
something I didn't even pay attention to

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.180 
something I didn't even pay attention to
a<00:04:55.690> lot<00:04:55.810> of<00:04:55.990> the<00:04:56.110> guys<00:04:56.260> that<00:04:56.500> were<00:04:56.560> a<00:04:56.650> team<00:04:56.980> up

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
a lot of the guys that were a team up

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.220 
a lot of the guys that were a team up
we're<00:04:57.730> saying<00:04:58.000> you<00:04:58.330> might<00:04:58.480> want<00:04:58.690> to<00:04:58.780> turn<00:04:58.990> off

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
we're saying you might want to turn off

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.480 
we're saying you might want to turn off
the<00:04:59.410> shot<00:04:59.620> meter<00:04:59.830> because<00:05:00.010> you'll<00:05:00.220> just<00:05:00.370> be

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
the shot meter because you'll just be

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.640 
the shot meter because you'll just be
focusing<00:05:01.030> on<00:05:01.150> that<00:05:01.330> I<00:05:01.600> didn't<00:05:02.260> think<00:05:02.470> that<00:05:02.620> at

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
focusing on that I didn't think that at

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.080 
focusing on that I didn't think that at
all<00:05:02.860> maybe<00:05:03.100> it'll<00:05:03.370> be<00:05:03.430> different<00:05:03.520> while<00:05:03.970> I'm

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
all maybe it'll be different while I'm

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.820 
all maybe it'll be different while I'm
playing<00:05:04.330> but<00:05:04.540> I<00:05:04.570> honestly<00:05:05.080> doubt<00:05:05.320> it<00:05:05.560> like<00:05:05.710> I

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
playing but I honestly doubt it like I

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.500 
playing but I honestly doubt it like I
didn't<00:05:06.040> even<00:05:06.100> notice<00:05:06.400> the<00:05:06.730> shot<00:05:06.940> meter<00:05:07.180> until

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
didn't even notice the shot meter until

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.180 
didn't even notice the shot meter until
like<00:05:07.660> the<00:05:07.810> third<00:05:08.050> quarter<00:05:08.440> and<00:05:08.650> then<00:05:09.100> I

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
like the third quarter and then I

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.650 
like the third quarter and then I
started<00:05:09.490> looking<00:05:09.700> at<00:05:10.000> it<00:05:10.030> and<00:05:10.240> I<00:05:10.330> don't<00:05:10.390> think

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
started looking at it and I don't think

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.060 
started looking at it and I don't think
it's<00:05:10.840> going<00:05:10.990> to<00:05:11.050> be<00:05:11.110> distracting<00:05:11.830> at<00:05:11.950> all

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
it's going to be distracting at all

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.490 
it's going to be distracting at all
it'll<00:05:12.310> just<00:05:12.400> provide<00:05:12.910> good<00:05:13.210> feedback<00:05:13.720> solid

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
it'll just provide good feedback solid

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.080 
it'll just provide good feedback solid
feedback<00:05:14.800> I<00:05:14.950> think<00:05:15.160> that's<00:05:15.310> a<00:05:15.460> positive<00:05:15.640> and<00:05:16.060> I

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
feedback I think that's a positive and I

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.060 
feedback I think that's a positive and I
don't<00:05:16.240> think<00:05:16.480> it'll<00:05:17.020> really<00:05:17.260> throw<00:05:17.830> you<00:05:17.890> off

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
don't think it'll really throw you off

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.470 
don't think it'll really throw you off
at<00:05:18.220> all<00:05:18.340> you<00:05:18.490> still<00:05:18.730> gotta<00:05:18.910> shoot<00:05:19.150> by<00:05:19.420> the

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
at all you still gotta shoot by the

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.850 
at all you still gotta shoot by the
eighth<00:05:19.660> what<00:05:19.900> you<00:05:19.990> see<00:05:20.140> you<00:05:20.230> on<00:05:20.350> the<00:05:20.470> animation

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
eighth what you see you on the animation

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.890 
eighth what you see you on the animation
that'll<00:05:21.340> be<00:05:21.550> your<00:05:21.670> best<00:05:21.910> bet<00:05:22.120> as<00:05:22.510> far<00:05:22.780> as

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
that'll be your best bet as far as

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.050 
that'll be your best bet as far as
having<00:05:23.200> success<00:05:23.650> and<00:05:23.890> I<00:05:24.340> think<00:05:24.820> the<00:05:24.910> shot

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
having success and I think the shot

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.370 
having success and I think the shot
meter<00:05:25.240> is<00:05:25.360> really<00:05:25.540> going<00:05:25.630> to<00:05:25.690> be<00:05:25.810> solid<00:05:26.020> won't

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
meter is really going to be solid won't

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.620 
meter is really going to be solid won't
distract<00:05:26.710> you<00:05:26.890> at<00:05:27.010> all<00:05:27.160> the<00:05:27.910> announcers<00:05:28.450> I

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
distract you at all the announcers I

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.380 
distract you at all the announcers I
couldn't<00:05:28.900> really<00:05:28.990> hear<00:05:29.230> as<00:05:29.350> well<00:05:29.380> um<00:05:30.390> because

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
couldn't really hear as well um because

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.140 
couldn't really hear as well um because
they<00:05:31.660> had<00:05:31.840> the<00:05:32.080> game<00:05:32.620> volume<00:05:32.920> pretty<00:05:33.460> low<00:05:33.760> as<00:05:34.000> i

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
they had the game volume pretty low as i

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.330 
they had the game volume pretty low as i
said<00:05:34.450> but<00:05:34.990> i<00:05:35.050> know<00:05:35.140> Doris<00:05:35.620> in<00:05:35.860> the<00:05:35.950> game<00:05:36.100> Kevin

Harlan and Kevin Harlan and Clark
Kellogg<00:05:39.640> I<00:05:39.940> didn't<00:05:40.600> hear<00:05:40.780> Steve<00:05:41.050> Kerr<00:05:41.290> which

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
Kellogg I didn't hear Steve Kerr which

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:42.690 
Kellogg I didn't hear Steve Kerr which
is<00:05:41.620> a<00:05:41.650> good<00:05:41.830> sign<00:05:41.890> there<00:05:42.280> were<00:05:42.370> some<00:05:42.550> rumors

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
is a good sign there were some rumors

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.130 
is a good sign there were some rumors
that<00:05:42.970> he<00:05:43.060> was<00:05:43.210> still<00:05:43.360> in<00:05:43.390> the<00:05:43.570> game<00:05:43.690> I<00:05:43.930> don't

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.140 
that he was still in the game I don't

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.260 
that he was still in the game I don't
think<00:05:44.230> 2k<00:05:44.680> would<00:05:44.860> do<00:05:44.980> that<00:05:45.130> it'd<00:05:45.910> be<00:05:46.030> nice<00:05:46.240> to

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
think 2k would do that it'd be nice to

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.090 
think 2k would do that it'd be nice to
have<00:05:46.540> a<00:05:46.600> third<00:05:46.960> member<00:05:47.260> in<00:05:47.470> the<00:05:47.620> broadcast

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 
have a third member in the broadcast

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.220 
have a third member in the broadcast
booth<00:05:48.220> but<00:05:48.760> I<00:05:49.090> don't<00:05:49.810> think<00:05:49.960> we're<00:05:50.050> going<00:05:50.140> to

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.230 
booth but I don't think we're going to

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.210 
booth but I don't think we're going to
be<00:05:50.290> getting<00:05:50.410> that<00:05:50.560> this<00:05:50.860> year<00:05:51.100> hopefully

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
be getting that this year hopefully

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.100 
be getting that this year hopefully
we'll<00:05:51.610> get<00:05:51.730> that<00:05:51.910> in<00:05:52.120> future<00:05:52.360> years<00:05:52.780> but<00:05:53.020> as

we'll get that in future years but as

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.080 
we'll get that in future years but as
long<00:05:53.290> as<00:05:53.320> Steve<00:05:53.650> Kerr<00:05:53.890> is<00:05:54.130> not<00:05:54.400> in<00:05:54.610> the<00:05:54.760> game<00:05:54.790> as

long as Steve Kerr is not in the game as
a<00:05:55.120> broadcaster<00:05:55.870> I<00:05:56.050> will<00:05:56.590> be<00:05:56.680> fine<00:05:56.860> with<00:05:57.040> that

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
a broadcaster I will be fine with that

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:58.530 
a broadcaster I will be fine with that
because<00:05:57.340> if<00:05:57.580> he<00:05:57.700> is<00:05:57.820> that's<00:05:58.120> just<00:05:58.210> going<00:05:58.420> to<00:05:58.510> be

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:58.540 
because if he is that's just going to be

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.750 
because if he is that's just going to be
kind<00:05:58.630> of<00:05:58.870> ridiculous<00:05:59.080> i<00:05:59.530> think<00:05:59.800> it'll<00:06:00.730> just

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
kind of ridiculous i think it'll just

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.850 
kind of ridiculous i think it'll just
make<00:06:01.000> things<00:06:01.060> a<00:06:01.390> lot<00:06:01.540> more<00:06:01.750> unrealistic<00:06:02.350> so

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
make things a lot more unrealistic so

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.620 
make things a lot more unrealistic so
the<00:06:03.640> last<00:06:03.790> thing<00:06:03.970> I'm<00:06:04.150> going<00:06:04.240> to<00:06:04.300> talk<00:06:04.480> about

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
the last thing I'm going to talk about

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.240 
the last thing I'm going to talk about
actually<00:06:05.290> really<00:06:05.560> cool<00:06:05.710> as<00:06:05.860> well<00:06:05.890> there<00:06:06.190> are

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
actually really cool as well there are

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.190 
actually really cool as well there are
ton<00:06:06.580> of<00:06:06.760> new<00:06:06.880> attributes<00:06:07.540> they<00:06:07.750> talked<00:06:08.020> about

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.200 
ton of new attributes they talked about

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.710 
ton of new attributes they talked about
this<00:06:08.320> isn't<00:06:08.650> really<00:06:08.770> gameplay<00:06:09.370> related<00:06:09.910> but

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
this isn't really gameplay related but

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.480 
this isn't really gameplay related but
stealth<00:06:11.080> was<00:06:11.290> on<00:06:11.410> the<00:06:11.500> livestream<00:06:11.920> the<00:06:12.100> roster

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
stealth was on the livestream the roster

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:13.980 
stealth was on the livestream the roster
guy<00:06:12.640> and<00:06:12.850> he<00:06:12.940> was<00:06:13.060> talking<00:06:13.510> about<00:06:13.570> some<00:06:13.900> of

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
guy and he was talking about some of

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.620 
guy and he was talking about some of
these<00:06:14.080> attributes<00:06:14.320> and<00:06:14.890> he<00:06:15.040> was<00:06:15.190> saying<00:06:15.400> that

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
these attributes and he was saying that

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.060 
these attributes and he was saying that
basketball<00:06:16.630> IQ<00:06:17.230> is<00:06:17.350> one<00:06:17.500> of<00:06:17.590> the<00:06:17.680> Astra

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.070 
basketball IQ is one of the Astra

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.370 
basketball IQ is one of the Astra
attributes<00:06:18.640> now<00:06:18.820> I<00:06:19.030> guess<00:06:19.810> they<00:06:19.960> still<00:06:20.020> have

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
attributes now I guess they still have

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.960 
attributes now I guess they still have
offensive<00:06:20.770> and<00:06:20.980> defensive<00:06:21.370> awareness<00:06:21.820> but

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:21.970 
offensive and defensive awareness but

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.060 
offensive and defensive awareness but
now<00:06:22.120> basketball<00:06:22.660> IQ<00:06:23.200> really<00:06:23.560> has<00:06:23.710> a<00:06:23.740> big

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.070 
now basketball IQ really has a big

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.310 
now basketball IQ really has a big
effect<00:06:24.190> on<00:06:24.520> overall<00:06:24.580> and<00:06:25.300> how<00:06:25.750> you<00:06:25.810> play<00:06:26.170> as

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320 
effect on overall and how you play as

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.800 
effect on overall and how you play as
well<00:06:26.560> and<00:06:26.830> that's<00:06:27.250> why<00:06:27.520> Tim<00:06:27.880> Duncan<00:06:28.330> was<00:06:28.510> 90

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
well and that's why Tim Duncan was 90

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.360 
well and that's why Tim Duncan was 90
overall<00:06:29.170> I<00:06:29.200> was<00:06:29.410> kind<00:06:29.620> of<00:06:29.680> thinking<00:06:29.740> I<00:06:30.070> don't

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
overall I was kind of thinking I don't

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.010 
overall I was kind of thinking I don't
know<00:06:30.430> if<00:06:30.550> Tim<00:06:30.910> Duncan<00:06:31.270> is<00:06:31.330> really<00:06:31.630> the<00:06:31.750> fourth

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
know if Tim Duncan is really the fourth

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.990 
know if Tim Duncan is really the fourth
best<00:06:32.260> player<00:06:32.500> in<00:06:32.530> the<00:06:32.680> NBA<00:06:32.770> but<00:06:33.310> the<00:06:33.820> reason

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
best player in the NBA but the reason

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.030 
best player in the NBA but the reason
why<00:06:34.270> his<00:06:34.480> overall<00:06:34.870> is<00:06:35.020> that<00:06:35.200> highest<00:06:35.410> cuz<00:06:35.800> of

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:36.040 
why his overall is that highest cuz of

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.070 
why his overall is that highest cuz of
the<00:06:36.250> basketball<00:06:36.730> IQ<00:06:37.270> they

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
the basketball IQ they

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.510 
the basketball IQ they
and<00:06:38.229> a<00:06:38.319> bunch<00:06:38.530> of<00:06:38.650> other<00:06:38.830> attributes<00:06:39.370> they

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
and a bunch of other attributes they

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.999 
and a bunch of other attributes they
talked<00:06:39.759> about<00:06:39.879> lateral<00:06:40.270> quickness<00:06:41.009> shooting

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:42.009 
talked about lateral quickness shooting

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:44.309 
talked about lateral quickness shooting
fatigue<00:06:42.460> and<00:06:42.879> then<00:06:43.090> another<00:06:43.599> type<00:06:43.870> of<00:06:43.900> fatigue

00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:44.319 
fatigue and then another type of fatigue

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:46.260 
fatigue and then another type of fatigue
as<00:06:44.500> well<00:06:44.680> so<00:06:44.949> it's<00:06:45.340> just<00:06:45.490> going<00:06:45.639> to<00:06:45.699> add<00:06:45.939> a<00:06:45.970> lot

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.270 
as well so it's just going to add a lot

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.969 
as well so it's just going to add a lot
more<00:06:46.449> layers<00:06:46.810> to<00:06:47.110> it<00:06:47.139> and<00:06:47.379> add<00:06:47.560> a<00:06:47.590> lot<00:06:47.830> more

more layers to it and add a lot more

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:49.890 
more layers to it and add a lot more
depth<00:06:48.340> and<00:06:48.490> overall<00:06:49.120> make<00:06:49.300> the<00:06:49.449> game<00:06:49.599> a<00:06:49.629> lot

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:49.900 
depth and overall make the game a lot

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.080
