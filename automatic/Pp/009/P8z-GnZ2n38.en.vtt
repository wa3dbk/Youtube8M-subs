I'm not having to guess between points
on<00:02:52.160> what's<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.090> right<00:02:53.209> hold<00:02:53.540> I<00:02:53.840> can<00:02:54.530> always

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
on what's the right hold I can always

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.190 
on what's the right hold I can always
find<00:02:55.640> a<00:02:55.820> marking<00:02:56.209> there<00:02:56.360> somewhere<00:02:56.750> that<00:02:57.140> I

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
find a marking there somewhere that I

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.170 
find a marking there somewhere that I
can<00:02:57.410> put<00:02:57.590> on<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:58.070> target<00:02:58.310> or<00:02:58.580> on<00:02:58.730> an<00:02:58.850> edge<00:02:59.000> of

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
can put on the target or on an edge of

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.449 
can put on the target or on an edge of
the<00:02:59.269> target<00:02:59.630> and<00:02:59.870> I<00:03:00.590> can<00:03:00.769> repeat<00:03:01.070> that<00:03:01.280> each

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
the target and I can repeat that each

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.110 
the target and I can repeat that each
time<00:03:01.570> for<00:03:02.570> multiple<00:03:03.140> shots<00:03:03.610> also<00:03:04.610> a<00:03:04.910> big

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
time for multiple shots also a big

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.030 
time for multiple shots also a big
advantage<00:03:05.420> I<00:03:05.660> say<00:03:05.840> is<00:03:06.140> I<00:03:06.350> don't<00:03:06.500> have<00:03:06.680> to<00:03:06.860> turn

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
advantage I say is I don't have to turn

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.970 
advantage I say is I don't have to turn
the<00:03:07.370> knobs<00:03:07.580> I<00:03:07.820> don't<00:03:07.970> have<00:03:08.120> to<00:03:08.239> decide<00:03:09.140> am<00:03:09.590> I<00:03:09.950> on

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
the knobs I don't have to decide am I on

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.250 
the knobs I don't have to decide am I on
the<00:03:10.070> right<00:03:10.160> revolution<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.420> clicks<00:03:11.959> are<00:03:12.140> they

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
the right revolution the clicks are they

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.300 
the right revolution the clicks are they
really<00:03:12.410> true<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:13.760> scope<00:03:14.000> set<00:03:14.810> its<00:03:15.170> 0<00:03:15.470> and<00:03:15.799> it's

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
really true the scope set its 0 and it's

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.360 
really true the scope set its 0 and it's
it's<00:03:16.820> always<00:03:17.180> right<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:18.290> Horace<00:03:18.739> system<00:03:19.190> is

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
it's always right the Horace system is

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.390 
it's always right the Horace system is
intuitive<00:03:20.120> and<00:03:20.150> simple<00:03:20.329> to<00:03:21.019> use<00:03:21.400> requiring

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
intuitive and simple to use requiring

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.850 
intuitive and simple to use requiring
one-third<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.360> time<00:03:23.600> to<00:03:23.810> learn<00:03:24.019> compared

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
one-third the time to learn compared

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.370 
one-third the time to learn compared
with<00:03:25.010> conventional<00:03:25.250> systems<00:03:26.180> so<00:03:26.870> simple

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
with conventional systems so simple

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.760 
with conventional systems so simple
anyone<00:03:27.950> can<00:03:28.100> use<00:03:28.430> it

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.620 

we<00:03:32.370> wanted<00:03:32.640> to<00:03:32.730> show<00:03:32.940> you<00:03:32.970> how<00:03:33.150> easy<00:03:33.180> the

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
we wanted to show you how easy the

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.510 
we wanted to show you how easy the
system<00:03:33.960> was<00:03:34.110> to<00:03:34.320> use<00:03:34.560> so<00:03:34.890> we<00:03:35.010> wanted<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:35.310> find

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
system was to use so we wanted to find

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.190 
system was to use so we wanted to find
the<00:03:35.700> shooter<00:03:35.970> that<00:03:36.090> had<00:03:36.210> not<00:03:36.420> shot<00:03:36.750> with<00:03:37.170> a

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
the shooter that had not shot with a

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.290 
the shooter that had not shot with a
horse<00:03:37.470> system<00:03:37.860> before<00:03:37.980> so<00:03:38.700> we<00:03:38.790> asked<00:03:39.030> Eddie's

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
horse system before so we asked Eddie's

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.660 
horse system before so we asked Eddie's
son<00:03:39.510> Louis<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:40.050> come<00:03:40.230> up<00:03:40.380> and<00:03:40.530> join<00:03:40.740> us<00:03:40.800> Eddie

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
son Louis to come up and join us Eddie

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.120 
son Louis to come up and join us Eddie
