00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello good afternoon my name is john in 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.690
 this time I'm showing a tutorial 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.510
 of how to make your hearing aids sound 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.910
 a little more serious and also how to be able 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.580
 take care of them a little more here I show you 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.330
 all three types of hearing aids are 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.380
 pea this must be this one 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.330
 mandatory that everyone in the pea 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.510
 because of pea these hearing aids 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.670
 they have the facility of which of which 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.250
 three fits very well in your ear and of 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.650
 fact the sound does not even come out 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.140
 does not enter then this makes the 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.850
 sound all rumbles inside the ear by 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.760
 example to me non-personal hearing aids 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.500
 of djs its great if they have very 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.050
 good low but in the same way not 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.969
 they listen like these do not allow 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.309
 the external sound in your hearing aids 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.110
 if they allow external sound that's why 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.600
 that I like the personal 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.120
 I have tried many types of hearing aids 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.220
 Most are because they are the hearing aids that 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.200
 in particular they are the ones that have more 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.510
 clarity in terms of sound but of 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.970
 just searched other brands for example 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.309
 this is also audio band this brand 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.380
 it is characterized a lot by the sounds 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.050
 serious that have these are the 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.420
 panasonic brand hearing aids these 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.820
 They challenged the 200 pesos in stores 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.160
 self-service and in fact they are very 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.690
 good clarity of sound and bass 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.850
 as well 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.310
 and last of the last I bought 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.090
 were these are from the brand of 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.189
 philips 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.350
 I had never bought phillips hearing aids 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.240
 but this action requires me 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.359
 buy us from another brand does not stop 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.560
 us another type of sound then 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:37.780
 Well, I'm going to teach you at that moment 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.719
 how to make it sound a bit more 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.390
 low to catch we need a few 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:45.310
 gummies those types of gummies that have 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.560
 a little bit the opening a little bigger 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.990
 those do not have much to say if not 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.990
 they serve but what we are going to put 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.270
 in comes out very often and that 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.670
 makes the sound sometimes vary 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.729
 so for this only the only 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.280
 What we need is to have two pieces of 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.110
 good cotton should only split 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.250
 cotton and split it in equal parts 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.110
 cotton should be very equal parts 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.200
 [Music] 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.020
 very equal and small not so big and 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.060
 neither the one that you put a lot 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.670
 more cotton will make the sound 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.040
 then go less if you have to upload a 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.870
 little more to be able to listen is the 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.910
 sound that you want and if you put it very 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.770
 little, then you will not be able to hear that 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.960
 clarity that we want in the low 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.750
 then this is like pretty much the 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.130
 amount you should put the range not 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.290
 then what we are going to do is going to be 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.260
 then this one look for some types of 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.020
 gummies of these in fact if they compare 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.810
 made these entries a little smaller 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.450
 that this one in fact these gummies I 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.739
 the buy them good are from a brand of 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.750
 Sonic hearing aids is the most 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.030
 economic costs that cost 100 pesos and 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.580
 that everywhere sales of those are and 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.280
 in fact they have those colors in the part 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.220
 network 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.650
 then I am the two in the plant 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.420
 because he had others he had those chasms 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.750
 that I understand had in fact that 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.370
 Comitan type or large then what 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.930
 let's see with the cotton is going to be 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.880
 put it in to disgust and let's go 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.760
 to get in and we're going to support a little 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.760
 of the blog of another hearing aid of the same 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.770
 we have cotton 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.290
 and likewise we put cotton in the 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.329
 other 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.700
 which should be equally its 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:35.439
 children in a hearing aid is going to have more 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.819
 strong to the volume that in the other and what 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:38.819
 they are getting in fact they are taking away 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.130
 and you can already organ 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.560
 I show because if not, they will not be able to 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.300
 appreciate but this is my advice and of 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.910
 same way you same tried what 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.710
 I do not know try to listen to music without the 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.550
 cotton and then with the cotton and they go to 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.010
 see what the difference will be 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.840
 also in particular I like those 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.400
 sharp that you hear clear and that 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.830
 also hear that they echo in the 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.300
 ears then this is my secret my 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.450
 trick to make them sound a bit more 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.280
 below the pain that I have for them is also 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.070
 how to do and how can you give a little more 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.440
 the spirits gave previously had the 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.480
 tweezers that some cell phones like sony 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.139
 Ericsson had to be played in here in 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.180
 rice 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.939
 were already used too many in fact 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.039
 I no longer have more of them but 

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:26.770
 You can also buy some 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:29.139
 remains of these are those that are bought 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.840
 in stationeries they are not in more than three 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:33.630
 weights I think 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.110
 and it is now just wear it as in as 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:40.050
 the pints of cell phones and these 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.540
 hearing aids makes them stay a little longer 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.310
 you put them here on your clothes because they 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.280
 we put this there are times that for example 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.250
 you put on your hearing aids and for reasons 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.210
 that you do not want without wanting to leave it in 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.930
 headphones 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.460
 so hopefully in a very strong way 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.280
 that even the drop starts the hearing aids 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.380
 of the ears that makes it to be in 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.849
 this part of the hearing aids and therefore 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:08.659
 makes 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:11.149
 that would be to begin to truncate and not 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:13.429
 listen to one or not listen well to us 

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:16.909
 two then already with this we do that 

00:05:13.429 --> 00:05:19.009
 all the strength of the pulls that are given 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:22.189
 to hearing aids no longer falls on the 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:24.139
 welding but throw publicly for 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:25.999
 fall into this part that is a part a 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:29.659
 little more resistant then at the moment 

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:31.669
 to pull and nothing else pulls sixth and no longer 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:34.409
 pull your hearing aids that is in fact what 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:36.689
 that we should take care a little more 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:39.599
 and well this has been all if they have 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:41.429
 doubts can equal comment if you 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:43.529
 it served or if it did not serve them I would like 

00:05:41.429 --> 00:05:45.749
 to leave a comment 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:47.999
 presided I like it if you can 

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:49.139
 share this information many 

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:51.859
 thank you and see you in the next 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:51.859
 tutorial
