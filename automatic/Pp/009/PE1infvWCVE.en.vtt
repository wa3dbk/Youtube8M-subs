00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.039

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:14.089
 insist on sending you 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.590
 the plague has led many of us 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.700
 find a cure when you are near me 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.700
 heart beats in peace 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:34.840
 emilio we will count the days until your 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.840
 come back fast with good news 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.929
 from the hand of bethesda and developed 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:43.030
 by parking developer studios 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:44.589
 the dark messiah series come to us from 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.510
 sound an innovative action game 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.699
 First person adventure with dyes 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.530
 of stealth and is that we are probably 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:51.460
 before the revelation game of the year if 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.420
 you want to know why 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.420
 attentive to the analysis 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.480
 they speak of a curse 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.680
 superstitions 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.720
 there could already be a cure for the plague 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.640
 the premise of the game is very simple 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.170
 we will incarnate an officer of the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.790
 army of the hypothetical locality 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.740
 tan industrial world that is 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.930
 betrayed and accused of the death of the 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.660
 empress and kidnapping her daughter a 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.100
 crime that he did not commit with the help of a 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.080
 group of allies we will escape from the 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.520
 jail before its execution and from 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.410
 from there we will have to collaborate with them 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.930
 to uncover the plot behind 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.369
 of everything assassinating key objectives the 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.050
 game is divided into missions in which 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.880
 we will have to kill kidnap or 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.830
 steal key objects to clean our 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.899
 name a structure very seen in the 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.210
 world of video games is in the 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.009
 amount of possibilities at the time of 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.350
 meet our goals where lies 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.540
 the depth of this title we can 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.800
 choose the path of combat eliminating 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.990
 enemies find us 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.610
 our step until we reach the goal or 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.350
 we can choose the way of stealth 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.509
 being coverage in coverage 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.729
 using roofs passageways windows 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.220
 the possibilities to face each 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.530
 mission are overwhelming and it just depends 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.170
 of the player the way to face the 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.750
 view 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:13.690
 everything is coming down looking seeks in it and 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:15.860
 leave it only you can know what to do 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.580
 true 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.580
 I hear 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.599
 it can not be seen what he has done if he has 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.599
 killed the empress 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.609
 you've done with the young leidy emily 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:42.519
 traitor your ironic bodyguard will be 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:42.519
 beheaded by stockholm apprehend him 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.200
 no no 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.819
 for all this we will have a series 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.920
 of aid either in the form of weapons or 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.540
 powers on the one hand in our hand 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.010
 right we will have our dagger that 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.260
 we will use continuously during 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.879
 all the game on the other hand in the 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.010
 left we can choose between carrying 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.560
 pistol a crossbow with different types 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.510
 of ammunition or a power is not necessary 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.519
 highlight that the powers granted by 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.439
 an angel at the beginning of the game grant 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.540
 a very interesting playable point ever 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:17.829
 before seen in a title of this kind of 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.389
 laurent and in turn are made 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.249
 essential when completing 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.019
 a successful mission of which the 

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:24.760
 fan is broad we can have 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.159
 transport us quickly to reach 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.079
 otherwise inaccessible places or 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:31.329
 be animals to go unnoticed 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.430
 before the guards invoke rats that we 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.079
 help or even see enemies through 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.090
 of power walls that we will use 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.430
 surely for more than half of the 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.959
 game whose duration of the campaign mode is 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.959
 about 10 hours 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.510
 graphically the game looks 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.120
 superbly championed by the famous 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.220
 engine unreal engine 3 although the merit 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.640
 of it is not the engine but the 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.500
 artistic section is so remarkable that it is 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.600
 able to cover any graphic defect 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.580
 that has the game than world is a 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.520
 fictional city of industrial appearance 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.470
 infested by the plague and that is reflected in 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.630
 perfection at all times we will be 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.850
 amazed by the designs of the environment 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.680
 and the effects of light all with a 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.410
 constant framerate 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.080
 also the port for pc analyzed version 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.910
 It is very well done granting us a 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:25.620
 good amount of graphic options and a 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.870
 unlimited framerate that referred to me 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.760
 I do not like these people either 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.100
 let me live so I can see again 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.380
 my children, it's worth noting that we have 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.780
 several possible endings depending on 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.699
 how have we faced the game how many 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.260
 more corpses let us leave more 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.120
 the plague will spread through the city 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.460
 thanks to the rats and worse end 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.530
 we will get that's why it's 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.030
 advisable to use stealth and leave 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.580
 alive I am aware to the enemies 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.889
 except to the targets that kill them 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.500
 directly this grant of playability 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:58.350
 to the title to see what would have happened if 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.639
 we would have played differently 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.919
 Secondary visions are fine 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.360
 raised inviting you to complete them already 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.190
 that are strongly linked to the 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.199
 main mission arriving some 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:11.960
 even to modify our initial plan 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.960
 and to face an important decision 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.990
 Regarding the multiplayer section there 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.790
 to say that it is not included and neither 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.950
 there is a need for it to enjoy 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.560
 everything the game offers in 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.300
 conclusion game recommended and maximum that 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.030
 entertain us from beginning to end 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.250
 highly rejugable and certainly one of 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.960
 the best of the year as a boom of the 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:37.200
 mine his reign with truth or blood 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:40.200
 is not a man easily accessible if 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.990
 would have liked the Empress like that 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.690
 different things would now be 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.050
 revenge the only thing you 're looking for or have 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:51.450
 another plan in mind to restore the 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.030
 order for everything clear and crown as a 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:57.720
 a new empress or you will go up 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:59.040
 cruelly everyone in the neighborhood in both 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.700
 cases 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.700
 I hope to have fun
