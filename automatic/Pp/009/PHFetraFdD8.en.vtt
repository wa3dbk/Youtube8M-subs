00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.009

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.889
 and today we are going to make a dessert without an oven 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.770
 they are cake pops are super great 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.660
 easy it 's super fast they're perfect 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.150
 that if they have little hands they 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.520
 they will love to make them 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.779
 this time I made them with mantecadas but 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.759
 also the schools with the dunes 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.039
 only with the reins with the 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.300
 together or even any bread course of 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.590
 the bakery here will be perfect 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.440
 and then let's start 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.700
 we're just going to need mantecadas or 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.860
 any other sweet bread 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.830
 chocolate to melt the flavor that 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.460
 more like flavor boat bitumen 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.200
 what they like most and pallet sticks 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.240
 first we are going to wash our hands and 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.250
 then we are going to crumble the sweet bread 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.250
 until we have a powder 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.530
 now we are going to put 2 tablespoons of 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:14.450
 bitumen and depending on the amount of 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.909
 bread maybe they will need a 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:22.780
 little bit more and we're going to stir it up 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.780
 that we have a little one like this 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.320
 let's start doing laps 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.650
 and we're going to put them in with that for 10 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.050
 minutes 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.420
 now let's melt a little bit of the 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.010

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.010

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.740
