00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.510
 let's see during missions of the week on behalf of a dog so that's me 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.170
 remember something it was three times four times and each time 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.279
 it's a result once that says I love my money so why 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.940
 because the force my agent feels it suburban cars sun 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.150
 has become rare 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.020
 So here is the Latin Quarter with this restaurant where the student tourists 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.370
 anelka without spending her singing a kitchen 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.100
 traditional 40% in the first quarter that ordered announced 30 minutes 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.920
 after 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.170
 waiting for the trailer% almost 50 minutes to see her waiting for the 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.260
 premium that drew a culture 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.090
 it's a bit flat 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.500
 and next door and I already spotted it's still funny that the prices 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.790
 stopped already at the pickup 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.680
 the circuit fish 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.000
 this attack in the ditch and when the chicken just arrived in 50 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.730
 55 minutes it was not perfect 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.730
 and that's a big disappointment because I found the skin 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.350
 the first steps at all possible between peoples 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.820
 for a month she sounded mercilessly seeing the English are however well 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.030
 sure all this 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.390
 nothing exciting we were cooked happily but% 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.400
 it's sorry what because there is no relief yesterday by the ivy not 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.050
 sure there is not 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.620
 it's in paris and his ministers signed a cdd go through anything 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.340
 it's of no matter how 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.420
 so we click on his glass of wine the bad wine of emotion 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.980
 even if there are others 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.980
 and suddenly it's a real evening the country 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.050
 with what always helps heat fun is the enchanting tables 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.950
 nearby people who have passion for restaurant inputs 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.310
 it's the big Parisian paradox these women stadiums that are so bad 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.009
 new
