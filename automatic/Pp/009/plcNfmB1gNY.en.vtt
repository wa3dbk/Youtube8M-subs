00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.469 
superb performance magnificent job
sluggish<00:04:27.620> performance<00:04:27.770> the<00:04:28.550> whole<00:04:28.760> thing<00:04:29.090> if

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
sluggish performance the whole thing if

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.080 
sluggish performance the whole thing if
that<00:04:29.720> doesn't<00:04:29.960> hold<00:04:30.260> her<00:04:30.440> up<00:04:30.620> into<00:04:31.280> a<00:04:31.520> very

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
that doesn't hold her up into a very

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.430 
that doesn't hold her up into a very
high<00:04:32.330> position<00:04:32.870> I<00:04:32.960> think<00:04:33.199> in<00:04:33.320> this

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
high position I think in this

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.920 
high position I think in this
competition<00:04:33.830> since<00:04:34.370> we're<00:04:34.639> in<00:04:34.820> the<00:04:35.180> last<00:04:35.419> now

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
competition since we're in the last now

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.129 
competition since we're in the last now
dream<00:04:36.710> of<00:04:36.949> the<00:04:37.910> third<00:04:38.180> from<00:04:38.419> the<00:04:38.449> last<00:04:38.750> skater

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
dream of the third from the last skater

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.550 
dream of the third from the last skater
I<00:04:39.500> think<00:04:39.919> that<00:04:40.100> I'll<00:04:40.280> eat<00:04:40.639> my<00:04:40.669> hat<00:04:41.440> but<00:04:42.440> she

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
I think that I'll eat my hat but she

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.580 
I think that I'll eat my hat but she
kept<00:04:42.830> her<00:04:42.949> calm<00:04:43.220> and<00:04:43.699> she<00:04:44.240> really<00:04:44.840> focused<00:04:45.410> on

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
kept her calm and she really focused on

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.909 
kept her calm and she really focused on
each<00:04:46.180> individual<00:04:47.180> jump<00:04:47.539> and<00:04:47.750> just<00:04:48.740> a

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
each individual jump and just a

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:50.950 
each individual jump and just a
beautiful<00:04:49.310> flow<00:04:49.820> of<00:04:49.970> the<00:04:50.090> game<00:04:50.120> couldn't<00:04:50.870> we

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
beautiful flow of the game couldn't we

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.010 
beautiful flow of the game couldn't we
be<00:04:51.110> looking<00:04:51.530> at<00:04:51.680> the<00:04:51.800> next<00:04:52.070> world<00:04:52.310> champion

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
be looking at the next world champion

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.300 
be looking at the next world champion
uniting<00:04:54.020> I<00:04:54.199> think<00:04:54.440> that's<00:04:54.620> difficult<00:04:54.949> to

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
uniting I think that's difficult to

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.060 
uniting I think that's difficult to
example<00:04:55.970> yeah<00:04:56.090> asada<00:04:56.570> nakano<00:04:57.110> still<00:04:57.590> to<00:04:57.830> come

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
example yeah asada nakano still to come

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.100 
example yeah asada nakano still to come
so<00:04:58.550> we'll<00:04:59.030> see<00:04:59.300> we'll<00:04:59.479> check<00:04:59.630> the<00:04:59.750> numbers<00:04:59.990> in

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
so we'll see we'll check the numbers in

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.590 
so we'll see we'll check the numbers in
a<00:05:00.169> moment<00:05:00.500> but<00:05:00.639> the<00:05:01.639> world<00:05:01.970> champ<00:05:02.240> from<00:05:02.389> last

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
a moment but the world champ from last

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.810

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
it obviously is 64 82 for technical

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.310 
it obviously is 64 82 for technical
elements<00:06:25.010> I<00:06:25.750> think<00:06:26.750> it's<00:06:26.870> gonna<00:06:27.020> be<00:06:27.140> wonderful

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320 
elements I think it's gonna be wonderful

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.840 
elements I think it's gonna be wonderful
to<00:06:27.590> see<00:06:27.860> if<00:06:27.920> they're<00:06:28.160> at<00:06:28.310> a<00:06:28.340> hundred<00:06:28.610> percent

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:28.850 
to see if they're at a hundred percent

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.300 
to see if they're at a hundred percent
it<00:06:29.180> will<00:06:29.360> but<00:06:29.540> guess<00:06:29.750> what<00:06:29.990> it's<00:06:30.320> not<00:06:30.800> enough

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:31.310 
it will but guess what it's not enough

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.580 
it will but guess what it's not enough
to<00:06:31.730> pull<00:06:31.970> her<00:06:32.000> ahead<00:06:32.240> of<00:06:32.450> carolina<00:06:33.260> kostner
