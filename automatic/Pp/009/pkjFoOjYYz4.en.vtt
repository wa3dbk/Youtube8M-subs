00:00:01.849 --> 00:00:05.479
 until quite a lot of dikes a Volkamer has talked about a 

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:09.080
 Parking ticket in the everything went over me I am now people here for the time 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.760
 I'm just coming home because I've been around for a long time 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.629
 another kilo 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:15.929
 because in many cases the judges followed me already 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:21.050
 and where I was totally impressed and not just so blatant victims 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.239
 finally move in 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:25.390
 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.119
 Century has premiered today and that's why I have to 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.220
 of course immediately after doing so yes I'm currently missing but the 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.000
 People earn money and he has to be there right after 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.070
 and my heartbeat 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.680
 and what say it's just one of the best movies I've ever seen 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.050
 and a very she has had her dignified graduation 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.019
 he had an opinion, you can be your opinion 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:46.950
 west 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.010
 and stopped and best told us 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.980
 most touching with history 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.390
 and film series the topic was produced 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.390
 So personally I am a huge hype to lead what do you know yet 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.690
 not yet reading "the first two books read aloud and read as read 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.370
 I have read all the books umpteen times 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.820
 when they read the same nine days I have bought all the Turkish 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.840
 Merged to God hundreds of times and of course was immediately in 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.840
 make a movie 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.030
 and create an enthusiastic this universe has packed me so 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.869
 washed-out opponents was for that I do not evaluate German bank 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.619
 bought all life or bought I was several times at carnival education 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:21.670
 Disguised Potter 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.470
 because I'm simple with these cases of these mens potter universe 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.140
 I also think that at the moment that she has made it 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.570
 Michel Temer of the universe so much to cast a spell that is not the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.200
 whole Kinderland fest 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.120
 which was a great pity when the movie was over and I almost had to 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.729
 cry 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.260
 I cook or squeeze 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.689
 I had to want to fit 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.600
 because with the end of the film can also be his my childhood 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.619
 Michael Pachter always accompanied more and more children no matter where I was in 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.359
 Dahlem what year of my life and made something in front of me 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:50.439
 if you can either new movies or new book from me in the future, too 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:51.980
 I was happy 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.350
 it is really over 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.460
 But everything can be the actual topic of the video 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.720
 I found the supposedly private Beinlich Levi made 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.920
 with a good degree this grandiose against Jahn Rheine 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.819
 but the movie did not go insane 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:06.990
 he was very epic 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.319
 very emotionally, the message has brought the book across well and indeed 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.680
 Really something for everyone, it was really all about it 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.699
 was brought 

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:16.790
 trained and guilty 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.189
 good around 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.129
 Love and friendship 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.399
 sacrifice 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:24.989
 all important things in life 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.760
 after view in his life except food 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.959
 Hampel at the very story plays something very cool by Schumann 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.689
 from the movie very very exciting and although I told 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:35.120
 of course I knew what the end would be like as I have read the last book several times 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.159
 read or big Fannys has extremely exciting and in between 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.659
 also often beat my heart 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.759
 really like him from Krattenmacher 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:45.899
 good smells good friendships deepen 

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:49.369
 and if you really euro and I did not know that I was from the village 

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:52.949
 I always hoped to the end and therefore pressed unreal 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.910
 I was such a band in this movie and I find it an apartment a year 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.239
 that does not make many movies 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.680
 what makes me as a petty one, of course, especially interested 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.149
 are and the special effects 

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:04.859
 under the movie today every few seconds 8 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.109
 Isar 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:07.989
 Century made 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.400
 It is not just that he reloads the castle 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.219
 somehow collapses or destroys with walls and walls if you 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:15.440
 all the spells 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.940
 that belongs together lead 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.789
 but for example 

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:21.799
 Although I am always told my keyword Kuipers 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.590
 in Grimentz Gartz too 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.070
 what occupies us as high as in the hall 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.249
 and when I think about what's wrong I'm so happy to get my turn 

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:32.249
 kind 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:42.090
 Hello Sieglinde what makes so special Soboll Dr that the Chancellor 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.510
 the players of other entrepreneurs different assumptions and 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.370
 unclear panther there 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.489
 and if I look at it in our movie 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.519
 Friedman 2 6 2 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.269
 The finale was the last resort, the battle between good and evil 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:57.589
 shown 

00:03:57.589 --> 00:04:01.019
 and secondly so Rebscher I really want in seven cases 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.749
 and books was built 

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:04.640
 and now just started walking 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.930
 it was stress Wandhofen involved because hope creatures bunch mages 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.359
 also football games Vettel 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.409
 from a 4 4 four different venues 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:16.609
 very emotional very gripping very tragic very epic 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.499
 an insane one 

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:22.770
 natural 20 years such expectations are lodged 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.779
 still in the movie to turn the solos is a series changed 

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:29.759
 which are now celebrating millions of fans for ten years but that's exactly what it has 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:31.059
 Director and Coop creates 

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:34.199
 they have put on an amazingly good movie a terrific good ending 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:35.550
 this amazingly good series 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.629
 of that, sincerely, sincerely, thank you 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:40.699
 of course also has the theatrical performances for the 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.309
 highest level and what I still noticed very positive though the music 

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:48.159
 But the march route for the movie knows where it really juices every single one 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:49.140
 Movie was taken 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.370
 and then fitting spot was screwed 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.370
 always seen scenes or small elements from the past days 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.069
 By which one said Cross that means everything on this once in the squad 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:01.300
 and they just mastered it so perfectly 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.800
 It has become such a good movie and all fans of Harry Potter crisis 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.480
 benefit 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.900
 go in there and also on all the other ads hopefully brought good movie 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:09.669
 to have 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.970
 Around one o'clock comes the day where the others are when you enter the Panoz 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.460
 the world do not regret that his awesome movie so good of the good 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.300
 Taste is still in any case 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.479
 what then comes is of course that the first hype was there in 3d 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.219
 sent and they have 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:27.199
 to the blog also very well to get the line that he never 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:31.019
 pushy to exchange Prison has that permanent depth effect that you can 

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:32.150
 can look further 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.000
 and that you especially the levels the law seven people for example then 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.650
 also stand still 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.850
 then of course we want to highlight and have important items 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.159
 they mastered really well 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:41.900
 and that will pass 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.050
 I really liked it was not too intrusive and 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.380
 Last but not least a joker consultant has seen the draft is not always 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.610
 just everything fit he really liked me a lot I was ten 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.189
 happy with the movie 

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:56.619
 As I said in between we have mitgefiebert two triple protective walls 

00:05:56.619 --> 00:06:00.110
 Tears beautiful extremely sad extremely tragic 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.110
 But at the same time he gave a lot of money 

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:08.409
 But I must say to seduce that thanks to Tatum o'neal have been all 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:11.299
 People have been involved in the film around this then in all the people themselves 

00:06:11.299 --> 00:06:14.259
 just this sporty video here so far not under 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:16.819
 I just had to say my opinion about the movie in front of the camera 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:18.990
 I also had some camera and 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.370
 I'm out of practice 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.520
 the next came the guys coming frontal lobes coming soon around the world 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.069
 I will work with you today too 

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:27.819
 but that may take some time 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:29.169
 I have to see that 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:30.539
 that to recover 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:33.750
 nice even more memorable you the movie urgently times Ernst h 

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:38.249
 see you 

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:48.569
 similar
