a<00:00:28.470> senior<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:28.800> high<00:00:28.980> school<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.519> really<00:00:29.789> had<00:00:29.939> no

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
a senior in high school I really had no

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.209 
a senior in high school I really had no
idea<00:00:30.090> what<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.480> wanted<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.810> do<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.260> didn't<00:00:32.160> know

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
idea what I wanted to do I didn't know

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.040 
idea what I wanted to do I didn't know
what<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.430> computer<00:00:32.759> scientists<00:00:33.210> were<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.690> in

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
what the computer scientists were and in

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.209 
what the computer scientists were and in
fact<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.500> didn't<00:00:34.800> even<00:00:34.860> know<00:00:35.010> what<00:00:35.160> an

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
fact I didn't even know what an

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.270 
fact I didn't even know what an
algorithm<00:00:35.670> was<00:00:35.790> what<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.719> an<00:00:36.870> algorithm

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
algorithm was what is an algorithm

uh-huh<00:00:38.540> have<00:00:39.540> no<00:00:39.870> idea<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.620> mean<00:00:41.610> maybe<00:00:41.879> a

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
uh-huh have no idea I mean maybe a

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.290 
uh-huh have no idea I mean maybe a
second<00:00:42.480> album<00:00:42.809> hazards<00:00:43.879> I<00:00:44.899> have<00:00:45.899> no<00:00:46.200> idea<00:00:47.300> like

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
second album hazards I have no idea like

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.510 
second album hazards I have no idea like
a<00:00:48.329> graph<00:00:48.660> with<00:00:49.050> something<00:00:49.440> thank<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.070> hot

everywhere computer scientists have

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.770 
everywhere computer scientists have
helped<00:00:58.559> create<00:00:58.770> your<00:00:58.980> ipod<00:00:59.370> cell<00:00:59.940> phone<00:01:00.239> car

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
helped create your ipod cell phone car

lab<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.570> where<00:01:06.750> we<00:01:06.900> have<00:01:07.080> robots<00:01:07.439> that

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
lab this is where we have robots that

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.770 
lab this is where we have robots that
play<00:01:07.860> robotic<00:01:08.369> soccer<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:09.119> reason<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.510> we

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
play robotic soccer the reason that we

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.010 
play robotic soccer the reason that we
have<00:01:10.409> robots<00:01:10.950> playing<00:01:11.250> soccer<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.900> we

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
have robots playing soccer is so that we

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.080 
have robots playing soccer is so that we
can<00:01:13.229> test<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.799> bunch<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.070> algorithms<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.880> are

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
can test a bunch of algorithms that are

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.640 
can test a bunch of algorithms that are
at<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.479> fact<00:01:15.630> actually<00:01:16.020> read<00:01:16.200> general

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
at in fact actually read general

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.560 
at in fact actually read general
algorithms<00:01:17.130> like<00:01:17.280> vision<00:01:17.729> algorithms<00:01:17.880> and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
algorithms like vision algorithms and

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.969 
algorithms like vision algorithms and
motion<00:01:19.020> algorithms<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.740> teamwork

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
motion algorithms and teamwork

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.640 
motion algorithms and teamwork
algorithms<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.790> those<00:01:21.479> algorithms<00:01:21.689> we<00:01:22.439> put

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
algorithms and those algorithms we put

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.780 
algorithms and those algorithms we put
them<00:01:22.770> on<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.950> robots<00:01:23.250> but<00:01:23.400> they're<00:01:23.640> actually

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
them on the robots but they're actually

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.520 
them on the robots but they're actually
kind<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.299> general-purpose<00:01:24.630> things<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.439> we

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
kind of general-purpose things that we

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.130 
kind of general-purpose things that we
could<00:01:25.710> apply<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.009> any<00:01:26.420> particular<00:01:27.420> problem

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
could apply to any particular problem

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.660 
could apply to any particular problem
out<00:01:28.320> there<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.770> for<00:01:28.920> example<00:01:29.009> like<00:01:29.400> these

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
out there so for example like these

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.890 
out there so for example like these
robots<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.090> little<00:01:30.270> cameras<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.810> their

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
robots have little cameras and their

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.060 
robots have little cameras and their
nose<00:01:31.079> it's<00:01:31.290> right<00:01:31.439> there<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.829> that's<00:01:31.920> how

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
nose it's right there and that's how

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.190 
nose it's right there and that's how
they<00:01:32.189> see<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.460> world<00:01:32.509> but<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.720> problem<00:01:33.900> of

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
they see the world but the problem of

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.109 
they see the world but the problem of
doing<00:01:34.470> computer<00:01:34.740> vision<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.310> translating

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
doing computer vision of translating

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.999 
doing computer vision of translating
with<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.329> robot<00:01:36.540> sees<00:01:36.869> which<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> digital

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
with the robot sees which is a digital

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.580 
with the robot sees which is a digital
image<00:01:38.100> into<00:01:39.060> meaningful<00:01:39.720> objects<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.530> things

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
image into meaningful objects and things

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.080 
image into meaningful objects and things
like<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:40.920> like<00:01:41.220> actually<00:01:41.549> seeing<00:01:41.939> that

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
like that like actually seeing that

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.399 
like that like actually seeing that
that's<00:01:42.270> like<00:01:42.329> goal<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.810> not<00:01:42.930> just<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.170> bunch<00:01:43.350> of

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
that's like goal and not just a bunch of

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.230 
that's like goal and not just a bunch of
yellow<00:01:43.770> pixels<00:01:44.159> over<00:01:44.399> there<00:01:44.549> that's<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.060> really

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
yellow pixels over there that's a really

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.850 
yellow pixels over there that's a really
hard<00:01:45.270> problem<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.990> people<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:46.500> computer

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
hard problem and people in computer

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.139 
hard problem and people in computer
vision<00:01:46.890> have<00:01:47.250> been<00:01:47.399> researching<00:01:47.850> that

translate to advances that could be used

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.429 
translate to advances that could be used
all<00:01:57.270> over<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.540> world<00:01:57.689> for<00:01:57.960> any<00:01:58.110> sort<00:01:58.290> of

we're<00:02:13.599> trying<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:13.900> do<00:02:13.989> is<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.200> look<00:02:14.620> out

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
we're trying to do is to look out

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.380 
we're trying to do is to look out
another<00:02:15.069> 10<00:02:15.280> or<00:02:15.310> 15<00:02:15.700> years<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:16.120> figure<00:02:16.360> out

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
another 10 or 15 years and figure out

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.270 
another 10 or 15 years and figure out
how<00:02:16.780> people<00:02:17.560> should<00:02:17.590> be<00:02:17.739> can<00:02:17.890> build<00:02:18.189> in

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
how people should be can build in

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.009 
how people should be can build in
computer<00:02:18.549> systems<00:02:18.700> much<00:02:19.329> beyond<00:02:19.689> what

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
computer systems much beyond what

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.500

industry is capable of doing today and

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.649 
industry is capable of doing today and
to<00:02:22.959> do<00:02:23.079> that<00:02:23.640> we<00:02:24.640> actually<00:02:24.909> build<00:02:25.450> real

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
to do that we actually build real

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.780 
to do that we actually build real
prototypes<00:02:26.170> so<00:02:26.319> for<00:02:26.680> example<00:02:26.799> we<00:02:27.640> have

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
prototypes so for example we have

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.399 
prototypes so for example we have
designed<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.329> implemented<00:02:28.629> a<00:02:28.810> real<00:02:29.170> computer

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409 
designed and implemented a real computer

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:31.319 
designed and implemented a real computer
chip<00:02:29.739> with<00:02:30.280> some<00:02:30.400> of<00:02:30.489> our<00:02:30.519> novel<00:02:30.849> ideas<00:02:31.180> on

them on it and we're experimenting with

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.399 
them on it and we're experimenting with
those<00:02:34.239> ideas<00:02:34.360> in<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.810> lab<00:02:34.989> you<00:02:35.379> know

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409 
those ideas in the lab you know

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.559 
those ideas in the lab you know
computers<00:02:35.829> are<00:02:35.920> used<00:02:36.099> pervasively<00:02:36.760> in<00:02:37.150> in

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
computers are used pervasively in in

society and in and in the sciences so

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.250 
society and in and in the sciences so
we're<00:02:40.599> really<00:02:40.750> trying<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:40.989> build<00:02:41.170> the

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
we're really trying to build the

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.599 
we're really trying to build the
infrastructure<00:02:41.349> to<00:02:41.920> help<00:02:42.099> further

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
advancement of all those other areas

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:45.770 
advancement of all those other areas
that<00:02:44.230> rely<00:02:44.409> on<00:02:44.560> high-performance<00:02:44.709> computing

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
that rely on high-performance computing

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.589 
that rely on high-performance computing
ok<00:02:46.780> so<00:02:46.840> near<00:02:47.739> o<00:02:47.890> stands<00:02:48.640> for<00:02:48.730> new<00:02:49.180> evolving

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
ok so near o stands for new evolving

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.619 
ok so near o stands for new evolving
robotic<00:02:49.989> operatives<00:02:50.440> is<00:02:51.129> a<00:02:51.340> game<00:02:51.609> that<00:02:51.909> was

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
robotic operatives is a game that was

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.089 
robotic operatives is a game that was
developed<00:02:52.810> in<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.290> neural<00:02:53.769> networks

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
research group in the computer science

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.300 
research group in the computer science
department<00:02:56.440> by<00:02:57.280> a<00:02:57.310> graduate<00:02:57.819> student<00:02:58.180> and

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
department by a graduate student and

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.309 
department by a graduate student and
undergraduates<00:03:00.310> done<00:03:00.879> a<00:03:00.909> lot<00:03:01.060> of<00:03:01.319> programming

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
undergraduates done a lot of programming

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.110 
undergraduates done a lot of programming
work<00:03:02.530> on<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:02.799> it's<00:03:03.519> been<00:03:03.639> developed<00:03:03.940> over<00:03:04.000> the

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
work on it it's been developed over the

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.069 
work on it it's been developed over the
past<00:03:04.209> three<00:03:04.569> years<00:03:05.370> so<00:03:06.370> this<00:03:07.090> game<00:03:07.540> is<00:03:07.989> really

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
past three years so this game is really

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.050 
past three years so this game is really
useful<00:03:08.290> for<00:03:08.650> us<00:03:08.739> for<00:03:08.920> research<00:03:09.220> but<00:03:09.849> it's<00:03:09.970> also

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
useful for us for research but it's also

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.699 
useful for us for research but it's also
useful<00:03:10.239> for<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.930> gaming<00:03:11.200> industry<00:03:11.230> because

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
useful for the gaming industry because

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.800 
useful for the gaming industry because
right<00:03:11.920> now<00:03:11.950> a<00:03:12.250> lot<00:03:12.400> of<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.670> AI<00:03:13.120> that's<00:03:13.510> built

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
right now a lot of the AI that's built

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.229 
right now a lot of the AI that's built
into<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.109> game<00:03:14.260> it's<00:03:14.500> really<00:03:14.680> pretty<00:03:14.769> dumb

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
into the game it's really pretty dumb

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.339 
into the game it's really pretty dumb
and<00:03:16.239> so<00:03:16.930> there<00:03:17.379> is<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:17.500> need<00:03:18.310> in<00:03:19.269> a<00:03:19.870> lot<00:03:20.109> of<00:03:20.139> games

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
and so there is a need in a lot of games

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:24.409 
and so there is a need in a lot of games
to<00:03:20.530> create<00:03:20.799> kind<00:03:21.430> of<00:03:21.549> intelligent<00:03:22.030> or<00:03:22.269> four

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
to create kind of intelligent or four

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.930 
to create kind of intelligent or four
useful<00:03:25.419> characters<00:03:25.989> that<00:03:26.530> are<00:03:26.739> able<00:03:26.859> to<00:03:27.160> make

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
useful characters that are able to make

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.039 
useful characters that are able to make
the<00:03:28.060> game<00:03:28.209> more<00:03:28.239> interesting<00:03:28.480> and<00:03:28.959> more

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
the game more interesting and more

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.920 
the game more interesting and more
interactive<00:03:30.040> and<00:03:30.129> so<00:03:30.480> working<00:03:31.480> in<00:03:31.599> this<00:03:31.750> kind

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
interactive and so working in this kind

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.689 
interactive and so working in this kind

an interest in computer science I think

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.210 
an interest in computer science I think
that<00:06:10.280> you<00:06:10.400> should<00:06:10.430> do<00:06:10.730> what<00:06:11.000> you<00:06:11.270> love<00:06:11.990> and<00:06:12.380> as

that you should do what you love and as

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.280 
that you should do what you love and as
it<00:06:13.940> turns<00:06:14.120> out<00:06:14.270> a<00:06:14.330> lot<00:06:14.630> of<00:06:14.690> the<00:06:14.930> things<00:06:15.169> that

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.290 
it turns out a lot of the things that

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.220 
it turns out a lot of the things that
