00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 very good kids here I will be 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.960
 commenting we are in battlefield 1943 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.330
 as you can see in the background and I know that many 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.190
 I will say you're a copycat not know 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.719
 you will tell me a thousand things but I'm not 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.040
 copying nobody just that I'm 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.010
 doing my way and how I like and 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.869
 a second that had an uncle in front and not 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.970
 see me if there is a man who happens to you 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.310
 many told me of copies ages well 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.140
 to a thousand thousand stories but I'm going to 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.880
 do my way so I hope that they 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.500
 like and as you can see I'm not 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.110
 making attacks filtre but attacks was 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.640
 in 1943 that I think it's much more 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.500
 hard 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.180
 and over I'm not playing a pc I'm 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.500
 playing in teams and I have an uncle 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.150
 in front of me, the same thing always happens to me 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.360
 whenever you have two you shoot a half 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.270
 I do not know why there is a lower fee 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.110
 that is fine 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.100
 or look at it in this way empty 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.100
 in the head 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.300
 how good they are going to answer us 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.870
 ready 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.520
 come on 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.990
 they changed as a small challenge and 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.830
 sniper rifle worth 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.810
 Let's see 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.040
 because it lies we have the answer lante 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.180
 not worth neither move nor for 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.250
 side or for the other what happens that 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.390
 get to a point where they expect to be 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.650
 they will go down the rock from behind because they know 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.880
 that we are all on this side so 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:28.130
 come on, if not, do not 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.189
 no we are not nobody I think I'm going to have 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.270
 to go pulling towards the area of 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.979
 up the mountain to be now 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.690
 how the little friends are advancing ostia 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.400
 take the explosions 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.860
 how are the progresses in my team 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.110
 so let's go up here if 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.300
 we can with the flag that we 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.790
 it would come perfectly for so 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.420
 have your base your front base 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.220
 at your base but trying not just to 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.670
 shot a little bit later on the 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.020
 primer 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.890
 look at it look at it 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.710
 but man 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.420
 not a bullet 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.180
 more than they arrive and they kill him with a 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.430
 relationship that filippo ti 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.259
 and also another one that is sometimes taken from me 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.080
 explosion between planes and the moon 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.220
 that we have michael fleeman I have 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.950
 another one that is brushed 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.690
 and there is a franc and there is a frank uncle 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.310
 impossible to call me such a frank when 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.129
 he just charged the one below to the same 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.450
 it's impossible, well, neither is it 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.099
 either the fit that was a franc 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.560
 for example I imagine I can not imagine why 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.810
 this is undermined 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.130
 there is one sure you upload any champion 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.130
 hoping that looking forward 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:41.319
 let's see a lot you'll tell me why not 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:44.129
 you go to the base attack them not so Augustine 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.129
 marquetti or 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.930
 the life of the sniper so there's no 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.100
 go to look for them the sniper is the 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.700
 that you have to stay just 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:57.210
 behind the whole group of soldiers and 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.850
 I have another one in front of me and it failed me 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.810
 uncle mother how bad I am at the worst is that 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.849
 it's not still killing me 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.890
 I do not know if a sniper killed me but 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.390
 the worst is that it still kills me haughty 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.650
 good as silly as we are going 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.319
 third and that we're going to 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.790
 snipers imagine that they are not 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.569
 doing the rest of the team 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.569
 and that missile 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.380
 I have them in front of me 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.270
 I do not give 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.210
 many others you will tell me is battlefield 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.370
 because it does not do or is to do it from the fall 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.230
 of the voucher and that here, in my opinion, 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.280
 has the bullet fall for nothing anymore 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.280
 we have two others in front I think I go 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.280
 perfect 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.590
 good 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.680
 peer 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:55.140
 tomato 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.909
 do not be good it's worth that there is no fall 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.099
 of the bullet here the bullet has not fallen or 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:01.379
 be I see that it goes in a straight line I think 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.659
 that he has talked about the map I do not give him and 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.159
 what it is when a person goes 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.659
 running for example was 2 if you have him 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:09.599
 that shoot a tad more forward or a 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:11.270
 tidy further back because if not no no no 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.310
 you are going to give so 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.230
 and what they did, they wanted to do it well 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.130
 but in part they are wrong or blame the 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.340
 fall of the bullet but good 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.480
 you can not ask for more either because 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.800
 I like the game or the world 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.570
 like the games of the second war 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.480
 I'm crazy, so I'm not going to 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.990
 be complaining either 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.990
 Y 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.060
 and I have it here 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:40.080
 I have here look look everything is not going to 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.680
 leave apply we are going with everything and I 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.290
 kill 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:47.620
 apply yourself a sniper that 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.690
 seconds 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.380
 you know that the rest of the machine equipment 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.380
 one hundred percent 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.630
 I found my mother a plane a 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.630
 helicopter 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.720
 I have not heard it yet 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.409
 and those in the house 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.030
 no no 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.280
 you have to eat it for balls 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.230
 Mazzola Barattini Central looks at a model 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.360
 you ate over the head 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.260
 on top of the big headed and sasso 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.800
 girl 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.800
 to the 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.980
 there is no one and the 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.610
 departure so let's if we can do 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.099
 anything else 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.449
 well I know that the game is running out 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:42.409
 kids so I do not know by the sound 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:42.409
 background that like a mermaid 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.960
 so I know that it is running out 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.960
 starting from mine we have a front 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.180
 I 'm not going 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.630
 you have to die uncle later that has 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.060
 that dying is less bad 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.220
 a franc but where is frank 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:03.890
 Uncle, what is he in his glass? 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.890
 It can not be that I dressed 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.919
 come on, it's coming to an end 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:14.780
 where others were but that is not done 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:14.780
 without marking a hit market 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:18.980
 what luck that does not stay now sure 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:21.530
 that at home 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.570
 and my uncle kills what all the fools 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.930
 they are lucky he gave all the fools 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:29.440
 they are lucky that no one escapes 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.630
 what luck lad 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.040
 but our team our teams the 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.270
 last ones that have negative points like that 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.540
 that you imagine the team that 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.540
 I have 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.040
 well it's worth here it's over I hope you'll 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.980
 you liked already know if they liked it 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:45.520
 Like to comment and until next time 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.520
 goodbye
