00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.280
 well that's what everyone is 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.990
 you are here today for a 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.380
 very little video pretty corruption 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.779
 video announcement where I want to propose 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.600
 something is going but subscribers in some 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.570
 so yes that's it like the times are 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.980
 harder on youtube for 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.770
 a little everyone does in general 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.390
 it's hard for everyone and me 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.400
 also although I'm not too many videos 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.290
 and everything but that right now that's what 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.480
 I think it will resume everything 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.340
 just to the new consoles 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.600
 generation 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.519
 colautti ice that's for sure 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.710
 will take over parts on so much of 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.300
 things to show that but that's fine 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.220
 cartoning 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.920
 but right now it's a little bit soft 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.570
 and that's why I would like 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.050
 even because you have to see that I have 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.280
 still a little bit of a view 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.300
 it's not the top of my five thousand 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.080
 subscribers I'm going to do a lot 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.750
 but if I can help a little bit if 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.800
 I'm not trying to get it 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.350
 risk we are people 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.720
 so I thought a little trick for 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.140
 help the youtuber who are among the 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.630
 subscribers if you have few subscribers so 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.250
 that I will see when I look and that 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.619
 you want you think your 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.810
 work it's still original there I 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.520
 will be careful because that's work 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.320
 original something that comes out a little 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.100
 little of the ordinary or a 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.630
 special feature a little special that's so 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.850
 you think you bring your 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.070
 touch of originality that your work 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.539
 you do it but it is not so put 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.110
 ahead and you do not get too much to the 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.810
 put forward 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.630
