00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
it one of the most effective if you

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.390 
it one of the most effective if you
don't<00:01:21.570> have<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.750> freezer<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.040> put<00:01:23.189> ice<00:01:23.369> in

don't have a freezer is to put ice in
the<00:01:23.640> glass<00:01:23.689> this<00:01:24.689> had<00:01:24.930> some<00:01:25.409> soda<00:01:25.650> water<00:01:25.880> this

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
the glass this had some soda water this

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.520 
the glass this had some soda water this
means<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.360> entire<00:01:27.750> inside<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.350> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
means that the entire inside of the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.280 
means that the entire inside of the
glass<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.979> chilled<00:01:29.570> but<00:01:30.570> also<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.020> solar

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
glass is chilled but also the solar

water<00:01:31.530> actually<00:01:31.950> has<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.250> very<00:01:32.520> small<00:01:32.880> salt

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
water actually has a very small salt

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.330 
water actually has a very small salt
content<00:01:33.630> which<00:01:34.350> reduces<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.130> freezing

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
content which reduces the freezing

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.670 
content which reduces the freezing
content<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.090> water<00:01:36.329> so<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.110> makes<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.439> even

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
content of the water so it makes it even

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.310 
content of the water so it makes it even
colder<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.790> why<00:01:38.880> icebergs<00:01:39.390> float<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:40.110> the

colder this is why icebergs float in the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.190 
colder this is why icebergs float in the

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
with 14 million 906 so you see the level

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.229 
with 14 million 906 so you see the level
of<00:03:31.450> the<00:03:31.540> liquids<00:03:31.900> have<00:03:32.019> dropped<00:03:32.260> down<00:03:33.239> and

of the liquids have dropped down and
then<00:03:34.480> going<00:03:34.690> to<00:03:34.780> get<00:03:34.870> my<00:03:34.989> julep<00:03:35.440> strainer

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
then going to get my julep strainer

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.920 
then going to get my julep strainer
because<00:03:36.190> of<00:03:36.340> Hawthorne<00:03:36.730> strainer<00:03:36.940> doesn't

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930

fit so nicely in there the julep

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.509 
fit so nicely in there the julep
strainer<00:03:40.239> will<00:03:40.720> fit<00:03:40.870> nicely<00:03:40.900> on<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.500> top<00:03:41.739> and

strainer will fit nicely on the top and

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.030 
strainer will fit nicely on the top and
remove<00:03:42.880> that<00:03:42.910> ice<00:03:43.440> shaking<00:03:44.440> it<00:03:44.650> to<00:03:44.739> get<00:03:44.890> rid<00:03:45.010> of
