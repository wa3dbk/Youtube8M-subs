00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 Hi guys, how are you? I'm going there today. 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.470
 start a new style of video that I 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.630
 was creating a time in which 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.830
 I 'll tell you guys to get dressed. 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.199
 I do not like those videos and the like 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.000
 related to the literature normally and 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.480
 put a little that I found of 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.630
 each of them and will not propose the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.140
 periphery where specific city when 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.640
 have some 20 next to the cvm show 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.340
 You, then, the first thing I 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.230
 wanted to process the map magazine but they 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.809
 maybe from here the first issue the second 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.930
 I think it should come out a new and 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.390
 proposal is to discuss literature in various 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.809
 elements then do not have both things 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.300
 more classic like renault thirds 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.390
 various types and evening 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.140
 She was very beautiful and she brings so many 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:59.520
 thirds of people cmed from here 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:04.949
 writing as texts produced dani 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:08.850
 I agree a force or, and at times, art is 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:14.000
 a cool graphic design and I liked it 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.000
 many of the texts in this list of files 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.100
 a very interesting selection I 'll go 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.780
 leave a link or else to 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.900
 find more information about it 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.710
 anima and another magazine that I wanted 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.110
 also indicate is the cut are starting to 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.770
 launch this special edition of great 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.020
 interviews interview selections 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.210
 that have passed through the magazine is 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.920
 The one that has to comment is the book 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.970
 saramago 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.850
 It's cool, and I think it's cool, too. 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.799
 all the more that I've read 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.040
 very cool interview 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.130
 so if anyone is interested in the province 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.600
 Interesting people. 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.720
 Another thing they called me to 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.000
 me that of a monograph that studied 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.489
 bit the subtle graphic part some 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.530
 simple cosac but I found it well 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.959
 interesting I think that for those who 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.390
 is interested in it for this part 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.819
 graphic edition of books can also 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.160
 I think it's cool, never let it down. 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:24.030
 Another cool thing that's happening is 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.410
 a promotion of written literature were 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.810
 all women 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.060
 so I 'll leave a simple exam 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.450
 I also have male who is promoting 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.549
 Juliana Brina, who already had 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.209
 and a more urgent bill 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:42.569
 women of 2014 also increase 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.299
 publishing things to the actor 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.310
 wrote a text in the afterword 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.630
 about this I'll leave the following 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.870
 to cheer 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.239
 I find it interesting because I already felt 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.910
 that last year lagged like me 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.190
 I have many books by male authors and 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.519
 few of women authors 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.700
 So anyway I think it brings a 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.519
 inspiration brings tips from other illegal 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.670
 So it might be a good idea of love. 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:14.579
 conferred on written by 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.010
 women and I wanted to indicate no one says 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.200
 which were the texts published in the newspaper 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.230
 draft over alice moron 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.780
 I thought it was nice talking a little more 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.239
 about her madness then if they 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.430
 will also stagnate but a link that I 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.340
 I wanted to show you guys a story. 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.350
 published in the newspaper Economic Value at 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.350
 column a little about work in the 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.870
 your riff who is a literary agent here 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.520
 in Brazil and who is the one who takes care of 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:47.060
 majority of our most famous authors 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.500
 say so and how a little there is 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.300
 very deep but when a 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.830
 a little about her work then 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.440
 they left everything the same 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:58.280
 I finally wanted to suggest a little trick 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.230
 of a new book by JosÃ© Carrascosa and 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.780
 It is published I did not cheat by 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.420
 cosac naify this in a snippet of it in 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.340
 Gringa magazine then it's in English 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.060
 but I found an excerpt from a 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.740
 very beautiful sensitivity of 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.540
 basically I'll buy a book 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.299
 as soon as he leaves because he really 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.200
 it was not enough then we will have 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.690
 in box 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.690
 well I hope you like me 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.760
 then comment on what you thought 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.520
