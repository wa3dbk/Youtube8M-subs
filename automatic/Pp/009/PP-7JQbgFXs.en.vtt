to skip step here but i was going to

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.339 
to skip step here but i was going to
start<00:00:27.210> by<00:00:27.330> showing<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.660> just<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:28.080> little<00:00:28.230> bit

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
start by showing you just a little bit

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.150 
start by showing you just a little bit
about<00:00:29.810> paint<00:00:30.810> consistency<00:00:31.560> since<00:00:31.830> i<00:00:32.009> know

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
about paint consistency since i know

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.560 
about paint consistency since i know
that<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.579> was<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.759> concern<00:00:33.000> i've<00:00:33.390> got<00:00:33.540> a

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
that that was a concern i've got a

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.850 
that that was a concern i've got a
couple<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.960> different<00:00:34.230> brown<00:00:34.380> paints<00:00:34.800> that

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
couple of different brown paints that

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.389 
couple of different brown paints that
are<00:00:36.110> different<00:00:37.110> consistencies<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:37.920> then<00:00:38.370> I

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
are different consistencies and then I

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.040 
are different consistencies and then I
think<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.730> have<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.910> pretty<00:00:39.149> thick<00:00:39.270> paint<00:00:39.780> that's

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
think I have a pretty thick paint that's

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.260 
think I have a pretty thick paint that's
maybe<00:00:41.040> not<00:00:41.129> brown<00:00:41.520> but<00:00:41.550> it'll<00:00:41.969> give<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.180> an

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
maybe not brown but it'll give you an

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.700 
maybe not brown but it'll give you an
idea<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.930> paint<00:00:43.170> that's<00:00:43.379> just<00:00:43.530> way<00:00:43.649> too

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
idea of the paint that's just way too

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.790 
idea of the paint that's just way too
thick<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.600> anyway<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.899> start<00:00:46.110> with<00:00:46.260> let's<00:00:46.500> talk

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
thick so anyway to start with let's talk

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.580 
thick so anyway to start with let's talk
about<00:00:47.070> paint<00:00:47.489> consistency<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.180> little<00:00:48.420> bit<00:00:48.590> the

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
about paint consistency a little bit the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.680 
about paint consistency a little bit the
first<00:00:49.890> paint<00:00:50.250> which<00:00:50.850> I'll<00:00:51.000> show<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.300> which<00:00:51.660> is

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
first paint which I'll show you which is

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.080 
first paint which I'll show you which is
a<00:00:51.840> perfect<00:00:52.649> consistency<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.640> actually<00:00:53.969> going

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
a perfect consistency is actually going

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.360 
a perfect consistency is actually going
to<00:00:54.149> be<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.600> suitable<00:00:55.230> paint<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.039> don't<00:00:56.250> want

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
to be a suitable paint and I don't want

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.770 
to be a suitable paint and I don't want
you<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.579> take<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.789> as<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:58.039> sign<00:00:59.420> that<00:01:00.420> only

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
you to take that as a sign that only

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.970 
you to take that as a sign that only
sital<00:01:01.170> paints<00:01:01.379> are<00:01:01.469> going<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.649> be<00:01:01.739> good

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
sital paints are going to be good

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.840 
sital paints are going to be good

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
consistency but this one is one of my

but<00:01:51.720> right<00:01:51.899> here<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.100> consistency

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
but right here this is the consistency

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.569 
but right here this is the consistency
of<00:01:53.850> paint<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.270> I'm<00:01:54.390> looking<00:01:54.540> for<00:01:55.460> like<00:01:56.460> I

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
of paint that I'm looking for like I

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.310 
of paint that I'm looking for like I
told<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.000> on<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.119> phone<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.540> don't<00:01:57.780> then<00:01:58.020> paint

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
told you on the phone I don't then paint

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.709 
told you on the phone I don't then paint
at<00:01:58.530> all<00:01:59.600> but<00:02:01.219> this<00:02:02.219> consistency<00:02:02.969> specifically

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
at all but this consistency specifically

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.109 
at all but this consistency specifically
is<00:02:04.130> perfect<00:02:05.130> for<00:02:05.399> painting<00:02:05.729> as<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.909> can<00:02:06.030> see

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
is perfect for painting as you can see

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.990 
is perfect for painting as you can see
this<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.420> black<00:02:06.659> area<00:02:07.049> here<00:02:07.409> on<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.649> side

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
this is a black area here on the side

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.330 
this is a black area here on the side
and<00:02:09.000> when<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:09.869> paint<00:02:10.110> on<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.739> mean<00:02:11.129> it's<00:02:11.250> going

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
and when you paint on I mean it's going

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.930 
and when you paint on I mean it's going
to<00:02:11.430> cover<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:12.060> I'm<00:02:12.569> not<00:02:12.660> going<00:02:12.810> to

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
to cover and I'm not going to

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.010 
to cover and I'm not going to
this<00:02:13.030> too<00:02:13.150> much<00:02:13.270> because<00:02:13.420> I<00:02:13.570> did<00:02:13.690> really<00:02:13.870> know

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
this too much because I did really know

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.060 
this too much because I did really know
how<00:02:14.080> much<00:02:14.200> this<00:02:14.350> is<00:02:14.410> left<00:02:14.590> i'm<00:02:14.680> hoping<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:14.980> use

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
how much this is left i'm hoping to use

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.990 
how much this is left i'm hoping to use
it<00:02:15.160> for<00:02:15.280> all<00:02:15.340> my<00:02:15.460> mice<00:02:15.640> but<00:02:17.340> that's<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.610> perfect

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
it for all my mice but that's a perfect

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.510 
it for all my mice but that's a perfect
consistency<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.660> brown<00:02:19.840> paint<00:02:20.280> I've<00:02:21.280> got

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
consistency of brown paint I've got

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.980 
consistency of brown paint I've got
another<00:02:21.880> color<00:02:22.360> of<00:02:22.660> brown<00:02:22.870> paint<00:02:23.140> which<00:02:23.560> is

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
another color of brown paint which is

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.380 
another color of brown paint which is
the<00:02:25.990> same<00:02:26.200> shade<00:02:26.710> actually<00:02:27.580> I've<00:02:28.120> got<00:02:28.360> a

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
the same shade actually I've got a

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.730 
the same shade actually I've got a
little<00:02:28.570> bit<00:02:28.750> here<00:02:28.930> that's<00:02:29.110> dried<00:02:29.380> out<00:02:29.410> because

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
little bit here that's dried out because

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.630 
little bit here that's dried out because
I've<00:02:29.830> been<00:02:29.860> working<00:02:30.190> with<00:02:30.220> it<00:02:30.400> for<00:02:30.520> a<00:02:30.550> little

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
I've been working with it for a little

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.550 
I've been working with it for a little

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
going to cover very well it's going to

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.140 
going to cover very well it's going to
be<00:02:58.090> losers<00:02:58.750> it's<00:02:59.380> more<00:02:59.650> watery<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:00.790> I<00:03:00.970> don't

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
really know any way too thick and paint

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.370 
really know any way too thick and paint
other<00:03:02.560> than<00:03:02.800> let<00:03:03.040> it<00:03:03.160> sit<00:03:03.370> out<00:03:03.460> like<00:03:03.880> this<00:03:04.060> did

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
other than let it sit out like this did

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.900 
other than let it sit out like this did
as<00:03:05.380> you<00:03:05.560> can<00:03:05.650> see<00:03:05.830> this<00:03:05.980> has<00:03:06.430> been<00:03:06.580> sitting

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
as you can see this has been sitting

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.570 
as you can see this has been sitting
awhile<00:03:07.000> so<00:03:07.420> it's<00:03:07.540> a<00:03:07.600> little<00:03:07.690> thicker<00:03:08.460> that<00:03:09.460> you

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
awhile so it's a little thicker that you

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.720 
awhile so it's a little thicker that you
can<00:03:09.760> still<00:03:10.000> tell<00:03:10.270> it's<00:03:10.660> not<00:03:11.490> it's<00:03:12.490> not<00:03:12.670> like

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
can still tell it's not it's not like

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.370 
can still tell it's not it's not like
the<00:03:13.060> Citadel<00:03:13.300> paint<00:03:13.630> I<00:03:13.750> just<00:03:13.900> showed<00:03:13.990> you<00:03:14.140> it's

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
the Citadel paint I just showed you it's

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.740 
the Citadel paint I just showed you it's
still<00:03:14.650> not<00:03:15.490> got<00:03:15.700> a<00:03:15.730> lot<00:03:15.880> of<00:03:15.910> coverage<00:03:16.270> ability

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
still not got a lot of coverage ability

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.960 
still not got a lot of coverage ability
and<00:03:16.959> when<00:03:17.110> it's<00:03:17.230> before<00:03:18.220> it's<00:03:18.400> set<00:03:18.640> out<00:03:18.820> and

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
and when it's before it's set out and

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.100 
and when it's before it's set out and
kind<00:03:19.150> of<00:03:19.239> thickened<00:03:19.510> on<00:03:19.600> its<00:03:19.750> own<00:03:19.870> when<00:03:19.959> it's

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
kind of thickened on its own when it's

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.970 
kind of thickened on its own when it's
even<00:03:20.350> worse<00:03:20.970> as<00:03:21.970> you<00:03:22.300> can<00:03:22.420> tell<00:03:22.600> so<00:03:23.200> this<00:03:23.709> would

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
even worse as you can tell so this would

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.460 
even worse as you can tell so this would
be<00:03:24.130> good<00:03:24.340> for<00:03:24.970> maybe<00:03:25.150> highlights<00:03:26.050> when<00:03:26.380> I'm

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
be good for maybe highlights when I'm

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.670 
be good for maybe highlights when I'm
trying<00:03:26.739> to<00:03:26.890> build<00:03:27.130> up<00:03:27.250> from<00:03:28.209> a<00:03:28.390> mid<00:03:28.959> base<00:03:29.200> color

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.090 
to a lighter color I don't have any
problem<00:03:31.959> using<00:03:32.110> a<00:03:32.290> thinner<00:03:32.500> paint<00:03:32.770> like<00:03:32.920> this

problem using a thinner paint like this

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.400 
problem using a thinner paint like this
in<00:03:33.310> fact<00:03:33.489> I've<00:03:33.640> got<00:03:33.820> one<00:03:34.110> called<00:03:35.790> nutmeg<00:03:36.790> brown

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
in fact I've got one called nutmeg brown

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:43.500 
in fact I've got one called nutmeg brown
right<00:03:38.410> here<00:03:39.040> that<00:03:39.940> is<00:03:42.180> about<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.360> same

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
right here that is about the same

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.600 
right here that is about the same
consistency<00:03:44.080> and<00:03:44.500> I<00:03:44.680> was<00:03:44.860> noticing<00:03:45.130> last<00:03:45.459> time

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
consistency and I was noticing last time

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.790 
consistency and I was noticing last time
I<00:03:45.700> used<00:03:45.880> it<00:03:46.030> that<00:03:46.150> it's<00:03:46.330> not<00:03:46.510> oh<00:03:46.840> look<00:03:47.470> I've<00:03:47.680> got

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
I used it that it's not oh look I've got

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.960 
I used it that it's not oh look I've got
some<00:03:47.950> dried<00:03:48.100> paint<00:03:48.340> coming<00:03:48.550> in<00:03:48.730> there<00:03:48.820> with<00:03:48.940> it

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
some dried paint coming in there with it

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.570 
some dried paint coming in there with it
actually<00:03:49.890> looks<00:03:50.890> like<00:03:51.040> it's<00:03:51.190> gotten<00:03:51.400> a<00:03:51.459> little

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
actually looks like it's gotten a little

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.460 
actually looks like it's gotten a little
thicker<00:03:51.850> last<00:03:52.360> time<00:03:52.510> I<00:03:52.600> used<00:03:52.630> it<00:03:52.840> that<00:03:52.989> is<00:03:53.170> not

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
thicker last time I used it that is not

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.250 
thicker last time I used it that is not
a<00:03:53.500> bad<00:03:53.680> consistency<00:03:54.459> really<00:03:55.019> it's<00:03:56.019> a<00:03:56.080> little

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
a bad consistency really it's a little

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.530 
a bad consistency really it's a little
thick<00:03:56.530> in<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.400> glue<00:03:57.580> penis<00:03:57.880> but<00:03:58.060> you<00:03:58.209> can<00:03:58.360> work

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
thick in the glue penis but you can work

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.850 
thick in the glue penis but you can work
with<00:03:58.720> it<00:03:58.750> with<00:03:58.989> a<00:03:59.019> toothpick<00:03:59.290> for<00:03:59.620> a<00:03:59.650> while<00:03:59.830> or

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
with it with a toothpick for a while or

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.470 
with it with a toothpick for a while or
just<00:04:00.190> with<00:04:00.280> a<00:04:00.310> nasty<00:04:00.700> browse<00:04:01.000> like<00:04:01.180> I've<00:04:01.269> got

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
just with a nasty browse like I've got

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.090 
just with a nasty browse like I've got
but<00:04:02.050> you<00:04:02.110> can<00:04:02.200> still<00:04:02.380> see<00:04:02.620> for<00:04:02.860> whatever

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
but you can still see for whatever

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.090 
but you can still see for whatever
reason<00:04:03.489> it's<00:04:03.790> not<00:04:03.910> I<00:04:04.620> would<00:04:05.620> only<00:04:05.709> use<00:04:05.860> this

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
reason it's not I would only use this

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.920 
reason it's not I would only use this
for<00:04:06.310> highlighting<00:04:06.640> I'm<00:04:06.910> not<00:04:07.090> fond<00:04:07.480> of<00:04:07.570> the

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
for highlighting I'm not fond of the

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.620 
for highlighting I'm not fond of the
coverage<00:04:08.200> on<00:04:08.380> this<00:04:08.470> brown<00:04:08.680> paint<00:04:08.920> either<00:04:09.239> as<00:04:10.239> a

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
coverage on this brown paint either as a

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.870 
coverage on this brown paint either as a
base<00:04:10.989> color<00:04:11.260> it<00:04:12.010> would<00:04:12.160> be<00:04:12.310> a<00:04:12.340> nightmare<00:04:12.550> you'd

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
base color it would be a nightmare you'd

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.770 
base color it would be a nightmare you'd
have<00:04:13.000> to<00:04:13.090> do<00:04:13.180> a<00:04:13.209> ton<00:04:13.450> of<00:04:13.480> coats<00:04:14.670> so<00:04:15.690> that's<00:04:16.690> just

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
have to do a ton of coats so that's just

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.599 
have to do a ton of coats so that's just
a<00:04:16.900> little<00:04:17.049> bit<00:04:17.230> of<00:04:17.320> word<00:04:17.470> about<00:04:17.709> consistency<00:04:18.459> i

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
a little bit of word about consistency i

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.420 
a little bit of word about consistency i
want<00:04:18.820> to<00:04:18.880> show<00:04:18.970> you<00:04:19.000> a<00:04:19.150> really<00:04:19.390> bad<00:04:20.430> thick

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
want to show you a really bad thick

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.690 
want to show you a really bad thick
thick<00:04:21.970> paint

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
thick paint

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.170 
thick paint
and<00:04:24.420> I'm<00:04:24.480> not<00:04:24.690> sure<00:04:25.400> the<00:04:26.400> best<00:04:26.640> one<00:04:26.880> to<00:04:26.970> show

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
and I'm not sure the best one to show

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.960 
and I'm not sure the best one to show
you<00:04:27.740> would<00:04:28.740> be<00:04:30.230> was<00:04:31.230> this<00:04:31.470> this<00:04:32.250> brown<00:04:32.490> oxide

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
you would be was this this brown oxide

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.610 
you would be was this this brown oxide
maybe<00:04:33.240> let's<00:04:33.450> see<00:04:33.570> if<00:04:33.630> I<00:04:33.720> this<00:04:33.780> is<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.350> right

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
maybe let's see if I this is the right

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.880 
maybe let's see if I this is the right
one<00:04:36.050> no<00:04:37.050> that<00:04:37.260> one's<00:04:37.410> actually<00:04:37.530> a<00:04:37.710> good

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
one no that one's actually a good

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:45.710 
one no that one's actually a good
consistency<00:04:43.670> you<00:04:44.670> know<00:04:44.760> what<00:04:44.940> I've<00:04:45.390> got<00:04:45.570> some

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
consistency you know what I've got some

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.200 
consistency you know what I've got some
flash<00:04:45.960> right<00:04:46.290> here<00:04:46.490> and<00:04:47.490> this<00:04:47.610> is<00:04:47.670> a<00:04:48.000> little

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
flash right here and this is a little

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.390 
flash right here and this is a little
paint<00:04:48.390> so<00:04:48.540> you'll<00:04:48.660> see<00:04:48.840> now<00:04:48.990> that<00:04:49.400> even

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
paint so you'll see now that even

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.880 
paint so you'll see now that even
sideral<00:04:50.760> paints<00:04:51.060> can<00:04:51.240> get<00:04:52.170> bad<00:04:52.380> and<00:04:52.710> you<00:04:52.770> can

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
sideral paints can get bad and you can

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.040 
sideral paints can get bad and you can
just<00:04:53.010> look<00:04:53.190> at<00:04:53.340> it<00:04:53.520> it's<00:04:53.730> getting<00:04:53.910> pretty<00:04:54.630> bad

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
just look at it it's getting pretty bad

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.990 
just look at it it's getting pretty bad
in<00:04:55.410> there<00:04:55.590> there's<00:04:56.130> paint<00:04:56.520> of<00:04:56.730> the

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
in there there's paint of the

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.140 
in there there's paint of the
consistency<00:04:57.630> that<00:04:57.840> I<00:04:58.530> would<00:04:58.890> use<00:04:59.220> in<00:04:59.520> fact

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
consistency that I would use in fact

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.420 
consistency that I would use in fact
what's<00:05:00.390> running<00:05:00.630> off<00:05:00.870> right<00:05:01.140> now<00:05:01.320> if<00:05:01.620> you're

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
what's running off right now if you're

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.130 
what's running off right now if you're
doing<00:05:02.880> a<00:05:02.940> small<00:05:03.210> area<00:05:03.510> and<00:05:03.780> you're<00:05:03.870> careful

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
doing a small area and you're careful

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.490 
doing a small area and you're careful
not<00:05:04.440> to<00:05:04.770> do<00:05:04.920> it<00:05:05.040> too<00:05:05.280> thickly<00:05:06.140> is<00:05:07.140> going<00:05:07.350> to<00:05:07.410> be

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
not to do it too thickly is going to be

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.810 
not to do it too thickly is going to be
fine<00:05:07.740> i<00:05:07.770> mean<00:05:08.010> you<00:05:08.100> can<00:05:08.220> dip<00:05:08.340> in<00:05:08.460> there<00:05:08.640> and<00:05:08.730> do

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
fine i mean you can dip in there and do

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.100 
fine i mean you can dip in there and do
details<00:05:09.180> with<00:05:09.390> this<00:05:09.570> and<00:05:09.840> you<00:05:09.990> would

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
details with this and you would

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.050 
details with this and you would
definitely<00:05:10.260> only<00:05:10.620> have<00:05:10.770> to<00:05:10.830> do<00:05:10.950> one<00:05:10.980> coat<00:05:11.370> but

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
definitely only have to do one coat but

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.820 
definitely only have to do one coat but
if<00:05:12.150> you<00:05:12.240> were<00:05:12.360> doing<00:05:12.480> a<00:05:12.630> base<00:05:12.870> coat<00:05:13.230> with<00:05:13.500> this

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
if you were doing a base coat with this

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.520 
if you were doing a base coat with this
thick<00:05:14.340> of<00:05:14.580> a<00:05:14.700> paint<00:05:15.000> you'd<00:05:15.990> either<00:05:16.140> want<00:05:16.440> to

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
thick of a paint you'd either want to

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.170 
thick of a paint you'd either want to
thin<00:05:16.740> it<00:05:16.770> i<00:05:17.010> put<00:05:17.250> three<00:05:17.460> or<00:05:17.490> four<00:05:17.700> drops<00:05:18.000> of

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
thin it i put three or four drops of

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.970 
thin it i put three or four drops of
water<00:05:18.240> in<00:05:18.600> this<00:05:18.750> pot<00:05:18.990> and<00:05:19.290> then<00:05:19.440> shake<00:05:19.710> it<00:05:19.860> up

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
water in this pot and then shake it up

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:26.120 
water in this pot and then shake it up
or<00:05:23.870> your<00:05:24.870> risk<00:05:25.230> losing<00:05:25.620> detail<00:05:25.950> on<00:05:26.100> your

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
or your risk losing detail on your

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.250 
or your risk losing detail on your
figure<00:05:26.520> because<00:05:26.880> when<00:05:27.300> it<00:05:27.450> dries<00:05:27.690> it's<00:05:28.080> not

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
figure because when it dries it's not

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.390 
figure because when it dries it's not
going<00:05:28.410> to<00:05:28.500> get<00:05:28.620> much<00:05:28.740> thinner<00:05:29.040> than<00:05:29.160> it

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
going to get much thinner than it

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.490 
going to get much thinner than it
already<00:05:29.550> is<00:05:29.760> and<00:05:30.150> so<00:05:30.270> you<00:05:31.200> know<00:05:31.230> if<00:05:31.380> you've

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
already is and so you know if you've

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.320 
already is and so you know if you've
covered<00:05:31.740> up<00:05:31.980> small<00:05:32.400> areas<00:05:32.880> it's<00:05:33.090> going<00:05:33.270> to

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
covered up small areas it's going to
