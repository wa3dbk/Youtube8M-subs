00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello all friends welcome to another 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.569
 nice video from the pc gamer I know that in a 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.820
 previous fact video on the channel said 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.320
 that this kind of videos were going to be left 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.550
 to do but the truth is that 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.160
 lately I have seen 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:18.640
 a lot of people who have been 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.560
 asking about a pc ultra to md and 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.140
 they have enough doubts wants to be 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:27.099
 honest that in the previous video of the 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:30.160
 pc gamer ultra to md had knowledge 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.800
 quite low and that pc was armed 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.900
 only to the knowledge then 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.390
 the truth is that it was not a very good 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.000
 video so with this video I want 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.280
 reward a little the previous video 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.129
 so leaving this aside let's 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:49.210
 start with this nice amd processor 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:52.100
 fx 8320 is a black edition is a 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:56.120
 pretty good edition of this one 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:01:00.879
 it's a decision that goes to 3.5 GHz 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:04.369
 has the socket am3 and has 8 cores 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:07.610
 it's amazing it's fantastic only 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:10.280
 I would spend 125 watts and it is quite 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.320
 amazing the next thing that obviously 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.750
 well the teacher itself already brings a 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.350
 heatsink but the heatsink that we're going to 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.690
 put is a color master wizard set 2 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:24.920
 It supports interscholastic but also supports 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:27.950
 md also obviously supports md 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.429
 the ms 3 plus and how can you tell 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.890
 in the picture it looks pretty good and has 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:36.580
 a very nice design I think right now 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.950
 this heatsink will be pink 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.560
 on the brush page but of all 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.480
 modes can look for it in another page of 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.100
 internet anyway I leave here the 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.990
 name on the screen to go and 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.490
 they consider it somewhere else and what 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.810
 next would be the card of the 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.120
 mother card is a pretty thing 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.190
 important I'm going to put in a pc and 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.440
 when I was arming this pc to 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:01.690
 arm the teacher I was recommended this 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:03.610
 mother card asus am5 to 97 lg ere 2.0 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.430
 that I flew with the name and has a 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.050
 1930 chipset obviously if it's going to 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.610
 support our focus and our 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.640
 teacher without any problem 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.560
 supports up to 32 GB of RAM memory 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.950
 which is pretty amazing has 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.310
 ports I wanted this ports pc 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.050
 x 16 and the ports but is that there 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.970
 also but it has two and it's pretty 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.000
 incredible the truth also has 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.340
 obviously for two ram and pnv cards 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.980
 what is pretty amazing 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.290
 obviously we need something powerful that 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.300
 would be the following would be the card 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.230
 video the video card is going to be a 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:44.780
 video card here 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:48.849
 nvidia geforce gtx 750,000 is 2 gb es 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.849
 one gddr5 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.020
 when I saw her I said this card 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.730
 video has to be for this pc because 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.320
 it's amazing indeed in many videos 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.560
 is recommended by the quality that 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.060
 has this product is not sold out this 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.230
 that they can get it without any 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.490
 problem we have to see 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.860
 this video is a pc and has pci-express 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:11.530
 x16 3.0 problems and it took me a bit 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.900
 obviously has HDMI and displayport dvi 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.400
 there are many things that are needed to 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.170
 a video card but obviously 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.180
 we are going to use for the 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.280
 section of gaming which is going to 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.959
 agree enough as you can see here 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.970
 has all the components all 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.260
 nice things and it looks pretty good 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.150
 other things that we obviously need 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.340
 also for this pressure would be the 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.990
 memory the ram does not have to 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.750
 fall short since we have a 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.700
 atmosphere with an adult education and 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.980
 obviously not how I want it to be a 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.770
 economic adult since we really go to 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:47.620
 use a kingston hyperx memory 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:49.790
 r3 is 1600 megahertz and is 8 days 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.380
 like the last time in I found a 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.050
 comment that said if you have less 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.850
 of 1,600 megahertz then it was out 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.620
 saying goodbye and seeing and teaching 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.240
 triumph not just as you see I corrected 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.070
 like kodak but the truth is that if 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.200
 you have one of 1300 still like that 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.560
 it would work obviously does not have the same 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.110
 power but it still works like the 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.090
 half of this ram memory so good 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.100
 it only remains to leave that there the disc 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.690
 hard I always recommend what is done 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.150
 you do not know that you have a quality 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.980
 pretty amazing and this hard drive is 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.799
 will make barracuda of a terabyte not 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.470
 is behind is a 64 megabyte cache 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.080
 at 7200 revolutions per minute is a 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.150
 take 3 is incredible I recommend them 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.250
 rather more than me the pinot I have 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.500
 tried but simply for everything that 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.330
 has this saga 'the in addition for the 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.730
 price that the truth is relatively 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.580
 cheap thousand mexican pesos is 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.440
 quite the source of power is one thing 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.540
 very very important also that we are going to 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.009
 need the power source is going to be 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.770
 an old age 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:51.229
 of 500 watts is an art x obviously 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.169
 we need a cabinet that is ate x 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:56.689
 that is not micro to tx rx sorry because 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.330
 otherwise it will not fit in that cabinet like this 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:01.249
 that we have to have in our head that 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.199
 besides that because I recommend you are 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:05.360
 because it is very economical and also in the 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:08.059
 80 flows with the 80 mixing process 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.249
 to know what you can give us, you will have the 

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:11.749
 watts that is telling us maybe not 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:14.300
 all but without a nice quality 

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:16.039
 quite pretty big so good 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.020
 already leaving all the components to 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:21.610
 We deal with the price that is something that 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:24.469
 you would be very interested 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.149
 very much so good some cut 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:27.889
 Well, they are not going to make the cut but 

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:30.110
 Now I tell you how much this cost 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.969
 pretty that are some guys to do 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.099
 an ultra pizza the truth is that it's going 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:36.080
 to get out pretty cheap with this pc 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:37.909
 obviously we will be able to play any 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.349
 game that is coming out right now 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:41.270
 can play that is the 5 and the colo 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:43.639
 cristian where to save without any type 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.289
 of problem for you will ask 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:47.029
 how much does it cost until I can weigh it 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:48.439
 wardrobe without problems with active in the 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:50.190
 primary or secondary do not think that you 

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:51.750
 we spent a pc of those 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.390
 if you have enough money then 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:58.230
 You can assemble fabric for only 10 thousand 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:06:00.780
 990 pesos we round the 11,000 pesos for 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:03.300
 that is not bad but cheap for a 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:06.540
 ultra of this style and of these calibers 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:08.280
 it's pretty pretty good so 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.390
 well see you in the next lot 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.220
