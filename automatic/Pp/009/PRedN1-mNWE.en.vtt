00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 friends i am simon your muscle maker 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.660
 One may with an allergy one may with 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.350
 hay fever to go to training yes or 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.360
 No 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.010
 I explained to you in the last video 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.230
 what it looks like with a runny nose 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.250
 a cold if you are there for training 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.839
 can go and I already have 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.340
 announced that the proper position again 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.560
 so a little different looks at 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.029
 an allergy what is actually one 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.650
 allergy what is a hay fever me 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.939
 I'm always plagued with hay fever myself 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.740
 when the early bloomers come along 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.449
 I always go when the winter comes to an end 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.980
 and it used to be really nice 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.849
 then I have this allergic 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.859
 reaction 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.930
 my eyes swim to my 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.100
 nose starts to hit if he agrees 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.260
 is also a bit different and 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.730
 that's exactly where I'm with 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.410
 have to fight hay fever 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.809
 what is a hay fever now and how 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.300
 it comes about our body thinks 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.399
 that there is something harmful and driving 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.289
 his entire defense team high 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.270
 So the entire immune system is with it 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.129
 Busy to get rid of these pollen 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.410
 they are not viruses, they are not 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.510
 Bacteria are just completely 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.760
 harmless polls but our body 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.160
 takes is different he was thinking that he 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.470
 on the other hand, the result must be the 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.970
 I realize this swollen itself 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.369
 roughened here a bit in the back 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.049
 neck a disgusting feeling one feels 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.060
 just not so fit and there is 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.100
 Of course some things you can do 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.780
 On the other hand, it can be quite decisive 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.909
 you can play your histamine role 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.400
 Antihistamines take it too 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.689
 other allergic or antiallergic 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.310
 I am always on medication 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.900
 bit reticent these tablets 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.479
 I have the rizzi called that 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.250
 Whole one can take on the eve 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.840
 or take half a tablet if 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.340
 it is especially bad of 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.600
 I do not hold a nasal spray personally 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.070
 a lot of the world is simply the one with me 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.540
 nose dries out and the whole thing still 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.740
 But what makes me worse is what I do 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.329
 can recommend is a beautiful 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.890
 Nasal shower that is actually that 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.810
 hottest what you can do with if 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.579
 allergy or without allergy just take a look 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.079
 Pretty much everything by washing her glock 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.270
 not what it all comes out 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.979
 It is really incredible that I can 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.020
 recommend you go pharmacy or yes 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.939
 Order yourself on the internet is what I am 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.740
 I use the link under the link 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.420
 video in the infobox in but you can 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.860
 But just go to the pharmacy 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.479
 as to inquire what a nasal shower 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.460
 We just have them there 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.780
 play through all the pollen rausholen 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.520
 Everything is really nice for you 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.930
 is caked once is play through 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.640
 a really good thing and that too 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.989
 the best you could do me 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.849
 I already said it actually is 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.630
 this defensive reaction of our body 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.070
 completely 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.990
 100 if you take the medication 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.210
 has taken or precautionary measures 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.250
 then you feel at once 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.920
 again much better means of course in 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.630
 plain text where no allergens are there 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.100
 you can not be harmed either 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.570
 so they can not do anything to you 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.700
 in the gym you will for 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.920
 usually do not have pollen or only 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.660
 have minimal amounts of pollens 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.190
 that means that you should actually 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.990
 have no complaints so I am 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.890
 at least I have in the gym 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.720
 no complaints 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.280
 So I can go to the gym 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.720
 exercise without restriction 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.340
 Now I'll just remember when I'm back 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.080
 go out of the gym after 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.790
 run home run under nachwirke 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.890
 over there it starts again 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.330
 That's how I like it. So I try 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.290
 in the time where I have a fever 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.880
 while training 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.230
 I look a bit unnoticed 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.450
 I'm not 100 percent, either 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.880
 my forces but only so at 95 or 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.230
 98 percent I will not go over now 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.270
 all borders and I have none 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.700
 training booster pure though that's me 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.110
 often does very well if this protein 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.060
 and soul peace, for example, easy 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.700
 so to stop the nasal mucous membranes 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.750
 Contributes but I renounce it because 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.280
 I just want to say I want me 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.840
 itself the phase now not too 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.420
 bring top performance where the body 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.310
 Maybe it does not say it right now 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.750
 could accomplish their own forces 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.100
 so and now to the question again quite 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.930
 I am allowed to go there clearly 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.220
 Hay fever training yes or no 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.230
 best ask your doctor or 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.240
 Pharmacist but I leave when I am 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.890
 I have to have hay fever because of my training 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.540
 just noticed in the training room 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.980
 inside I have no problems in 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.810
 There is no allergenic swimming 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.580
 to create more can I do so 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.100
 also work out without problems 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.420
 Clearly so much for this question 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.530
 Of course you have to do it yourself again 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.240
 go through my head because yes 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.410
 do not know what allergens you have 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.970
 maybe you are also against training 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.320
 one for you allergic then you have 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.180
 of course a big problem 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.470
 See you in the next video many 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.470
 greetings from your simon
