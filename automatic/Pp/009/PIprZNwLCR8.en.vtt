00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.240
 in the sound range if you search 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.920
 efficiency at all costs you go 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.510
 take a turbo here these are the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.430
 sensations that interests you then 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.990
 this is the one you need 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.240
 but this new generation that I have 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.920
 of the three marks a break with a 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.000
 new engine a new box of 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.220
 double clutch speed pdk 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.880
 mandatory and a power steering 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.220
 electric 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.439
 as much to say that for the purists this 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.120
 gt3 there is simply heretics 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:39.510
 Well, it's not going to stop us from seeing this 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:41.340
 that it's really worth since 1999 the gt3 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.440
 is the epitome of sportsmanship the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.750
 purer in the 911 range but for 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.700
 sure porsche does not want to read pastist 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.920
 and this new gt3 rise to cross a 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.140
 technology cap in terms of style 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.720
 it is distinguished from the other 911 of the 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.690
 generation 991 by a redesigned shield 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.390
 and very widely openwork with a view 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.500
 prominent is very well exposed 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.860
 on his 20-inch wheels 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.270
 the 911 gt3 widens by almost 5 cm and 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.770
 enjoys voice increase 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.420
 the first thing that strikes when we 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.100
 settles on board it's the lack of 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.369
 rear seats his share nothing win the 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.289
 weight 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.880
 it's good that the gt3 weighs in the end 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:16.619
 than 1400 30 kg empty 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.060
 the other thing what impresses is 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.109
 very low driving position 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.560
 we are really sitting 

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:20.759
 daisies 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.649
 that's because the car was 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.780
 lowered by 30 mm compared to 900 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.909
 normal the ubiquitous alcantara y 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.979
 concludes on the steering wheel just strengthen the 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.780
 sporty character of this 911 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.670
 even if the presentation remains finally 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.539
 close to that of the other models of the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.100
 range 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.929
 and as often in porsche it is necessary 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.939
 go through the options to benefit 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.889
 gps or cruise control 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.329
 admit that it's mean but pretty 

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:44.329
 grumbling the road is calling us 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.520
 no 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.570
 the 911 gt3 therefore inaugurates a new 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.100
 3 liter engine 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.460
 pierrick but gets an injection 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.880
 direct to 14 75 horses and the 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.260
 strong characters 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.130
 it's simple this engine is bomb 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.380
 atomic 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.790
 it is flexible in dam oran where he 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.870
 takes 9 minutes in minutes it makes a 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.670
 racing car engine noise 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.180
 is simple and with that we take 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.099
 almost for a pilot 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.590
 the performances are up to par 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.620
 due 3 accelerates from 0 to 100 km / h in 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.989
 only 3 seconds 5 0 to 200 km / hour 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.819
 and signed in second four-speed 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.819
 maximum 315 km 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.260
 to master the crowd of those flat 6 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.390
 porsche put the guiding package 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.549
 active motor support damping 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.960
 piloted and vectorization of the couple are 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.510
 in the program 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.310
 thanks to this technological arsenal the gt3 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.170
 to come back in turns turns out to 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.440
 awesome nautilis and motor skills 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.430
 perfect out of what 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.040
 ceramic carbon braking 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.650
 9000 euros is perfect easy to dose and 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.000
 extremely during the can something that me 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.739
 crumpled it's this gearbox 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.510
 it's not that she did not have the pdk 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.159
 it has never been so fast that if 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.900
 she is perfect but I can not 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.790
 to stop me from thinking that in a gt3 we 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.569
 should have the choice between a pdk is 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.010
 a manual gearbox 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.200
 because there is no need to say but the box 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.889
 manual there is a touch side that 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.889
 missing a bit here 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.130
 despite all the 911 gt3 porsche has nothing 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.560
 lost its character I re sport 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.210
 unclassifiable with a fabulous engine and 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.370
 a chassis sharper than ever 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.400
 impossible to remain insensitive to his 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.400
 charms
