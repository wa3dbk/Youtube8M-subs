 illustrated for securing the hood 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.310
 [Music]

 [Music] 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:07.720
 [Music] 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.030
 now you will see how easy it is to install 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.990
 the chimney of the hood following the step a 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.990
 illustrated step 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:29.099
 [Music] 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.500
