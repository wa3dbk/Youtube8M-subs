and then you slide it in I have to use
two<00:02:19.450> hands<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:19.870> do<00:02:20.110> this<00:02:20.260> because<00:02:20.470> we<00:02:20.650> made<00:02:20.830> it

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
two hands to do this because we made it

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.540 
two hands to do this because we made it
a<00:02:21.010> nice<00:02:21.250> tight<00:02:21.610> fit<00:02:25.830> so<00:02:26.830> as<00:02:27.010> you<00:02:27.160> see<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:27.520> looks

a nice tight fit so as you see it looks

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.660 
a nice tight fit so as you see it looks
like<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.880> funny<00:02:28.180> contraption<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:30.250> chickens

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
like a funny contraption the chickens

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.610 
like a funny contraption the chickens
stick<00:02:31.330> their<00:02:31.510> head<00:02:31.660> in<00:02:31.690> there<00:02:32.050> and<00:02:32.290> eat<00:02:32.590> the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
food and they have two ways to get in

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.759 
food and they have two ways to get in
we're<00:02:37.450> gonna<00:02:37.569> make<00:02:37.810> three<00:02:38.140> of<00:02:38.230> these<00:02:38.349> not

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
today but we're gonna make three one for

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.790 
today but we're gonna make three one for
scratch<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:41.800> two<00:02:41.950> for<00:02:42.280> feed<00:02:42.489> and<00:02:43.590> should<00:02:44.590> give

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
scratch and two for feed and should give

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.170 
scratch and two for feed and should give
us<00:02:44.920> enough<00:02:45.040> for<00:02:45.400> two<00:02:45.549> weeks<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:47.500> look<00:02:47.680> inside

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
us enough for two weeks you look inside

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.150 
us enough for two weeks you look inside
now<00:02:49.180> I<00:02:49.569> made<00:02:50.290> them<00:02:50.470> two<00:02:50.650> different<00:02:50.980> heights

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
now I made them two different heights

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.400 
now I made them two different heights
coming<00:02:51.640> off<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.910> ground<00:02:52.200> this<00:02:53.200> one's

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
coming off the ground this one's

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.110 
coming off the ground this one's
probably<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.830> little<00:02:54.010> high<00:02:54.280> it's<00:02:54.640> like<00:02:54.850> four

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
probably a little high it's like four

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.900 
probably a little high it's like four
inches<00:02:55.299> and<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.920> one's<00:02:57.160> like<00:02:57.310> three<00:02:57.580> inches

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
inches and this one's like three inches

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.880 
inches and this one's like three inches
which<00:02:58.120> is<00:02:58.269> probably<00:02:58.599> a<00:02:58.690> better<00:02:58.840> height<00:02:59.170> you

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
which is probably a better height you

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.320 
which is probably a better height you
could<00:03:00.010> probably<00:03:00.220> even<00:03:00.519> go<00:03:00.700> lower<00:03:00.910> to<00:03:01.180> two

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
could probably even go lower to two

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.710 
could probably even go lower to two
inches<00:03:02.099> but<00:03:03.099> the<00:03:03.310> food<00:03:03.610> just<00:03:03.910> falls

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
inches but the food just falls

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.699 
inches but the food just falls
underneath<00:03:05.290> and<00:03:05.560> they<00:03:05.680> eat<00:03:06.420> no<00:03:07.420> mess<00:03:07.720> and<00:03:08.110> went

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
underneath and they eat no mess and went

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:09.960 
underneath and they eat no mess and went
into<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:09.069> chicken<00:03:09.400> coop<00:03:09.580> and<00:03:09.790> there's

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
into the chicken coop and there's

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:22.370 
into the chicken coop and there's
probably<00:03:10.420> 25<00:03:11.410> pounds<00:03:12.160> of<00:03:19.560> what's<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:20.739> called

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
probably 25 pounds of what's it called

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.830 
probably 25 pounds of what's it called
crumbles<00:03:23.380> so<00:03:23.880> I<00:03:24.880> went<00:03:25.120> into<00:03:25.239> the<00:03:25.450> hen<00:03:25.600> house

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
crumbles so I went into the hen house

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.559 
crumbles so I went into the hen house
and<00:03:26.380> there's<00:03:26.680> probably<00:03:26.829> about<00:03:27.160> 25<00:03:27.730> pounds<00:03:28.120> of

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
and there's probably about 25 pounds of

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.410 
and there's probably about 25 pounds of
crumbles<00:03:29.200> on<00:03:29.410> the<00:03:29.709> floor<00:03:30.010> we<00:03:30.760> know<00:03:30.910> lovey<00:03:31.209> is<00:03:31.359> a

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
crumbles on the floor we know lovey is a

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.759 
crumbles on the floor we know lovey is a
culprit<00:03:31.900> of<00:03:31.989> that<00:03:32.340> she<00:03:33.340> likes<00:03:34.209> to<00:03:34.590> scratch<00:03:35.590> it

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
culprit of that she likes to scratch it

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.729 
culprit of that she likes to scratch it
out<00:03:35.920> and<00:03:36.390> this<00:03:37.390> will<00:03:37.600> help<00:03:37.750> prevent<00:03:38.049> that<00:03:38.440> loss

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
out and this will help prevent that loss

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.580 
out and this will help prevent that loss
and<00:03:39.250> reduce<00:03:39.790> our<00:03:40.000> cost<00:03:40.569> for<00:03:41.019> our<00:03:41.079> birds

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
and reduce our cost for our birds

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.370 
and reduce our cost for our birds
especially<00:03:42.489> since<00:03:43.180> we<00:03:43.299> have<00:03:43.420> so<00:03:43.600> many<00:03:43.750> of<00:03:43.989> them

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.660 

now<00:03:47.380> don't<00:03:47.560> forget<00:03:47.769> to<00:03:47.950> put<00:03:48.190> a<00:03:48.220> lid<00:03:48.459> on<00:03:48.489> it

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
now don't forget to put a lid on it

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.550 
now don't forget to put a lid on it
because<00:03:49.480> you<00:03:49.630> don't<00:03:49.810> want<00:03:50.079> the<00:03:50.200> chickens

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
because you don't want the chickens

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.099 
because you don't want the chickens

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
getting in there and pooping and then

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.340 
getting in there and pooping and then
you<00:03:53.319> can<00:03:53.470> just<00:03:53.650> hang<00:03:53.829> it<00:03:53.980> up<00:03:54.100> in<00:03:54.670> your<00:03:54.819> henhouse
