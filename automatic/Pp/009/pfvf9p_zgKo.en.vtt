too<00:02:25.630> modern<00:02:25.980> looking<00:02:26.980> generic<00:02:27.519> to<00:02:27.670> be<00:02:27.790> honest

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
too modern looking generic to be honest

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.150 
too modern looking generic to be honest
like<00:02:28.329> aesthetically<00:02:28.900> it<00:02:29.530> just<00:02:29.799> looks<00:02:29.980> like

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
like aesthetically it just looks like

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.210 
like aesthetically it just looks like
another<00:02:30.579> 2.5<00:02:31.420> D<00:02:31.660> platformer<00:02:32.349> so<00:02:32.739> I<00:02:32.769> mean<00:02:32.950> it's

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
another 2.5 D platformer so I mean it's

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.190 
another 2.5 D platformer so I mean it's
not<00:02:33.400> just<00:02:33.700> that<00:02:33.880> I<00:02:34.120> was<00:02:34.299> expecting<00:02:34.780> more<00:02:34.989> of<00:02:35.049> a

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
not just that I was expecting more of a

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.589 
not just that I was expecting more of a
Karloff<00:02:35.739> inspired<00:02:36.310> take<00:02:36.609> on<00:02:36.790> horror<00:02:37.060> it's

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
Karloff inspired take on horror it's

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.990 
Karloff inspired take on horror it's
also<00:02:37.780> that<00:02:38.139> what<00:02:38.859> is<00:02:39.099> here<00:02:39.370> just<00:02:39.609> isn't<00:02:39.970> that

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
also that what is here just isn't that

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.330 
also that what is here just isn't that
special<00:02:40.359> the<00:02:40.900> game<00:02:41.079> style<00:02:41.440> is<00:02:41.620> kind<00:02:41.980> of<00:02:42.040> flat

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
special the game style is kind of flat

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.530 
special the game style is kind of flat
and<00:02:42.639> unremarkable

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.789 

fortunately<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.870> other<00:02:48.900> half<00:02:49.319> of<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.530> story

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
fortunately the other half of the story

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.369 
fortunately the other half of the story
is<00:02:49.920> much<00:02:50.099> better<00:02:50.400> which<00:02:50.940> is<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.299> say<00:02:51.510> this<00:02:52.319> is

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
is much better which is to say this is

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.559 
is much better which is to say this is
an<00:02:52.650> awesome<00:02:52.920> platformer<00:02:53.730> it<00:02:54.120> really<00:02:54.360> does

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
an awesome platformer it really does

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.990 
an awesome platformer it really does
combine<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:55.260> retro<00:02:55.680> style<00:02:56.069> again

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
combine that retro style again

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.670 
combine that retro style again

you<00:03:14.790> know<00:03:14.909> what<00:03:15.209> surprised<00:03:15.690> me<00:03:15.900> is<00:03:16.019> that<00:03:16.319> it's

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
you know what surprised me is that it's

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.009 
you know what surprised me is that it's
not<00:03:17.129> as<00:03:17.310> hard<00:03:17.549> as<00:03:17.640> it<00:03:17.760> looks<00:03:18.150> like<00:03:18.750> this<00:03:18.900> is

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
not as hard as it looks like this is

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.080 
not as hard as it looks like this is
definitely<00:03:19.319> a<00:03:19.500> hard<00:03:19.739> platformer<00:03:20.519> but<00:03:20.670> it's

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
definitely a hard platformer but it's

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.970 
definitely a hard platformer but it's
not<00:03:21.269> as<00:03:21.359> ridiculous<00:03:21.870> as<00:03:22.170> some<00:03:22.379> of<00:03:22.500> its<00:03:22.620> peers

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
not as ridiculous as some of its peers

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.920 
not as ridiculous as some of its peers
which<00:03:23.370> I<00:03:23.489> like<00:03:23.730> it's<00:03:24.209> actually<00:03:24.599> a<00:03:24.660> little<00:03:24.810> more

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
which I like it's actually a little more

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.080 
which I like it's actually a little more
accessible<00:03:25.410> in<00:03:25.799> that<00:03:25.950> way<00:03:26.129> and<00:03:26.519> a<00:03:26.640> lot<00:03:26.910> less

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
accessible in that way and a lot less

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.979 
accessible in that way and a lot less
frustrating

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
frustrating

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.990 
frustrating
I<00:03:28.019> mean<00:03:28.410> look<00:03:28.920> make<00:03:29.129> no<00:03:29.310> mistake<00:03:29.640> it<00:03:29.819> takes

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
I mean look make no mistake it takes

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.930 
I mean look make no mistake it takes
platforming<00:03:30.720> skill<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.379> do<00:03:31.530> this<00:03:31.680> but<00:03:32.010> like<00:03:32.670> I

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
platforming skill to do this but like I

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.910 
platforming skill to do this but like I
didn't<00:03:33.420> get<00:03:33.540> stuck<00:03:33.750> in<00:03:33.930> this<00:03:34.079> game<00:03:34.319> and<00:03:34.769> I

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
didn't get stuck in this game and I

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.710 
didn't get stuck in this game and I
usually<00:03:35.310> get<00:03:35.459> stuck<00:03:35.549> in<00:03:35.819> these<00:03:35.940> games<00:03:36.239> and

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
usually get stuck in these games and

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.720 
usually get stuck in these games and
another<00:03:36.959> nice<00:03:37.230> surprise<00:03:37.379> is<00:03:38.129> the<00:03:38.310> addition<00:03:38.640> of

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
another nice surprise is the addition of

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.640 
another nice surprise is the addition of
the<00:03:38.879> werewolf<00:03:39.299> sections<00:03:39.810> so<00:03:40.200> there<00:03:40.319> are<00:03:40.409> parts

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
the werewolf sections so there are parts

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.800 
the werewolf sections so there are parts
of<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.829> levels<00:03:41.159> where<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:41.640> actually<00:03:42.480> become

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
of the levels where you actually become

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.289 
of the levels where you actually become
a<00:03:42.840> wolf<00:03:43.109> Twilight<00:03:43.950> Princess<00:03:44.129> style<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:45.120> that

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
a wolf Twilight Princess style and that

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.390 
a wolf Twilight Princess style and that
really<00:03:45.510> helps<00:03:45.840> break<00:03:46.109> things<00:03:46.379> up<00:03:46.620> which<00:03:47.069> is

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
really helps break things up which is

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.339 
really helps break things up which is
something<00:03:47.640> this<00:03:47.909> game<00:03:48.150> sorely<00:03:48.900> needs<00:03:49.139> at

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
something this game sorely needs at

00:03:49.349 --> 00:04:03.070 
something this game sorely needs at
times

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.650 

of<00:04:03.830> course<00:04:04.100> it<00:04:04.370> doesn't<00:04:04.610> completely<00:04:05.270> do<00:04:05.540> the

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
of course it doesn't completely do the

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:06.160 
of course it doesn't completely do the
trick

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
trick

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.750 
trick
I<00:04:06.200> mean<00:04:06.530> even<00:04:06.740> with<00:04:07.010> a<00:04:07.040> few<00:04:07.280> different<00:04:07.580> modes

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
I mean even with a few different modes

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.510 
I mean even with a few different modes
after<00:04:08.660> a<00:04:08.690> while<00:04:08.870> it<00:04:09.260> all<00:04:09.350> gets<00:04:09.560> very<00:04:09.680> samey

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
after a while it all gets very samey

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.090 
after a while it all gets very samey
everything<00:04:11.360> kind<00:04:11.600> of<00:04:11.660> bleeds<00:04:12.170> together<00:04:12.620> which

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
everything kind of bleeds together which

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.040 
everything kind of bleeds together which
has<00:04:13.370> as<00:04:13.670> much<00:04:13.790> to<00:04:14.030> do<00:04:14.150> with<00:04:14.240> the<00:04:14.360> presentation

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
has as much to do with the presentation

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.289 
has as much to do with the presentation
as<00:04:15.170> anything<00:04:15.530> else<00:04:15.620> made<00:04:16.310> the<00:04:16.430> graphics<00:04:16.670> the

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
as anything else made the graphics the

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.630 
as anything else made the graphics the
music<00:04:17.720> but<00:04:18.350> the<00:04:18.560> gameplay<00:04:18.769> plays<00:04:19.220> a<00:04:19.250> part<00:04:19.580> in

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
music but the gameplay plays a part in

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.660 
music but the gameplay plays a part in
that<00:04:19.700> too<00:04:20.090> the<00:04:20.630> game<00:04:20.780> turns<00:04:21.019> into<00:04:21.170> just

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.670 
that too the game turns into just

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.810 
that too the game turns into just
collect<00:04:22.670> tokens<00:04:23.210> shoot<00:04:23.990> enemies<00:04:24.200> oh<00:04:24.770> now<00:04:25.640> I'm

it<00:04:31.430> just<00:04:32.090> gets<00:04:32.270> kind<00:04:32.660> of<00:04:32.780> formulaic<00:04:33.320> you<00:04:33.710> know

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
it just gets kind of formulaic you know

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.010 
it just gets kind of formulaic you know
and<00:04:34.070> not<00:04:34.250> only<00:04:34.460> that<00:04:34.640> but<00:04:34.820> the<00:04:35.390> wolf<00:04:35.600> parts

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
and not only that but the wolf parts

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.690 
and not only that but the wolf parts
aren't<00:04:36.320> as<00:04:36.440> much<00:04:36.620> fun<00:04:36.830> as<00:04:36.950> the<00:04:37.040> regular<00:04:37.370> parts

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
aren't as much fun as the regular parts

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.550 
aren't as much fun as the regular parts
like<00:04:38.120> something<00:04:38.540> about<00:04:38.720> the<00:04:38.870> way<00:04:38.960> it<00:04:39.080> controls

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
like something about the way it controls

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.310 
like something about the way it controls
just<00:04:39.890> feels<00:04:40.460> floaty<00:04:40.880> an<00:04:41.210> old<00:04:41.420> concept<00:04:41.840> feels

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
just feels floaty an old concept feels

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.380 
just feels floaty an old concept feels
kind<00:04:42.560> of<00:04:42.620> tacked<00:04:42.830> on<00:04:43.040> at<00:04:43.190> times<00:04:43.400> you<00:04:44.240> know<00:04:44.270> I

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
kind of tacked on at times you know I

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.330 
kind of tacked on at times you know I
really<00:04:45.200> hope<00:04:45.350> it<00:04:45.560> doesn't<00:04:45.590> seem<00:04:46.040> like<00:04:46.220> I

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
really hope it doesn't seem like I

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.370 
really hope it doesn't seem like I
dislike<00:04:46.700> this<00:04:47.180> game<00:04:47.420> because<00:04:47.690> I<00:04:47.810> don't<00:04:48.140> I
