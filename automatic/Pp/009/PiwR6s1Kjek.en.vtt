00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.300
 despite being on the market some time 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.899
 here panis and a setback 7 7 7 sin 

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:13.350
 still caught attention 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.350
 and continues to be the object of many guitarists' desire 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.449
 perhaps it is not an exaggeration to say that the model 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.999
 very soon it may be considered a classic 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:27.749
 have probably figured in the brand's product line permanently 

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:33.530
 many people have no idea the great classic of forest fires 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.370
 was recorded with a similar guitar of seven strings 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.020
 this model I am presenting was manufactured one year from 2002 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.900
 and had some faults actions done by its owner 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.380
 the first 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.460
 was that he removed the pickup from the 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.720
 the second 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.770
 was that he changed the picker from the bridge 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.000
 this one that late factory with three scavengers of the mark of marcio or delÃºbio 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.220
 laws 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.850
 here was left alone with the arm 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.100
 of the bridge and has been exchanged for an important vehicle models 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.670
 the wood used in this step were as follows 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.800
 we have half a point 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.010
 with a range of contents 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.840
 the body is extremely bad 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.840
 only the bridge is the famous projects 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.540
 and the rest of the hardware as it could not stop being the abortion option 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.960
 this guitar was made in japan 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.310
 let's start 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.020
 to pay attention to the incredible Swiss mother-of-pearl that was 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.020
 from the historical moment 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:21.559
 the finish is flawless 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.599
 of all parts of the body 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.909
 here another avalone differential 

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:59.029
 and the other type of internal stress they put on 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:02.279
 off the mother-of-pearl 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:05.729
 the arm markings are also a show apart 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:08.729
 where they mixed mother-of-pearl and abalone 

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:15.759
 only the tip is a feat of 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.679
 the square also a little different from the conventional one the locked microfinance 

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:28.679
 not 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.469
 is that a little bigger 

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:36.469
 but not escaping anything from the standard ivanis 

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:40.030
 the shield 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.010
 mirrored 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.010
 and Mr. Duncan was installed here 

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:51.229
 here's the blazer originally late 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:58.229
 and finally an overview of his study 

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:04.889
 for being a guitar more rock oriented 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:08.149
 let's test it as truth and with the heavy distortion 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.599
 putting a cotton hunter on and activating or true distortion s 

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:34.189
 serious taster 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:46.659
 now a heavier distortion 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.330
 River 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:39.069

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:15.379

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.009

 vaughan 

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:32.770
 even with a very different arm from the conventional because of the seventh 

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:33.729
 running 

00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:36.799
 the footprint is very comfortable and the role of the media in tv 

00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:42.139
 the feeling that I had in the seventh place, but the note 5 

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:46.270
 some drivers use the word on the seventh string to facilitate performance 

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:50.620
 of chords if you use note 5 you can do a bit of 

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.860
 conventional 

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:57.430
 This stage starts from Newmont by the finish that comes flawless after the 

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.150
 details are perfect and very well planned 

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:01.460
