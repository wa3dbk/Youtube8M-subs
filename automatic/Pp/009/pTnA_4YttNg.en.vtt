 how 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.060
 i 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.300
 as never before 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.229
 the future loss of diversity of 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.239
 phytoplankton and its climatic effect the 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.369
 warming of the oceans could 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.790
 alter significantly in the future 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.040
 the phytoplankton populations which 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.410
 in turn could make diminish the 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.330
 beneficial indirect influence that 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.780
 they exercise these little organisms over 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.300
 the weather 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.830
 in a new study a team of 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.680
 specialists of the state university 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.990
 from Michigan in the United States shows 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.150
 that towards the end of this century if 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.430
 the oceans continue to warm up according to 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.050
 predicted and the phytoplankton do not 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.180
 adapts to climate change in the zones 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.739
 that the people will produce a 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.020
 shift towards the poles of the 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.870
 areas with high temperatures for the 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.120
 phytoplankton and a marked decline in 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.170
 biodiversity of these species in the 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.690
 equatorial waters 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.209
 how phytoplankton plays a role 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.760
 important in the food chain and in 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.880
 the carbon cycles the nitrogen the 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.340
 phosphorus and others a drastic fall of their 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.720
 population in the tropical seas could 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.240
 have measurable consequences 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.590
 in addition as the phytoplankton also 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.420
 plays a key role in the 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.790
 regulation of dioxide levels 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.670
 carbon in the atmosphere and therefore in the 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.500
 global climate this population decline 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.500
 in the phytoplankton of tropical waters 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.870
 could intensify climate change 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.140
 the prediction of the team of middle tomas 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.600
 colin crÃ©mer elena richman and christopher 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.940
 carney is that at the end of this century 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.220
 the tropical seas will suffer a 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.420
 decrease of up to 40% on your 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.970
 potential biodiversity 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.640
 the microorganisms use the light the 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.459
 carbon dioxide and the nutrients for 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.980
 grow although the phytoplankton is small 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.900
 abounds in all seas and consumes 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.239
 both carbon dioxide through the 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.420
 photosynthesis like all plants 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.220
 terrestrial together 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.840
 Water temperature influences 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.239
 decisively in the rates of 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.250
 phytoplankton growth 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.010
 in fact water phytoplankton 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.120
 Warmer equatorial can grow 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.280
 much faster than cold water 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.680
 since the temperatures will increase 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.359
 during this century and the next is 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.459
 important to evaluate the reaction of 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.049
 phytoplankton and what will happen to the 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.300
 carbon dioxide that currently 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.270
 absorbs from the atmosphere and moves towards 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.819
 the ocean floor where it is retained 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.500
 and the researchers believe that the 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:32.050
 phytoplankton is well adapted to 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.120
 current local temperatures but that 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.669
 if the predictions of 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.110
 ocean temperatures in the future what 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.909
 most likely, much of the 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.099
 phytoplankton can not adapt with the 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:44.050
 fast enough to changes in your 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:46.240
 local environment 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.129
 as phytoplankton can not regulate its 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.860
 temperature or emigrate actively 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:53.500
 their populations can be forced to 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.669
 a decrease and an impoverishment 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.669
 of biodiversity
