00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.930
 You know just have seen the back of the screen 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:10.950
 Well I guess is a multi-monitor advocates 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:14.879
 But you and says terrible say whether Raze multi-monitor is good 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:20.820
 We can compare two documents which screen can use widely 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:21.689
 A program that can create your own document while looking at one document 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.870
 Wash it 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.950
 You can program while watching the document 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:30.430
 It's a document or a paper 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:32.460
 That's a device that made such noise 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:39.930
 If it is promoted 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:40.649
 In the old days When the hair is reduced Boyaki heard from around their high-tech when you're riding the Tokyo Metropolitan 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.449
 Office 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:50.430
 And the hair of a conventional office but computer is full at Once such office I saw 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:52.480
 It was put in the same way, the raining king file and various files are like a mountain 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:58.329
 It was is put was drunk at the time 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.350
 It seems that the amount of hair will not change after all as computer cartification computerization advances 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.489
 I told you that 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:07.600
 But I did not know that you are saying because I was a child of the parent at the time 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:12.470
 Recently I understood that even if the informatization proceeds, God will not disappear 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:18.170
 If you really want to computerize , you ca n't sell but it's a computer 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:22.760
 There are a lot of printers counting from the top of the best-selling wood that sells related goods 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:26.120
 If it is New Year's Day, there will be a New Year's card, and if it comes to such a place, it will bite into the upper rank 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:30.800
 Laser printer for household use for household use 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.460
 Such a thing is sold recently, but recently I put out cannongar child type color thing 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.000
 Household use 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.409
 Because it is a laser printer it is like a stop 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.460
 I issued 7 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:45.329
 That kind of thing is a laser of that color to the general public 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:50.250
 I think it says so say you want something to take that kind of hard copy 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:55.049
 Eco-multi monitor in front of pre-running paperless 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:57.400
 Dual monitor that say so, I think that good corporate Toka rest printer 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.570
 How much is who by putting on the counter 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:07.090
 There is a place that is monitoring the kind of thing that the god was injured 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:15.250
 Both So I say so going to Soap is more and more the amount camera both of hair movement but looks 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:17.390
 Speaking of fear horror fear politician thinks by that one Who printed on the printer 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:22.190
 Well put a counter 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.950
 Than fear I have falling in the way of teeth I will shake hole of fear Gawa 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.760
 Shake this a good hole 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:31.000
 I think there is a better way to promote It is multi-monitor 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:41.440
 Install all responsibility multi-monitor 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:43.940
 It's the multi Patty nothing N people that may in the good in one hour to educate how to use it 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.819
 Closer to his eventually be put 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:53.280
 It seems that there are many people who only see one screen 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:56.999
 It's not that multi-monitor ear it's just disturbing It's just one step even if there are two desks 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.150
 Things are stacked Choi is also on the do not use the 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:03:01.120
 Some screens may be buried 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.580
 So 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:11.860
 Education is also a specification I introduce hardware and teach how to use 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:17.709
 If so, I think that I really can not aim at the paperless turtle eyes of God one screen 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:21.140
 If you 're just you can't get the text you 're making now and the document you 're referring to on the screen 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:26.100
 Printing to will be printed you have any on hand 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:29.970
 Display it on the next screen before printing instead of printing it 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:33.600
 I would like you to promote such things with Taro 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.710
 Put it It is useless winter counter I fishermen politics 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:41.980
 Do not use fear 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:45.340
 Possibility of multi-monitor more than it is atrophy with you Spread it more and more 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:49.330
 Promoted paperless with an open feel 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:52.270
 I thought that such a direction is not good p I say why I thought such a thing 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:55.700
 Masu and large companies featured whether 0 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:58.700
 Mostly it will come out Toka office on TV 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:03.569
 I also do one letter with a good laptop computer 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:06.770
 I keep working with my laptop, but I'm working on it 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:10.940
 I think that is tough that 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:15.500
 Wide change wide resolution and multi monitor 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.160
 In some cases it will be easier if you introduce triples or something like that 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.910
 Is not there 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:24.930
 No overtime work, no work time 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.090
 I think it's all good things to burn if creative time increases 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:31.870
 By all means 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.870
 I want you to carry it out I was born and the monitor is more than reducing God
