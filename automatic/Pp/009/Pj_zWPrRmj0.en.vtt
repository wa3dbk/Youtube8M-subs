we all know that athletes and Olympians
continue<00:00:02.070> to<00:00:02.220> break<00:00:02.580> records<00:00:03.149> but<00:00:03.449> will

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.870 
signs episode why our Olympic records
always<00:00:10.800> broken<00:00:11.130> we<00:00:11.429> talked<00:00:11.639> about<00:00:11.730> how

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
always broken we talked about how

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.759 
always broken we talked about how
technological<00:00:12.660> advances<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.500> fact<00:00:13.710> that

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
technological advances the fact that

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.200 
technological advances the fact that
athletes<00:00:14.190> are<00:00:14.309> training<00:00:14.460> at<00:00:14.759> younger<00:00:15.059> and

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
athletes are training at younger and

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.400 
athletes are training at younger and
younger<00:00:15.450> ages

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
younger ages

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.320 
younger ages
the<00:00:16.650> popularity<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.250> amateur<00:00:17.699> sports<00:00:18.090> and

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
the popularity of amateur sports and

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.730 
the popularity of amateur sports and
while<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.720> whole<00:00:18.900> world<00:00:19.140> growing<00:00:19.650> in

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
while the whole world growing in

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.800 
while the whole world growing in
population<00:00:20.369> but<00:00:20.789> how<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.210> driving<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
population but how this is driving the

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.689 
population but how this is driving the
fact<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.140> records<00:00:22.590> continued<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.160> be<00:00:23.250> broken

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
fact that records continued to be broken

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.640 
fact that records continued to be broken
so<00:00:24.119> obviously<00:00:24.630> humans<00:00:24.900> are<00:00:24.990> going<00:00:25.170> faster<00:00:25.619> and

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
so obviously humans are going faster and

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.320 
so obviously humans are going faster and
faster<00:00:25.800> but<00:00:26.430> we<00:00:26.550> know<00:00:26.789> this<00:00:26.970> can't<00:00:27.210> continue

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
faster but we know this can't continue

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.120 
faster but we know this can't continue
indefinitely<00:00:27.840> otherwise<00:00:28.619> we'd<00:00:28.920> be<00:00:28.949> running

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
indefinitely otherwise we'd be running

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.669 
indefinitely otherwise we'd be running
races<00:00:29.580> in<00:00:29.760> zero<00:00:30.000> seconds<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:30.869> where<00:00:31.230> exactly

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
races in zero seconds so where exactly

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.760 
races in zero seconds so where exactly
is<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.160> line<00:00:32.340> at<00:00:32.489> which<00:00:32.640> we<00:00:32.790> stopped<00:00:33.420> in<00:00:33.809> 1964

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770

point five eight seconds to this day

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.430 
point five eight seconds to this day
that<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.270> still<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.690> world<00:00:48.930> record

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
that is still the world record

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.990 
that is still the world record
interestingly<00:00:49.860> some<00:00:50.430> scientists<00:00:50.940> have

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
interestingly some scientists have

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.490 
interestingly some scientists have
actually<00:00:51.300> calculated<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.930> speed<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.379> they

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
actually calculated the speed that they

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.410 
actually calculated the speed that they
believe<00:00:52.770> humans<00:00:53.070> can<00:00:53.219> go<00:00:53.340> based<00:00:53.640> off<00:00:53.850> human

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
believe humans can go based off human

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.569 
believe humans can go based off human
power<00:00:54.660> oxygen<00:00:55.350> intake<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.890> heart<00:00:56.190> function

plateaus for a while in 1988 scientists

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.390 
plateaus for a while in 1988 scientists
thought<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.290> 100-meter<00:01:10.890> race<00:01:11.040> hadn't

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400

thought that the 100-meter race hadn't
reached<00:01:11.520> its<00:01:11.790> limit<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.510> seems<00:01:12.750> somewhat

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
reached its limit this seems somewhat

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.320 
reached its limit this seems somewhat
true<00:01:13.439> as<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.860> took<00:01:14.010> 16<00:01:14.549> years<00:01:14.580> for<00:01:15.240> the

seconds<00:01:17.520> from<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.759> hundred<00:01:18.030> meter<00:01:18.210> race<00:01:18.509> but

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
seconds from the hundred meter race but

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.920 
seconds from the hundred meter race but
in<00:01:19.590> 2008<00:01:20.189> when<00:01:20.520> Usain<00:01:20.909> Bolt<00:01:21.180> came<00:01:21.420> along<00:01:21.659> in

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
in 2008 when Usain Bolt came along in

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.690 
in 2008 when Usain Bolt came along in
only<00:01:22.200> two<00:01:22.470> years<00:01:22.500> he<00:01:22.920> was<00:01:23.040> able<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.280> shave<00:01:23.520> off

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
only two years he was able to shave off

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.249 
only two years he was able to shave off
point<00:01:24.000> one<00:01:24.240> four<00:01:24.540> seconds

so<00:01:25.380> what<00:01:25.530> other<00:01:25.650> athletes<00:01:26.100> did<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.369> 16<00:01:26.850> years

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
so what other athletes did in 16 years

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.510 
so what other athletes did in 16 years
Usain<00:01:27.570> Bolt<00:01:27.840> did<00:01:28.020> in<00:01:28.229> two<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.159> took<00:01:29.280> just

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
Usain Bolt did in two so it took just

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.550 
Usain Bolt did in two so it took just
one<00:01:29.729> amazing<00:01:30.210> person<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.630> define<00:01:30.990> everything

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
one amazing person to define everything

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.319 
one amazing person to define everything
that<00:01:31.710> scientists<00:01:32.189> have<00:01:32.310> thought<00:01:32.610> this<00:01:33.030> record

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
that scientists have thought this record

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.969 
that scientists have thought this record
was<00:01:33.450> no<00:01:33.630> doubt<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.840> byproduct<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.500> hardwork

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
was no doubt a byproduct of hardwork

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.310 
was no doubt a byproduct of hardwork
training<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.759> an<00:01:35.820> amazing<00:01:36.180> diet<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:36.930> humans

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320
