overall<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.450> think<00:02:03.630> Chelsea<00:02:03.960> at<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.259> wrong

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
overall I think Chelsea at the wrong

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.410 
overall I think Chelsea at the wrong
side<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:05.369> course<00:02:05.670> they<00:02:05.790> got<00:02:05.909> recent<00:02:06.299> Cup

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
side of course they got recent Cup

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.660 
side of course they got recent Cup
winning<00:02:06.570> experience<00:02:07.200> with<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:08.160> Champions

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
League last year they certainly look

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.110
