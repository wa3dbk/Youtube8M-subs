spec cards and basically there are

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.010 
spec cards and basically there are
really<00:02:01.729> overpowered<00:02:02.729> trainers<00:02:03.149> but<00:02:03.689> to

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
really overpowered trainers but to

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.289 
really overpowered trainers but to
counter<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.649> they<00:02:04.920> only<00:02:05.280> allow<00:02:05.610> one<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:06.060> be

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
counter that they only allow one to be

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.419 
counter that they only allow one to be
used<00:02:06.570> in<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.810> deck<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.229> that's<00:02:07.890> not<00:02:08.069> just<00:02:08.129> like

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
used in a deck and that's not just like

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.219 
used in a deck and that's not just like
one<00:02:08.640> crystal<00:02:09.000> edge<00:02:09.179> one<00:02:09.420> computer<00:02:09.780> search<00:02:09.959> you

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
one crystal edge one computer search you

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.309 
one crystal edge one computer search you
can<00:02:10.349> only<00:02:10.619> play<00:02:10.920> one<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.640> spec<00:02:12.180> card<00:02:12.480> in<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:13.020> deck

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
can only play one a spec card in a deck

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.470 
can only play one a spec card in a deck
so<00:02:13.680> really<00:02:14.099> cool<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.579> then<00:02:15.030> we<00:02:15.120> have<00:02:15.269> a

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
so really cool and then we have a

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.289 
so really cool and then we have a
checklist<00:02:15.870> on<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.530> back<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:17.760> checklist<00:02:18.120> I

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
checklist on the back the checklist I

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.649 
checklist on the back the checklist I
actually<00:02:19.139> have<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:20.030> makeshift<00:02:21.030> checklist<00:02:21.480> of

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
actually have a makeshift checklist of

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.149 
actually have a makeshift checklist of
my<00:02:21.810> own<00:02:21.989> right<00:02:22.019> now<00:02:22.499> at<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.709> moment<00:02:22.980> that<00:02:23.069> I've

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
my own right now at the moment that I've

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.179 
my own right now at the moment that I've
been<00:02:23.189> using<00:02:23.310> but<00:02:24.060> for<00:02:24.389> collectors<00:02:25.109> if<00:02:25.319> the

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
been using but for collectors if the

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:27.890 
been using but for collectors if the
chiclet<00:02:26.549> those<00:02:26.730> checklists<00:02:26.999> are<00:02:27.299> really

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
chiclet those checklists are really

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.119 
chiclet those checklists are really
really<00:02:28.139> awesome<00:02:28.319> use<00:02:28.709> because<00:02:28.859> they<00:02:28.980> have

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
really awesome use because they have

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.039 
really awesome use because they have
spots<00:02:29.400> for<00:02:29.639> the<00:02:29.670> reverses<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.299> the<00:02:30.689> regular

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
spots for the reverses and the regular

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.539 
spots for the reverses and the regular
cards<00:02:31.349> so<00:02:31.859> very<00:02:32.370> very<00:02:32.430> useful<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:33.870> coin<00:02:34.650> if<00:02:35.129> I

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
cards so very very useful the coin if I

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:41.300 
cards so very very useful the coin if I
can<00:02:35.730> dig<00:02:35.939> it<00:02:35.969> out<00:02:37.790> appropriately<00:02:38.989> kiram<00:02:40.310> see

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
can dig it out appropriately kiram see

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.899 
can dig it out appropriately kiram see
that<00:02:43.010> and<00:02:44.569> then<00:02:45.569> you<00:02:46.049> get<00:02:46.169> cool<00:02:46.500> oh<00:02:46.769> oh<00:02:47.310> yeah<00:02:47.879> I

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909 
that and then you get cool oh oh yeah I

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.189 
that and then you get cool oh oh yeah I
forgot<00:02:47.969> um<00:02:48.419> code<00:02:49.319> card<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:50.459> I'm<00:02:50.879> probably<00:02:51.629> not

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:52.199 
forgot um code card so I'm probably not

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:55.759 
forgot um code card so I'm probably not
going<00:02:52.469> to<00:02:52.560> be<00:02:52.709> using<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:54.150> code<00:02:54.419> card<00:02:54.780> for<00:02:55.590> this

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
going to be using the code card for this

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.409 
going to be using the code card for this
deck<00:02:56.129> maybe<00:02:56.400> I'm<00:02:56.699> just<00:02:56.849> checking<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.269> back

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:57.419 
deck maybe I'm just checking the back

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:59.509 
deck maybe I'm just checking the back
real<00:02:57.659> quick<00:02:57.689> so<00:02:58.530> i<00:02:58.560> think<00:02:58.859> i<00:02:59.010> have<00:02:59.040> all<00:02:59.370> the

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
real quick so i think i have all the

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.740 
real quick so i think i have all the
scylla<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.030> everything<00:03:00.599> that<00:03:00.689> I<00:03:00.750> need<00:03:01.169> so

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
scylla and everything that I need so

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.089 
scylla and everything that I need so
probably<00:03:03.750> not<00:03:04.019> going<00:03:04.199> to<00:03:04.260> be<00:03:04.319> using<00:03:04.620> this<00:03:04.889> one

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
probably not going to be using this one

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.979 
probably not going to be using this one
the<00:03:05.549> other<00:03:05.819> deck<00:03:06.239> though<00:03:06.419> i<00:03:06.480> think<00:03:06.750> i'll<00:03:06.870> be

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
the other deck though i think i'll be

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.890 
the other deck though i think i'll be
using<00:03:07.199> that<00:03:07.439> code<00:03:07.909> so<00:03:08.909> here<00:03:09.299> we<00:03:09.389> go<00:03:09.419> with<00:03:09.780> the

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
using that code so here we go with the

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.800 
using that code so here we go with the
crystal<00:03:10.290> shard<00:03:10.590> paulo<00:03:11.010> promo<00:03:11.549> white<00:03:12.239> kiram

and<00:03:13.159> honestly<00:03:14.159> these<00:03:14.549> cards<00:03:14.909> aren't<00:03:15.090> that

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
and honestly these cards aren't that

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.199 
and honestly these cards aren't that
great<00:03:15.659> I<00:03:16.439> really<00:03:17.189> don't<00:03:17.370> think<00:03:17.459> that<00:03:17.639> the<00:03:18.030> new

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
great I really don't think that the new

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.210 
great I really don't think that the new
kiram's<00:03:18.569> are<00:03:18.780> really<00:03:19.470> anything<00:03:19.680> amazing

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
kiram's are really anything amazing

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.699 
kiram's are really anything amazing
they're<00:03:20.939> they're<00:03:21.269> not<00:03:21.299> bad<00:03:21.780> by<00:03:22.049> any<00:03:22.079> means<00:03:22.500> but

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
they're they're not bad by any means but

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:23.899 
they're they're not bad by any means but
I'd<00:03:22.919> really<00:03:23.129> just<00:03:23.280> don't<00:03:23.579> think<00:03:23.759> they're

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
I'd really just don't think they're

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.059 
I'd really just don't think they're
playable<00:03:24.269> but<00:03:24.780> we'll<00:03:25.019> see<00:03:25.199> when<00:03:25.379> we<00:03:25.409> get<00:03:25.919> to

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
playable but we'll see when we get to

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.520 
playable but we'll see when we get to
