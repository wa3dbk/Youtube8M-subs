about<00:00:04.020> container<00:00:04.560> gardening<00:00:05.359> when<00:00:06.359> designing

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
about container gardening when designing

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.360 
about container gardening when designing
with<00:00:06.899> containers<00:00:07.319> it's<00:00:07.799> good<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.130> keep<00:00:08.250> a

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
with containers it's good to keep a

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.940 
with containers it's good to keep a
couple<00:00:08.639> of<00:00:08.730> general<00:00:09.030> principles<00:00:09.540> in<00:00:09.660> mind<00:00:09.950> one

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
couple of general principles in mind one

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.789 
couple of general principles in mind one
is<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.160> principle<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.670> contrast<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.799> in

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
is the principle of contrast and in

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.709 
is the principle of contrast and in
trying<00:00:14.009> to<00:00:14.190> do<00:00:14.340> my<00:00:14.549> two<00:00:14.610> containers<00:00:15.120> here<00:00:15.509> I've

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
trying to do my two containers here I've

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.680 
trying to do my two containers here I've
chosen<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.740> taller<00:00:17.310> container<00:00:17.880> which<00:00:18.510> I've

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
chosen a taller container which I've

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.290 
chosen a taller container which I've
even<00:00:19.020> accented<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.890> vertical<00:00:20.369> even<00:00:20.820> more<00:00:21.090> by

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
even accented the vertical even more by

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.750 
even accented the vertical even more by
putting<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.689> tall<00:00:21.990> plant<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:22.980> plants

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
putting a tall plant in it and plants

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.480 
putting a tall plant in it and plants
the<00:00:23.850> growing<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.390> more<00:00:24.539> upright<00:00:24.869> shape<00:00:25.490> and

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
the growing in a more upright shape and

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.620 
the growing in a more upright shape and
I<00:00:26.580> want<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.789> contrast<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.330> with<00:00:27.449> the

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
I want to contrast that with the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.390 
I want to contrast that with the
horizontal<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:28.680> can<00:00:28.800> see<00:00:28.949> I've<00:00:29.099> picked<00:00:29.310> a

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
horizontal you can see I've picked a

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.479 
horizontal you can see I've picked a
lower<00:00:29.960> container<00:00:30.960> here<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.710> I'm<00:00:32.309> going<00:00:32.460> to

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
lower container here and I'm going to

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.250 
lower container here and I'm going to
pick<00:00:32.700> some<00:00:32.730> plants<00:00:33.270> they're<00:00:33.570> going<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.840> accent

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
pick some plants they're going to accent

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.639 
pick some plants they're going to accent
the<00:00:34.380> horizontal<00:00:35.070> more<00:00:36.260> first<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.410> all<00:00:37.500> I'm

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
the horizontal more first of all I'm

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.020 
the horizontal more first of all I'm
going<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.829> put<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.010> gerbera<00:00:38.489> daisy<00:00:38.760> in<00:00:38.940> the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
going to put this gerbera daisy in the

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.569 
going to put this gerbera daisy in the
middle<00:00:39.500> now<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.559> can<00:00:40.739> see<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.340> leaves

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
middle now you can see that the leaves

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.340 
middle now you can see that the leaves
hold<00:00:41.910> on<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> very<00:00:42.329> horizontal<00:00:42.660> way<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
hold on a very horizontal way and the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.049 
hold on a very horizontal way and the
flower<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.890> comes<00:00:44.100> up<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.489> holds<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
flower is it comes up it holds on the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.930 
flower is it comes up it holds on the
horizontal<00:00:45.809> plane<00:00:45.870> as<00:00:46.230> well<00:00:46.579> so<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
horizontal plane as well so this is the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.360 
horizontal plane as well so this is the
kind<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.329> plant<00:00:49.100> that's<00:00:50.100> going<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.930> really

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
kind of plant that's going to really

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.470 
kind of plant that's going to really
accent<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.550> container<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.510> it's<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:56.480> by

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
accent the container that it's in by

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.599 
accent the container that it's in by
being<00:00:57.780> horizontal<00:00:58.109> as<00:00:58.559> well<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.039> that's<00:00:59.460> a

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
being horizontal as well and that's a

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.340 
being horizontal as well and that's a
good<00:00:59.730> way<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.910> look<00:01:00.149> at<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.390> here<00:01:01.140> I've

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
good way to look at it here I've

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.139 
good way to look at it here I've
actually<00:01:01.620> wanted<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.190> make<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.730> taller

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
actually wanted to make the taller

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.140 
actually wanted to make the taller
container<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:04.489> vertical<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.939> lower

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
container a vertical and the lower

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.020 
container a vertical and the lower
container<00:01:06.600> or<00:01:07.200> horizontal<00:01:08.189> but<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.880> could

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
container or horizontal but you could

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.969 
container or horizontal but you could
switch<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.420> around<00:01:09.479> some<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.650> make<00:01:10.799> this

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
switch it around some to make this

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.830 
switch it around some to make this
container<00:01:11.430> more<00:01:11.670> horizontal<00:01:12.299> all<00:01:12.450> we<00:01:12.630> need<00:01:12.810> to

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
container more horizontal all we need to

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.810 
container more horizontal all we need to
do<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.290> put<00:01:13.560> some<00:01:13.680> trailing<00:01:14.100> things<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.610> some

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
do is put some trailing things and some

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.850 
do is put some trailing things and some
lower<00:01:15.000> more<00:01:15.270> vertical<00:01:15.659> plants<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.290> trail<00:01:16.740> it

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
lower more vertical plants and trail it

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.440 
lower more vertical plants and trail it
over<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> side<00:01:17.310> will<00:01:17.610> change<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.030> feel<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.210> it

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
over the side will change the feel of it

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.140 
over the side will change the feel of it
entirely<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:20.460> other<00:01:20.610> thing<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.909> think<00:01:20.939> about

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
entirely the other thing to think about

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.670 
entirely the other thing to think about
when<00:01:21.390> you're<00:01:21.509> designing<00:01:21.689> with<00:01:22.080> containers<00:01:22.439> is

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
when you're designing with containers is

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.890 
when you're designing with containers is
your<00:01:22.830> color<00:01:23.009> contrast<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.000> your<00:01:24.720> color

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
your color contrast and your color

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.980 
your color contrast and your color
compliments<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.909> one<00:01:27.150> I've<00:01:27.390> chosen<00:01:27.810> to

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
compliments in this one I've chosen to

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.450 
compliments in this one I've chosen to
go<00:01:28.110> with<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.290> little<00:01:28.530> bit<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.890> red<00:01:29.070> white<00:01:29.310> and

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
go with a little bit of a red white and

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.789 
go with a little bit of a red white and
blue<00:01:29.640> theme<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.180> little<00:01:30.299> bit<00:01:30.869> on<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.110> patriotic

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
blue theme a little bit on the patriotic

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.550 
blue theme a little bit on the patriotic
side<00:01:32.009> but<00:01:32.759> I've<00:01:32.850> also<00:01:33.060> again<00:01:33.600> chosen<00:01:34.140> plants

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
side but I've also again chosen plants

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.200 
side but I've also again chosen plants
are<00:01:34.619> going<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.829> stay<00:01:35.009> low<00:01:35.310> compact<00:01:36.000> and

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
are going to stay low compact and

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.789 
are going to stay low compact and
horizontal<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.320> never<00:01:37.500> going<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.710> be

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
horizontal so this is never going to be

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.490 
horizontal so this is never going to be
a<00:01:37.890> really<00:01:38.100> tall<00:01:38.369> container<00:01:39.079> what<00:01:40.079> i<00:01:40.110> have<00:01:40.470> done

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
a really tall container what i have done

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.370 
a really tall container what i have done
though<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.280> i've<00:01:41.670> chosen<00:01:42.000> some<00:01:42.450> plants<00:01:42.869> that

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
though is i've chosen some plants that

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.679 
though is i've chosen some plants that
are<00:01:43.409> going<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:44.090> complement<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.329> colors<00:01:45.659> that

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
are going to complement the colors that

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.200
