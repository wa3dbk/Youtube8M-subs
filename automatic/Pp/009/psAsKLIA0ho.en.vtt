00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.849
 West of September 1992 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.179
 It had been a bad day 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.589
 especially hard at work 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:18.820
 a gallery of the mine where he worked 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.820
 he collapsed on four companions 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.839
 one of them 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:26.839
 he died that same afternoon 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.320
 that unfortunate event he did with or bolivia has never regretted 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.600
 but what would really change my life 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.360
 forever 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.620
 It was what happened 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.090
 of that night 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.090
 lee has married exhausted 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.390
 without a word with my parents and brothers 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.200
 I will decide my room and go to bed to rest 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.170
 and try to forget that terrible day 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.550
 in the early morning 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.550
 something made them wake up startled 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.650
 I had the feeling that something 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.260
 or someone 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
 I had passed over my bed 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.700
 I thought military incupo 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.190
 flake study 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.500
 act and was 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.650
 in the middle of the storm sitting on his hind legs 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.700
 staring at my window 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.670
 alfonso not on the other side of the door of my room 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.850
 who is already 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.220
 Who's there 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.150
 I asked for 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.870
 she, too, towards the door 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.980
 had the feeling that what caused that sound 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.060
 did the same thing to the other side 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.010
 just before grabbing the knob 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.330
 he alone stopped 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.330
 just like the storm 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.920
 the silence was overwhelming 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.260
 Grab the knob tightly and very slowly 

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:12.089
 open the door 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:17.059
 there was no one 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:18.809
 but I felt 

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:20.709
 an icy breeze 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.219
 that gently brushed my bedside table gliding very slowly 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.519
 through my neck 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.219
 my back 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:31.339
 I was 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:34.329
 totally paralyzed 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.369
 there was something like that with me but 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:40.369
 could not talk 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:42.919
 behind my back 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:45.429
 in the springs of the camera they rang 

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:48.429
 as if someone had sat on it 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:53.059
 snowflake still outside 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:58.189
 He began to work as he wanted to warn me of the presence of a stranger 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.229
 again that sound 

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:05.509
 now right behind my daughter 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:08.279
 the obvious 

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:10.209
 if there is someone else 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.209
 I was with my son in that room 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.859
 the temperature dropped sharply 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.019
 an uncontrollable tremor 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.019
 I traveled all my body 

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:29.009
 I started to spin myself very slowly 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:31.479
 until you have 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:34.479
 and he was sitting on my bed 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.779
 can not be 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:39.209
 you can read it 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.539
 and how could I not believe 

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:45.539
 what his eyes saw 

00:03:46.279 --> 00:03:49.279
 soracco already acquired by the calm 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.849
 nobody would believe me health 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.519
 it was impossible 

00:03:57.749 --> 00:04:01.189
 it was red rock 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:02.569
 although the nasa 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.229
 today in the morning 

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:05.339
 the 

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:06.939
 omen 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:08.639
 tegan papa 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.639
 me 1 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.959
 in general
