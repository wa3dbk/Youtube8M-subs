with it anymore which I guess is sad but
um<00:02:26.490> I<00:02:27.330> did<00:02:27.690> decide<00:02:27.990> to<00:02:28.050> start<00:02:28.560> running<00:02:28.770> a<00:02:28.920> new

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
um I did decide to start running a new

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.360 
um I did decide to start running a new
target<00:02:29.280> for<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.760> which<00:02:29.910> is<00:02:30.980> Armageddon<00:02:31.980> night

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
target for it which is Armageddon night

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.690 
target for it which is Armageddon night
um<00:02:33.530> so<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:34.590> know<00:02:34.980> when<00:02:35.250> he's<00:02:35.400> summoned

um so you know when he's summoned
special<00:02:36.300> summon<00:02:36.570> or<00:02:36.660> normal<00:02:37.080> summon<00:02:37.410> so<00:02:37.590> you

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
special summon or normal summon so you

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.010

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
and lastly to Thunder Kings I guess I

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.040 
and lastly to Thunder Kings I guess I
just<00:02:56.280> needed<00:02:56.520> more<00:02:56.790> monsters<00:02:57.300> because<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:57.930> was

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
just needed more monsters because I was

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.590 
just needed more monsters because I was
running<00:02:58.260> like<00:02:58.820> 14<00:02:59.820> and<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.150> think<00:03:00.360> now<00:03:00.480> I'm

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
running like 14 and I think now I'm

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.120 
running like 14 and I think now I'm
running<00:03:00.810> 16<00:03:01.260> with<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.500> Thunder<00:03:01.650> Kings<00:03:01.950> which

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
running 16 with the Thunder Kings which

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.120 
running 16 with the Thunder Kings which
still<00:03:02.370> isn't<00:03:02.520> a<00:03:02.610> lot<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:03.600> just<00:03:04.320> opted<00:03:04.800> not<00:03:04.830> to

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
still isn't a lot I just opted not to

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.060 
still isn't a lot I just opted not to
run<00:03:05.310> dark<00:03:05.550> armed<00:03:05.850> I<00:03:06.450> found<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.350> min<00:03:07.500> consistent

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
run dark armed I found a min consistent

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.340 
run dark armed I found a min consistent
and<00:03:08.250> I<00:03:08.820> don't<00:03:09.510> know<00:03:09.600> Thunder<00:03:09.750> Kings<00:03:10.080> in<00:03:10.230> my

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
and I don't know Thunder Kings in my

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.199 
and I don't know Thunder Kings in my
opinion<00:03:10.590> better<00:03:10.950> he'll<00:03:11.490> be<00:03:11.610> better<00:03:11.790> for<00:03:12.120> the

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
opinion better he'll be better for the

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.210 
opinion better he'll be better for the
format<00:03:12.570> against<00:03:12.810> fire<00:03:13.320> fist<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.740> stuff<00:03:13.980> which

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
format against fire fist and stuff which

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.490 
format against fire fist and stuff which
I<00:03:14.510> think<00:03:15.510> I<00:03:15.630> already<00:03:15.660> have<00:03:16.020> a<00:03:16.050> good<00:03:16.290> matchup

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
I think I already have a good matchup

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.509 
I think I already have a good matchup
against<00:03:16.980> anyway<00:03:17.310> so<00:03:17.840> whatever<00:03:18.840> on<00:03:19.519> spells

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
against anyway so whatever on spells

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.100 
against anyway so whatever on spells
we've<00:03:20.820> got<00:03:21.000> two<00:03:21.570> of<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.440> swords<00:03:23.810> to<00:03:24.810> pot<00:03:24.989> of

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
we've got two of the swords to pot of

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.660 
we've got two of the swords to pot of
duality<00:03:25.200> kind<00:03:25.890> of<00:03:25.920> like<00:03:26.100> another<00:03:26.340> replacement

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
duality kind of like another replacement

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.330 
duality kind of like another replacement
for<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.209> tour<00:03:27.420> guides<00:03:27.690> I<00:03:28.290> think<00:03:29.220> people

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
for the tour guides I think people

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.130

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
already ran to a DS as a replacement for

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.580 
giga-brilliant so I guess I take out as
a<00:06:18.919> means<00:06:19.130> for<00:06:19.220> that<00:06:19.840> then<00:06:20.840> we<00:06:20.960> got<00:06:21.139> a<00:06:21.169> gotcha

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
a means for that then we got a gotcha

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.149 
a means for that then we got a gotcha
gotcha<00:06:22.630> uh<00:06:23.630> because<00:06:24.020> the<00:06:24.259> ladybugs<00:06:24.740> sometimes

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:25.159 
gotcha uh because the ladybugs sometimes

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:28.089 
gotcha uh because the ladybugs sometimes
you<00:06:25.280> just<00:06:25.340> have<00:06:25.460> too<00:06:25.699> many<00:06:26.620> peploe<00:06:27.620> operative

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:28.099 
you just have too many peploe operative

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:33.730 
you just have too many peploe operative
my<00:06:28.460> stroke<00:06:28.849> for<00:06:29.060> rank<00:06:29.210> fours<00:06:29.949> utopia<00:06:32.740> tirus

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:33.740 
my stroke for rank fours utopia tirus

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.300 
my stroke for rank fours utopia tirus
rank<00:06:34.009> fives<00:06:35.320> they're<00:06:36.320> probably<00:06:36.680> should<00:06:37.130> be<00:06:37.219> an

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.310 
rank fives they're probably should be an

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.290 
rank fives they're probably should be an
adrius<00:06:37.820> or<00:06:38.200> going<00:06:39.200> to<00:06:39.260> wait<00:06:39.469> for

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.300 
adrius or going to wait for

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.899 
adrius or going to wait for
with<00:06:40.690> it<00:06:40.810> volcano<00:06:41.259> soros<00:06:41.860> to<00:06:42.069> come<00:06:42.220> out<00:06:42.370> and<00:06:42.639> i

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:42.909 
with it volcano soros to come out and i

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:45.559 
with it volcano soros to come out and i
guess<00:06:43.060> i<00:06:43.150> would<00:06:43.210> take<00:06:43.389> utopia<00:06:43.900> out<00:06:43.990> for<00:06:44.289> that

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:45.569 
guess i would take utopia out for that

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:48.600 
guess i would take utopia out for that
but<00:06:46.569> yeah<00:06:46.750> I<00:06:46.930> mean<00:06:47.050> whatever<00:06:47.440> rank<00:06:48.099> sixes

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:48.610 
but yeah I mean whatever rank sixes

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.760 
but yeah I mean whatever rank sixes
which<00:06:48.940> I<00:06:49.300> guess<00:06:49.599> you<00:06:49.750> make<00:06:49.900> sometimes<00:06:50.169> you<00:06:50.620> got

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:50.770 
which I guess you make sometimes you got

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.399 
which I guess you make sometimes you got
ex-beatle<00:06:51.250> I<00:06:51.669> just<00:06:52.479> really<00:06:52.659> like<00:06:52.810> rank<00:06:53.020> sixes

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:53.409 
ex-beatle I just really like rank sixes

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:54.839 
ex-beatle I just really like rank sixes
which<00:06:53.650> is<00:06:53.800> why<00:06:53.949> I<00:06:53.979> should<00:06:54.310> be<00:06:54.430> running<00:06:54.520> hazy
