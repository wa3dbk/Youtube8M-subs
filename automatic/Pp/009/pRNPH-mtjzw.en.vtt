00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
a crappy build and I know people are

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.109 
a crappy build and I know people are
gonna<00:00:25.890> say<00:00:26.070> typically<00:00:26.430> talking<00:00:26.789> about<00:00:26.970> it's

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
been the main event it's been featured

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.529 
been the main event it's been featured
yeah<00:00:29.670> but<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.880> whole<00:00:30.000> thing<00:00:30.179> with<00:00:30.330> Scott

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
yeah but the whole thing with Scott

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.450

Armstrong<00:00:30.990> didn't<00:00:31.349> really<00:00:31.529> make<00:00:31.679> sense<00:00:31.740> I

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.370

honestly<00:00:33.090> think<00:00:33.510> Daniel<00:00:33.930> Bryan<00:00:34.110> should<00:00:34.290> have

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
honestly think Daniel Bryan should have

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.810 
honestly think Daniel Bryan should have
came<00:00:34.530> out<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.950> surrendered<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.520> title

came out and surrendered the title

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.510 
came out and surrendered the title

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
himself you know but they want the

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.799 
himself you know but they want the
scouter<00:00:38.760> Armstrong<00:00:39.180> about<00:00:39.390> which<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.690> was

perfectly<00:00:40.110> fine<00:00:40.200> with<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.620> except<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:41.610> fact

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
perfectly fine with that except in fact

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.010 
perfectly fine with that except in fact
we<00:00:41.879> haven't<00:00:42.000> heard<00:00:42.120> anything<00:00:42.239> from<00:00:42.629> him<00:00:42.840> and

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
Scott Armstrong is one of my favorite

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.310 
Scott Armstrong is one of my favorite
referees<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.000> I'm<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.750> little<00:00:45.960> disappointed

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
referees so I'm a little disappointed

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.430 
referees so I'm a little disappointed
with<00:00:46.770> where<00:00:47.039> they<00:00:47.219> went<00:00:47.489> with<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.879> actual

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
with where they went with the actual

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.660 
with where they went with the actual
stripping<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.590> title<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.100> since<00:00:50.370> you

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
stripping of the title and since you

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
stripping of the title and since you
know<00:00:50.760> it's<00:00:50.940> been<00:00:51.030> stripped<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.510> know<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
know it's been stripped you know the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.709 
know it's been stripped you know the
drainings<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.320> been<00:00:52.440> crap<00:00:53.539> whether<00:00:54.539> or<00:00:54.629> not

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
drainings have been crap whether or not

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.150 
drainings have been crap whether or not
the<00:00:54.840> targets<00:00:55.199> driven<00:00:55.440> though<00:00:55.500> we<00:00:55.590> can't<00:00:55.800> tell

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
the targets driven though we can't tell

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.310 
the targets driven though we can't tell
if<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.879> ratings<00:00:57.030> would<00:00:57.449> be<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.960> know<00:00:58.050> any

if the ratings would be you know any

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.139 
if the ratings would be you know any
better<00:00:58.680> but<00:00:59.430> obviously<00:00:59.730> when<00:00:59.850> it<00:00:59.940> comes<00:01:00.059> to

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
better but obviously when it comes to

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.360

know<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.720> pet<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.110> probably<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
know the pet this is probably the

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.240 
know the pet this is probably the
penultimate<00:01:07.710> match<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:09.090> these<00:01:09.180> guys<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:10.250> you

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250

penultimate match for these guys and you
know<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.580> don't<00:01:11.760> necessarily<00:01:12.330> see<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.570> feud

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
know I don't necessarily see the feud

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.580 
know I don't necessarily see the feud
carrying<00:01:13.710> on<00:01:13.860> too<00:01:14.520> much<00:01:14.700> longer<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.810> see<00:01:16.439> this

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
carrying on too much longer I I see this

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.590 
carrying on too much longer I I see this
as<00:01:16.650> an<00:01:16.920> opportunity<00:01:17.130> for<00:01:17.460> Daniel<00:01:17.909> Bryan<00:01:17.939> to

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
as an opportunity for Daniel Bryan to

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.359 
as an opportunity for Daniel Bryan to
eventually<00:01:19.110> win<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.350> title<00:01:19.680> either<00:01:19.830> here<00:01:20.220> at

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
eventually win the title either here at

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.820 
eventually win the title either here at
Hell<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.700> Cell<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.180> move<00:01:21.990> on<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.320> feud<00:01:22.590> and

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
Hell in a Cell and move on the feud and

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.980 
Hell in a Cell and move on the feud and
I<00:01:23.369> think<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.670> whole<00:01:23.850> point<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.720> money<00:01:24.900> in

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
I think the whole point of the money in

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.570 
I think the whole point of the money in
the<00:01:25.020> bank<00:01:25.200> cash<00:01:25.439> in<00:01:25.680> for<00:01:25.830> Randy<00:01:26.130> Orton<00:01:26.369> was

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
the bank cash in for Randy Orton was

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.899 
the bank cash in for Randy Orton was
never<00:01:27.030> ever<00:01:27.360> actually<00:01:27.869> have<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.590> long<00:01:29.430> reign<00:01:29.729> as

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
never ever actually have a long reign as

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.819 
never ever actually have a long reign as
champion<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.600> think<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.200> was<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.470> bring<00:01:31.619> back

I think that mission has slowly been
accomplished<00:01:44.009> now<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.579> know<00:01:44.610> Randy

accomplished now that you know Randy

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.520 
accomplished now that you know Randy

people<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.820> will<00:01:47.909> continue<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.810> the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
people and that will continue and the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.280 
people and that will continue and the
only<00:01:49.350> way<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.619> really<00:01:49.740> continues<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:51.200> if<00:01:52.200> he

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
only way that really continues is if he

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.139 
only way that really continues is if he
loses<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:53.070> he<00:01:53.130> keeps<00:01:53.310> coming<00:01:53.670> up<00:01:53.790> short<00:01:54.090> with

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
Randy Orton to win here I want to see

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.410 
Randy Orton to win here I want to see
what<00:02:49.140> happens<00:02:49.709> if<00:02:49.950> once<00:02:50.519> again<00:02:50.910> Daniel<00:02:51.360> Bryan

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
what happens if once again Daniel Bryan

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.280 
what happens if once again Daniel Bryan
wins<00:02:51.900> clean<00:02:52.290> with<00:02:53.099> that<00:02:53.310> bazooka<00:02:53.549> knee<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.329> he

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
wins clean with that bazooka knee and he

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.110 
wins clean with that bazooka knee and he
gets<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:55.590> one<00:02:55.769> two<00:02:55.950> three<00:02:56.220> pin<00:02:56.430> count<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:56.970> I

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
gets a one two three pin count and I

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.970 
gets a one two three pin count and I
think<00:02:57.359> it<00:02:57.480> would<00:02:57.569> piss<00:02:57.720> Randy<00:02:58.170> off<00:02:58.319> even<00:02:58.950> more

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
think it would piss Randy off even more

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.069 
think it would piss Randy off even more
and<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.910> would<00:03:00.000> help<00:03:00.150> further<00:03:00.450> his<00:03:00.720> character

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
and it would help further his character

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.390 
and it would help further his character
development<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.709> think<00:03:01.980> that's<00:03:02.220> where

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
development and I think that's where

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.509 
development and I think that's where
they<00:03:02.549> should<00:03:02.790> go<00:03:02.819> in<00:03:03.450> all<00:03:03.629> honesty<00:03:04.230> with<00:03:05.099> him<00:03:05.370> I

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
they should go in all honesty with him I

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.369 
they should go in all honesty with him I
think<00:03:05.910> just<00:03:05.970> giving<00:03:06.480> him<00:03:06.599> a<00:03:06.720> short<00:03:06.959> pseudo

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
think just giving him a short pseudo

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.099 
think just giving him a short pseudo
rain<00:03:07.590> until<00:03:07.980> Hell<00:03:08.190> in<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.489> Cell<00:03:08.629> means<00:03:09.629> that

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
rain until Hell in a Cell means that

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:11.960 
rain until Hell in a Cell means that
then<00:03:10.410> when<00:03:10.799> he<00:03:10.920> loses<00:03:11.129> it<00:03:11.370> he<00:03:11.489> gets<00:03:11.670> another

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
then when he loses it he gets another

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.460 
then when he loses it he gets another
rematch<00:03:12.420> which<00:03:12.690> means<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:13.049> would<00:03:13.109> carry<00:03:13.349> on

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
rematch which means it would carry on

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.530 
rematch which means it would carry on
the<00:03:13.680> Survivor<00:03:14.040> Series<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:15.120> I<00:03:15.390> don't

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
the Survivor Series and I don't

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.150 
the Survivor Series and I don't
necessarily<00:03:15.930> want<00:03:16.079> to<00:03:16.140> see<00:03:16.290> that<00:03:16.500> so<00:03:16.859> I

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
necessarily want to see that so I

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.940 
necessarily want to see that so I
honestly<00:03:18.090> think<00:03:18.329> I<00:03:18.569> this<00:03:18.959> paper<00:03:19.169> fetal<00:03:19.709> either

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
honestly think I this paper fetal either

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.650 
honestly think I this paper fetal either
end<00:03:20.280> in<00:03:20.549> kind<00:03:20.760> of<00:03:20.819> a<00:03:20.940> double<00:03:21.209> count-out<00:03:21.599> and

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
kind of some cheap finish I don't think

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.870 
kind of some cheap finish I don't think
you<00:03:24.690> award<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.200> title<00:03:25.530> here<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:26.190> Randy<00:03:26.669> Orton

have end in some sort of DQ account any
anything<00:03:33.569> that<00:03:34.260> doesn't<00:03:34.470> necessarily<00:03:34.620> have<00:03:34.950> a

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
anything that doesn't necessarily have a

anything that doesn't necessarily have a
decisive<00:03:35.579> winner<00:03:35.849> because<00:03:36.690> if<00:03:36.900> Randy<00:03:37.319> wins

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
decisive winner because if Randy wins

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.440 
decisive winner because if Randy wins
