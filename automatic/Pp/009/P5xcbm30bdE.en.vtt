00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.050 
going to apply the resurfacing mask to
the<00:02:07.920> eye<00:02:07.950> area<00:02:08.520> because<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.910> IO<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.330> very<00:02:09.569> very

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
the eye area because the IO is very very

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.510 
the eye area because the IO is very very
but<00:02:11.360> when<00:02:11.510> it<00:02:11.599> comes<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:11.959> hydration<00:02:12.520> the

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
but when it comes to the hydration the

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.690 
but when it comes to the hydration the
ice<00:02:13.760> part<00:02:14.209> of<00:02:14.569> the<00:02:14.720> treatments<00:02:15.349> I<00:02:15.769> will<00:02:16.489> then

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
ice part of the treatments I will then

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.970 
ice part of the treatments I will then
actually<00:02:17.120> go<00:02:17.450> right<00:02:17.840> up<00:02:18.050> to<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.230> eye<00:02:18.260> area<00:02:18.349> to

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
actually go right up to the eye area to

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.640 
actually go right up to the eye area to
provide<00:02:19.580> some<00:02:19.790> hydration<00:02:20.450> there<00:02:20.720> so<00:02:21.500> we've

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
provide some hydration there so we've

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.330 
provide some hydration there so we've
got<00:02:21.830> Stacy<00:02:22.220> ready<00:02:22.610> here<00:02:22.910> now<00:02:23.269> the<00:02:23.330> cleanser<00:02:24.340> in

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
got Stacy ready here now the cleanser in

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.460 
got Stacy ready here now the cleanser in
the<00:02:25.400> is<00:02:25.760> clinical<00:02:26.030> range<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.690> con<00:02:26.930> cleansing

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
the is clinical range the con cleansing

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.500 
the is clinical range the con cleansing
complex<00:02:28.040> what<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:28.940> actually<00:02:29.239> does<00:02:29.269> is<00:02:29.480> it

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
complex what that actually does is it

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.839 
complex what that actually does is it
prepares<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:30.170> skin<00:02:30.319> for<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.010> mask<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.519> go<00:02:31.670> on

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
prepares the skin for the mask to go on

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.820 
prepares the skin for the mask to go on
there<00:02:32.150> so<00:02:32.750> I'm<00:02:32.840> naturally<00:02:33.019> now<00:02:33.410> going<00:02:33.680> to

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
there so I'm naturally now going to

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.289 
there so I'm naturally now going to
start<00:02:34.010> applying<00:02:34.819> the<00:02:36.220> resurfacing<00:02:37.220> mask<00:02:37.670> to

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
start applying the resurfacing mask to

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.080 
start applying the resurfacing mask to
Stacy's<00:02:39.049> skin<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:40.459> I'll<00:02:40.610> start<00:02:40.879> at<00:02:41.060> the

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
Stacy's skin and I'll start at the

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.820 
Stacy's skin and I'll start at the
forehead<00:02:41.390> and<00:02:41.989> I'll<00:02:42.170> get<00:02:42.380> this<00:02:42.560> on<00:02:44.500> am<00:02:45.500> i<00:02:45.620> right

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
forehead and I'll get this on am i right

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.800 
forehead and I'll get this on am i right
in<00:02:45.860> thinking<00:02:46.160> that<00:02:46.519> this<00:02:46.880> is<00:02:46.940> sometimes<00:02:47.330> known

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
in thinking that this is sometimes known

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.680 
in thinking that this is sometimes known
in<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.560> celebrity<00:02:49.069> press<00:02:49.340> as<00:02:49.579> the<00:02:49.690> Hollywood

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
in the celebrity press as the Hollywood

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.350 
in the celebrity press as the Hollywood
red<00:02:50.989> carpet<00:02:51.019> facial<00:02:51.709> it<00:02:52.340> certainly<00:02:52.849> is<00:02:53.030> but

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
red carpet facial it certainly is but

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.030 
red carpet facial it certainly is but
obviously<00:02:53.510> it's<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:53.900> lot<00:02:54.019> more<00:02:54.200> expensive<00:02:54.620> if

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
obviously it's a lot more expensive if

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.400 
obviously it's a lot more expensive if
you're<00:02:55.190> actually<00:02:56.090> going<00:02:56.269> to<00:02:56.630> clinic<00:02:57.019> over<00:02:57.290> in

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
you're actually going to clinic over in

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.780 
you're actually going to clinic over in
Beverly<00:02:57.799> Hills<00:02:58.750> so<00:03:00.310> this<00:03:01.310> is<00:03:01.459> something<00:03:01.670> that

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
Beverly Hills so this is something that

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.509 
Beverly Hills so this is something that
quite<00:03:02.120> often<00:03:02.390> that<00:03:03.170> they'll<00:03:03.560> pop<00:03:03.799> out<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.400> can

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
quite often that they'll pop out and can

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:05.770 
quite often that they'll pop out and can
actually<00:03:04.640> go<00:03:04.880> and<00:03:05.030> have<00:03:05.180> done<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:05.540> then<00:03:05.630> could

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
actually go and have done and then could

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.900 
actually go and have done and then could
be<00:03:05.810> filming<00:03:06.290> again<00:03:06.380> in<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.769> afternoon<00:03:07.400> so

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
be filming again in the afternoon so

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.270 
be filming again in the afternoon so
it's<00:03:08.030> like<00:03:08.180> a<00:03:08.209> lunchtime<00:03:08.660> procedure<00:03:09.349> solutely

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
it's like a lunchtime procedure solutely

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.850 
it's like a lunchtime procedure solutely
but<00:03:10.910> very<00:03:11.150> beneficial<00:03:11.410> and<00:03:12.410> you<00:03:12.590> know<00:03:12.709> also

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
but very beneficial and you know also

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.210 
but very beneficial and you know also
starting<00:03:13.579> now<00:03:13.730> to<00:03:13.810> replace<00:03:15.010> some<00:03:16.010> of<00:03:16.040> the

starting now to replace some of the

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.379 
starting now to replace some of the
mouse<00:03:16.400> where<00:03:16.670> you've<00:03:16.790> got<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.090> deeper

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
mouse where you've got the deeper

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.890 
mouse where you've got the deeper

downtime of you know having to perhaps
have<00:03:21.109> two<00:03:21.319> weeks<00:03:21.560> off<00:03:21.739> work<00:03:21.769> this<00:03:22.130> is<00:03:22.280> a<00:03:22.340> really

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
have two weeks off work this is a really

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.039 
have two weeks off work this is a really
nice<00:03:22.910> way<00:03:23.299> of<00:03:23.569> freshening<00:03:24.380> up<00:03:24.500> your<00:03:24.709> skin<00:03:26.049> but

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
with a hydration part of this which will

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.229 
with a hydration part of this which will
follow<00:03:29.329> on<00:03:29.569> in<00:03:29.959> part<00:03:30.290> 2<00:03:30.680> of<00:03:30.980> this<00:03:31.250> clip<00:03:31.639> and

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
that and put the hydration in so she

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.199 
that and put the hydration in so she
will<00:03:35.750> not<00:03:35.900> have<00:03:36.079> that<00:03:36.260> downtime<00:03:36.920> of<00:03:37.209> flakiness

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
certain amount of time I would generally

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.379 
certain amount of time I would generally
say<00:03:52.370> if<00:03:52.549> you've<00:03:52.700> got<00:03:52.880> something<00:03:53.120> like<00:03:53.239> a

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
along I would say really kind of had it

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.610 
along I would say really kind of had it
done<00:03:58.400> about<00:03:58.639> four<00:03:58.970> days<00:03:59.299> before<00:03:59.870> you're

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
done about four days before you're

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
so that they don't feel that it's too

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.159

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
and what that actually does is that

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.270 
and what that actually does is that
actually<00:05:16.130> helps<00:05:16.490> neutralize<00:05:17.530> this<00:05:18.530> mask<00:05:18.860> and

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
actually helps neutralize this mask and

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.950 
actually helps neutralize this mask and
this<00:05:19.340> actually<00:05:19.699> breaks<00:05:19.940> it<00:05:20.270> down<00:05:20.300> and<00:05:20.509> again

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
this actually breaks it down and again
