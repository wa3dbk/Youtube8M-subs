direction<00:00:36.480> here's<00:00:37.170> my<00:00:37.289> biggest<00:00:37.469> problem<00:00:37.800> with

00:00:37.849 --> 00:00:37.859 
direction here's my biggest problem with

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:39.020 
direction here's my biggest problem with
the<00:00:37.949> shotgunners<00:00:38.460> he's<00:00:38.609> in<00:00:38.699> the<00:00:38.760> running

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
the shotgunners he's in the running

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.540 
the shotgunners he's in the running
animation<00:00:39.270> his<00:00:40.020> gun<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.440> down<00:00:40.680> he's<00:00:41.340> looking

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
animation his gun is down he's looking

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.460 
animation his gun is down he's looking
the<00:00:41.790> other<00:00:41.850> direction<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.570> he's<00:00:43.050> taking

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
the other direction and he's taking

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.799 
the other direction and he's taking
damage<00:00:43.760> he<00:00:44.760> all<00:00:44.970> this<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.270> happening<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.720> him

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
damage he all this is happening to him

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.540 
damage he all this is happening to him
and<00:00:45.960> guess<00:00:46.200> what<00:00:46.440> he<00:00:46.980> ain't<00:00:47.190> gonna<00:00:47.280> die

and guess what he ain't gonna die

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.610 
and guess what he ain't gonna die
because<00:00:48.210> all<00:00:48.390> he<00:00:48.510> has<00:00:48.630> to<00:00:48.660> do<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.930> pull<00:00:49.590> that

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
because all he has to do is pull that

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.530 
because all he has to do is pull that
gun<00:00:49.920> up<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.280> he's<00:00:50.730> gonna<00:00:50.850> get<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.059> kill

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540
