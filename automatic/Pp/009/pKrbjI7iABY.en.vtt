back you first get the job tracker and

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.190 
back you first get the job tracker and
you<00:03:08.230> know<00:03:08.380> what<00:03:08.560> this<00:03:08.950> tracker<00:03:09.460> is<00:03:09.850> so<00:03:10.420> useless

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
you know what this tracker is so useless

you know what this tracker is so useless
there<00:03:12.070> is<00:03:12.190> why<00:03:12.430> is<00:03:12.490> useless<00:03:13.150> is<00:03:13.390> because<00:03:13.720> it's

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
there is why is useless is because it's

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.840
