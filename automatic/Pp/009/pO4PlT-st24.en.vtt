00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:09.719
 Hello, I decided to make a little 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.910
 video on my second hobby is 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.950
 making homemade baits for 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.139
 fishing 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:22.520
 Well, at the same time a small video response to me 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.520
 maxim for such here 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.520
 the type of bait imitation larvae 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.970
 insects 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.460
 passing the introductory stage of the so -called 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.420
 nymphs or wet flies 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:39.360
 very wonderful fishing 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:43.050
 year round in winter used in 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.970
 as the quality of suspension 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.790
 or balance so well 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:57.170
 self bait due to the fact 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:01:00.690
 that the open hook is completely 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.699
 You can also add some 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.699
 natural tips 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.880
 fairly easy to make bait 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.280
 in the absence of tools and materials 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.880
 which are not always possible everywhere 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:28.470
 to acquire 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:32.440
 we will need a responsible hook itself 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:37.360
 hook can be from the eighteenth 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:41.369
 numbers 8 6 pieces on taste and color in 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.369
 depending on the fish that catch 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.580
 alternative to the ball 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:54.840
 if not completely hard to find now 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.840
 and DIY stores well, and in many places 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.840
 here they sell 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.840
 chains 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.520
 bites off the ball and accordingly 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:10.379
 hooked or maybe any 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:15.849
 colors yellow golden silver 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:17.280
 even painted also they are and 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:23.400
 tungsten 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:25.000
 heavily used for weighting 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.160
 dubbing but it 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.769
 animal fur undercoat 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.549
 use a wool thread given 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:36.900
 case it show in the absence of 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:40.209
 tool think medical clip 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:46.060
 there are many who have the angler god 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:48.959
 for sure there is engaged himself hook with 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.959
 wearing a ball 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.230
 can use any fleecy thread 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.370
 it could be synthetics it could be 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.640
 wool problems with thread should 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.640
 arise 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:11.030
 we move the ball the very beginning is desirable 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:16.650
 it is to fix at least an ordinary thread 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:20.390
 thin silk years think at home 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.390
 each one will have a thin thread 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.150
 respectively 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.150
 winding is performed 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.290
 only here in this place is created 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.290
 slight thickening 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:54.260
 underdeveloped wings they look 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:58.910
 something like this in a real insect 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:02.599
 if you catch all the water from the water 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:07.670
 lives usually were at the bottom of the type given 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:15.620
 bait can also be without using 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:18.829
 do weights without loading or 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:24.440
 the same ball is necessary options very 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:28.310
 there is a lot of insect imitation 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:32.840
 very good to use right there wool 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:35.830
 mink for dubbing undercoat for 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:39.280
 imitations of the wings themselves 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.280
 wool hairs 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:47.009
 not wool fur is still very good 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:48.560
 material which is also not so difficult 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:51.770
 find that 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.770
 Peacock feather 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.849
 a few beard comes off 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.570
 odd 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.389
 cut off 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:25.259
 Also with the help of a normal thread, this is all 

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:27.979
 is attached to the forearm of the hook further 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:32.400
 such circular movements 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:37.310
 carried winding is obtained 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:40.490
 natural color imitation chitin 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.490
 it looks like 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.410
 It looks like this 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:54.460
 It turns out in the summer from spring to 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:57.760
 the end of summer , this fly is very 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:00.550
 good fish and that is the head open 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.920
 asp well, in principle, a roach is bleak so 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:11.530
 very much every other kid just 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:16.270
 not so rich in ponds of fish with 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:20.950
 time we make the same 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:24.450
 Principle on 3 prince for lures 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.450
 number and own production 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:32.320
 catch the fish on your own 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:36.390
 made bait it with nothing 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:40.140
 comparable pleasure is also possible 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:43.300
 produce small streamer even four 

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:46.420
 here 80 percent are usually such 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.760
 plump more for beauty fact it 

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.680
 you can use very simple 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.630
 materials 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:56.620
 the only alternate color well and here 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:07:01.870
 there is no limit of fantasy each for himself 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:04.570
 can determine what he likes so much 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:06.900
 this is all attached to the usual 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.900
 spinner 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:13.280
 and you get a completely different 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:16.560
 the bait is more interestingly unique 

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:21.349
 after just a few pokes, all 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:28.650
 it turns into a rather creepy picture 

00:07:21.349 --> 00:07:31.379
 Well, but in the box pleases the eye so 

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:33.780
 try really very good 

00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:37.680
 you can always take things with you 

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:40.639
 look for a live bait on the bait very 

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:43.220
 well use the only thing on 

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:46.080
 water bodies over 

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:49.770
 practically fishes herself since 

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:53.909
 fusing along the flow of the natural environment 

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:56.610
 let's say so on the waters of calm water 

00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:58.259
 these are lakes and ponds yet 

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:01.740
 animate this bait a little bit 

00:07:58.259 --> 00:08:04.520
 small twitch suspenders 

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:09.469
 there are fantasies 

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:12.449
 the fisher himself and how he likes it 

00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:16.909
 I hope this video was useful if that 

00:08:12.449 --> 00:08:16.909
 I will shoot further all bye
