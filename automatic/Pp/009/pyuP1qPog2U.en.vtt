this<00:00:44.140> project<00:00:45.129> was<00:00:45.550> a<00:00:46.030> lot<00:00:46.480> of<00:00:46.629> fun<00:00:46.899> to<00:00:47.140> do

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
this project was a lot of fun to do

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.209 
this project was a lot of fun to do
because<00:00:47.800> it<00:00:48.699> helps<00:00:49.629> you<00:00:49.780> see<00:00:50.140> that<00:00:50.829> even

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
because it helps you see that even

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:54.899 
because it helps you see that even
though<00:00:51.460> you<00:00:52.179> start<00:00:52.629> out<00:00:52.839> with<00:00:53.109> a<00:00:53.460> flat<00:00:54.460> pattern

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909 
though you start out with a flat pattern

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:57.540 
though you start out with a flat pattern
on<00:00:55.329> the<00:00:55.420> inside<00:00:55.809> of<00:00:55.839> the<00:00:56.109> dachshund<00:00:56.620> you

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
on the inside of the dachshund you

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.849 
on the inside of the dachshund you
actually<00:00:57.969> can<00:00:58.120> get<00:00:58.300> a<00:00:58.329> lot<00:00:58.659> of<00:00:58.989> turns<00:00:59.499> and

00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859 
actually can get a lot of turns and

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:04.079 
actually can get a lot of turns and
twists<00:01:00.339> and<00:01:00.489> a<00:01:00.819> very<00:01:01.030> dynamics<00:01:02.609> posture<00:01:03.609> now

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
twists and a very dynamics posture now

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.100 
twists and a very dynamics posture now
this<00:01:05.340> sculpture<00:01:06.340> actually<00:01:06.820> started<00:01:07.270> out<00:01:07.450> as<00:01:07.719> a

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
this sculpture actually started out as a

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.880 
this sculpture actually started out as a
very<00:01:08.680> quick<00:01:08.979> sketch<00:01:09.700> and<00:01:10.210> then<00:01:11.170> through<00:01:11.469> a<00:01:11.530> lot

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
very quick sketch and then through a lot

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.100 
very quick sketch and then through a lot
of<00:01:11.979> trial<00:01:12.310> and<00:01:12.460> error<00:01:12.549> I<00:01:12.909> transferred<00:01:13.689> the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
of trial and error I transferred the

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.580 
of trial and error I transferred the
sketch<00:01:14.500> on<00:01:15.100> to<00:01:15.520> a<00:01:15.549> grid<00:01:16.180> so<00:01:16.869> that<00:01:16.899> it<00:01:17.409> would

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
sketch on to a grid so that it would

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.520 
sketch on to a grid so that it would
create<00:01:18.310> the<00:01:19.149> pattern<00:01:19.600> as<00:01:19.780> you<00:01:19.899> can<00:01:20.020> see<00:01:20.229> here

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
create the pattern as you can see here

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.480 
create the pattern as you can see here
and<00:01:21.420> then<00:01:22.420> when<00:01:22.930> you<00:01:23.110> cut<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:23.920> pattern<00:01:24.280> out<00:01:24.430> of

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
and then when you cut the pattern out of

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.300 
and then when you cut the pattern out of
cardboard<00:01:25.479> you<00:01:25.750> can<00:01:26.079> twist<00:01:26.649> all<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:26.950> pieces

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
cardboard you can twist all the pieces

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.319 
cardboard you can twist all the pieces
you<00:01:27.729> can<00:01:27.909> make<00:01:28.149> make<00:01:28.810> your<00:01:28.990> legs<00:01:29.939> bent<00:01:30.939> like

this so that so that she's got her her
legs<00:01:33.969> up<00:01:34.119> in<00:01:34.329> front<00:01:34.570> of<00:01:34.659> her<00:01:34.780> chest<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:36.520> can

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
legs up in front of her chest you can

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.859 
legs up in front of her chest you can

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:46.359 
because we're using aluminum inside of

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:48.870 
because we're using aluminum inside of
these<00:01:46.600> ears<00:01:47.439> you<00:01:47.799> can<00:01:48.009> actually<00:01:48.189> bend<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.850> ear
