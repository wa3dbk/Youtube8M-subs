00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.890
 the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teach that the 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.520
 members of the family do not have to separate forever at the time of 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.159
 death 

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:15.489
 but the family unit can continue for eternity 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.199
 worthy couples can join in a sacred wedding ceremony held 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.439
 in one of the sacred buildings called centers that the church 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.769
 build around the world 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.449
 said marriage is not only for this mine but for all eternity 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.640
 the saints of the last days believe that their ancestors can also 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.850
 have the blessing of a triple family 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.380
 through the fiscal ordinances that they carry out in the centers 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.210
 for that reason 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.690
 they try to identify their deceased relatives to perform for them that 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.980
 love service 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.160
 in order to help its members and others identify their ancestors 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.050
 the church has sent specialists in family records to all parts of the 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.100
 world 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.570
 work with local governments, churches and other organizations to copy or 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.890
 microfilm historical documents with the names of people and the dates of 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.890
 birth marriage and death 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.740
 the information is cataloged and stored 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.060
 and the copies are made available to researchers around the world 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.850
 A copy is donated by local organizations that provided access to 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.680
 original records 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.080
 family history or genealogy 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.390
 also this interest for many people who are not members of the 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.390
 Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.910
 every year millions of people of all faiths 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.000
 they look for the data of their ancestors without cost 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.270
 in the church's research facilities 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.270
 they do this in the central library to help 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.390
 and in thousands of small branches around the world that have access to 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.390
 copies of the records of the central library 

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:11.779
 much of the visual and family information has also been placed in a 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:13.249
 website 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:14.599
 what has become 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.599
 one of the preferred rental sites 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:21.600
 information 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.200
 eleven share freely with people from all over the world who want to discover 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.200
 more about your family history 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:34.289
 the saints of the last days believe that the family had AIDS 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.119
 it is the basis of society 

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:41.629
 and that by feeling an affinity with relatives of the present and the past, 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.989
 families and society their portals in and they are unified
