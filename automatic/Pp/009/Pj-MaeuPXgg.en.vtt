00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.460

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.640
 video recorder later to see what 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.140
 speak or who has pressed to the bucket 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.699
 in other words, little young garbage 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.820

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.599
 cenerentola inherent the st must say the 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.000
 sincere truth 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.399
 let's say between champions and europa league 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.950
 in the ranking the thread is really 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.809
 really threads but it's nice guys a 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.879
 in particularly cool cardboard e 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.320
 regionally these characters more 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.300
 appreciated by an audience of kids 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.100
 so let's face it all then 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.660
 really really beautiful cinderella 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.510

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.030
 your children because it's cool and this is it 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.039
 two episodes of the TV series of the 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.719
 silvia principles tele these episodes 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.160
 we were pretty nice though 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.079
 frankly I preferred much more 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.989
 friends in harmony but this was okay 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.090
 beautiful you have seen it either 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.280
 need to talk about it but know raga 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.409
 on this if I could I would talk about it 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.880
 worst hours hours these are not the first 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.560
 place is in second place in the 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.210
 classifies ships that rightly being 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.810
 in short, a male is really kind to 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.450
 he one for him and two for gaspari of the 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.240
 sorry panic penis rs raga really is 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.030
 one of the most beautiful classics one of the 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.590
 most beautiful dubbing and with a crowd of 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.359
 characters really among the most beautiful 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.689
 will present that I keep myself a bulletin board then 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:36.520
 everyone decides this 4 is nice but I have to 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:38.890
 to admit it is also nice though 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.710
 stands in the Europa League in the ranking e 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.719
 although the first let's face it is a lot 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.460
 more beautiful but also this nice 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:47.740
 known well because I have almost 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:56.740
 twenty years of this first cooler black 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:59.259
 the first ok this is to say the first one 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.750
 it's the first one, but this one is approaching 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.610
 so much so much at first well maybe 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.159
 because it explains what happened in the 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.049
 first and not simply a sequela 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.399
 or a pre which really deserves to 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.250
 stay in your bulletin board 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.680
 let's say this is one of many 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.489
 intestine boxes can also be seen 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.489
 from the not very orthodox file is 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.560
 one of the underground vhs productions 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.329
 old enough as we have it 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.849
 seen day 4 5 times in my life 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:30.010
 I must say that this is nice too 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.569
 beautiful as a bad production the 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.129
 classic story of the child being found 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.549
 catapulted into the world of cartoons 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:38.590
 animated 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:40.060
 ok this is it I must confess something to you 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.739
 I had orgasms when I was little 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.840
 only from the cover because in short a 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.819
 baby if you saw almost image 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.819
 imagine that he and that mouse are there 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.230
 girl upwind or better sorry mini 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.940
 blasphemy 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.440
 we were like that really are three handsome 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.730
 cartoons in my opinion could not 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.200
 make a better choice 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.970
 only problem once you are 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.530
 having grown up there is no longer those 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.720
 effects that there is a small cloth seen 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.500
 but it is still cool fighissimo wire cyto 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.480
 type c 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.000
 these are two episodes 2 2 among the most 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.709
 beautiful episodes of seeing the backstage in 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.569
 which in the first we have a crowd of 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.640
 Vikings who deprived paperopoli and 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.709
 kidnaps the nanny in the second we 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.079
 it really gets to me all 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.910
 will know in comics and including and 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.860
 that following a nice subterfuge 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.989
 manages to transform the passages of the 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.790
 Donald Duck's grandchildren and to steal the 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.590
 number one even if it is not among the 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.390
 favorite cassettes I have to say that every 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.780
 once I see it I repeat it with a lot 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.700
 taste 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.290
 you guys have that in these videos the 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.900
 cassettes they denounce whose leaves 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.849
 how do you say we have a 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.650
 great something animated than together 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.900
 to the beautiful and the hercules beast 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.940
 Cinderella and some others are 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.349
 right at the top of the standings and bongo 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.530
 and three adventurers who are right there 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.400
 attached to exactly how 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.200
 maybe some of you might 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.740
 contest three adventurers because he knows 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.209
 instead much older than aladin 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.910
 short films disney donated the item to the 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.430
 also very much more towards one tube 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.890
 myth to the cartoon from 35 pleasure 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.540
 when I see aladin 87 minutes after the 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.480
 elections, and in any case the princess 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:12.060
 jasmine the two missions that are sick 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.540
 songs, however, when you are our two 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.880
 seven 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.639
 well know you have so much fun 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.829
 box that I come to show you 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.480
 I 'm also very fond of this 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.390
 also these two episodes that are here 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.430
 they are beautiful they are very very beautiful 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.870
 of course we can not forlÃ¬ around 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.450
 the success others have had 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.630
 cartoons like this or maybe 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:36.150
 this, however, when you go to see 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.310
 which is two different episodes plus one 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.010
 sgana chant of the other by profession 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.840
 but here the small soft becomes let's say 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.639
 acquired mother of a child 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.760
 teddy bear who has a problem 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.320
 the predators of the lost idol in which 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.810
 value is the child they find themselves doing a 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:55.440
 you can kill for this beautiful golden book 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:58.020
 which is worth 13 million peat 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.280
 well these are all the boxes or better 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.770
 all the cassettes we know of 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.330
 the identity this remains we are 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.340
 to all the others down who do not have 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.930
 let's look at a precise identity 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.610
 perfect if you want 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.780
