00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:02.960
 third episode of julitte julitte 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.670
 with two different player profiles 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.440
 and why did I choose these 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.150
 two profiles of their different which 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.270
 are you going to see a little bit more 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.909
 over and over the video could 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.830
 well simply how and well I 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.480
 want to say how to find a good 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.940
 day to fall the frame and whose 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.380
 in particular to make a monopoly of 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.790
 different profiles two I have 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.550
 selected two that's because these are 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.200
 two profiles that are often not too 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.909
 use but which unfortunately is 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.560
 good are the best because yes do not 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.240
 are not used in not too much use 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.700
 are used and they are not too much 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.700
 making use and although the purchase 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.800
 resale and enjoy a lot less 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.160
 of people so that finally you 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.180
 have understood 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.860
 in short, I will close my mouth and therefore 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.570
 the goods they are and profile of the 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.390
 cheers because yes there you see 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.650
 mounir leave etc finally I buy it I 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.780
 resell it and so regrowth 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.770
 resold you'll see that why is 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.950
 what knights this player is 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.110
 simple one must always tell oneself that fifa 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.660
 This is based on the 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.290
 reality is in quotation marks and 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.310
 it's bound to proclaim it as being a 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.060
 a simulation of 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.229
 the real footballer what am I going to you 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.130
 do what I'm going to teach you this 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.140
 you already know 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.790
 it is simply therefore be based on 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.220
 real life and was based on 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.620
 talents on talents on them on 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.260
 foul players who have a talent 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.480
 huge esteem and who will play flag 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.280
 for the most scary of big 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.739
 chances to still become the 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.690
 missiles and the wines of the future ronald 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.550
 and here I chose mounir why because 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.800
 that it is a player who is endowed when 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.750
 even a very big quality that in mode 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.100
 career I think important this is the 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.150
 rather not bad finally I have not looked at 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.799
 I do not want to say bullshit but 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.970
 I believe but fine short if I say a 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.400
 bullshit I kiss you anyway 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.780
 so two years so here is mounir it's 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.160
 still an enormously talented 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.840
 a few years ago if we would have 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.950
 in 2009 or in 2010 we could have taken 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.160
 neymar or haye could have been 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.450
 a prodigy here anyway that would have 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.769
 could be good that's why the quitter 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.599
 sale so that's a very profile 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.010
 interesting about leak 13 iliad and 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:03.620
 frimpong also who was a player 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:05.299
 I really want to say very very very 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.190
 sure side finally not very sure side in 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.930
 what am I saying who was very beloved 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.220
 here is the audience including arsenal 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.180
 and then by the public 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.739
 you football here finally that's because 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.299
 love football and that's frimpong 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.310
 that was a mouth and that's 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.480
 also his players that we will seek so 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.440
 these are people who have talent and 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.329
 players who have a jaw ie 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.260
 players who see there weighs in range 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.359
 and c is what I want to say so 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.840
 always look for a little talent 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:28.609
 player 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.680
 that is what is always 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:33.920
 also worth not head 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.840
 that he has but the aulaqi charisma that 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.519
 clear it's still important 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.799
 this is for example a balotelli can be 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.290
 sell very well here seen balotelli 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:44.180
 still a very very charisma 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.620
 developed even though here it is born 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.660
 a shabby start to the season which makes 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.799
 that unfortunately and this charisma 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.180
 take him off a little bit all took 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.500
 but this is the first 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.519
 profile is so the second profile game 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.480
 quickly chained because yes it's 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.920
 almost the end of the video 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.079
 the second low profile these are the 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.630
 cards that's money 74.2 very general 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.840
 important 74 2 general this is what is 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.330
 well 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.860
 could finally it's very important 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.989
 means and very interesting stats 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.940
 in a very interesting championship and 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.550
 also to a very interesting post so 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.550
 there I chose as how george had 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.930
 so chose didavi yeah that's it 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.750
 said of opinion and a hamlet these Germans 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.190
 this is evolving into bundesliga which is 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.540
 really nystad not disgusting 1 who has 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.910
 still a beautiful center is 8 and n 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.220
 113 of shooting I think we think of pass 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.860
 we are going very very good destiny for amo 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.320
 these silver at 74.2 general it's price 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.699
 was a little bit what the fuck that's at 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.760
 to say that we could find 1300 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:37.350
 mixes of 6000 in very large numbers 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.790
 and so I decided to put a little 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.030
 little price between the two and the 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.500
 put at 3000 3200 3300 end here are some 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.330
 prices like that they always 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.220
 sold also sees the number of times 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.690
 I have zero listed on the bottom right I 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.250
 want to clarify them well and well 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.419
 in total it makes us quite a lot of 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.250
 profits 50-1 51 thousand rather etienne 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.660
 all credit what is really rather 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.250
 not bad here is what is badass 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.720
 at the beginning we were gone with 25000 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.550
 credit and ultimately we end up with 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.380
 79 miles credit and that's what is 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.210
 really very very good here for this 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.039
 third episode back he'll have you 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.539

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.370
 200 video telling the 400 there he 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:12.870
 is these young crazy when 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.760

 do gold on wednesday almost in brazil 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:20.280
 that I can get you out but I say 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.050
