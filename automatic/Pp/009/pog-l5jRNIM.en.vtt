00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.400
 I am mario persona and these are the 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.790
 answers that I gave to those who 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.070
 they asked about the bible you wrote 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.719
 wondering what the gold would mean 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:20.070
 incense and friend who are the gifts of 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:23.279
 wizards or better translating wise place 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.039
 of magicians because nowhere in the 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.920
 said that there were three times these 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.960
 wizards or wise men and that is why 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.790
 associates number 3 because there were three 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.780
 gifts but do not speak the Bible that 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.610
 would be two or three or four or five 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.890
 in the Bible a more correct tradition 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.530
 could we call it wise to 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.739
 Instead of wizards and were rather gold incense 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.250
 and myrrh that they brought as a gift 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.140
 for the jesus boy and his doubt 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.940
 about the meaning of these gifts already 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.379
 that you heard different explanations 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.940
 about it come the two hit eleven 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.920
 entering the house they found the boy with 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.559
 mother and prostrated if they worshiped him 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.680
 and opening its treasures offering 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.960
 unit with the gold incense and myrrh 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.570
 when we have the gospels we must 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.270
 keep in mind that they the gospels 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.850
 especially of mateus are the fulfillment 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.170
 prophecies of the Old Testament to 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.900
 Israel 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.890
 the under-extant church in chapter 2 and 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.200
 acts and these prophecies for israel 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.960
 they foretold the life of his messiah was wrong 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.840
 matthew the gospel more said 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.759
 things described there happened to 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:42.140
 that the word of the prophets should be fulfilled 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:50.670
 if you check mateus 1 20 22 23 4 14 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:52.979
 8 17 12 17 13 35 21 4 and 27 35 of these 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.750
 passages always speak some but 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.240
 time it happened so that 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.009
 fulfilled the word that the prophet 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.439
 so - and -so 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.119
 therefore to understand the gospels 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.840
 It's important to know what God 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.850
 promised in israel and also 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.429
 we have in mind the whole symbology of 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.860
 types and figures in contacts in the 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.890
 pentateuco those who are first five 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.040
 books written by bassinet you find 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.140
 gold incense many times in the objects in 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.129
 ceremonies of the tabernacle of 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.900
 desert 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:26.019
 if we want to understand your 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.049
 meaning is where we should look 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:31.450
 because the tabernacle was already possible because 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.890
 if only a figure of Christ in his 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.799
 various aspects 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.500
 Romans 5 14 says however the death 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.299
 reigned from Adam to Moses over 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.599
 those who did not have a sin 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:47.519
 like the transgression of Adam the 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:50.530
 and the figure of the man who had 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:53.560
 first clients 10/6 these things 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.450
 were made in figure so that 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.170
 we do not know things but like them 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.530
 coveted 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.720
 Romans 15 4 because all that before was 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.269
 written for our teaching was written 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.000
 so that through the patience and consolation of 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.489
 scriptures we have hope 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.609
 Colossians 2, 16 and 17 and therefore no one 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:15.340
 Judge by eating bb or by 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:17.470
 cause of the new moon feast days 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.620
 Saturdays that are shadows of things 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:24.160
 future the body is of Christ 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.650
 the first sentence 3 21 which also as a 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.440
 true figure now saves you the 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.650
 baptism not from the stripping of the news 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.970
 but the question of a good 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.620
 awareness to god by 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.230
 resurrection of jesus christ 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.370
 therefore many answers to understand 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.720
 the gospel we find in the figures 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.599
 or things that in the Old Testament 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.859
 they were figures of things that would happen 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.989
 in the new testament 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:52.510
 gold is a symbol that represents the 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.299
 divine perfection and royal dignity 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.650
 therefore the gospel tells us of the divine 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.919
 jesus person 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.419
 the king of the jews incense is a scent 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:03.940
 which was used in ceremonies of the 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:06.880
 tabernacle and tells us about the 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.950
 sinless humanity of Jesus that was 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.799
 perceived by all in all that he 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.490
 did or wherever he walked 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:17.690
 leave a scent of 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:21.959
 whore holiness of absolute perfection 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:24.240
 nissan a maeva maga and she told us about 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.110
 sufferings and bitterness that Jesus must 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.590
 to suffer 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:31.140
 behold the 65 6 the prophecy speaks only of gold 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.020
 incense because isaÃ­as is talking about 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.420
 second coming of Christ that will be in 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.900
 power and glory and not suffering as it was 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:42.210
 the first time they witnessed their child 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.610
 of God coming into the world the sages of the 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.460
 recognized with these types or 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.760
 figures that jesus was god 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:53.640
 I erred that his humanity was perfect. 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.460
 and that the child was destined to 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.170
 suffer for you to better understand the 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.110
 symbols of the Old Testament, I 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:04.440
 reading the books of charles macintosh 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:07.950
 on the pentateuch are excellent books 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:12.200
 There are Portuguese, you only have to 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.200
 search the internet you will find 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:21.510
