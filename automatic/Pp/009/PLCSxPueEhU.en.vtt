00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
where the actual 120 millimeter fan will

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.149 
where the actual 120 millimeter fan will
go<00:01:44.000> along<00:01:44.390> the<00:01:44.659> side<00:01:44.930> the<00:01:45.229> GPU<00:01:46.210> heatsink

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
go along the side the GPU heatsink

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.709 
go along the side the GPU heatsink
what's<00:01:49.159> technically<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.729> CPU<00:01:50.180> think<00:01:50.509> but

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:50.719 
what's technically the CPU think but

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:53.200 
what's technically the CPU think but
