00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.300
 weapon in your hand we're going to have to 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.760

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.050
 assume right in front of this wall is worth 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.820
 this what I 'm going to do, let's go 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.680
 in a kind of wolverine that is 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.329
 walk bridge to his and so he went up does 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.760
 a few days but this is not what I come to 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.739
 show you then once inside 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.000
 guys, I'll put it here like this on camera 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.219
 slow so you can see it 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.409
 perfectly let's go inside and 

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:07.520
 will tell us that we are like in the 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.979
 where site 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.630
 they do dances inside the puticlub vale 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.509
 As you can see, you can not enter the room 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.880
 private without a dancer then by 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.770
 here he will throw us as automatically 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.509
 for outside and we do not have to touch anything 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.130
 It's worth as you see automatically as not 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.469
 we have ballerina pulls us out 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.360
 we have to imagine ourselves on the 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:27.860
 travel we are doing and now 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.479
 just when our character stops 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.310
 Ok guys right on the left you have 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.810
 I do exactly the same thing here 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.670
 we found the stairs and here the 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.709
 left we would have the bar worth 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.420
 Where is the dancer dancing? 

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:40.489
 so if we do not get a little closer 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.319
 and now we can put first 

00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:44.780
 person and let's see inside the 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:45.709
 puticlub is worth a trick in the 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.349
 Access I think you'll love it 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:50.090
 we will be able to throw weapons to the dancer 

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:52.189
 I think it's pretty enough 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.869
 funny to me I loved it and how 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.310
 guys, once we're inside the email 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.929
 it will be here it was like blocking 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.939
 among the people we have to come here the 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.259
 lateral to the side of the bar and 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.119
 we give a little arrow to the right as 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.310
 to support us to see the dancer 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.810
 then once we support each other as you see 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.299
 up on the left we get the option 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.429
 to throw a dollar and throw as they go 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:12.109
 several tickets are worth then as you see 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.060
 we launched as we entered with the 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:16.730
 tree and salgado then we have 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.470
 and we are throwing bills but if you 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.660
 we do in 1 nuno as you see it puts 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.209
 up the left the x so we throw 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.190
 all the time the weapon is a trunk that goes 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.540
 delighted quiet guys who in arms 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.489
 do not lose it because it represents that 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.620
 you are throwing dollars yes the money 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.330
 it goes down a little but what else are we 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.730
 encouraging a little the views although I 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.380
 I have not said anything about boys and well 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.970
 nothing else I wanted to share 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.819
 this with you I think it's pretty 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.220

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.470
