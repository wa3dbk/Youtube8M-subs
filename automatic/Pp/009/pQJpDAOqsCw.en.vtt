00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
wanted to exercise a bit more you just

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.000 
wanted to exercise a bit more you just
take<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.670> you<00:00:15.150> take<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.509> tire<00:00:15.780> off<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.410> it

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
take the you take the tire off and it

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.510 
take the you take the tire off and it
goes<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.430> alternator<00:00:18.680> and<00:00:19.680> then<00:00:19.890> out<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.490> a

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
goes to the alternator and then out to a

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:30.230 
goes to the alternator and then out to a
power<00:00:21.119> source<00:00:26.990> so<00:00:27.990> that's<00:00:28.140> with<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:29.240> the

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
power source so that's with the the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.840 
power source so that's with the the
rotor<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.929> alternator<00:00:31.470> not<00:00:32.099> energized

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
rotor and the alternator not energized

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.780 
rotor and the alternator not energized
and<00:00:33.239> no<00:00:33.719> load<00:00:33.960> on<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:34.920> now<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.070> introduce<00:00:35.430> a

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
and no load on it so now I introduce a

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:48.410 
and no load on it so now I introduce a
roaster<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.360> put<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.570> 50<00:00:36.809> watt<00:00:37.050> load<00:00:37.230> on<00:00:47.329> at<00:00:48.329> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
roaster and put a 50 watt load on at the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.460 
roaster and put a 50 watt load on at the
moment

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
moment

00:00:50.470 --> 00:01:12.230 
moment
but<00:00:53.710> load

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.340 

pretty<00:01:13.170> much<00:01:13.909> but<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.149> this<00:01:15.570> isn't<00:01:15.840> even<00:01:16.110> a

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
pretty much but this this isn't even a

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.359
