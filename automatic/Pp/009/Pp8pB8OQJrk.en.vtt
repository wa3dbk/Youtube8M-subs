came with white laces and then the gray

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.900 
came with white laces and then the gray
laces<00:04:13.720> I<00:04:14.470> would<00:04:15.040> put<00:04:15.220> the<00:04:15.310> grey<00:04:15.459> laces<00:04:15.880> in

something<00:04:20.109> and<00:04:20.500> I<00:04:20.709> think<00:04:20.920> these<00:04:21.040> laces<00:04:21.340> did<00:04:21.700> it

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
so it comes with three pairs of laces

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.760 
so it comes with three pairs of laces
