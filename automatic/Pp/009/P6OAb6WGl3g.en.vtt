quite<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.549> good<00:01:50.670> skateboarder<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:52.200> take<00:01:52.680> that

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
quite a good skateboarder so I take that

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.350 
quite a good skateboarder so I take that
board<00:01:53.040> when<00:01:53.159> I'm<00:01:53.250> with<00:01:53.430> him<00:01:53.579> just<00:01:53.850> like<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.240> do

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
board when I'm with him just like it do

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.469 
board when I'm with him just like it do
some<00:01:54.570> kick<00:01:54.780> flips<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.259> ramps<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.399> stuff<00:01:56.610> so

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
some kick flips and ramps and stuff so

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.760 
some kick flips and ramps and stuff so
that's<00:01:57.630> what<00:01:57.869> that's<00:01:58.020> for<00:01:58.110> if<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.469> want<00:01:58.680> to

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
that's what that's for if you want to

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.980 
that's what that's for if you want to
add<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.070> we're<00:01:59.310> how<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.610> skateboard<00:01:59.969> get<00:02:00.960> a

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
add so we're how to skateboard get a

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.840 
add so we're how to skateboard get a
normal<00:02:01.320> skateboard<00:02:01.710> or<00:02:01.860> go<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.310> skate<00:02:02.610> park

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
normal skateboard or go to skate park

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.080 
normal skateboard or go to skate park
and<00:02:03.200> yet<00:02:04.200> that's<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.829> board<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.130> get<00:02:05.280> if<00:02:05.610> you

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
and yet that's the board to get if you

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.660 
and yet that's the board to get if you
want<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.360> or<00:02:06.479> street<00:02:06.719> skiing

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
want to or street skiing

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.330 
want to or street skiing
but<00:02:08.630> if<00:02:08.869> you<00:02:09.020> just<00:02:09.229> want<00:02:09.470> a<00:02:09.560> board<00:02:09.860> to<00:02:10.039> skate

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
but if you just want a board to skate

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.980 
but if you just want a board to skate
around<00:02:10.459> on<00:02:10.850> your<00:02:11.270> bet<00:02:11.600> you're<00:02:11.720> getting<00:02:11.930> the

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
around on your bet you're getting the

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.410 
around on your bet you're getting the
penny<00:02:12.200> board<00:02:12.440> because<00:02:12.740> as<00:02:12.980> a<00:02:13.040> cruiser<00:02:13.940> it's

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
penny board because as a cruiser it's

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.650 
penny board because as a cruiser it's
faster<00:02:15.140> as<00:02:15.760> light<00:02:16.760> our<00:02:16.940> way<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:18.100> start<00:02:19.100> it<00:02:19.280> is

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
faster as light our way and start it is

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.780 
faster as light our way and start it is
going<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.780> be<00:02:20.870> less<00:02:21.110> of<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:22.040> hazard<00:02:22.220> to<00:02:22.459> you

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
going to be less of a hazard to you

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.949 
going to be less of a hazard to you
because<00:02:23.750> if<00:02:24.050> you<00:02:24.140> can<00:02:24.350> tell<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.620> difference

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
because if you can tell the difference

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.340 
because if you can tell the difference
along<00:02:26.959> skateboard<00:02:27.470> wheels<00:02:27.620> are<00:02:27.830> very<00:02:28.040> small

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
along skateboard wheels are very small

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.340 
along skateboard wheels are very small
and<00:02:30.350> thin<00:02:30.950> and<00:02:31.250> a<00:02:32.239> penny<00:02:32.480> balls<00:02:32.750> are<00:02:32.959> very<00:02:32.989> big

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
and thin and a penny balls are very big

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.979 
and thin and a penny balls are very big
the<00:02:34.010> reason<00:02:34.370> for<00:02:34.520> that<00:02:34.670> well<00:02:34.910> there's<00:02:35.690> lots<00:02:35.810> of

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
the reason for that well there's lots of

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.020 
the reason for that well there's lots of
reasons<00:02:36.050> but<00:02:36.410> one<00:02:36.560> of<00:02:36.590> them<00:02:36.770> is<00:02:36.890> because<00:02:37.069> this

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
reasons but one of them is because this

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.770 
reasons but one of them is because this
skateboard

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
skateboard

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.080 
skateboard
if<00:02:38.840> you<00:02:39.650> roll<00:02:39.860> over<00:02:39.890> a<00:02:40.190> stone<00:02:40.550> on<00:02:40.730> your<00:02:40.910> wheel

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
if you roll over a stone on your wheel

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.060 
if you roll over a stone on your wheel
or<00:02:41.360> your<00:02:41.540> trucks<00:02:41.810> it's<00:02:42.410> going<00:02:42.620> to<00:02:42.680> get<00:02:42.800> stuck

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
or your trucks it's going to get stuck

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.430 
or your trucks it's going to get stuck
and<00:02:43.340> you're<00:02:43.550> going<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.850> go<00:02:44.030> flying<00:02:44.630> and<00:02:45.050> I<00:02:45.290> have

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
and you're going to go flying and I have

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.180 
and you're going to go flying and I have
had<00:02:45.620> that<00:02:45.769> before

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
had that before

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.020 
had that before
so<00:02:47.320> this<00:02:48.320> is<00:02:48.440> more<00:02:48.709> for<00:02:48.980> people<00:02:49.760> who<00:02:49.820> could

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
so this is more for people who could

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.140 
so this is more for people who could
skate<00:02:50.269> better<00:02:50.450> and<00:02:51.280> go<00:02:52.280> to<00:02:52.340> skate<00:02:52.700> parks<00:02:53.030> to

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
skate better and go to skate parks to

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.910 
skate better and go to skate parks to
the<00:02:53.239> pulling<00:02:53.510> off<00:02:53.840> stones<00:02:54.140> so<00:02:54.530> you<00:02:54.620> don't<00:02:54.800> know

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
the pulling off stones so you don't know

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.440 
the pulling off stones so you don't know
how<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.070> take<00:02:55.250> it<00:02:55.280> at<00:02:55.459> cruising<00:02:55.850> because<00:02:56.180> it's

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
how to take it at cruising because it's

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.490 
how to take it at cruising because it's
very<00:02:56.630> hard<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:57.640> control<00:02:58.640> yourself<00:02:59.239> going<00:03:00.140> over

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
very hard to control yourself going over

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.550 
very hard to control yourself going over
rocks<00:03:00.769> and<00:03:00.950> stuff<00:03:01.220> and<00:03:01.780> this<00:03:02.780> was<00:03:03.050> fast<00:03:03.290> so<00:03:03.500> you

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
rocks and stuff and this was fast so you

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.140 
rocks and stuff and this was fast so you
need<00:03:03.620> to<00:03:03.800> do<00:03:03.890> more<00:03:04.100> legwork<00:03:04.310> if<00:03:04.670> you're<00:03:04.910> going

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
need to do more legwork if you're going

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.270 
need to do more legwork if you're going
cruising<00:03:05.510> with<00:03:05.600> an<00:03:05.810> on<00:03:06.019> the<00:03:06.110> skateboard<00:03:06.319> these

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
cruising with an on the skateboard these

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.920 
cruising with an on the skateboard these
moves<00:03:07.550> are<00:03:07.670> better<00:03:07.910> so<00:03:08.269> they<00:03:08.390> can<00:03:08.420> move<00:03:08.660> over

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
moves are better so they can move over

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.140 
moves are better so they can move over
stones<00:03:09.290> obviously<00:03:09.800> not<00:03:09.950> big<00:03:10.100> rocks<00:03:10.400> but<00:03:11.000> they

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
stones obviously not big rocks but they

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.090 
stones obviously not big rocks but they
can<00:03:11.330> move<00:03:11.570> over<00:03:11.720> small<00:03:12.170> stones<00:03:12.500> you<00:03:12.799> hardly

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
can move over small stones you hardly

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.550 
can move over small stones you hardly
know<00:03:13.459> set<00:03:13.760> and<00:03:13.940> these<00:03:14.780> are<00:03:14.930> easier<00:03:15.200> to<00:03:15.290> turn

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
know set and these are easier to turn

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.009 
know set and these are easier to turn
and<00:03:16.060> normal<00:03:17.060> orthonormal<00:03:17.600> skateboard<00:03:17.989> you

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
and normal orthonormal skateboard you

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.080 
and normal orthonormal skateboard you
have<00:03:18.140> to<00:03:18.320> kick<00:03:18.560> turn<00:03:18.769> which<00:03:18.980> is<00:03:19.010> keep<00:03:19.880> on

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
have to kick turn which is keep on

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.970 
have to kick turn which is keep on
lifting<00:03:20.840> your<00:03:21.230> feet<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:21.590> turning<00:03:21.890> around

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
lifting your feet and turning around

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.550 
lifting your feet and turning around
like<00:03:22.250> that<00:03:22.400> if<00:03:22.700> your<00:03:23.420> trucks<00:03:24.019> are<00:03:24.170> very<00:03:24.200> loose

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
like that if your trucks are very loose

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.240 
like that if your trucks are very loose
so<00:03:25.250> that's<00:03:25.730> board<00:03:26.030> normally<00:03:26.390> just<00:03:26.570> the<00:03:26.900> slice

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
so that's board normally just the slice

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.009 
so that's board normally just the slice
so<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:28.310> shift<00:03:28.579> of<00:03:28.670> your<00:03:28.820> body<00:03:29.090> weight<00:03:29.810> and

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
so the shift of your body weight and

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.289 
so the shift of your body weight and
