00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:25.580 
so I'm guessing this is the real risha
and<00:06:19.020> not<00:06:19.140> dream<00:06:19.710> ratio<00:06:20.250> right<00:06:21.620> the<00:06:22.620> snow<00:06:24.590> he's

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:31.070 
and not dream ratio right the snow he's
in<00:06:25.830> color<00:06:26.130> which<00:06:26.490> must<00:06:26.820> mean<00:06:26.910> he's<00:06:27.240> real<00:06:30.080> I'm

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
in color which must mean he's real I'm

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.020 
in color which must mean he's real I'm
still<00:06:31.380> wondering<00:06:31.560> how<00:06:31.980> our<00:06:32.160> heroes<00:06:32.580> managed

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.030

maximum<00:07:33.250> level<00:07:33.670> Bushido<00:07:34.360> I<00:07:34.950> think<00:07:35.950> it<00:07:36.070> does<00:07:38.280> so

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 
maximum level Bushido I think it does so

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.980 
maximum level Bushido I think it does so
let's<00:07:39.520> go<00:07:39.730> to<00:07:39.790> the<00:07:40.030> throne<00:07:40.360> room<00:07:40.390> get
