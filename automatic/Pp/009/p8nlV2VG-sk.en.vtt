00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.139 
fine then you could select the delay
between<00:01:48.750> waves<00:01:49.290> now<00:01:49.649> I'm<00:01:49.950> gonna<00:01:50.100> put<00:01:50.369> no<00:01:50.549> delay

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
between waves now I'm gonna put no delay

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.580 
between waves now I'm gonna put no delay
or<00:01:51.180> just<00:01:51.479> leave<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.780> cuz<00:01:51.899> I'm<00:01:51.990> only<00:01:52.140> doing<00:01:52.380> one

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
or just leave it cuz I'm only doing one

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.800 
or just leave it cuz I'm only doing one
wave<00:01:53.149> once<00:01:54.149> it's<00:01:54.299> all<00:01:54.420> setup

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
wave once it's all setup

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.780 
wave once it's all setup
test<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.350> out<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:56.189> I'm<00:01:56.280> just<00:01:56.310> gonna<00:01:56.490> wave<00:01:56.759> my

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
test it out so I'm just gonna wave my

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.080 
test it out so I'm just gonna wave my
hand<00:01:57.270> over<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.659> proximity<00:01:58.079> sensors<00:01:58.710> oh<00:01:59.090> I

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
hand over the proximity sensors oh I

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.899 
hand over the proximity sensors oh I
waved<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.840> too<00:02:01.110> much<00:02:01.290> just<00:02:02.040> one<00:02:02.250> wave<00:02:02.460> will

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
waved it too much just one wave will

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.270 
waved it too much just one wave will
turn<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.270> on<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:04.170> second<00:02:04.619> wave<00:02:04.770> should

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
turn it on and the second wave should

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.580 
turn it on and the second wave should
turn<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.549> off<00:02:05.780> so<00:02:06.780> there<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.020> go<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.350> works

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
turn it off so there you go it works

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.070 
turn it off so there you go it works
pretty<00:02:07.920> fast<00:02:08.310> it's<00:02:08.759> pretty<00:02:09.360> accurate<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:10.020> I

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
pretty fast it's pretty accurate and I

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
pretty fast it's pretty accurate and I
definitely

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
definitely

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.890
