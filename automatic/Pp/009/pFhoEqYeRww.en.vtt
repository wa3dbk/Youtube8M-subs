00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
snowy and this one's like a huge I'm not

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.550 
snowy and this one's like a huge I'm not
even<00:02:48.270> gonna<00:02:48.390> open<00:02:48.720> it's<00:02:48.870> not<00:02:49.020> worth<00:02:49.260> it

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
even gonna open it's not worth it

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.110 
even gonna open it's not worth it
but<00:02:49.860> it's<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.040> huge<00:02:50.250> harness<00:02:50.640> leash<00:02:50.790> it's<00:02:51.030> way

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
but it's a huge harness leash it's way

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.150 
but it's a huge harness leash it's way
too<00:02:51.180> big<00:02:51.330> it<00:02:51.690> fits<00:02:51.870> my<00:02:51.989> cats<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.620> my<00:02:52.709> cats<00:02:52.980> are

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
too big it fits my cats and my cats are

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.820 
too big it fits my cats and my cats are
huge<00:02:53.519> and<00:02:53.790> really<00:02:53.940> overweight<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:55.560> fits

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
huge and really overweight and it fits

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.050 
huge and really overweight and it fits
them<00:02:56.040> so<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.310> definitely<00:02:56.580> doesn't<00:02:56.700> fit<00:02:56.940> the

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
them so it definitely doesn't fit the

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.370 
them so it definitely doesn't fit the
ferrets<00:02:57.360> but<00:02:57.480> I<00:02:57.510> think<00:02:57.750> if<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:57.930> got<00:02:58.110> it<00:02:58.230> in<00:02:58.320> a

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
ferrets but I think if I got it in a

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.320 
ferrets but I think if I got it in a
medium<00:02:58.530> it's<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:58.980> super<00:02:59.280> pet<00:02:59.459> one<00:02:59.640> I<00:02:59.850> think<00:03:00.269> if

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
medium it's the super pet one I think if

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.550 
medium it's the super pet one I think if
I<00:03:00.420> got<00:03:00.570> it<00:03:00.630> in<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.780> medium<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:01.170> probably<00:03:01.380> would

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
I got it in a medium I probably would

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.170 
I got it in a medium I probably would
fit<00:03:01.739> same<00:03:02.280> thing<00:03:02.430> with<00:03:02.580> this<00:03:02.700> one<00:03:02.880> I<00:03:02.910> think

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
fit same thing with this one I think

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.500 
fit same thing with this one I think
they<00:03:03.269> need<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.450> medium<00:03:04.010> um<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:05.910> yeah<00:03:06.030> this<00:03:06.450> is

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
they need a medium um so yeah this is

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.090 
they need a medium um so yeah this is
really<00:03:06.870> no<00:03:07.050> major<00:03:07.260> point<00:03:07.560> in<00:03:07.709> this<00:03:07.769> video<00:03:08.040> I
