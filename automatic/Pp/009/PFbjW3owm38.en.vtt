00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:27.670 
you'll notice them someone's put a tree

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.670 
you'll notice them someone's put a tree
in<00:00:27.730> the<00:00:27.880> way<00:00:28.029> so<00:00:28.090> you<00:00:29.050> have<00:00:29.230> to<00:00:29.320> get<00:00:29.439> over<00:00:29.560> that

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680 
in the way so you have to get over that

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.530 
in the way so you have to get over that

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
got 178 yards to the flag now that's

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.020 
got 178 yards to the flag now that's
it's<00:00:35.559> gonna<00:00:35.650> take<00:00:35.830> me<00:00:35.890> about<00:00:36.040> at<00:00:36.129> 99<00:00:36.550> maybe<00:00:36.879> an

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
it's gonna take me about at 99 maybe an

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.820 
it's gonna take me about at 99 maybe an
a<00:00:37.150> time<00:00:37.420> to<00:00:37.570> get<00:00:37.690> over<00:00:37.960> that<00:00:38.050> tree<00:00:38.379> but<00:00:38.590> it's<00:00:38.739> a

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
a time to get over that tree but it's a

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.850 
a time to get over that tree but it's a
7-iron<00:00:39.309> yardage<00:00:39.820> 178<00:00:40.600> yards<00:00:40.750> so<00:00:41.440> I<00:00:41.470> need<00:00:41.769> to

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
7-iron yardage 178 yards so I need to

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.470 
7-iron yardage 178 yards so I need to
hit<00:00:41.949> a<00:00:42.010> high<00:00:42.220> shot<00:00:42.550> which<00:00:43.090> is<00:00:43.210> going<00:00:43.330> to<00:00:43.390> get

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
hit a high shot which is going to get

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.330 
hit a high shot which is going to get
over<00:00:43.629> the<00:00:43.840> tree<00:00:44.050> but<00:00:44.379> still<00:00:44.650> make<00:00:44.860> the<00:00:44.980> yardage

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
over the tree but still make the yardage

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.250 
over the tree but still make the yardage
so<00:00:45.610> let's<00:00:45.910> see<00:00:46.030> if<00:00:46.120> we<00:00:46.210> can<00:00:46.390> talk<00:00:47.050> you<00:00:47.140> through

you do this so number one thing I need

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.759 
you do this so number one thing I need
Heights<00:00:51.580> I<00:00:51.760> need<00:00:51.910> loft<00:00:52.150> okay<00:00:52.600> so<00:00:52.900> in<00:00:53.260> my<00:00:53.290> set<00:00:53.620> up

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
Heights I need loft okay so in my set up

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:54.719 
Heights I need loft okay so in my set up
I'm<00:00:53.979> going<00:00:54.070> to<00:00:54.129> put<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:54.370> ball<00:00:54.460> further

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
to do in the setup I mean that's

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.420 
to do in the setup I mean that's
actually<00:01:02.409> going<00:01:02.650> to<00:01:02.739> make<00:01:02.830> the<00:01:02.949> hands<00:01:03.129> come

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
actually going to make the hands come

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.000 
actually going to make the hands come
back<00:01:03.580> a<00:01:03.640> little<00:01:03.879> bit<00:01:04.120> so<00:01:04.180> some<00:01:04.839> people<00:01:05.170> and<00:01:05.830> I

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
actually encourage this the hands go

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.180 
actually encourage this the hands go
forward<00:01:07.540> a<00:01:07.960> little<00:01:07.990> bit<00:01:08.290> in<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:08.440> setup<00:01:08.650> but

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
forward a little bit in the setup but

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.100 
forward a little bit in the setup but
not<00:01:09.340> for<00:01:09.520> this<00:01:09.640> shot<00:01:09.880> ball<00:01:10.450> forward<00:01:10.869> hands

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
not for this shot ball forward hands

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.140 
not for this shot ball forward hands
will<00:01:11.290> be<00:01:11.409> back<00:01:11.530> a<00:01:11.560> little<00:01:11.860> bit<00:01:12.010> in<00:01:12.190> the<00:01:12.880> golf

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
will be back a little bit in the golf

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.600 
will be back a little bit in the golf
swing<00:01:13.470> will<00:01:14.470> do<00:01:14.560> pretty<00:01:14.770> much<00:01:14.830> everything<00:01:15.250> the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
swing will do pretty much everything the

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.460 
swing will do pretty much everything the
same<00:01:15.790> as<00:01:16.030> normal<00:01:16.479> in<00:01:16.659> our<00:01:16.720> backswing<00:01:17.260> we'll

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
same as normal in our backswing we'll

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.620 
same as normal in our backswing we'll
load<00:01:17.680> up<00:01:17.710> on<00:01:17.950> to<00:01:18.070> our<00:01:18.190> right<00:01:18.430> side<00:01:18.760> but<00:01:19.479> on<00:01:19.510> the

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
load up on to our right side but on the

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.350 
load up on to our right side but on the
way<00:01:19.869> down<00:01:20.159> yes<00:01:21.159> the<00:01:21.369> lower<00:01:21.549> body<00:01:21.790> will<00:01:22.060> drive

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
way down yes the lower body will drive

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.060 
way down yes the lower body will drive
and<00:01:22.600> rotate<00:01:22.960> through<00:01:23.110> to<00:01:23.260> the<00:01:23.320> target<00:01:23.740> but<00:01:23.770> my

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
and rotate through to the target but my

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.469 
and rotate through to the target but my
head<00:01:24.310> is<00:01:24.340> going<00:01:24.610> to<00:01:24.670> stay<00:01:24.850> back<00:01:25.090> a<00:01:25.119> little<00:01:25.330> bit

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
head is going to stay back a little bit

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.630 
head is going to stay back a little bit
longer<00:01:25.690> okay<00:01:26.020> so<00:01:26.890> my<00:01:27.010> head<00:01:27.220> is<00:01:27.280> going<00:01:27.400> to<00:01:27.490> stay

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
longer okay so my head is going to stay

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.850 
longer okay so my head is going to stay
back<00:01:27.850> more<00:01:28.120> behind<00:01:28.480> the<00:01:28.630> golf<00:01:28.840> ball<00:01:29.140> sense<00:01:29.740> of

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
back more behind the golf ball sense of

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.440 
back more behind the golf ball sense of
gravity<00:01:30.160> behind<00:01:30.400> the<00:01:30.610> ball<00:01:30.760> we're<00:01:31.210> gonna<00:01:31.300> make

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
gravity behind the ball we're gonna make

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.580 
gravity behind the ball we're gonna make
the<00:01:31.540> golf<00:01:31.720> ball<00:01:31.900> go<00:01:32.020> a<00:01:32.050> little<00:01:32.230> bit<00:01:32.410> higher

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
the golf ball go a little bit higher
