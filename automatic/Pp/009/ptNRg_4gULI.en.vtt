00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
performance and you lose

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.489 
performance and you lose

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:43.499 
as long as you fight your heart out and

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:45.889 
as long as you fight your heart out and
come<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.520> fight<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:45.390> doesn't<00:01:45.659> hurt<00:01:45.749> your

experience they are world-class judges

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.490 
experience they are world-class judges
however<00:02:07.799> we've<00:02:08.039> seen<00:02:08.250> decisions<00:02:08.700> in<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.940> past

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
however we've seen decisions in the past

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.160 
however we've seen decisions in the past
rendered<00:02:10.500> by<00:02:10.619> judges<00:02:11.039> were<00:02:11.220> their<00:02:11.400> political

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
rendered by judges were their political

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.110

appointed<00:02:13.170> type<00:02:13.379> of<00:02:13.620> scenarios<00:02:14.579> that<00:02:14.879> you

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
appointed type of scenarios that you

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.520 
appointed type of scenarios that you
know<00:02:15.209> maybe<00:02:15.420> these<00:02:15.599> people<00:02:15.660> just<00:02:16.110> don't<00:02:16.349> have

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
know maybe these people just don't have

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.319 
know maybe these people just don't have
what<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.709> takes<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.280> be<00:02:17.610> putting<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:18.000> hypership

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
what it takes to be putting a hypership

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:19.670 
what it takes to be putting a hypership
situation<00:02:18.959> so<00:02:19.049> I<00:02:19.079> think<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.319> needs<00:02:19.560> to

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
situation so I think that needs to

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.039 
situation so I think that needs to
change<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:20.370> we<00:02:20.519> as<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:21.180> boxing<00:02:21.569> community<00:02:21.720> to

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
change and we as the boxing community to

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.869 
change and we as the boxing community to
look<00:02:22.290> at<00:02:22.379> that<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:22.769> put<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.370> best<00:02:23.610> people

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
look at that and put the best people

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.449 
look at that and put the best people
forward<00:02:24.450> if<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:25.049> have<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.290> bad<00:02:25.530> night<00:02:25.739> you<00:02:26.310> need

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
forward if you have a bad night you need

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:27.979 
forward if you have a bad night you need
to<00:02:26.519> sit<00:02:26.670> down<00:02:26.730> for<00:02:26.879> a<00:02:27.120> while<00:02:27.209> do<00:02:27.420> some<00:02:27.599> remedial

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
to sit down for a while do some remedial

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.080 
to sit down for a while do some remedial
stuff<00:02:28.349> if<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.129> have<00:02:29.280> great<00:02:29.519> outings<00:02:29.910> each

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
stuff if you have great outings each

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.550 
stuff if you have great outings each
time<00:02:30.329> you<00:02:30.540> should<00:02:30.599> work<00:02:30.870> more<00:02:30.900> than<00:02:31.170> someone

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
time you should work more than someone

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.440 
time you should work more than someone
else<00:02:31.709> so<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:32.280> think<00:02:32.579> we<00:02:32.819> really<00:02:33.090> need<00:02:33.239> to<00:02:33.329> look

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
else so I think we really need to look

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.680 
else so I think we really need to look
at<00:02:33.599> that<00:02:33.720> as<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:33.930> sport<00:02:34.379> and<00:02:34.650> hopefully

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
at that as a sport and hopefully

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.849 
at that as a sport and hopefully
decisions<00:02:36.690> like<00:02:36.840> this<00:02:36.870> one<00:02:37.200> will<00:02:37.379> not<00:02:37.590> happen

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
decisions like this one will not happen

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:41.119 
decisions like this one will not happen
in<00:02:38.819> the<00:02:38.970> future<00:02:39.470> you<00:02:40.470> talked<00:02:40.709> about<00:02:40.799> in<00:02:41.040> the
