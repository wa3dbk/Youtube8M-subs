00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
seen on or near attraction think I might

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.150 
seen on or near attraction think I might
have<00:05:50.600> been<00:05:50.750> a<00:05:50.780> part<00:05:51.020> a<00:05:51.080> few<00:05:51.260> of<00:05:51.350> those<00:05:51.470> yes<00:05:51.830> I

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
have been a part a few of those yes I

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.400 
have been a part a few of those yes I
think<00:05:52.250> so<00:05:52.460> I<00:05:52.610> think<00:05:53.030> you<00:05:54.020> know<00:05:54.139> the<00:05:54.229> best

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
think so I think you know the best

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:55.810 
think so I think you know the best
temper<00:05:54.740> tantrum<00:05:55.100> that<00:05:55.190> I've<00:05:55.340> thrown<00:05:55.550> was

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
temper tantrum that I've thrown was

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.490 
temper tantrum that I've thrown was
probably<00:05:56.210> jumping<00:05:56.960> over<00:05:57.080> the<00:05:57.169> car<00:05:57.350> and

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
probably jumping over the car and

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.500 
probably jumping over the car and
grabbing<00:05:57.770> Biffle<00:05:58.070> by<00:05:58.160> the<00:05:58.220> side<00:05:58.460> so<00:05:58.729> it's

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
grabbing Biffle by the side so it's

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:00.940 
grabbing Biffle by the side so it's
probably<00:05:59.810> the<00:05:59.960> worst<00:06:00.500> one<00:06:00.680> that<00:06:00.800> I've<00:06:00.919> ever

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950
