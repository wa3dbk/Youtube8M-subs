00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
at all so it's really hard for you to do

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.689 
at all so it's really hard for you to do
this<00:00:41.199> make<00:00:42.199> sure<00:00:42.440> your<00:00:42.650> back<00:00:42.890> is<00:00:42.920> getting

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.410 
other ones cuz it makes it easier with
other<00:02:24.610> momentum<00:02:25.470> so<00:02:26.730> really<00:02:27.730> you're<00:02:27.880> going<00:02:28.269> to

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
other momentum so really you're going to

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.860 
other momentum so really you're going to
stay<00:02:28.660> in<00:02:28.690> each<00:02:28.930> position<00:02:29.140> like<00:02:29.680> half<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:30.100> second

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
stay in each position like half a second

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.610 
stay in each position like half a second
so<00:02:31.870> it's<00:02:32.019> like<00:02:32.970> three<00:02:33.970> down<00:02:34.180> up<00:02:34.480> move<00:02:35.260> em<00:02:35.410> up

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
so it's like three down up move em up

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.800 
so it's like three down up move em up
move<00:02:36.459> em<00:02:36.670> up<00:02:37.030> move<00:02:37.750> em<00:02:37.900> up<00:02:38.700> so<00:02:39.700> your<00:02:40.480> weight

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
move em up move em up so your weight

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.080 
move em up move em up so your weight
most<00:02:41.260> of<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.530> time<00:02:41.769> is<00:02:42.070> on<00:02:42.340> your<00:02:42.550> hands

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
most of the time is on your hands

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.509 
most of the time is on your hands
because<00:02:43.510> when<00:02:44.470> you<00:02:44.560> go<00:02:44.709> down<00:02:44.980> you<00:02:45.010> don't<00:02:45.280> run<00:02:45.489> a

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
because when you go down you don't run a

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.070 
because when you go down you don't run a
lot<00:02:45.610> on<00:02:45.880> your<00:02:46.030> feet<00:02:46.239> Cosette<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:46.569> it's<00:02:46.720> harder

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
lot on your feet Cosette and it's harder

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.830 
lot on your feet Cosette and it's harder
to<00:02:47.110> push<00:02:47.500> off<00:02:47.739> so<00:02:48.730> for<00:02:49.000> this<00:02:49.209> you're<00:02:49.540> using

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
to push off so for this you're using

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.780 
to push off so for this you're using
your<00:02:50.170> back<00:02:50.410> muscles<00:02:50.440> and<00:02:51.130> your<00:02:51.220> glut<00:02:51.430> muscles

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
your back muscles and your glut muscles

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.199 
your back muscles and your glut muscles
to<00:02:52.060> get<00:02:52.239> to<00:02:52.510> over<00:02:53.049> and<00:02:54.010> if<00:02:54.579> you<00:02:54.700> need<00:02:54.880> help<00:02:55.060> you

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
to get to over and if you need help you

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.539 
to get to over and if you need help you
can<00:02:55.329> always<00:02:55.510> get<00:02:55.750> someone<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:55.959> spot<00:02:56.230> you

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
can always get someone to spot you

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:04.670 
can always get someone to spot you

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.250
