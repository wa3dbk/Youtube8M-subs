 ordering baby clothes something for home we 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.579

 so wait do not unsubscribe today 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.119
 want to talk to you again on 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:11.960
 financial theme namely 6 ways 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:15.840
 saving money so the first way 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.869
 I already talked about him my previous 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.689
 financial video but today I want to talk about it 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.820
 way to talk to you in detail and so 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.400
 when we get paid we get 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.680
 some of our extra income from 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.530
 this whole amount boy 10 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.240
 percent and remove the envelope and its 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.610
 natural glue we remove where 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.240
 away from our eyes to the next 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.850
 payday and so we do the first month in 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.710
 the second month we have shares total 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.820
 we postpone 20 percent and also 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.500
 sealed in an envelope choose away 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:53.369
 the third month we set aside from the whole 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.130
 totaling 30 percent is natural 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:00.299
 we do at the very beginning as soon as we 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.579
 improved money on the fourth month 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.360
 we'll start all over again putting it off again 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.210
 10 percent and so on this way 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.240
 very effective for on 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:14.090
 phenomenon in terms of allowing 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.910
 save up for some things fast 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.790
 pretty without resorting to a loan or 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.230
 other all sorts of loans this way 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.660
 it is really very proven 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:28.910
 effective we checked it on ourselves we 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.580
 bought furniture and 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.470
 at that time a certain full amount 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.420
 we didn't have credit available we didn't 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.470
 they wanted to get in and here I found such a method 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.140
 accumulation we decided it for one 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.270
 try it to us very much and we 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.420
 did not regret that we are not anywhere 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.890
 climbed in principle for three months we 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.370
 on exactly the furniture we wanted 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:56.450
 saved up so the second way we save money 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.480
 in a bank, that is, we open a deposit under 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.250
 percent and we put there under these percent 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.210
 some kind of your capital 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.830
 This method is good for such savings. 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.100
 which are you planning to spend on 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.600
 any big your expense items 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.730
 for example real estate 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.860
 car or land purchase 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:21.380
 or something else that education pension there 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:24.410
 different goals can be and such 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:28.220
 here is the long term method of accumulation he and 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:31.250
 this is the third way to postpone 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.440
 all the little things in the bank in ordinary 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.520
 some kind of iron glass jar 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.690
 box in the piggy bank anything 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.410
 let's say big from the store you have 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.300
 left 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:46.880
 letting the little things throw her in this jar 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.520
 that is, we postpone naturally coins 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.210
 Of course, 10 to 5 kopecks to 50 is not worth 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.120
 save 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.320
 namely ruble 2 ruble 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.930
 five-ruble 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.240
 10-ruble coin we all throw this 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.740
 jar and before it starts 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.710
 I want to put off coins 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.570
 advise to determine the period of accumulation 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.750
 and it is desirable to put strongly that you 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:13.010
 save example set term for six months 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.900
 and every day I throw these coins to you 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.630
 I want to say in six months 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.370
 an impressive amount that you accumulate 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.900
 can spend on some standing 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.430
 for you the thing you put off 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:29.290
 the purchase that you put off constantly 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:32.630
 for some indefinite time and so 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.910
 fourth method fourth method very 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.660
 interesting I would recommend one 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.980
 familiar 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:44.570
 I have not heard everything about this method before 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:48.980
 we know that on banknotes of childhood 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:53.300
 such here are the type of initials that is 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:55.670
 and a series of money that is license plates 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:05:01.100
 not a sign correctly it is called here 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:03.170
 here is the same and even this is serious 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.050
 we are fun this way interesting in 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:09.980
 generally got in the money and mash and 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:15.800
 look on the notes your initials that is 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:16.640
 eg here and here and there may be a name 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.470
 patronymic 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:24.080
 first name last name maiden name and your first name 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.870
 surname husband's name surname middle name 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.030
 there children anything else initials 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.970
 if you find such bills you them 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.860
 you can also postpone 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.700
 what is the term postponing these denezhek 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.170
 and also seems very decisive and the amount 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.780
 proven method 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.880
 as effective and efficient as you can 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.680
 you put it off for a month 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.630
 spend on entertainment somewhere else 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:53.170
 some kind of purchase to buy general all that 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:55.310
 your heart's content so the method of Example 5 

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:57.590
 put off steppe 10 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.830
 ruble bill or become ruble 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.930
 bills you got a salary of 50 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.630
 or 100 rubles postponed either 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.330
 went to the store came from the store to you 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.990
 surrendered on such bills brought 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.300
 home change put off 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:15.120
 also very effective way 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:18.030
 you can even think of an effective system 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:21.510
 fines for example you put somewhere on 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:24.200
 kitchen a jar in advance of course the family 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:28.170
 spoke this system of fines that is 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:32.340
 a certain dachshund for 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:35.760

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.930
 fines 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.850
 let's say for some small violation 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:50.400
 a small fine for a big violation 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:52.080
 a bigger penalty and for example the end of the month 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.150
 accumulated amount you can also 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:57.470
