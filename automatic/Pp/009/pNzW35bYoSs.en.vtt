people kill their out boards I'm gonna
do<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.910> first<00:00:17.939> one<00:00:18.330> right<00:00:18.509> now<00:00:19.279> ready<00:00:20.279> oh

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700 
turn the key because really the number

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.519 
turn the key because really the number
one<00:00:26.730> stupid<00:00:27.180> way<00:00:27.419> people<00:00:27.779> kill<00:00:28.020> their<00:00:28.169> upwards

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
one stupid way people kill their upwards

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.889 
one stupid way people kill their upwards
is<00:00:28.739> by<00:00:29.279> dry<00:00:29.669> starting<00:00:30.149> them<00:00:30.300> when<00:00:30.599> land

00:00:30.889 --> 00:00:30.899 
is by dry starting them when land

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.470 
is by dry starting them when land
without<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.470> sufficient<00:00:31.710> water<00:00:32.099> supply<00:00:32.480> here's

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
without a sufficient water supply here's

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.780 
without a sufficient water supply here's
why<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:34.200> cooling<00:00:34.590> water<00:00:34.680> for<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.399> outboard

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
why the cooling water for that outboard

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.280 
why the cooling water for that outboard
engine<00:00:36.060> comes<00:00:36.690> from<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.930> water<00:00:37.050> pump

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
engine comes from the water pump

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.190 
engine comes from the water pump
impeller<00:00:37.620> which<00:00:38.100> has<00:00:38.280> veins<00:00:38.550> like<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.200> see

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
impeller which has veins like this see

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.770 
impeller which has veins like this see
how<00:00:40.260> they<00:00:40.380> Bend<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.980> rubbery<00:00:41.370> no<00:00:42.120> water<00:00:42.360> no

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
how they Bend the rubbery no water no

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.670 
how they Bend the rubbery no water no
lubrication<00:00:44.210> vein<00:00:45.210> goes<00:00:45.420> bad<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.930> your

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
lubrication vein goes bad and your

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.330 
lubrication vein goes bad and your
outboard<00:00:47.010> doesn't<00:00:47.700> get<00:00:47.790> any<00:00:47.940> cooling<00:00:48.240> water

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
outboard doesn't get any cooling water

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.250 
outboard doesn't get any cooling water
stupid<00:00:50.340> move<00:00:50.490> number<00:00:50.850> two<00:00:51.150> also<00:00:51.600> takes<00:00:52.079> place

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
stupid move number two also takes place

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.350 
stupid move number two also takes place
right<00:00:52.980> here<00:00:53.160> at<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.400> helm<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.850> I'm<00:00:54.090> gonna<00:00:54.240> do

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
right here at the helm and I'm gonna do

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.080 
right here at the helm and I'm gonna do
this<00:00:54.480> one<00:00:54.630> too<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.960> ready<00:00:55.820> that's<00:00:56.820> it

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
shifting in and out of gear when the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.729 
shifting in and out of gear when the
engine<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.579> not<00:00:59.790> running<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.570> bad<00:01:00.960> idea<00:01:01.260> now

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
engine is not running is a bad idea now

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.549 
engine is not running is a bad idea now
one<00:01:02.160> caveat<00:01:02.399> with<00:01:03.090> electronic<00:01:03.600> controls<00:01:03.989> it's

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
one caveat with electronic controls it's

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.590 
one caveat with electronic controls it's
perfectly<00:01:04.979> fine<00:01:05.189> but<00:01:05.670> with<00:01:05.820> cable<00:01:06.210> controls

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
perfectly fine but with cable controls

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.960 
perfectly fine but with cable controls
you<00:01:06.780> can<00:01:06.810> stress<00:01:07.259> the<00:01:07.439> cable<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.430> clutch<00:01:08.700> dog

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
you can stress the cable the clutch dog

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.300 
you can stress the cable the clutch dog
may<00:01:09.180> not<00:01:09.330> engage<00:01:09.479> properly<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.740> can<00:01:10.950> stress
