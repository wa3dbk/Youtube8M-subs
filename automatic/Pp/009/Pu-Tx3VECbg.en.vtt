00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.940
 doesn't suit me best 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.410
 as it covers all the flaws on 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.070
 I like the face that it is very 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.550
 mattes the skin well and during the day I 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.410
 absolutely no need to correct my makeup 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.960
 in order for the skin to get a little more 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.090

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.259
 I work out a pencil strands 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.060
 just a little bit hard not to 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.899
 make your eyebrows so very bright 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.899
 unnatural 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.600
 and on top I'll apply this one for 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.909
 eyebrows from anastasia beverly hills 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.490

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.630
 and at the counter I will wear my favorite 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.189

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.189
 bright saturated color 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.770
 and of course, where without highlighters today 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.080
 I will use the smashbox highlighter 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:04.350
 I will put it quite a bit on the cheekbones 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.350
 the back of the nose and of course under the brow and 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.920
 now proceed to the eye makeup in 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.230
 As a base, I applied mineral 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.350
 powder and make up itself we will do with 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.260
 I put the ax into the corners of the eye with a palette 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.670
 the lightest shade and also its me 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.489

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.519
 I apply more on all mobile eyelids 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.800

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:39.250
 interesting very complex and the same color 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.800
 I put on the lower lash line and 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.930
 then I blend everything well to 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.019
 the borders we had were very so smooth and 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.590
 soft proceed to the design of the fold 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.660
 a century then the eye will look more 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:56.549
 bulk large and if you have the newest 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.549
 century then you just need it and 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.060
 the darkest color in this palette i will 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.880
 use to darken the external 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.160
 corner of the eye and will also apply it along 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.769
 eyelash growth lines and also a little bit 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:15.250
 I will put it on the lower lash line 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:15.640
 and for lips i will use chubby 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.950
 stick 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.799
 from clinics of such a delicate pink color 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.620
 and voila that's what we did before and 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.420
 after pre-hair I caused 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.290
 thermal protection from schwarzkopf professional 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.269
 anywhere from the middle to the ends of the hair 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.400
 so that my hair shone I 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:37.450
 Has caused here such means from matrix 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.810
 it is dry oil and for volume on the roots 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.400
 I applied hair from kerastase and 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.260
 Now Iâ€™ll start laying 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.510
 make universal steel frame three 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.810
 Screw me as much as 3 interchangeable nozzles in 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.640
 first then tongs for small curls 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.360
 Next comes the thermo brush to impart 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:58.510
 shape and volume conical forceps 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:04.390
 and forceps for more such soft and 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:06.310
 Difficult curls kit comes in very 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.150
 convenient cosmetic bag where everything is fine 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.790
 fits 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:13.420
 and now I carefully comb my hair 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.550
 the entire length of the Kolyma upper part on 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.269
 crown 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:20.590
 crab and start laying and 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.110
 first i will wind my hair on 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.390
 forceps largest diameter to 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.240
 getting such lighter curls and 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.820
 there will be such a special scheme first 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.740
 the strand will not wind on large 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.600
 tongs yes with a large diameter second 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.700
 strand we will wind on the tapered 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.760
 curling and so on but first of course 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.860
 I will cheat all 1 pankov just 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.570
 I will retreat 3-4 centimeters to 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:49.510
 further screw on cone 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:51.310
 curling tongs of course have 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.290
 ceramic coating to 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.810
 heat is evenly distributed and 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:05:01.390
 tourmaline to hair you not 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:03.250
 I am electrified hair I wind not 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.350
 more than 10 seconds that is, the curl itself on 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.570
 curling I hold no more than ten seconds 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:11.530
 then I put it in my palm and let it cool 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:14.140
 and omit and now proceed to laying 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.810
 conical forceps and now we will 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.570
 wind those strands of hair that we 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.370
 specially left and it turns out that 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.310
 we have one strand of hair twisted on 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:27.580
 big forceps and the second strand on here 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.950
 so here's a cone-shaped curling say 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:34.020
 so we get more hair 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.020
 so voluminous more interesting 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:53.430
 and now we do the same with everyone 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.430
 by voices 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.950
 put down another part of the hair principle you 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.690
 you can not stab them if you do not 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.480
 very thick hair but I'm so much 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.220
 more convenient to cheat them say such 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.220
 in small batches 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:20.470
 and as I said cheat for sure 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:22.180
 so that's what happened and now 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:25.820
 last layer 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:29.320
 I carefully comb the top as 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.320
 I got a little confused 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.259
 and now let's do the same 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.060
 the single most hair part i am 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:41.250
 wound precisely cone-shaped forceps 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.560
 in order to give more volume 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:46.110
 I love my hair exactly volume 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:49.080
 such hairstyles it turns out that one strand 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:52.020
 we screwed on a large diameter curling iron 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:54.539
 and the other two who go after him on 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:58.039
 cone-shaped and it turns out we have this 

00:06:54.539 --> 00:07:00.780
 very beautiful voluminous hairstyle 

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:02.250
 slightly combing the carnie to smooth 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:05.389
 little hairs so they don't 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:08.310
 bristling and splattering like that 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:11.099
 varnish-spray is very convenient but very so 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:13.710
 easily and quietly fixes hair not 

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:16.169
 stick together and looks very much like that 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:19.969
 natural and here it is our result 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:22.800
 I think it turned out very nice and 

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:24.840
 somewhere in half an hour the curls will become 

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.990
 slightly less delineated and are obtained 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:30.090
 such a very gentle curls to me crazy 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:32.370
 like this tab i hope it 

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:34.759
 you also liked it and everything so far and to 

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.759
 see you soon
