00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
so let's go ahead and throw that way and

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.220 
so let's go ahead and throw that way and
obviously<00:01:09.980> the<00:01:10.130> back<00:01:10.280> old<00:01:10.460> bands<00:01:10.670> picked<00:01:10.970> up

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
obviously the back old bands picked up

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.890 
obviously the back old bands picked up
but<00:01:12.230> look<00:01:12.620> what<00:01:12.740> we<00:01:12.830> got<00:01:12.860> going<00:01:13.220> on<00:01:13.310> here<00:01:13.900> about

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
but look what we got going on here about

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.740 
but look what we got going on here about

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
three coin styles all of a sudden which

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.330 
three coin styles all of a sudden which
is<00:01:17.960> pretty<00:01:18.170> crazy<00:01:18.440> I'm<00:01:18.860> sure<00:01:19.040> that's<00:01:19.250> not

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
is pretty crazy I'm sure that's not

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.450 
is pretty crazy I'm sure that's not
intended<00:01:19.940> I<00:01:22.210> mean<00:01:23.290> I<00:01:24.290> mean<00:01:24.650> I'm<00:01:25.040> not<00:01:25.250> really

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.830 
intended I mean I mean I'm not really
sure<00:01:25.550> how<00:01:25.790> this<00:01:25.940> is<00:01:26.000> possible<00:01:26.240> but<00:01:26.690> we're

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
sure how this is possible but we're

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.660 
sure how this is possible but we're
going<00:01:26.930> to<00:01:26.990> do<00:01:27.110> again

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.280 

let's<00:01:31.360> check<00:01:31.540> the<00:01:31.659> alchemy<00:01:32.049> bag<00:01:32.259> and<00:01:34.290> it

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
let's check the alchemy bag and it

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.780 
let's check the alchemy bag and it
didn't<00:01:35.799> quite<00:01:35.979> do<00:01:36.220> the<00:01:36.310> same<00:01:36.490> thing<00:01:36.670> as<00:01:36.759> last

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
didn't quite do the same thing as last

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.240 
didn't quite do the same thing as last
time<00:01:37.060> as<00:01:37.330> you<00:01:37.420> can<00:01:37.509> see<00:01:37.689> about<00:01:37.960> four<00:01:38.320> Klein

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
time as you can see about four Klein

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.420 
time as you can see about four Klein
stardrives<00:01:39.850> here<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:41.320> course<00:01:41.470> four<00:01:42.100> of<00:01:42.220> those

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
stardrives here of course four of those

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.260 
stardrives here of course four of those
will<00:01:42.880> convert<00:01:43.390> up<00:01:43.659> to<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:45.580> next<00:01:45.790> ten<00:01:46.030> of

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
will convert up to the next ten of

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.910 
will convert up to the next ten of
cleanser<00:01:49.270> which<00:01:49.960> as<00:01:50.289> you<00:01:50.500> see<00:01:50.740> here<00:01:51.039> is<00:01:52.920> the

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
cleanser which as you see here is the

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.920 
cleanser which as you see here is the
thea<00:01:54.159> ha<00:01:55.030> Fatiha<00:01:56.729> let's<00:01:57.729> do<00:01:57.880> it<00:01:57.970> again<00:01:58.030> this

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
thea ha Fatiha let's do it again this

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.950 
thea ha Fatiha let's do it again this
time<00:02:00.060> for<00:02:01.060> out<00:02:01.619> now<00:02:02.619> it<00:02:02.770> doesn't<00:02:03.009> always<00:02:03.130> work

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
time for out now it doesn't always work

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.340 
time for out now it doesn't always work
maybe<00:02:04.960> i<00:02:05.050> will<00:02:05.200> try<00:02:05.890> it<00:02:05.950> this<00:02:06.220> way<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.890> again

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
maybe i will try it this way and again

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:17.220 
maybe i will try it this way and again
this<00:02:11.350> time<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:13.720> let's<00:02:14.049> try<00:02:14.230> again<00:02:14.410> I<00:02:16.230> think

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
this time and let's try again I think

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.400 
this time and let's try again I think
that<00:02:17.440> all<00:02:17.620> tear<00:02:18.310> their<00:02:18.549> means<00:02:18.790> yep<00:02:19.350> two<00:02:20.350> of

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
that all tear their means yep two of

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:28.970 
that all tear their means yep two of
them<00:02:20.549> and<00:02:24.510> just<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.690> bash<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.500> point<00:02:26.739> home

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.910 

four<00:02:29.980> of<00:02:30.100> them<00:02:30.360> so<00:02:31.360> i've<00:02:31.840> got<00:02:32.049> for<00:02:32.290> now<00:02:32.319> which

four of them so i've got for now which

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:41.699 
four of them so i've got for now which
means<00:02:33.130> i<00:02:33.959> can<00:02:34.959> now<00:02:35.790> make<00:02:36.790> my<00:02:38.970> sphere<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:41.440> does

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
means i can now make my sphere it does
