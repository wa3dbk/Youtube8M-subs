I<00:02:35.269> mean<00:02:35.540> I<00:02:35.660> think<00:02:35.720> it's<00:02:35.989> pretty<00:02:36.170> pretty

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
I mean I think it's pretty pretty

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.740 
I mean I think it's pretty pretty
obvious<00:02:37.609> that<00:02:37.760> it<00:02:37.910> is<00:02:38.030> to<00:02:38.269> be<00:02:38.299> perfectly

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
obvious that it is to be perfectly

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.460

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.780 
honest with you but again that's not
