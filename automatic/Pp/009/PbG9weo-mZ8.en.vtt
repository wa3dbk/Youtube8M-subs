00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.990
 after all 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.280
 Hello, recently we bought ourselves 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.470
 coils for second feeder rods and 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.510
 Now I will do a little review and 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.970
 I will tell about the main technical 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.380
 the characteristics of this coil 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.779
 since these coils are completely 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.230
 same one we put aside a 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.360
 let's see the second one so this coil is from 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.700
 companies flagship i called she 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.290
 squadron feeder coil data 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.489
 Available in four sizes 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.950
 these are three thousand 4000 5 6000 since these 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.960
 reels we took for feeder rods 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.190
 class extra chemist we have the largest 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.650
 size 6 thousand this coil has 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.080
 gear ratio 5 five to one and in 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.380
 it has 4 bearings + 1 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:01:00.250
 needle bearing for full coupling 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:02.579
 opening our box here we are right away 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.199
 see additional graphite spool 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.439
 As a rule, these spools are used for 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.479
 a lot of mono, as you can see 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:13.439
 it is quite roomy here too 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:16.899
 written forest capacity here for example 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:21.290
 fishing line with a diameter of 0 35 millimeters here 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:24.620
 you can wind 300 meters 0 4 millimeters 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.710
 230 meters and 0 45 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.530
 millimeters can be wound here 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:34.720
 160 meters put off this spool in 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:38.690
 side and continue to watch the coil 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:44.690
 get the coil out of the gum box 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:47.290
 packed in a bag and here is a bag 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.760
 this in order to be able to her 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:57.080
 transport store and not 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:02:00.759
 scratch here is such a coil 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.759
 pretty pretty 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.470
 in this coil immediately want to note 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.940
 Here the aluminum spool Well firstly 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.370
 because it's a school 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.450
 low profile we can reel here 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.180
 cord without b-king 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.110
 and secondly on this spool are two 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.390
 metal clips here but faces here 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.959
 the second clip due to the presence of two 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.840
 clips 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.830
 we can simultaneously clip poke on 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.900
 several distances it is very convenient 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.220
 look further 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.230
 the friction in this front coil 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.610
 it works quite smoothly 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.040
 you can easily do it 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:47.489
 adjust the note which load us 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:51.069
 it is necessary in general an hour and it works fine 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.959
 now see the bow well friend here 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.920
 Made pretty from fat 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:59.920
 the wire is very powerful massive 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.709
 leans back quite clearly that is when 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.130
 casting it is unlikely to come off 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:08.170
 independently also works gorgeous in 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.700
 roller here are ball 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:16.420
 the bearing seems to be with this part all 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:20.910
 I now look at the handle the handle is made 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:23.920
 from metal and knob here from neoprene 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.900
 very comfortable in the hand and true 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.880
 only that such material is more likely 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.950
 all will get dirty when working with 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.840
 prikormkoy I think it 's not scary 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:38.410
 especially as far as I know he was washing too 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.580
 it is not difficult which is why it can not be 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.170
 think 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:48.090
 such a strong drawback stopper here 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.090
 instant at all without backlash 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:04:02.069
 with a stopper here are no questions also 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:05.640
 no, what else, in principle, on the outside 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:10.319
 I mean, I showed everything in one turn. 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.090
 coil exhausting 1 meter of cord 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:21.829
 very comfortable especially when fishing on 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:21.829
 long distances the course is quite smooth 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:39.460
 And finally, let's see what weight 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:45.640
 our coils take scales and lay on them 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:48.220
 coil weight 420 I think that for coil 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.500
 this size is quite reasonable 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.340
 adequate weight and this is how it turned out 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.850
 overview 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:58.150
 In principle, the first impression is pretty 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:01.140
 I liked the positive coil 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.790
 it remains only to check it on fishing 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.740
