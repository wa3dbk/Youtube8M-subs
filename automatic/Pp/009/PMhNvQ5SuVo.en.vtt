00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.920 
one right now I think they have the same
properties<00:01:05.790> as<00:01:05.970> chickens<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.600> like<00:01:06.750> if<00:01:06.900> you

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
properties as chickens so like if you

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.230 
properties as chickens so like if you
hit<00:01:07.110> them<00:01:07.260> they<00:01:07.560> fly<00:01:08.460> down<00:01:08.640> slowly<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.180> they

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
hit them they fly down slowly and they

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.270 
hit them they fly down slowly and they
make<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.510> chicken<00:01:09.720> sounds<00:01:10.439> which<00:01:11.070> is

make the chicken sounds which is

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.219 
make the chicken sounds which is
something<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.880> improve<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.420> later<00:01:12.750> for<00:01:13.110> the
