each<00:01:29.320> of<00:01:29.530> these<00:01:29.620> four<00:01:29.890> races

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.820 

and<00:01:46.330> as<00:01:46.450> you<00:01:46.570> can<00:01:46.750> see<00:01:48.960> like<00:01:49.960> cosmically<00:01:50.590> he's

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
and as you can see like cosmically he's

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.280 
and as you can see like cosmically he's
right<00:01:51.280> Anna<00:01:52.240> Manson<00:01:54.060> Mario's<00:01:55.060> just<00:01:55.600> getting

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
right Anna Manson Mario's just getting

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
to this point pretty insane and these

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.830 
to this point pretty insane and these
races<00:02:04.630> are<00:02:04.780> reason<00:02:05.970> why<00:02:06.970> most<00:02:07.210> people<00:02:07.660> that

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
races are reason why most people that

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.320 
races are reason why most people that
leave<00:02:08.050> no<00:02:08.530> one's<00:02:08.770> even<00:02:09.450> grand<00:02:10.450> finale<00:02:10.780> out

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
leave no one's even grand finale out

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.570 
leave no one's even grand finale out

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
look how far cosmic Mario still is down

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.860 
look how far cosmic Mario still is down
on<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.850> course<00:02:21.060> it's<00:02:22.060> like<00:02:22.210> almost<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:22.660> 10

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
on the course it's like almost a 10

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.710 
on the course it's like almost a 10
second<00:02:23.290> difference<00:02:24.210> and<00:02:25.210> of<00:02:25.330> course<00:02:25.570> this

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
second difference and of course this

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.680 
second difference and of course this
short<00:02:26.020> that's<00:02:26.200> a<00:02:26.290> lot<00:02:26.380> of<00:02:26.410> time
