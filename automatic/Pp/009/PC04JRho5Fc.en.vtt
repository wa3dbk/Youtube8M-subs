anywhere but I know what's in my room so
I<00:00:17.699> don't<00:00:17.880> want<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.060> buy<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.180> new<00:00:18.420> one<00:00:18.570> but<00:00:19.380> i've

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
I don't want to buy a new one but i've

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.960 
I don't want to buy a new one but i've
just<00:00:19.680> been<00:00:19.800> searching<00:00:19.859> for<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.670> i<00:00:20.730> can't

find it so eventually i guess that i
really<00:00:23.550> can't<00:00:23.730> find<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.269> i'll<00:00:24.390> have<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.869> do

really can't find it i'll have to do

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.810 
really can't find it i'll have to do
that<00:00:25.230> but<00:00:25.380> it's<00:00:25.560> just<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:26.070> don't<00:00:26.490> feel<00:00:26.699> like

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
that but it's just I don't feel like

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.400 
that but it's just I don't feel like
going<00:00:27.119> up<00:00:27.240> money<00:00:27.599> um<00:00:27.990> if<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:29.220> have<00:00:29.490> one<00:00:29.840> so<00:00:30.840> for
