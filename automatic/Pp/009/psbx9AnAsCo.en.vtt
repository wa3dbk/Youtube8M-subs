00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.770
 the intervals apart in 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.169
 graphic representations also those 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:12.030
 we can represent by equations 

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:14.670
 in which the X appears 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.880
 we take the first example from before to 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.740
 minus 25 that was this interval with the 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.740
 ends not including 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.900
 and the numbers 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.190
 that belong to this interval are 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:35.020
 these who are here in the middle between the 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:37.300
 minus 2 and 5 therefore the X in 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.030
 this first interval can be less 1 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.680
 can be 0 x can be equal to 1 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.870
 matched to any number there 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.730
 here 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.649
 therefore we start looking always 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:52.129
 on the left the X with respect to 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.129
 minus 2 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:59.920
 it will always be according to this interval 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:03.829
 greater therefore the symbol of greater 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:08.530
 is this that we have here 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:11.880
 x greater than minus 2 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.880
 and with respect to 5 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:19.570
 the X is always going to be smaller 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:23.140
 small can be 4 can be 3 can 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:26.560
 be 2 but it can not be 6 therefore 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:32.110
 the x will be less 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:36.880
 of 5 to not get involved and we cover it x 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:40.030
 is smaller than 5 if you look at the x 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:44.950
 is smaller and with respect to at least 2 the 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.860
 x is larger therefore x greater than 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.320
 minus 2 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.320
 as the ends were open and not 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.750
 they are included we do not put any symbol 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.340
 below as we will see in the next 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.469
 example 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.259
 the X is also between two numbers 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.259
 between 1 and 7 therefore 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.649
 1x 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.459
 and 7 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:17.739
 and we look at the ends we start with the 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:20.110
 1 on 1 we said that the X will have 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:23.900
 to be bigger than one because it's going 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.980
 to the right therefore 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.260
 the mouth in this sense 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.900
 and regarding 7 what is this point that 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.510
 we have here the X is smaller 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.170
 because it can be 6 can be 5 that are 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:42.850
 smaller than 7 but can not be 8 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:47.440
 therefore the X will be 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:50.080
 smaller than 7 but eye like 7 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.130
 was included the X can also be 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.170
 be equal to 7 and that is indicated 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.080
 with this stick under the symbol 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.170
 earlier so that we are now 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:07.570
 saying that the X may be smaller or 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:10.770
 same as 7 the X can be smaller or 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:14.580
 same as 7 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:18.420
 the final equation would be this x is greater 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:21.080
 that 1 and less than or equal to 7 are all 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.800
 these numbers here 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.900
 with the third example here the X and 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.780
 it's not between two numbers but it's going 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.270
 from zero to infinity 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.870
 Thus 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.870
 we will only compare the X with the zero 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:44.030
 about zero the X as it goes towards 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.770
 the right is greater because it can be one 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.430
 can be two can be three four 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.800
 five will always be bigger than zero 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.040
 therefore how the X can be more 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.040
 big 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.830
 we put this symbol and remember that as 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.069
 the 0 was included because there was a 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:06.970
 clau dator and there was a point we have to 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:12.880
 put the symbol of the equal so that 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:16.269
 the X is greater than or equal to 0 and are 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:20.859
 all these numbers of the interval 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:23.860
 and in the last example the same goes from 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:29.460
 the least infinite up to 2 so 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.460
 we only have one number x and 2 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:42.490
 in this case the X with respect to the 2nd of 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:45.690
 be smaller than 2 the X can be 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.520
 0 can be less 5 can be less 100 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.560
 therefore as the x has to be more 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.520
 little 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:57.730
 we put this symbol and since 2 is not 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.280
 included we do not put the symbol of the equal 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:04.570
 so that this would be the equation x 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:08.850
 is smaller than 2 being all these 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.850
 interval numbers
