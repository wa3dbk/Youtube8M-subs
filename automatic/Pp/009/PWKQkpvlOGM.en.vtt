00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello everyone and welcome to my 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.340
 the channel today I want to show you how 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.340
 make spring pendant in technique 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.340
 filigree 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.330
 I took the finished blank for the pendant 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.199
 I take fimo gel and lubricate their surface 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.300
 inside 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.130
 so that we have plastic well 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.180
 stuck after baking 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:31.830
 Now I take the burgundy plastic and 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:35.040
 completely filling the whole foundation with it now 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.160
 take a piece of cloth and start sealing 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.250
 texture set give plastic good 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.559
 I press the fabric with my finger and help myself 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.610
 so that the repeat happened 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.610
 more beautiful and more interesting 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.490
 Well, now you can start creating 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.460
 pattern on the pendant I take beige 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.170
 plastic I roll it into a sausage so that 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.710
 one edge was sharp 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.380
 and the other blunt sharp is the top of the tree 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.720
 stupid this ground now I ride 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.580
 slender flagella of which form 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.320
 little children 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.370
 You can do as many branches as you like. 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.470
 a couple of things I chose two branches and 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:32.650
 these girls added one more 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:35.350
 a tiny little twig is good 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.920
 press your fingers to the base so that they 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.920
 don't fall off 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.840
 tree color you can choose any peace 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.050
 you want it can be beige 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.850
 white and gray and brown but i 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.850
 stopped at such a color combination 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.030
 now we add to our tree 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.250
 leaflets for leaflets I use everything 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.430
 the colors you saw at the beginning of the video 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.280
 but I mix with white to make them 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:31.260
 delicate beautiful skate small balls 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:34.140
 and with a needle I push them through the center and 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.660
 so i attach them to the base 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.070
 as it happens on our 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.630
 leaflets have lived to the central 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.860
 I decided to make a green bird 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.330
 colors i said a bit 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.950
 flattening out not to be flat and 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.580
 now bend the edges 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.710
 I do a tail and beak again you 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.410
 showing a drop and flattened on 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:02.280
 fingers are pulled out big beak and 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:05.600
 also the tail is now seated bird 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.600
 wherever we want 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:13.840
 I paint bird eyes and 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:16.330
 also draw a wing and now i'm 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.370
 I continue to make out my base 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.930
 bright multi-colored leaves 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.670
 arranging them in a chaotic manner not 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.740
 be sure to have them around 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.430
 look too much wood 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.860
 the basics 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.739
 there is not much left empty 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:39.270
 spaces also a couple of leaves i 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.270
 add near the tree trunk 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.760
 and when the whole picture is ready I send 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:16.430
 pendant baked in the oven when 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.430
 temperature 110 degrees for half an hour 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.740
 st he turned out very gentle interesting
