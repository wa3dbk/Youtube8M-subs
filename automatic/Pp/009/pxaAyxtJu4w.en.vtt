00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
to treat her differently because she's

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.400

but the rushed pacing of it makes it

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.970 
but the rushed pacing of it makes it

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
here and leaves it much more open to

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.460 
here and leaves it much more open to
question<00:03:13.030> whether<00:03:13.180> he's<00:03:13.420> actually<00:03:13.690> reformed

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
question whether he's actually reformed

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.440 
question whether he's actually reformed
which<00:03:14.770> is<00:03:14.890> great<00:03:15.220> for<00:03:15.490> his<00:03:15.610> character<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:16.270> to

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
which is great for his character and to

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.940

discord planting the seeds for his

discord planting the seeds for his
takeover<00:03:32.950> but<00:03:33.340> it<00:03:33.460> was<00:03:33.550> very<00:03:33.760> subtle<00:03:34.060> and<00:03:34.240> you

takeover but it was very subtle and you

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.300 
takeover but it was very subtle and you
had<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:34.690> really<00:03:34.900> be<00:03:35.050> paying<00:03:35.380> attention<00:03:35.560> now<00:03:36.280> a

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
had to really be paying attention now a

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.460 
had to really be paying attention now a
couple<00:03:36.760> more<00:03:36.880> random<00:03:37.240> observations<00:03:37.840> one<00:03:38.380> of

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
couple more random observations one of

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.230 
couple more random observations one of
the<00:03:38.560> show<00:03:38.740> staff<00:03:38.980> tweeted<00:03:39.460> that<00:03:39.490> she<00:03:39.670> seems<00:03:40.060> to

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
the show staff tweeted that she seems to

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.700 
the show staff tweeted that she seems to
fly<00:03:40.420> better<00:03:40.690> when<00:03:40.870> she's<00:03:41.020> not<00:03:41.140> overthinking

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.710 
fly better when she's not overthinking

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.590 
fly better when she's not overthinking
it<00:03:41.890> and<00:03:42.280> I<00:03:42.430> liked<00:03:42.640> this<00:03:42.790> concept<00:03:43.330> since

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
it and I liked this concept since

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.450 
it and I liked this concept since
Twilight<00:03:43.780> overthinks<00:03:44.350> everything<00:03:44.440> even<00:03:45.250> more

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.460 
Twilight overthinks everything even more

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.700 
Twilight overthinks everything even more
I<00:03:45.640> like<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:45.970> idea<00:03:46.150> that<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:47.080> more<00:03:47.200> she<00:03:47.380> loses

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:47.710 
I like the idea that the more she loses

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.680 
I like the idea that the more she loses
control<00:03:47.920> her<00:03:48.310> composure<00:03:48.700> and<00:03:49.000> stress<00:03:49.360> the

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
control her composure and stress the

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.630 
control her composure and stress the
more<00:03:49.840> she<00:03:49.990> loses<00:03:50.260> control<00:03:50.440> over<00:03:50.770> wings<00:03:50.950> I<00:03:51.340> hope

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
more she loses control over wings I hope

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.070 
more she loses control over wings I hope
we<00:03:51.700> get<00:03:51.820> to<00:03:51.940> see<00:03:52.090> a<00:03:52.120> little<00:03:52.300> more<00:03:52.480> of<00:03:52.720> this

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
we get to see a little more of this

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.170 
we get to see a little more of this
if<00:03:53.140> the<00:03:53.590> Summer<00:03:53.800> Sun<00:03:54.010> celebration<00:03:54.190> is<00:03:54.700> now<00:03:54.880> and

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.490 
if the Summer Sun celebration is now and
it<00:03:55.420> sounds<00:03:55.630> like<00:03:55.690> it's<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:55.990> first<00:03:56.170> one<00:03:56.350> since

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
it sounds like it's the first one since

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.199 
it sounds like it's the first one since
Linda's<00:03:56.830> return<00:03:57.160> does<00:03:57.670> that<00:03:57.820> mean<00:03:57.970> that<00:03:58.090> the

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
Linda's return does that mean that the

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:59.790 
Linda's return does that mean that the
timeline<00:03:58.480> since<00:03:58.959> the<00:03:59.050> pilot<00:03:59.350> has<00:03:59.470> been<00:03:59.500> one
