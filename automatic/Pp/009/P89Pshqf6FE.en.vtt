00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello friends let's start today 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.540
 release of 3dnews daily with news from 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.880
 mountain view 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.920
 September 15th at noon google will hold 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.509
 press conference in india most likely 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.610
 we are waiting for the first demonstration 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.920
 commercial fruit project android one 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.949
 under which the corporation is planning 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.730
 bring to emerging markets 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:23.100
 standardized hardware platform 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.810
 for budget smartphones details 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.910
 will be announced closer to the date so 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:32.160
 follow the news on 3dnews.ru 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.260
 while on earth there are announcements on Mars 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.510
 the old man oppositiony prepare for 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.730
 reformatting an elderly steel rover 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.200
 let it down electronic brains scientists 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.600
 believe that the reason lies in 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.360
 flash memory worn out over 10 years 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.039
 intensive use however in NASA 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.289
 even glad to have encountered such 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.120
 a problem and in fact an opportunit run 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.629
 with a three-month life expectancy 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.399
 cycle 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.469
 no one hoped that he would succeed 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.149
 last forty-odd times longer 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.399
 you are his predecessor 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.770
 before showed himself to be such a fighter of his 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.170
 sent to the red planet in 2003 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.960
 and the farewell session took place in 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.549
 2010 operators will launch the process 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.390
 backup memory 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.830
 Opportunity 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.930
 and then give the command to 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.909
 formatting after this rover is still 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.580
 will show caressed to us at the press salagi 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.619
 curiosity who's on mars main later 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.600
 decade he can still take a punch 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.950
 severe winters and ruthless winds 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.049
 far planet 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.969
 from space exploration we go to 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.780
 more pressing issues such as wai 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:30.789
 file router 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.579
 in your apartment which is not evil 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.020
 can normally finish up the toilet solution 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.090
 this problem needs to be approached 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.789
 exclusively from the scientific side that 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.590
 did a physicist graduate student jason coffin he 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.630
 made a map of their apartments and 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.759
 appropriated the walls necessary indicators 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.799
 refraction then modeled 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.110
 electromagnetic wave propagation with 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.179
 using the Helmholtz equation Hall 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.979
 found out the obvious best bet 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.780
 router right in the center of the apartment 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.459
 However, this option did not suit him. 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.009
 so the second was found 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:01.299
 optimal device location 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.340
 many of those who read his work 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.020
 in favor of creating a web service 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.880
 which would allow effectively 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.560
 scatter the internet later 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.000
 at first call thought the idea 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.340
 impractical because of the huge 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.079
 the number of assumptions that are made in 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.760
 long settlement process 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:17.769
 data processing but in the end a physicist 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.140
 still released android application under 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.209
 called razor soldiers who can be 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.299
 buy google play for eighty three 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.079

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.079
 see you friends
