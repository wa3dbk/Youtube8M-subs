Judith<00:04:56.210> teleported<00:05:01.960> no<00:05:02.960> I<00:05:02.990> didn't<00:05:03.500> say<00:05:03.620> that

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:33.760 

supply<00:05:24.260> is<00:05:24.320> running<00:05:24.560> out<00:05:32.470> previously<00:05:33.470> came

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
supply is running out previously came

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.550 
supply is running out previously came
down<00:05:34.010> here<00:05:34.630> to<00:05:35.630> get<00:05:36.460> for<00:05:37.460> some<00:05:37.760> reason<00:05:38.510> no<00:05:39.350> one

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
down here to get for some reason no one

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.880 
down here to get for some reason no one
can<00:05:39.860> figure<00:05:40.250> out<00:05:40.460> but<00:05:41.330> that's<00:05:41.630> okay<00:05:42.230> we'll

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:42.890 
can figure out but that's okay we'll

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:59.650 
can figure out but that's okay we'll
just<00:05:43.190> do<00:05:43.520> it<00:05:43.550> anyways<00:05:55.030> back<00:05:57.970> yeah<00:05:58.970> that's<00:05:59.360> even

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660 
just do it anyways back yeah that's even

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.730 
just do it anyways back yeah that's even
better<00:05:59.780> than<00:05:59.930> the<00:05:59.990> first<00:06:00.080> time<00:06:00.410> I<00:06:00.470> did<00:06:00.620> it

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
better than the first time I did it

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.050 
better than the first time I did it
except<00:06:01.160> for<00:06:01.190> the<00:06:01.340> percent<00:06:02.890> all<00:06:03.890> right<00:06:04.100> then<00:06:04.370> I

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
except for the percent all right then I

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.270 
except for the percent all right then I
guess<00:06:06.020> I'm<00:06:06.350> going<00:06:06.560> to<00:06:06.650> cut<00:06:06.800> it<00:06:06.890> there<00:06:07.040> for<00:06:07.070> now

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
guess I'm going to cut it there for now

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.210 
guess I'm going to cut it there for now
later
