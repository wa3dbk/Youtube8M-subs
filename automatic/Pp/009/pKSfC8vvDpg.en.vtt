00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:42.599 
or probably lunch right now
I<00:01:39.479> think<00:01:40.479> I<00:01:40.630> always<00:01:40.840> give<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.920> people<00:01:42.159> to<00:01:42.490> the

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:42.609 
I think I always give the people to the

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:45.590 
I think I always give the people to the
right<00:01:42.789> to<00:01:43.090> give<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.299> right<00:01:43.630> away

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
right to give the right away

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.429 
right to give the right away
that's<00:01:46.600> what<00:01:46.780> I<00:01:46.960> feel

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:02:01.570 

sometimes<00:01:51.439> well<00:01:52.250> not<00:01:52.460> sometimes<00:01:52.939> I<00:01:53.210> do

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.970 

not<00:02:02.580> I<00:02:03.180> think<00:02:03.750> they<00:02:03.840> probably<00:02:04.020> sell<00:02:04.440> it<00:02:04.590> by<00:02:04.740> now

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
not I think they probably sell it by now

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.160 
not I think they probably sell it by now
but<00:02:05.010> no<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.670> wouldn't<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.390> car<00:02:06.690> when<00:02:06.870> I<00:02:06.960> go

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
but no I wouldn't have a car when I go

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.200 
but no I wouldn't have a car when I go
back<00:02:07.380> home<00:02:07.590> but<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:08.190> think<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.670> would<00:02:08.790> be<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:08.970> lot

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
back home but I think it would be a lot

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.390 
back home but I think it would be a lot
easier<00:02:09.240> for<00:02:09.660> me<00:02:09.960> to<00:02:09.990> just<00:02:10.320> go<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.800> get<00:02:11.010> one<00:02:11.370> of

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
easier for me to just go and get one of

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.430 
easier for me to just go and get one of
my<00:02:11.610> friend's<00:02:11.970> car<00:02:12.210> just<00:02:12.540> driving<00:02:12.990> around

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
my friend's car just driving around

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.089 
my friend's car just driving around
legally

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.709 

I<00:02:20.129> like<00:02:20.790> that<00:02:21.120> one<00:02:21.349> but<00:02:22.349> I<00:02:22.769> like<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.719> hummers

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:24.719 
I like that one but I like the hummers

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:34.430 
I like that one but I like the hummers
low<00:02:25.230> but<00:02:26.219> my<00:02:26.400> ideal<00:02:27.000> car<00:02:27.329> would<00:02:27.569> be<00:02:27.750> an<00:02:28.019> old

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.510 

I<00:02:34.500> thought

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
I thought

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:44.410 
I thought
