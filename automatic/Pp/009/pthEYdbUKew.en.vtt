so<00:00:00.810> this<00:00:01.110> is<00:00:01.260> the<00:00:01.469> geogebra<00:00:02.220> iPad<00:00:02.760> app<00:00:03.060> and<00:00:03.480> as

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
so this is the geogebra iPad app and as

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.930 
so this is the geogebra iPad app and as
you<00:00:04.110> can<00:00:04.259> see<00:00:04.470> when<00:00:04.710> you<00:00:04.799> start<00:00:05.130> it<00:00:05.250> up<00:00:05.370> you<00:00:05.759> get

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
you can see when you start it up you get

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.770 
you can see when you start it up you get

down<00:00:23.760> in<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:23.970> lower<00:00:24.119> left<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.570> can<00:00:24.720> see

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
down in the lower left you can see

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.259 
down in the lower left you can see
there's<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.140> little<00:00:25.310> finger<00:00:26.310> tool<00:00:26.519> basically

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
there's a little finger tool basically

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.960 
there's a little finger tool basically
that<00:00:27.689> allows<00:00:27.990> us<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.470> use<00:00:28.890> our<00:00:29.070> finger<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.760> move

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
that allows us to use our finger to move

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.229 
that allows us to use our finger to move
the<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.510> graphing<00:00:31.289> window<00:00:31.320> around<00:00:32.210> so<00:00:33.210> that

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
the the graphing window around so that

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.340 
the the graphing window around so that
we<00:00:33.510> can<00:00:33.719> see<00:00:34.410> coordinates<00:00:35.010> if<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.790> want<00:00:36.000> to

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
we can see coordinates if you want to

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.110 
we can see coordinates if you want to
have<00:00:37.350> graph<00:00:37.590> paper<00:00:37.860> or<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.160> grid<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.790> the

in the upper left corner there that

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.299 
in the upper left corner there that
turns<00:00:42.660> on<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.020> grid<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.469> like<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.070> have<00:00:44.190> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
turns on the grid I like to have the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.369 
turns on the grid I like to have the
grid<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.300> want<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.840> do<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.140> when

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
grid on so I want you to do that when

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.250 
grid on so I want you to do that when
you<00:00:46.590> make<00:00:46.800> your<00:00:47.010> graphs<00:00:47.899> there's<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.960> side

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
you make your graphs there's a side

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.340 
you make your graphs there's a side
window<00:00:49.680> here<00:00:50.039> which<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:51.120> can<00:00:51.300> we<00:00:51.719> can<00:00:51.870> tap<00:00:52.110> on

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
window here which we can we can tap on

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.630 
window here which we can we can tap on
and<00:00:52.559> make<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.710> go<00:00:52.949> away<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.219> we<00:00:53.489> get<00:00:53.610> a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
and make it go away so we get a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.430 
and make it go away so we get a
full-screen<00:00:54.149> graph<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.140> what<00:00:55.289> we're

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
full-screen graph so this is what we're

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.910 
full-screen graph so this is what we're
shooting<00:00:55.590> for<00:00:57.020> now<00:00:58.020> our<00:00:58.050> goal<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.590> going<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.800> be

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
shooting for now our goal is going to be

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.389 
shooting for now our goal is going to be
to<00:00:59.129> graph<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.550> line<00:01:00.020> and<00:01:01.020> have<00:01:01.350> geogebra<00:01:02.129> tell

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
to graph a line and have geogebra tell

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.119 
to graph a line and have geogebra tell
us<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.730> slope<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.300> then<00:01:04.170> also<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.589> change<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
us the slope and then also to change the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.219 
us the slope and then also to change the
name<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.640> document<00:01:06.210> from<00:01:06.360> untitled<00:01:07.020> to

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
name of this document from untitled to

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.730 
name of this document from untitled to
something<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.740> we<00:01:08.580> recognize<00:01:09.290> so<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.560> is

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
something that we recognize so that is

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.190 
something that we recognize so that is
very<00:01:11.040> easy<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.670> do<00:01:11.880> all<00:01:12.090> those<00:01:12.330> objectives<00:01:13.080> are

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
very easy to do all those objectives are

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.580 
very easy to do all those objectives are
easy<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.619> achieve<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.369> first<00:01:14.610> one<00:01:15.229> to<00:01:16.229> graph<00:01:16.439> a

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
easy to achieve the first one to graph a

function we simply go down to the input

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.140 
function we simply go down to the input
bar<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.689> we<00:01:21.840> tap<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.530> when<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.490> do<00:01:23.640> that

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
bar and we tap and when you do that

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.230 
bar and we tap and when you do that
the<00:01:24.930> input<00:01:25.350> bar<00:01:25.530> window<00:01:26.340> pops<00:01:26.759> up<00:01:26.939> along<00:01:27.210> with

the input bar window pops up along with
a<00:01:27.390> keyboard<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.530> we<00:01:28.710> are<00:01:28.799> able<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.040> type<00:01:29.340> in

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
a keyboard and we are able to type in

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.370 
a keyboard and we are able to type in
our<00:01:29.670> equation<00:01:30.240> now<00:01:30.390> notice<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.020> little

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
our equation now notice in that little

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.380 
our equation now notice in that little
blue<00:01:31.619> input<00:01:32.130> bar<00:01:32.340> box<00:01:33.270> there<00:01:33.630> there<00:01:34.500> are<00:01:34.740> extra

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
blue input bar box there there are extra

blue input bar box there there are extra
keys<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.720> can<00:01:36.810> use<00:01:37.020> for<00:01:37.470> instance<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
keys that you can use for instance the

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.170 
keys that you can use for instance the
equals<00:01:38.250> sign<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.579> going<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.759> be<00:01:38.820> one<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.119> you

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
equals sign is going to be one that you

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.940 
equals sign is going to be one that you
want<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.450> have<00:01:39.540> handy<00:01:39.750> as<00:01:40.110> well<00:01:40.140> as<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.710> plus

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
want to have handy as well as the plus

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.800 
want to have handy as well as the plus
sign<00:01:41.930> squared<00:01:43.009> degrees<00:01:44.009> high<00:01:45.000> things<00:01:45.630> like

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
sign squared degrees high things like

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.770 
sign squared degrees high things like
that<00:01:46.490> so<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.520> want<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.820> type<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.149> y<00:01:48.329> equals<00:01:48.600> 2x

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
that so I want to type in y equals 2x

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.719 
that so I want to type in y equals 2x
plus<00:01:48.990> 1<00:01:49.380> that's<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.890> linear<00:01:50.070> function<00:01:50.610> that

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
plus 1 that's a linear function that

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.120 
plus 1 that's a linear function that
you're<00:01:50.850> familiar<00:01:51.060> with<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:52.500> i<00:01:52.530> type<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:52.950> y

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
you're familiar with and so i type in y

you<00:03:54.629> should<00:03:54.780> know<00:03:54.900> is<00:03:54.930> you<00:03:55.230> can<00:03:55.379> move<00:03:55.530> your

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
you should know is you can move your

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.119 
you should know is you can move your
line<00:03:55.889> around<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:57.440> if<00:03:58.440> you<00:03:58.560> can't<00:03:58.769> get<00:03:58.889> it<00:03:58.980> back

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
line around and if you can't get it back

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:00.619 
line around and if you can't get it back
exactly<00:03:59.310> where<00:03:59.699> it<00:03:59.760> was<00:03:59.879> you<00:04:00.090> tap<00:04:00.389> on<00:04:00.569> the

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
exactly where it was you tap on the

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.420 
exactly where it was you tap on the
equation<00:04:01.260> and<00:04:01.379> you<00:04:01.440> can<00:04:01.500> put<00:04:01.829> it<00:04:01.919> back<00:04:02.099> so<00:04:02.400> I

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
equation and you can put it back so I

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.599 
equation and you can put it back so I
tapped<00:04:02.819> on<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.180> equation<00:04:04.250> and<00:04:05.250> I'm<00:04:05.340> gonna<00:04:05.430> put

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
tapped on the equation and I'm gonna put

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.990 
tapped on the equation and I'm gonna put
it<00:04:05.699> back<00:04:05.730> where<00:04:06.000> it<00:04:06.060> was<00:04:06.560> nothing<00:04:07.560> like<00:04:08.000> making

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
it back where it was nothing like making

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.659 
it back where it was nothing like making
an<00:04:09.239> error<00:04:09.449> when<00:04:09.780> you<00:04:09.840> do<00:04:09.959> your<00:04:10.109> video<00:04:10.459> so<00:04:11.459> here

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:11.669 
an error when you do your video so here

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.420 
an error when you do your video so here
we<00:04:11.760> have<00:04:11.879> this<00:04:12.030> line<00:04:12.590> y<00:04:13.590> equals<00:04:13.829> 2x<00:04:13.949> plus<00:04:14.099> 1

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
we have this line y equals 2x plus 1

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.240 
we have this line y equals 2x plus 1
it's<00:04:14.669> got<00:04:14.819> a<00:04:14.849> label<00:04:15.090> it's<00:04:15.569> got<00:04:15.690> a<00:04:15.720> name<00:04:16.250> the

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
it's got a label it's got a name the

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.890 
it's got a label it's got a name the
last<00:04:17.459> thing<00:04:17.669> I<00:04:17.729> want<00:04:17.880> to<00:04:17.940> do<00:04:18.060> is<00:04:18.209> have<00:04:18.479> it<00:04:18.660> tell

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
last thing I want to do is have it tell

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.039 
last thing I want to do is have it tell
us<00:04:18.930> what<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.620> slope<00:04:19.859> of<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.099> line<00:04:20.250> is<00:04:20.539> now<00:04:21.539> you

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
us what the slope of the line is now you

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.690 
us what the slope of the line is now you
should<00:04:22.229> already<00:04:22.440> know<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.830> slope<00:04:23.039> is<00:04:23.219> 2<00:04:23.250> but<00:04:23.640> I

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
should already know the slope is 2 but I

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.219 
should already know the slope is 2 but I
want<00:04:23.880> to<00:04:23.940> show<00:04:24.090> you<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.330> slope<00:04:24.630> tool<00:04:24.840> because

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
want to show you the slope tool because

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.500 
want to show you the slope tool because
as<00:04:25.409> we<00:04:25.620> start<00:04:26.310> to<00:04:26.460> create<00:04:26.610> these

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
as we start to create these

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.460 
as we start to create these
different<00:04:29.120> geometric<00:04:30.120> shapes<00:04:30.420> with<00:04:31.170> geogebra

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
different geometric shapes with geogebra

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.100 
different geometric shapes with geogebra
we're<00:04:31.860> gonna<00:04:31.950> need<00:04:32.160> to<00:04:32.250> figure<00:04:32.460> out<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:32.640> slope

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
we're gonna need to figure out the slope

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.040 
we're gonna need to figure out the slope
so<00:04:34.110> down<00:04:34.920> in<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.190> lower<00:04:35.460> toolbar<00:04:36.270> there's<00:04:36.960> a

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
so down in the lower toolbar there's a

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.650 
so down in the lower toolbar there's a
little<00:04:37.410> angle<00:04:37.950> button<00:04:38.340> that<00:04:38.640> has<00:04:38.670> a<00:04:38.820> looks

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
little angle button that has a looks

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.240

like<00:04:39.780> a<00:04:39.810> letter<00:04:40.050> A<00:04:40.110> it's<00:04:40.410> actually<00:04:40.710> an<00:04:40.800> alpha

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
like a letter A it's actually an alpha

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.760 
like a letter A it's actually an alpha
and<00:04:41.400> an<00:04:42.330> angle<00:04:42.780> shaded<00:04:43.110> and<00:04:43.200> if<00:04:43.320> you<00:04:43.440> tap<00:04:43.740> that

with angles and the last one the fifth
button<00:04:48.690> there<00:04:48.870> is<00:04:49.230> a<00:04:49.620> little<00:04:49.980> rise<00:04:50.130> over<00:04:50.460> run

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
button there is a little rise over run

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.620 
button there is a little rise over run
tool<00:04:50.910> if<00:04:51.810> you<00:04:51.930> tap<00:04:52.170> that<00:04:52.440> and<00:04:53.240> then<00:04:54.240> you<00:04:54.390> tap

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
tool if you tap that and then you tap

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.060 
tool if you tap that and then you tap
the<00:04:54.810> line<00:04:55.020> that<00:04:55.260> you<00:04:55.350> want<00:04:55.530> to<00:04:55.650> know<00:04:55.740> the<00:04:55.860> slope

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
the line that you want to know the slope

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.920 
the line that you want to know the slope
of<00:04:56.280> it<00:04:56.520> will<00:04:56.790> put<00:04:56.940> the<00:04:57.030> rise<00:04:57.210> and<00:04:57.450> run<00:04:57.540> in<00:04:57.750> there

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
of it will put the rise and run in there

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.730 
of it will put the rise and run in there
for<00:04:58.140> you<00:04:58.290> in<00:04:58.470> this<00:04:58.920> case<00:04:59.190> M<00:04:59.430> equals<00:04:59.790> two<00:05:00.560> so<00:05:01.560> not

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
for you in this case M equals two so not

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.470 
for you in this case M equals two so not
only<00:05:02.040> can<00:05:02.190> we<00:05:02.250> have<00:05:02.490> it<00:05:02.610> graph<00:05:02.820> our<00:05:03.060> line<00:05:03.090> but

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
only can we have it graph our line but

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.210 
only can we have it graph our line but
we<00:05:03.570> can<00:05:03.720> have<00:05:03.870> it<00:05:03.990> tell<00:05:04.170> us<00:05:04.200> the<00:05:04.470> slope<00:05:04.710> that's

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
we can have it tell us the slope that's

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.730 
we can have it tell us the slope that's
going<00:05:05.430> to<00:05:05.490> be<00:05:05.580> important<00:05:06.120> as<00:05:06.290> we<00:05:07.290> do<00:05:07.410> a<00:05:07.440> few

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
going to be important as we do a few

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.440 
going to be important as we do a few
activities<00:05:08.280> that<00:05:08.610> have<00:05:08.790> to<00:05:08.940> do<00:05:09.060> with<00:05:09.270> the

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
activities that have to do with the

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.130 
activities that have to do with the
slopes<00:05:09.840> of<00:05:10.140> different<00:05:10.470> lines<00:05:11.750> the<00:05:12.750> last<00:05:12.900> thing

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
slopes of different lines the last thing

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.860 
slopes of different lines the last thing
I<00:05:13.200> want<00:05:13.380> to<00:05:13.440> show<00:05:13.650> you<00:05:13.710> before<00:05:14.640> I<00:05:14.880> end<00:05:15.330> the

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
video is how to change the name of this

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.730 
video is how to change the name of this
document<00:05:18.810> right<00:05:18.930> now<00:05:18.990> it's<00:05:19.260> called<00:05:19.440> untitled

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
document right now it's called untitled

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
document right now it's called untitled
one<00:05:20.540> which<00:05:21.540> is<00:05:21.690> not<00:05:21.840> very<00:05:22.050> creative<00:05:22.760> instead

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
one which is not very creative instead

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.460 
one which is not very creative instead
let<00:05:24.330> me<00:05:24.420> tap<00:05:24.750> on<00:05:24.990> the<00:05:25.140> name<00:05:25.320> and<00:05:27.020> the<00:05:28.020> Edit<00:05:28.320> box

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
let me tap on the name and the Edit box

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.310 
let me tap on the name and the Edit box
pops<00:05:28.860> up<00:05:29.130> and<00:05:29.340> I<00:05:29.400> can<00:05:29.610> type<00:05:29.880> in<00:05:30.180> a<00:05:30.450> new<00:05:30.810> name<00:05:30.840> for

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
pops up and I can type in a new name for

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.110 
pops up and I can type in a new name for
this<00:05:31.440> so<00:05:31.740> I'm<00:05:31.920> gonna<00:05:32.070> put<00:05:32.960> graphing<00:05:33.960> graphing

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
this so I'm gonna put graphing graphing

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:41.570 
this so I'm gonna put graphing graphing
a<00:05:38.300> line<00:05:39.410> put<00:05:40.410> spaces<00:05:40.650> in<00:05:40.860> if<00:05:41.040> you<00:05:41.160> want<00:05:41.370> but<00:05:41.550> I

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
a line put spaces in if you want but I

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.240 
a line put spaces in if you want but I
chose<00:05:41.850> not<00:05:41.910> to<00:05:42.590> and<00:05:43.590> when<00:05:43.830> I'm<00:05:43.920> done<00:05:44.070> I<00:05:44.130> just

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
chose not to and when I'm done I just
