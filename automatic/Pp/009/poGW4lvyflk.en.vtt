like this you know we're obviously
you're<00:01:08.860> super<00:01:09.280> conscious<00:01:09.820> of<00:01:10.000> how<00:01:10.150> you<00:01:10.210> know

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
you're super conscious of how you know

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:36.960 
you're super conscious of how you know
crisis<00:01:11.200> affected<00:01:11.740> you<00:01:11.860> know<00:01:11.950> consumers

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.460 

by<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.030> way<00:01:38.180> Taylor<00:01:38.210> your<00:01:38.690> titles<00:01:39.110> or<00:01:39.259> of<00:01:39.350> the

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
by the way Taylor your titles or of the

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.590 
by the way Taylor your titles or of the
technology<00:01:40.070> but<00:01:40.490> it'll<00:01:40.670> work<00:01:40.700> at<00:01:41.030> any<00:01:41.180> kind<00:01:41.540> of

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
technology but it'll work at any kind of

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.180 
technology but it'll work at any kind of
game<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:42.020> I<00:01:42.050> think<00:01:42.259> the<00:01:42.380> whole<00:01:42.530> thing<00:01:42.800> is<00:01:42.830> I

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
game and I think the whole thing is I

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.770 
game and I think the whole thing is I
mean<00:01:43.460> it<00:01:43.580> never<00:01:43.759> have<00:01:43.940> an<00:01:44.030> exact<00:01:44.300> ship<00:01:44.570> date

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
mean it never have an exact ship date

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.870 
mean it never have an exact ship date
saying<00:01:45.080> it

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
saying it

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.580 
saying it
it's<00:01:45.969> definitely<00:01:46.329> not<00:01:46.420> going<00:01:46.570> to<00:01:46.630> be<00:01:46.689> in<00:01:46.810> 2009

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
it's definitely not going to be in 2009

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.469 
it's definitely not going to be in 2009
I<00:01:47.619> know<00:01:47.920> that<00:01:48.280> but<00:01:48.520> you<00:01:48.700> know<00:01:48.729> anything<00:01:49.240> every

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
I know that but you know anything every

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.080 
I know that but you know anything every
tree<00:01:49.630> those<00:01:49.780> dining<00:01:50.259> so<00:01:51.130> it's<00:01:51.549> possible<00:01:51.759> to

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
tree those dining so it's possible to

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.420 
tree those dining so it's possible to
augment<00:01:52.420> uh<00:01:52.710> he's<00:01:53.710> possible<00:01:54.070> to<00:01:54.130> augment

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
augment uh he's possible to augment

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.960 
augment uh he's possible to augment
updated<00:01:54.909> kurogane<00:01:55.420> totally<00:01:56.229> for<00:01:57.039> now<00:01:57.189> it'll
