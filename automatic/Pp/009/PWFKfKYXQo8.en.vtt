00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
click on drop shadow make sure that box

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.499 
click on drop shadow make sure that box
is<00:01:12.330> checked<00:01:13.340> for<00:01:14.340> blend<00:01:14.549> mode<00:01:14.790> put<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.330> to

is checked for blend mode put that to

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.149 
is checked for blend mode put that to
normal<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.520> make<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.880> box<00:01:18.420> black<00:01:18.979> bring<00:01:19.979> down

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.460 
normal and make the box black bring down
the<00:01:20.310> opacity<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:21.210> about<00:01:21.330> fifty<00:01:21.810> percent<00:01:21.840> you

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
the opacity to about fifty percent you

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.609 
the opacity to about fifty percent you
can<00:01:22.619> play<00:01:22.920> around<00:01:23.040> with<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.460> however<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.939> like

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
can play around with it however you like

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.770 
can play around with it however you like
the<00:01:25.619> angle<00:01:25.799> pretty<00:01:26.520> much<00:01:26.700> just<00:01:26.970> up<00:01:27.299> into<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
the angle pretty much just up into the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.719 
the angle pretty much just up into the
left<00:01:27.990> doesn't<00:01:28.619> really<00:01:28.890> matter<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.400> too<00:01:29.579> much

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
left doesn't really matter to too much

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.960 
left doesn't really matter to too much
the<00:01:30.689> distance<00:01:31.140> put<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.590> between<00:01:31.710> bit<00:01:32.400> five<00:01:32.759> and

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
the distance put it between bit five and

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.130 
the distance put it between bit five and
seven<00:01:33.299> here<00:01:34.490> spread<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.640> zero<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.210> then<00:01:36.869> for

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
seven here spread is zero and then for

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.960 
seven here spread is zero and then for
size<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.799> would<00:01:37.860> put<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.280> between<00:01:38.400> five<00:01:38.939> and

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
size I would put it between five and

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.109 
size I would put it between five and
seven<00:01:39.450> again<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.009> then<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.640> should<00:01:41.939> be<00:01:42.090> all

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
seven again and then that should be all

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.200 
seven again and then that should be all
for<00:01:42.780> drop<00:01:43.110> shadow<00:01:43.520> then<00:01:44.520> after<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:44.970> you're

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
for drop shadow then after that you're

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.100 
for drop shadow then after that you're
going<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.390> go<00:01:45.570> down<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.810> inner<00:01:46.500> shadow<00:01:47.009> and

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
going to go down to inner shadow and

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.450 
going to go down to inner shadow and
you're<00:01:49.110> going<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.350> change<00:01:49.680> blend<00:01:50.159> mode<00:01:50.430> to

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
you're going to change blend mode to

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.289 
you're going to change blend mode to
overlay<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:52.009> change<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.250> white<00:01:53.549> this<00:01:53.970> box

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
overlay and change this white this box

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.969 
overlay and change this white this box
here<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.840> make<00:01:55.020> sure<00:01:55.049> it's<00:01:55.409> white<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:57.979> make

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
here and make sure it's white and make

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.560 
here and make sure it's white and make
the<00:01:59.159> angle<00:01:59.549> but<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.600> same<00:02:01.040> just<00:02:02.040> like<00:02:02.159> that

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
the angle but the same just like that

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.100 
the angle but the same just like that
then<00:02:03.570> for<00:02:04.409> distance<00:02:05.090> put<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.240> between<00:02:06.630> you

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
then for distance put that between you

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.249 
then for distance put that between you
know<00:02:07.229> 10<00:02:07.619> 11<00:02:08.220> 12<00:02:08.520> right<00:02:08.819> around<00:02:09.000> there<00:02:09.259> make

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
know 10 11 12 right around there make

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.850 
know 10 11 12 right around there make
choke<00:02:10.679> at<00:02:10.860> 0<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.660> size<00:02:12.660> at<00:02:12.959> six

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
choke at 0 and size at six

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.280
