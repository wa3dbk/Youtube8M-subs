00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
pretty high goal for me there's a lot of

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.980 
pretty high goal for me there's a lot of
really<00:02:36.220> good<00:02:36.310> riders<00:02:36.760> out<00:02:36.880> there<00:02:36.940> I<00:02:37.270> just<00:02:37.870> got

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
really good riders out there I just got

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.530 
really good riders out there I just got
to<00:02:38.950> see<00:02:39.460> if<00:02:39.520> I<00:02:39.580> can<00:02:39.700> lay<00:02:39.940> down<00:02:39.970> all<00:02:40.240> the<00:02:40.300> tricks

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
to see if I can lay down all the tricks

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.120 
to see if I can lay down all the tricks
that<00:02:40.660> can<00:02:40.960> do<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.500> keep<00:02:41.770> them<00:02:41.890> consistent<00:02:42.070> I

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
that can do and keep them consistent I

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.730 
that can do and keep them consistent I
think<00:02:45.130> one<00:02:45.640> of<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.790> main<00:02:46.260> factors<00:02:47.260> and

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
think one of the main factors and

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.260 
think one of the main factors and
snowboarding<00:02:48.220> is<00:02:48.340> to<00:02:48.640> ride<00:02:48.850> with<00:02:49.030> someone

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
snowboarding is to ride with someone
