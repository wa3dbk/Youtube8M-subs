experience yeah well first of all I see

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.900 
experience yeah well first of all I see
it<00:02:34.350> as<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.590> Monday<00:02:35.280> through<00:02:35.550> Sunday<00:02:35.730> night

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910

it as a Monday through Sunday night
dining<00:02:36.360> experience<00:02:37.020> I<00:02:37.140> think<00:02:37.350> everybody

dining experience I think everybody

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.310 
dining experience I think everybody
should<00:02:37.890> come<00:02:38.070> here<00:02:38.430> seven<00:02:39.300> days<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.480> week<00:02:39.720> okay

should come here seven days a week okay
but<00:02:40.500> that's<00:02:40.590> probably<00:02:40.800> not<00:02:41.100> likely<00:02:41.310> right<00:02:44.209> no

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
but that's probably not likely right no

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.530 
but that's probably not likely right no
I<00:02:45.240> think<00:02:45.450> you<00:02:46.230> know<00:02:46.350> I<00:02:46.380> think<00:02:46.620> that<00:02:47.540> we're

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.979 
to wine inexpensive wine expensive wine
and<00:03:06.480> so<00:03:07.370> what<00:03:08.370> I<00:03:08.400> say<00:03:08.970> that<00:03:09.239> that<00:03:09.540> this

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
and so what I say that that this

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.900 
and so what I say that that this
restaurant<00:03:10.470> will<00:03:10.709> have<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:10.920> kids<00:03:11.430> menu<00:03:11.610> that

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
has chicken fingers on it I think this

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.020 
has chicken fingers on it I think this
is<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.230> place<00:03:16.500> where<00:03:16.709> you<00:03:16.860> go<00:03:17.070> I<00:03:17.340> hope<00:03:17.760> it's<00:03:17.970> a
