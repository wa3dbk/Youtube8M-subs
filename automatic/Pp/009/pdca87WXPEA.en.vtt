I think for us to challenge for the
division<00:03:19.159> I<00:03:19.549> think<00:03:19.969> that's<00:03:20.180> reasonable<00:03:20.739> our

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
division I think that's reasonable our

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.199 
division I think that's reasonable our
goals<00:03:22.040> aren't<00:03:22.280> any<00:03:22.400> different<00:03:22.549> anybody<00:03:23.030> else

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:25.219 
is still in a Super Bowl which means to

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:26.920 
is still in a Super Bowl which means to
get<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.489> playoffs<00:03:25.700> which<00:03:25.999> means<00:03:26.239> you<00:03:26.389> won

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
get the playoffs which means you won

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.500 
get the playoffs which means you won
your<00:03:27.139> division<00:03:27.230> or<00:03:27.590> close<00:03:27.799> to<00:03:27.829> it<00:03:28.099> you<00:03:28.849> know<00:03:29.480> I

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
your division or close to it you know I

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.239
