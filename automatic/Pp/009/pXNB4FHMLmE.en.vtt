00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
in the bottom right hand corner just

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.479 
in the bottom right hand corner just
keep<00:00:39.579> out<00:00:39.730> of<00:00:39.850> sight<00:00:40.120> of<00:00:40.690> everybody<00:00:41.430> there<00:00:42.430> we

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
keep out of sight of everybody there we

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.010 
keep out of sight of everybody there we
go<00:00:42.610> maybe<00:00:42.880> I<00:00:43.000> could<00:00:43.180> have<00:00:43.300> done<00:00:43.329> with<00:00:43.930> this

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
go maybe I could have done with this

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.390 
go maybe I could have done with this
join<00:00:44.260> that<00:00:44.410> tree<00:00:44.650> but<00:00:44.890> it's<00:00:45.040> fine

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
join that tree but it's fine

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.280 
join that tree but it's fine
then<00:00:45.850> you<00:00:46.000> want<00:00:46.180> to<00:00:46.210> put<00:00:46.420> Archer<00:00:46.989> towers

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
then you want to put Archer towers

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.450 
then you want to put Archer towers
rounder<00:00:47.560> because<00:00:47.710> the<00:00:47.860> other<00:00:47.980> ones<00:00:48.220> are

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
rounder because the other ones are

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.850 
rounder because the other ones are
really<00:00:48.790> really<00:00:49.000> strong<00:00:49.060> and<00:00:49.810> they<00:00:50.230> are<00:00:50.260> really

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
really really strong and they are really

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.260 
really really strong and they are really
good<00:00:51.040> at<00:00:51.130> gardening<00:00:51.340> so<00:00:51.489> you<00:00:51.610> want<00:00:51.790> to<00:00:51.880> make<00:00:52.120> it

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
good at gardening so you want to make it

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.200 
good at gardening so you want to make it
so<00:00:52.450> it's<00:00:52.600> just<00:00:52.809> touching<00:00:53.290> the<00:00:53.320> edge<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.730> off

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
so it's just touching the edge and off

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.979 
so it's just touching the edge and off
this<00:00:55.840> block<00:00:56.649> here<00:00:57.010> right<00:00:57.309> and<00:00:58.000> put<00:00:58.329> one<00:00:58.540> just

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
this block here right and put one just

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.330 
this block here right and put one just
like<00:00:59.320> so<00:01:00.280> and<00:01:00.969> then<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:02.140> biggest<00:01:02.500> one<00:01:02.710> in<00:01:02.920> the

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
like so and then the biggest one in the

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.160 
like so and then the biggest one in the
center<00:01:03.880> here<00:01:04.239> actually<00:01:04.629> you<00:01:04.689> can<00:01:04.839> maybe<00:01:04.960> move

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
center here actually you can maybe move

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.950 
center here actually you can maybe move
that<00:01:05.379> one<00:01:05.710> slot<00:01:07.110> service<00:01:08.110> there<00:01:08.860> we<00:01:09.040> go

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
that one slot service there we go

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.590 
that one slot service there we go
that's<00:01:10.960> perfect<00:01:11.439> then<00:01:11.710> we<00:01:11.890> want<00:01:12.159> to<00:01:12.459> have<00:01:12.880> some

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
that's perfect then we want to have some

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.919 
that's perfect then we want to have some
sort<00:01:13.959> of<00:01:14.079> outer<00:01:14.289> and<00:01:14.909> with<00:01:15.909> buildings<00:01:16.569> so<00:01:16.840> they

00:01:16.919 --> 00:01:16.929 
sort of outer and with buildings so they

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:18.090 
sort of outer and with buildings so they
have<00:01:17.049> to<00:01:17.170> go<00:01:17.289> through<00:01:17.439> a<00:01:17.469> layer<00:01:17.649> of<00:01:17.679> buildings

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
have to go through a layer of buildings

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.440 
have to go through a layer of buildings
before<00:01:18.310> the<00:01:18.520> dirt<00:01:18.670> so<00:01:18.850> let's<00:01:18.999> go<00:01:19.090> we're<00:01:19.359> gonna

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:23.879 
get these and things you make you can
make<00:01:22.659> sure<00:01:22.840> that<00:01:22.990> touching<00:01:23.319> if<00:01:23.439> you<00:01:23.529> really

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:23.889

make sure that touching if you really
want<00:01:24.130> to<00:01:24.569> because<00:01:25.569> doesn't<00:01:26.380> really<00:01:26.649> ma<00:01:26.889> feel

00:01:27.449 --> 00:01:27.459 
want to because doesn't really ma feel

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:29.910 
want to because doesn't really ma feel
like<00:01:27.670> that<00:01:27.850> like<00:01:28.299> so<00:01:28.569> and<00:01:28.869> then<00:01:29.499> put<00:01:29.679> it<00:01:29.799> like

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
like that like so and then put it like

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.730 
like that like so and then put it like
that<00:01:30.069> and<00:01:30.399> that's<00:01:30.639> all<00:01:31.270> sort<00:01:32.139> of<00:01:32.170> shell<00:01:32.439> round

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
that and that's all sort of shell round

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.879 
that and that's all sort of shell round
it<00:01:32.920> then<00:01:33.729> you<00:01:33.909> want<00:01:34.090> to<00:01:34.149> put<00:01:34.329> another<00:01:34.889> Archer

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:35.889 
it then you want to put another Archer

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:40.940 
it then you want to put another Archer
tower<00:01:37.560> one<00:01:38.560> block<00:01:39.189> away<00:01:39.219> so<00:01:39.849> it<00:01:40.090> doesn't

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
tower one block away so it doesn't

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.370 
tower one block away so it doesn't
interfere<00:01:42.450> with<00:01:43.450> this<00:01:43.630> one<00:01:43.840> key<00:01:44.049> if<00:01:44.139> you<00:01:44.200> put

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
interfere with this one key if you put

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.050 
interfere with this one key if you put
them<00:01:44.469> two<00:01:44.619> closer<00:01:44.920> then<00:01:45.310> they<00:01:45.549> can<00:01:45.729> get<00:01:45.909> hit

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
them two closer then they can get hit

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.609 
them two closer then they can get hit
with<00:01:46.299> each<00:01:46.450> other<00:01:46.630> you<00:01:46.929> can<00:01:47.049> get<00:01:47.170> them<00:01:47.289> all<00:01:47.380> at

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
with each other you can get them all at

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.199 
with each other you can get them all at
once<00:01:47.799> we<00:01:47.979> could<00:01:48.069> take<00:01:48.310> four<00:01:48.579> bounds<00:01:48.880> at<00:01:48.999> once

00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:49.209 
once we could take four bounds at once

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:53.339 
once we could take four bounds at once
there<00:01:50.069> and<00:01:51.389> then<00:01:52.389> we<00:01:52.539> won't<00:01:52.749> actually<00:01:52.959> maybe

00:01:53.339 --> 00:01:53.349 
there and then we won't actually maybe

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:57.629 
there and then we won't actually maybe
yeah<00:01:54.219> now<00:01:54.999> we<00:01:55.060> want<00:01:55.389> to<00:01:55.689> put<00:01:56.349> and<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:57.189> mortars

00:01:57.629 --> 00:01:57.639 
yeah now we want to put and the mortars

over the place makes it very hard to
attack<00:04:56.550> because<00:04:56.639> usually<00:04:56.849> if<00:04:57.270> you<00:04:57.449> put<00:04:57.599> them

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
attack because usually if you put them

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.120 
attack because usually if you put them
in<00:04:57.780> one<00:04:57.870> Pacifica<00:04:58.380> place<00:04:58.590> then<00:04:58.889> they<00:04:59.009> can

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
in one Pacifica place then they can

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.129 
in one Pacifica place then they can
usually<00:04:59.250> go<00:04:59.550> round<00:04:59.759> them<00:04:59.970> if<00:05:00.449> you<00:05:00.630> do<00:05:00.780> this<00:05:00.930> it

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
usually go round them if you do this it

usually go round them if you do this it
makes<00:05:01.289> it<00:05:01.440> very<00:05:01.590> hard<00:05:01.830> for<00:05:01.949> the<00:05:03.349> person<00:05:04.349> that's

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410
