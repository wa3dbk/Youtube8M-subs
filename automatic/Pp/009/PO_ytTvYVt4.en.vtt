this pin on this measuring bar built

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.340 
this pin on this measuring bar built
into<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:17.940> lid<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.360> here<00:03:19.080> there's<00:03:19.260> an

adjustable setting which just slides up

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.320 
adjustable setting which just slides up
and<00:03:21.989> down<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.350> ruler<00:03:22.590> so<00:03:23.310> find<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.120> length

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
and down the ruler so find the length

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.870 
and down the ruler so find the length
there's<00:03:24.690> six<00:03:25.019> inches<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:26.100> all<00:03:26.370> that<00:03:26.580> you<00:03:26.700> do

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
there's six inches and all that you do

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.780 
there's six inches and all that you do
then<00:03:27.180> is<00:03:28.940> put<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.030> line<00:03:30.380> round<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.620> pin<00:03:31.830> and

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
then is put the line round the pin and

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.090 
then is put the line round the pin and
there<00:03:33.120> you've<00:03:33.300> got<00:03:33.330> your<00:03:33.600> exact<00:03:34.290> hook<00:03:34.769> length

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
there you've got your exact hook length

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.300 
there you've got your exact hook length
and<00:03:35.400> then<00:03:35.910> tie<00:03:36.450> that<00:03:36.690> loop<00:03:36.989> do<00:03:37.739> that<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.100> same

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
and then tie that loop do that the same
