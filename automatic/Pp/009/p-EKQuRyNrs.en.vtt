continuing<00:00:08.220> where<00:00:08.370> we<00:00:08.490> left<00:00:08.670> off<00:00:08.910> last<00:00:09.269> time

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
continuing where we left off last time

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.870 
continuing where we left off last time
right<00:00:10.230> now<00:00:10.410> we<00:00:10.469> have<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.889> game<00:00:11.280> where<00:00:11.639> if<00:00:11.730> i

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
right now we have a game where if i

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.810 
right now we have a game where if i
press<00:00:12.120> p<00:00:12.389> when<00:00:12.990> i<00:00:13.019> left<00:00:13.259> click<00:00:13.639> the<00:00:14.639> mouse

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
press p when i left click the mouse

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.590 
press p when i left click the mouse
follows<00:00:15.450> or<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.170> box<00:00:16.350> follows<00:00:17.060> my<00:00:18.060> mouse<00:00:18.300> left

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
follows or the box follows my mouse left

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.390 
follows or the box follows my mouse left
and<00:00:18.810> right<00:00:18.960> let's<00:00:19.320> get<00:00:19.500> moving<00:00:19.859> up<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.279> down

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
and right let's get moving up and down

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.710 
and right let's get moving up and down
as<00:00:20.820> well<00:00:21.769> so<00:00:22.910> basically<00:00:23.910> looking<00:00:24.210> at<00:00:24.359> our<00:00:24.480> code

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
as well so basically looking at our code

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.130 
as well so basically looking at our code
we<00:00:24.990> got<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.590> width<00:00:25.769> position<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.720> the<00:00:27.720> x

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
we got the width position and the x

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.500 
we got the width position and the x
position<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.800> mouse<00:00:28.920> now<00:00:29.699> if<00:00:29.939> we<00:00:29.970> just<00:00:30.269> do

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
position of the mouse now if we just do

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.959 
position of the mouse now if we just do
the<00:00:31.230> same<00:00:31.439> thing<00:00:31.710> but<00:00:31.740> with<00:00:31.949> height<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.759> y

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
the same thing but with height and the y

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.290 
the same thing but with height and the y
axis<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.930> mouse<00:00:34.079> we<00:00:34.770> will<00:00:34.920> be<00:00:35.070> able<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.370> do

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
axis of the mouse we will be able to do

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.940 
axis of the mouse we will be able to do
the<00:00:36.420> same<00:00:36.600> thing<00:00:36.930> for<00:00:37.380> our<00:00:38.600> up<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.870> down<00:00:40.020> so

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
the same thing for our up and down so

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:48.049 
the same thing for our up and down so
here<00:00:41.489> we're<00:00:41.969> going<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.540> say<00:00:45.980> height<00:00:47.059> equals

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
here we're going to say height equals

is case sensitive next we're going to

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.109 
is case sensitive next we're going to
take<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.190> height<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.940> we<00:01:03.899> are<00:01:04.019> going<00:01:04.199> to

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
take that height and we are going to

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:12.890 
take that height and we are going to
divide<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.479> half<00:01:09.979> now<00:01:10.979> at<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.400> point<00:01:11.900> we

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
divide it in half now at this point we

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.380 
divide it in half now at this point we
have<00:01:13.409> one<00:01:13.799> more<00:01:13.979> thing<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.400> do<00:01:14.520> or<00:01:14.790> two<00:01:15.210> more

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
have one more thing to do or two more

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.820 
have one more thing to do or two more
things<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.630> do<00:01:15.750> before<00:01:15.930> we<00:01:16.140> apply<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.740> the

up<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.159> down<00:01:38.479> I'm<00:01:39.479> going<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.689> take<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.290> value

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
up and down I'm going to take that value

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.499 
up and down I'm going to take that value
and<00:01:41.180> reset<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.740> equal<00:01:43.740> what<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.189> equals

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
and reset it to equal what it equals

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.130 
and reset it to equal what it equals
already<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:46.890> we're<00:01:47.850> going<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.270> multiply<00:01:48.720> it

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
already and we're going to multiply it

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.889 
already and we're going to multiply it
by<00:01:51.590> 002<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:52.979> case<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.600> other<00:01:54.750> one

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
by 002 in this case and in the other one

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.020 
by 002 in this case and in the other one
I'd<00:01:55.110> if<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.530> multiply<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:55.979> buy<00:01:56.189> one<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.729> flip<00:01:56.909> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
I'd if I multiply to buy one to flip the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.730 
I'd if I multiply to buy one to flip the
negative<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.509> positive<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:58.079> don't<00:01:58.439> have<00:01:58.590> that

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
negative and positive I don't have that

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.800 
negative and positive I don't have that
issue<00:01:58.890> with<00:01:59.250> up<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.640> down<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.450> now<00:02:00.570> we<00:02:00.659> can

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
issue with up and down so now we can

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.020 
issue with up and down so now we can
just<00:02:00.840> say<00:02:01.200> owner<00:02:01.649> which<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:02.579> this<00:02:02.670> case<00:02:02.909> is

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
just say owner which is in this case is

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.170 
just say owner which is in this case is
our<00:02:03.180> cube<00:02:03.479> its<00:02:04.380> location<00:02:05.250> or<00:02:05.700> its<00:02:05.820> local

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.309 
and down and it's going to equal the POS
Z<00:02:17.560> that<00:02:17.769> we<00:02:17.920> created<00:02:18.280> so<00:02:19.209> now<00:02:19.420> if<00:02:19.720> I<00:02:19.870> come<00:02:20.200> up

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
Z that we created so now if I come up

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.710 
Z that we created so now if I come up
here<00:02:20.530> I'm<00:02:20.650> going<00:02:20.769> to<00:02:20.890> left<00:02:21.340> click<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:21.700> I<00:02:22.269> can

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
here I'm going to left click and I can

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.360 
here I'm going to left click and I can
move<00:02:23.110> this<00:02:23.650> cube<00:02:24.099> around<00:02:26.069> now<00:02:27.069> you<00:02:27.129> may<00:02:27.340> be

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
move this cube around now you may be

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.319 
move this cube around now you may be
asking<00:02:28.170> what<00:02:29.170> about<00:02:29.730> front<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:30.909> back<00:02:31.030> what<00:02:31.239> if

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
asking what about front and back what if

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.660 
asking what about front and back what if
I<00:02:31.390> don't<00:02:31.450> want<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:31.930> move<00:02:32.049> that<00:02:32.260> cube<00:02:32.560> back<00:02:32.920> well

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
I don't want to move that cube back well

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.949 
I don't want to move that cube back well
that's<00:02:33.819> a<00:02:33.940> great<00:02:34.150> question<00:02:34.360> i<00:02:34.810> have<00:02:35.769> no<00:02:36.040> clue

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
that's a great question i have no clue

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.099 
that's a great question i have no clue
well<00:02:37.959> a<00:02:37.989> cursor<00:02:38.409> a<00:02:38.439> mouse<00:02:38.709> only<00:02:39.310> has<00:02:39.840> left<00:02:40.840> and

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109 
well a cursor a mouse only has left and

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:43.380 
well a cursor a mouse only has left and
right<00:02:41.470> value<00:02:42.220> up<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:42.609> down<00:02:42.730> left<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.299> right

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
right value up and down left and right

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.270 
right value up and down left and right
values<00:02:43.959> it<00:02:44.140> doesn't<00:02:44.470> have<00:02:44.769> three-dimensional

values it doesn't have three-dimensional

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.530 
values it doesn't have three-dimensional
values<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:48.370> I'm<00:02:48.700> thinking<00:02:49.030> about<00:02:49.090> maybe<00:02:49.420> doing

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
also let me mention right now the way

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.630 
also let me mention right now the way
that<00:04:44.360> we<00:04:44.570> have<00:04:44.720> this<00:04:44.870> setup<00:04:45.400> you<00:04:46.400> can<00:04:46.430> only

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
that we have this setup you can only

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.400 
that we have this setup you can only
move<00:04:46.790> one<00:04:47.030> object<00:04:47.600> if<00:04:47.810> I<00:04:47.900> had<00:04:48.020> another<00:04:48.200> object

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
move one object if I had another object

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.170 
move one object if I had another object
on<00:04:48.710> I<00:04:48.740> click<00:04:49.100> it<00:04:49.130> but<00:04:49.310> they<00:04:49.400> both<00:04:49.700> move<00:04:50.000> to

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
on I click it but they both move to

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.510 
on I click it but they both move to
where<00:04:50.330> the<00:04:50.450> cursor<00:04:50.630> is<00:04:50.960> in<00:04:51.170> the<00:04:51.650> future<00:04:51.800> we

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
where the cursor is in the future we

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.580 
where the cursor is in the future we
will<00:04:52.670> figure<00:04:53.000> out<00:04:53.120> a<00:04:53.270> way<00:04:53.540> to<00:04:55.570> to<00:04:56.570> click<00:04:57.350> I

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
will figure out a way to to click I

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.860 
will figure out a way to to click I
items<00:04:58.280> individually<00:04:58.580> obviously<00:04:59.570> we<00:04:59.690> have

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
items individually obviously we have

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.730 
items individually obviously we have
options<00:05:00.140> in<00:05:01.360> the<00:05:02.360> drop<00:05:02.390> down<00:05:02.600> here<00:05:02.990> for<00:05:03.290> if<00:05:03.590> the

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
options in the drop down here for if the

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.180 
options in the drop down here for if the
mouse<00:05:03.890> is<00:05:03.920> over<00:05:04.570> and<00:05:05.570> I<00:05:06.230> can<00:05:06.410> figure<00:05:06.560> out<00:05:06.680> I<00:05:06.770> can

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
mouse is over and I can figure out I can

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.440 
mouse is over and I can figure out I can
tell<00:05:07.280> you<00:05:07.370> right<00:05:07.430> now<00:05:07.490> I<00:05:07.610> could<00:05:07.790> do<00:05:07.910> it<00:05:08.090> using

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
tell you right now I could do it using

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.730 
tell you right now I could do it using
just<00:05:08.750> logic<00:05:09.080> editor<00:05:09.320> but<00:05:09.440> I'm<00:05:09.500> going<00:05:09.590> to<00:05:09.650> try

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
just logic editor but I'm going to try

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.590 
just logic editor but I'm going to try
to<00:05:09.830> figure<00:05:09.980> out<00:05:10.130> a<00:05:10.220> way<00:05:10.340> to<00:05:10.850> do<00:05:10.970> it<00:05:11.120> pretty<00:05:11.390> much

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
to figure out a way to do it pretty much

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.910 
to figure out a way to do it pretty much
all<00:05:11.780> in<00:05:12.020> the<00:05:12.110> Python<00:05:12.470> script<00:05:12.830> without

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:12.920 
all in the Python script without

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.840 
all in the Python script without
creating<00:05:13.520> any<00:05:13.900> variables<00:05:15.160> properties<00:05:16.160> in<00:05:16.490> the

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
creating any variables properties in the

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.820 
creating any variables properties in the
logic<00:05:17.210> editor<00:05:17.480> here<00:05:17.720> so<00:05:17.990> I'll<00:05:18.470> just<00:05:18.530> need<00:05:18.770> to

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
logic editor here so I'll just need to

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:19.960 
logic editor here so I'll just need to
play<00:05:18.920> with<00:05:19.070> that<00:05:19.130> a<00:05:19.190> little<00:05:19.310> bit<00:05:19.460> but<00:05:19.700> look

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
play with that a little bit but look

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.460 
play with that a little bit but look
forward<00:05:20.240> that<00:05:20.330> tutorial<00:05:20.870> in<00:05:21.200> the<00:05:21.290> near<00:05:21.440> future

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
forward that tutorial in the near future

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.380 
forward that tutorial in the near future
so<00:05:22.430> I<00:05:22.460> think<00:05:22.580> you<00:05:22.730> once<00:05:22.880> again<00:05:23.030> for<00:05:23.150> watching

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
so I think you once again for watching

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:47.410 
so I think you once again for watching
and<00:05:23.840> have<00:05:24.070> a<00:05:25.070> great<00:05:25.250> day

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:47.420 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.480 

you
