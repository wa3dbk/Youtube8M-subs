00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:07.550
 hello how welcome are you at that point 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:10.430
 and then I will show you how to accelerate 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.350
 the windows 7 windows 7 operating system 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.690
 By default, it starts the computer using a 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.310
 only core so if we have a 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.500
 processor with more core we can 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.280
 take advantage so windows starts more 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.920
 Quick 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.920
 good let's start the first thing we do 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.730
 in the building 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.490
 ms config 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.750
 people 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.350
 let's go to the start tab 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.519
 Advanced Options 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.130
 here the number of processors activated 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.230
 check 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.020
 and in my house I only have two we have the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.810
 processor maximum we have 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.810
 maximum amount of memory we do not activate 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:04.550
 and by default we have the total of 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:07.950
 ram memory our culture we accept 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.880
 Here standby time 30 0 we go down to 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.530
 5 seconds 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.360
 we apply and accept 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.330
 now once we have our 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.940
 operating system that turn on fast 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.619
 start now what we want 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.240
 energize father in the same way that 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.060
 it goes off fast 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.930
 for that we leave the new beginning 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.930
 rgr and enter 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.119
 yes 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.210
 because we do not pay our operatives is 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.299
 that windows to close each process is 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.539
 delay in finishing each process about two 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:49.579
 seconds we want it here it will be down 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:54.380
 the 12 seconds to about 6 to 8 seconds 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.380
 for that we're going to key local machine 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:01.490
 system 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:05.649
 there is a tab there we go to control 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.649
 and the control we seek destruction 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.020
 this last one that as we mentioned 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.480
 find in 12 seconds what we will do 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.840
 in this case they will decrease to 6 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.840
 seconds 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.130
 we accept closed 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.430
 and ready 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.460
 is to grab and restart with 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.950
 this will see an improvement when switching off and 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.800
 learn our operative that's all 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.940
 friends thank you for visiting http us 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.940
 we see in the following video tutorial
