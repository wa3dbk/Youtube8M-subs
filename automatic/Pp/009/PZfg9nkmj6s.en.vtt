00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.429
 hello to you Artem 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.070
 I am very far from the topic of the dancers like on 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.080
 ios and on the computer however appeared 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.049
 quite interesting information which I 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.940
 I hasten to share with you immediately that 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.890
 it's not about any cheats or 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.869
 codes for world of tanks 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.090
 the fact is that the game is online 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.680
 accordingly it does not crack therefore 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.480
 don't ask me such questions in 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.029
 comments or posts in 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.560
 social networks as you know in 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.329
 the computer version of the game is 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.600
 ability to install various 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.280
 modifications are some of them just 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.860
 change the graphic elements of the game 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.750
 for example the appearance of tanks and others 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.059
 facilitate the gameplay a little 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.739
 Now all owners of a and devices 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.190
 jailbreak the opportunity 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.050
 set mods on world of tanks for 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.800
 this will need to add new go 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.989
 torus and in side 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.050
 all extensions in it are intended 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.840
 exclusively for all tweaks tviki 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.300
 has a Russian description and is supplied 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.420
 screenshots so deal with them 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.030
 no trouble here itself 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.040
 interesting modification in my opinion you 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.250
 You can repaint the wreckage of the wounded 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.229
 white tanks this will make it much easier 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.320
 targeting the enemy who tried 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.540
 hide behind them can also be replaced 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.430
 tree of development from horizontal to 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.790
 vertical which met more 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.140
 early versions of tanks on the computer 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.479
 very useful modification allows 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.810
 inflict breaking through on all 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.400
 high-level tanks will now be in battle 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.530
 much easier to navigate 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.060
 where to go for application 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.310
 maximum damage 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.829
 also in this repository is great 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.659
 number of mods for indicator sixth 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.390
 feeling 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.340
 There are several sound modifications. 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.610
 some of them replace the sounds of tanks and 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.049
 shots at more realistic and others 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.610
 replace votes and crew crews 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:02.340
 there is a modification that will make the game 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.369
 more beautiful and realistic namely it will inflict 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.679
 camouflage on all tanks however i dont 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.929
 I recommend installing it as it is. 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.700
 will make the game a little harder as you 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.989
 understand all the established mods and tweaks 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.970
 will act only on your 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.130
 device accordingly notice 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.650
 the enemy tank for you will be a bit 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.140
 harder so can you replace 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.410
 standard sight for more suitable 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.849
 either just add a digital display 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.630
 indicating the number of seconds to 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.810
 end of recharge except this you 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.040
 You can change the appearance of the minimap 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.799
 remove direction arrows 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.620
 tank movements and apply some more more 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.450
 minor modifications after installation 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.310
 most tweaks do not respring 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.810
 will need enough 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.980
 restart application 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.989
 closing it out of the multitasking panel for 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.250
 removing any modification required 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.470
 just go to shogi 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.980
 remove the appropriate extension and 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.510
 just restart the game 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.810
 now let's see how they look 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.609
 modifications in action as you can see at all 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.010
 serious tanks inflicted breakdown zones 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:10.380
 now you can easily understand where 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.450
 need to get to bring the tank out 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.060
 ordering to destroy his crew 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.829
 or just immobilize him not 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.019
 worry about the markers being 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.639
 applied to your vehicle again 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.230
 I will remind that all modifications will be 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.600
 act only on your device and 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.109
 Will not be visible to other players and yours. 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.450
 adversary other modifications that 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:32.600
 act during battle for example digital 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.310
 indication until the end of the recharge 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.350
 improved map as well as white models 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.980
 wrecked tanks will allow you more 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.139
 comfortably lead battles that's all 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.030
 I wanted to tell you in this video not 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.950
