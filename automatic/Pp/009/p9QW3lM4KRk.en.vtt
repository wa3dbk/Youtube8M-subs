00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
just shipped me a replacement but more

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.139 
just shipped me a replacement but more
power<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.230> them<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.550> just<00:00:50.579> have<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.879> first

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
power to them so you just have to first

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.100 
power to them so you just have to first
take<00:00:51.300> off<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> sticker<00:00:53.420> because<00:00:54.420> there's

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
take off the sticker because there's

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.560 
take off the sticker because there's
only<00:00:55.260> one<00:00:55.500> screw<00:00:57.109> that<00:00:59.329> keeps<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.510> thing

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
only one screw that keeps this thing

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.799 
only one screw that keeps this thing
together<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.140> here's<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.680> screw<00:01:02.750> hopefully<00:01:03.750> I

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
together so here's the screw hopefully I

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.850 
together so here's the screw hopefully I
can<00:01:04.019> use<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:08.930> to<00:01:09.930> take<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.290> apart<00:01:10.590> because

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
can use this to take it apart because

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.240 
can use this to take it apart because
this<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.250> kind<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.790> really<00:01:12.030> messed<00:01:12.360> up<00:01:13.250> and

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
this is kind of really messed up and

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.609 
this is kind of really messed up and
then<00:01:14.700> once<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:14.970> take<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.240> apart<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:16.380> top

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
then once you take it apart the top

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.039 
then once you take it apart the top
comes<00:01:16.920> off<00:01:17.100> like<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:20.150> revealing<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.630> bottom

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
comes off like this revealing the bottom

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.460 
comes off like this revealing the bottom
and<00:01:22.229> top<00:01:22.380> portions<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.930> then<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.110> can<00:01:25.290> work

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
and top portions and then you can work

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.170 
and top portions and then you can work
with<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.830> from<00:01:26.009> here<00:01:26.340> because<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.790> can<00:01:27.060> just

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
with it from here because this can just

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.200 
with it from here because this can just
be<00:01:27.270> pulled<00:01:27.600> out<00:01:28.340> one<00:01:29.340> thing<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.610> notice<00:01:29.820> this

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
be pulled out one thing to notice this

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.940 
be pulled out one thing to notice this
should<00:01:30.659> be<00:01:30.750> attached<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.259> here<00:01:31.560> but<00:01:31.710> it's

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
should be attached to here but it's

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:41.020 
should be attached to here but it's
broken<00:01:33.350> so<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.560> part<00:01:34.860> was<00:01:35.100> broken<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:36.000> end
