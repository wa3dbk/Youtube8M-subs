true<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:49.890> these<00:00:49.950> games<00:00:50.219> kind<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.550> boil<00:00:50.789> down

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
true that these games kind of boil down

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.939 
true that these games kind of boil down
to<00:00:51.210> just<00:00:51.510> mashing<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.140> attack<00:00:52.410> button<00:00:52.649> over

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
to just mashing the attack button over

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.200 
to just mashing the attack button over
and<00:00:52.980> over<00:00:53.160> again<00:00:53.399> but<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:53.850> think<00:00:53.910> with<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
and over again but I think with the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.790 
and over again but I think with the
right<00:00:54.329> execution<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.289> can<00:00:55.410> keep<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.649> game

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
right execution you can keep the game

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.439 
right execution you can keep the game
