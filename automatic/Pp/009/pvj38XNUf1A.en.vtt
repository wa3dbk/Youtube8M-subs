00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.480
 more difficult 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.830
 Our correspondents are further daily

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.989
 transformer mounted engineering 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.440
 communication you saw now is the second 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.780

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.750
 roughly speaking intensive work 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.000
 practically we are at the final stage 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.740
 all engineering communications about what 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.049
 Today, the work is intensive 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.299

 say that this promotion is work and 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:33.689
 Much has been done during these six weeks of 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:37.439
 walls and roofs of everything else at the time 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:40.320
 it was not yet today as it were on 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.000
 This level that requires today 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.460
 much attention 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.520
 organization and finish before frost 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:55.310
 frame to close and proceed to 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:58.320
 finishing work and staffing and 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.940
 installation will be equipped with a new terminal 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.850
 fully comply with the world 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.070
 standards area of ​​the future complex 29 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.960
 thousand square meters for comparison 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.610
 today's terminal which was built 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.649
 back in Soviet times and already 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.770
 the most modernized takes 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.450
 area of nine thousand square meters 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:20.360
 it will provide bandwidth 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:24.180
 capacity of a thousand passengers per hour with 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.040
 quality with high quality let's say 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.410
 quality si by international standards 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.690
 but he can skip this one and a half 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.870
 thousand say when here we have Russian 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.810
 program or sporting event then 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.989
 have we provided developed in 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.209
 terminal in such a way that we had 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.269
 Enough good stock was enough 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.970
 peak demand 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.190
 well, it's about two and a half 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.330
 million passengers a year is 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.549
 serious increase in throughput 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.380
 abilities dictated by time by 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.690
 Essentially today Odessa Airport is 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.910
 the main air gate of the south of Ukraine 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.320
 and next year specialists 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.250
 predict intense growth 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:08.250
 passenger traffic at this airport 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:11.340
 Today in Simferopol does not work in that 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.880
 here in the status house as international 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.620
 airport 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:19.230
 the entire burden falls on Odessa and others 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:22.470
 Black Sea cities here I was recently 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:26.760
 at the opening of the first flight and turkish 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:30.540
 airlines and in Kherson and looked yes there 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.150
 there is both demand and passenger but it will and 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:37.579
 here you just need to make a condition 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.000
 for the conditions of comfort for passengers 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.400
 initial terminal project 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.230
 complex provided and construction 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.030
 new runways 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.350
 but today in view of the situation in which 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.310
 Ukraine is building 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.120
 airfield suspended all 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.030
 runways in Ukraine 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.769
 financing from the core budget 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.830
 state well the situation is which 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.270
 now the country 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:04.140
 you know i won't be on it 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:06.640
 stop so the budget we have 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.290

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.970
 complex is scheduled to be due in the second
