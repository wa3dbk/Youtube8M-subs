00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
days it seems now Ronald Reagan was

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.750 
days it seems now Ronald Reagan was
quite<00:04:44.730> the<00:04:44.970> jokester<00:04:45.800> quickly<00:04:46.800> if<00:04:46.950> if<00:04:47.220> he<00:04:47.640> were

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
quite the jokester quickly if if he were

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.850 
quite the jokester quickly if if he were
still<00:04:48.030> alive<00:04:48.090> today<00:04:48.780> what<00:04:49.350> do<00:04:49.410> you<00:04:49.500> think<00:04:49.740> that

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
still alive today what do you think that

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.370 
still alive today what do you think that
he<00:04:49.950> would<00:04:50.040> say<00:04:50.250> about<00:04:50.460> his<00:04:50.750> 100th<00:04:51.750> birthday<00:04:54.380> I

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
he would say about his 100th birthday I

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.770 
he would say about his 100th birthday I
think<00:04:55.740> he'd<00:04:55.890> probably<00:04:55.980> start<00:04:56.520> screaming<00:04:57.240> for

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
think he'd probably start screaming for

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.190 
think he'd probably start screaming for
a<00:04:57.810> while<00:04:58.400> just<00:04:59.400> at<00:04:59.610> the<00:04:59.820> horror<00:05:00.450> of<00:05:00.780> being

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
a while just at the horror of being

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.760 
a while just at the horror of being
alive<00:05:01.530> and<00:05:02.010> I'm<00:05:02.640> not<00:05:02.790> sure<00:05:03.180> if<00:05:03.510> the<00:05:03.810> alzheimer

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
alive and I'm not sure if the alzheimer

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.550 
alive and I'm not sure if the alzheimer
still<00:05:05.130> applies<00:05:05.490> when<00:05:06.060> you're<00:05:06.240> a<00:05:06.510> zombie<00:05:07.110> but

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
still applies when you're a zombie but

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.210 
still applies when you're a zombie but
he<00:05:07.740> may<00:05:07.860> not<00:05:07.890> be<00:05:08.070> able<00:05:08.250> to<00:05:08.520> put<00:05:09.420> words<00:05:09.660> together

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
he may not be able to put words together

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.980 
he may not be able to put words together
so<00:05:11.220> i<00:05:11.250> think<00:05:11.730> it's<00:05:11.940> it<00:05:12.390> would<00:05:12.510> be<00:05:12.630> sort<00:05:12.900> of

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
so i think it's it would be sort of

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.130 
so i think it's it would be sort of
horrifying<00:05:13.470> i<00:05:13.590> think<00:05:13.770> it's<00:05:13.860> good<00:05:14.490> that

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
horrifying i think it's good that

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.180 
horrifying i think it's good that
everyone<00:05:16.140> else<00:05:16.320> pretends<00:05:16.830> to<00:05:16.950> be<00:05:17.010> around

everyone else pretends to be around

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
be as lucky well I don't know I think at

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.960 
be as lucky well I don't know I think at
the<00:05:54.830> exact<00:05:55.830> moment<00:05:55.920> in<00:05:56.250> their<00:05:56.370> presidency<00:05:56.850> is

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
the exact moment in their presidency is

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.720 
the exact moment in their presidency is
right<00:05:57.210> now<00:05:57.920> Obama's<00:05:58.920> approval<00:05:59.220> ratings<00:05:59.670> are

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 
right now Obama's approval ratings are

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.730 
right now Obama's approval ratings are
actually<00:06:00.000> higher<00:06:00.180> than<00:06:00.260> Reagan's<00:06:01.260> were<00:06:01.440> and

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
actually higher than Reagan's were and

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.510 
actually higher than Reagan's were and
the<00:06:02.640> the<00:06:03.060> unemployment<00:06:03.480> rate<00:06:04.020> is<00:06:04.350> lower<00:06:04.620> right

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
the the unemployment rate is lower right

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.850 
the the unemployment rate is lower right
now<00:06:05.550> but<00:06:05.880> I'm<00:06:05.970> not<00:06:06.000> sure<00:06:06.150> that<00:06:06.710> Americans<00:06:07.710> have

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
now but I'm not sure that Americans have

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.370 
now but I'm not sure that Americans have
the<00:06:08.010> same<00:06:08.310> confidence<00:06:08.850> in<00:06:09.180> the<00:06:09.600> economy<00:06:09.720> that

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
the same confidence in the economy that

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.340 
the same confidence in the economy that
they<00:06:11.010> did<00:06:11.190> under<00:06:11.430> Reagan<00:06:12.000> or<00:06:12.300> that<00:06:12.630> Reagan<00:06:13.020> had

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
they did under Reagan or that Reagan had

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:14.810 
they did under Reagan or that Reagan had
in<00:06:13.590> those<00:06:13.740> years<00:06:13.980> I<00:06:14.190> don't<00:06:14.280> think<00:06:14.490> Obama

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
in those years I don't think Obama

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.180 
in those years I don't think Obama
really<00:06:15.420> believes<00:06:15.660> it<00:06:15.840> either<00:06:15.980> it's<00:06:16.980> a<00:06:17.040> lot

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
really believes it either it's a lot

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.010 
really believes it either it's a lot
more<00:06:17.220> volatile<00:06:18.120> out<00:06:18.300> there<00:06:18.570> you<00:06:18.750> know<00:06:18.840> an

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
more volatile out there you know an

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.390 
more volatile out there you know an
industry<00:06:19.770> can<00:06:20.090> fall<00:06:21.090> apart<00:06:21.980> overnights<00:06:22.980> you

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 
industry can fall apart overnights you

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.580 
industry can fall apart overnights you
know<00:06:23.550> hot<00:06:24.420> dog<00:06:24.690> if<00:06:24.990> you're<00:06:25.170> in<00:06:25.230> the<00:06:25.320> hot<00:06:25.440> dog

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590 
know hot dog if you're in the hot dog

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.590 
know hot dog if you're in the hot dog

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 
industry the next day it's you know hot

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.840 
industry the next day it's you know hot
dogs<00:06:27.840> are<00:06:27.960> obsolete<00:06:28.230> and<00:06:28.500> what<00:06:28.620> do<00:06:28.680> you<00:06:28.740> do<00:06:28.890> so

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:29.850 
dogs are obsolete and what do you do so

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.480 
dogs are obsolete and what do you do so
I<00:06:29.880> think<00:06:30.030> people<00:06:30.690> are<00:06:30.810> not<00:06:31.070> quite<00:06:32.070> ready<00:06:32.310> to

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
I think people are not quite ready to

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:33.740 
I think people are not quite ready to
believe<00:06:32.670> that<00:06:32.850> everything<00:06:33.090> is<00:06:33.390> in<00:06:33.420> order

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
believe that everything is in order

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.140 
believe that everything is in order
right<00:06:34.050> now<00:06:34.080> so<00:06:34.380> we'll<00:06:34.530> see<00:06:34.770> if<00:06:34.980> his

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
right now so we'll see if his

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.480 
right now so we'll see if his
numbers<00:06:36.990> will<00:06:37.200> rebound<00:06:37.710> more<00:06:38.040> and<00:06:38.220> he'll<00:06:38.340> be

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
numbers will rebound more and he'll be

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.730 
numbers will rebound more and he'll be
able<00:06:38.580> to<00:06:38.760> win<00:06:39.090> a<00:06:39.150> second<00:06:39.510> term<00:06:39.680> somehow<00:06:40.680> I

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
able to win a second term somehow I

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.530 
able to win a second term somehow I
think<00:06:40.830> that<00:06:41.190> hot<00:06:41.490> dogs<00:06:41.760> are<00:06:42.000> still<00:06:42.180> gonna<00:06:42.330> make

think that hot dogs are still gonna make

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.120 
think that hot dogs are still gonna make
