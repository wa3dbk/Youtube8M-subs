00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
is a little bit confusing you have to

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.360 
is a little bit confusing you have to
set<00:00:36.540> up<00:00:36.660> properly<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.620> once<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.920> do<00:00:38.100> have<00:00:38.340> it

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
set up properly so once you do have it

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.190 
set up properly so once you do have it
go<00:00:38.640> ahead<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:38.940> go<00:00:39.059> into<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.629> settings<00:00:39.870> and

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
go ahead and go into the settings and

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.510 
go ahead and go into the settings and
there<00:00:40.649> are<00:00:40.739> actually<00:00:41.040> quite<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.250> few<00:00:41.460> different

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
there are actually quite a few different

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.610 
there are actually quite a few different
options<00:00:41.790> um<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.570> can<00:00:42.660> leave<00:00:42.840> pretty<00:00:43.290> much<00:00:43.410> all

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
options um you can leave pretty much all

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.560 
options um you can leave pretty much all
of<00:00:43.800> these<00:00:44.040> alone<00:00:44.370> but<00:00:44.610> activation<00:00:45.270> methods

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
of these alone but activation methods

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.090 
of these alone but activation methods
and<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:46.050> actually<00:00:46.350> brings<00:00:46.620> me<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.920> one<00:00:47.070> of

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
and that actually brings me to one of

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.650 
and that actually brings me to one of
the<00:00:47.250> really<00:00:47.430> cool<00:00:47.550> things<00:00:47.789> about<00:00:48.120> multiflow

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.630 
a whole lot to show it's a really simple
application<00:01:40.320> but<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.560> works<00:01:40.740> really<00:01:40.860> quite

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
application but it works really quite

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.789 
application but it works really quite
well<00:01:41.880> I'm<00:01:42.420> i<00:01:42.689> will<00:01:42.869> mention<00:01:43.020> there<00:01:43.290> are<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.470> few

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
well I'm i will mention there are a few

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.560

random<00:01:44.250> bugs<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.610> glitches<00:01:44.670> sometimes<00:01:45.090> the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
random bugs and glitches sometimes the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.330 
random bugs and glitches sometimes the
apps<00:01:45.750> don't<00:01:46.020> want<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.290> properly<00:01:46.619> background

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
apps don't want to properly background

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.880 
apps don't want to properly background
but<00:01:48.270> it's<00:01:48.390> not<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.570> huge<00:01:48.780> deal<00:01:48.869> generally<00:01:49.590> over

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
but it's not a huge deal generally over

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.260 
but it's not a huge deal generally over
again<00:01:50.130> I'm<00:01:50.369> sure<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.820> there<00:01:50.939> will<00:01:51.090> be<00:01:51.119> an

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
4 99 in cydia or rock so it is a little

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.950 
4 99 in cydia or rock so it is a little
bit<00:01:59.009> pricey<00:01:59.310> but<00:01:59.520> it<00:02:00.060> really<00:02:00.479> comes<00:02:00.750> down<00:02:00.810> to

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
bit pricey but it really comes down to

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.050 
bit pricey but it really comes down to
whether<00:02:01.530> or<00:02:01.770> not<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.159> like<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.700> Apple

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
whether or not you like the Apple

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.639 
whether or not you like the Apple
backgrounding<00:02:03.540> personally<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.290> thought<00:02:04.530> it

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
backgrounding personally I thought it

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.289 
backgrounding personally I thought it
was<00:02:04.770> pretty<00:02:04.920> decent<00:02:05.100> till<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.520> tried<00:02:05.790> multiflow

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
was pretty decent till I tried multiflow

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.850 
was pretty decent till I tried multiflow
and<00:02:06.479> now<00:02:06.600> I'm<00:02:06.750> really<00:02:07.140> really<00:02:07.380> like<00:02:07.619> me<00:02:07.799> and

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
and now I'm really really like me and

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.900 
and now I'm really really like me and
I've<00:02:07.979> already<00:02:08.129> shut<00:02:08.489> off<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.879> standard

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
I've already shut off the standard

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.150 
I've already shut off the standard
multitasking<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:10.810> favorite<00:02:11.200> multiflow<00:02:11.710> on

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
multitasking and favorite multiflow on

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.680 
multitasking and favorite multiflow on
so<00:02:12.520> it's<00:02:12.640> kind<00:02:12.820> of<00:02:12.850> a<00:02:12.910> personal<00:02:13.210> preference<00:02:13.450> if

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
so it's kind of a personal preference if

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.880 
so it's kind of a personal preference if
you<00:02:13.780> like<00:02:13.930> what<00:02:14.050> you<00:02:14.170> see<00:02:14.380> here<00:02:14.620> go<00:02:14.770> ahead
