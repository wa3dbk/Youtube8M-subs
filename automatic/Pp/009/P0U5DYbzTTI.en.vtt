 from the act and are connected from 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.390
 the wifi network we are going to deactivate the network 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.750
 wifi and we will connect from the 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.729
 adapter then you have already connected to 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.270

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.899
 connect to our network what we should 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.299
 to do is to connect with our 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:38.170
 adapter as you can see here 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.170
 I'm with the adapter 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.850

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.950

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.950

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.429
 the search and I've already found three 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:03.700
 Well what unknown devices 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.500
 are in green are those that I have left 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.950
 what 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.960
 that may be in my network but that are 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.050
 known but what are in red not 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.440
 I know them then he put them in red 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.920
 good how can you put it in red to 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:23.260
 so they can not enter your network 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.040
 easy only double click 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.349
 and here 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.170

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:34.890
 it was marked before and it said I know 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.049
 this computer or device and when 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.469
 I saw him remove this little popcorn and 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:42.870
 press ok now they can not enter 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:45.150
 to my network as you can appreciate this is the 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.359
 access to my computer's internet 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.410
