00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:13.120
 good to all I'm 60 and good today 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.570
 I come with a redstone tutorial that 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:19.090
 well it's really translated from it 's a 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:23.020
 tutorial from a person who 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:25.930
 call tibau if I'm not wrong I'll leave you 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.700
 your channel in the description and it's a 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.870
 translation because your channel is English 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:34.990
 it's good the only thing I want to show you 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:38.080
 to do is how to get it to be 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:41.050
 dispensers be a true dispenser 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.260
 that is going to expelling things I that is 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.800
 about eight objects per second 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.800
 yes 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.620
 this is the truth very but that very very 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:00.129
 useful is good and good that can have 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.589
 enough profits as soon as this is worth 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.220
 let's see how it mounts good let's 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:08.060
 see her 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:12.730
 how to assemble this it is worth seeing that you can see 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.560
 have this format like this 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.010
 that really does not eject anything because 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.010
 as you see 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.570
 not expelling because he had nothing 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.869
 so good to start we'll have to 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.560
 need we need a material 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.140
 anyone 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.380
 be it sun stone any kind of 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.829
 material we are going to do 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.380
 the structure where to put the dispenser 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.200
 that right here is 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.940
 up to this point we must put the 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:00.010
 button to give the energy 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.780
 and here another thing that has not caught 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:06.580
 put a law see and lower it 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.580
 because if we raise the law see 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.709
 is 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.210
 what does the everest give energy 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.319
 keep going 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:19.609
 why 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:23.049
 the clock is going well the clock of the 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:23.049
 watch therefore 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.160
 once we have this structure 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.580
 first of all we are going to put a 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:34.380
 repeater that what he's going to do is let's 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:39.069
 to put here this and this 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:41.730
 this this if I'm not wrong 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.730
 so 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:51.610
 you look how the the build and 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.610
 now I will explain why of each thing 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.180
 to see if I find sand here is 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.409
 so this like this this way 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:17.390
 ok we have the structure assembled 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.870
 missing here this and this 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.870
 is 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:30.879
 now he starts to mop this 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.879
 ok this was going well 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:38.350
 I will explain why everything with this 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:42.250
 basically what we do is set up a 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.500
 Very fast watch is worth from all 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.340
 these elements that what they will do will be 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:52.090
 it's good that the machine works fast 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.110
 from the button is activated or is it 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.920
 a flip flop 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:00.110
 but from a single one- button like 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.930
 way that we can activate and deactivate 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.730
 the mechanism only with the button at 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.400
 activate and deactivate the mechanism with the 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.230
 button just need the rapid pool 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.840
 be the watch 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.069
 energy functions the dispenser 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.560
 Quick 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.420
 and good that with that we get the effect 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.370
 d 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.680
 this from what 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.040
 that is a good dispenser in a 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.390
 dispenser that only one thing 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.450
 so good if you liked this 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:38.150
 this tutorial I invite you to what space 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:40.250
 it's steve's good channel steve 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.200
 that has pretty good videos of 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.210
 redstone and good soon 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.930
 will teach a tutorial that this is already mine 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.930
 what good 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:55.470
 to do things like that is 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.470
 impressive it costs a lot besides 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.960
 but I love it 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.610
 so good if you liked already 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.180
 you know the favorite x is passed by the 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:09.830
 steve's channel and we'll see you in a 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.830
 next video goodbye
