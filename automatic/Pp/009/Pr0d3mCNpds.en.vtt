clip
I<00:01:08.060> added<00:01:09.060> both<00:01:09.420> wires<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:10.020> there

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
I added both wires on there

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.380 
I added both wires on there
oh<00:01:10.939> so<00:01:12.409> came<00:01:13.409> through<00:01:13.770> with<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.700> ground<00:01:14.970> and

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
wires for the factory easy star easy

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.469 
wires for the factory easy star easy
start<00:01:26.490> connection<00:01:27.170> none<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.350> wires<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.829> cut

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
start connection none of the wires I cut

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.660 
start connection none of the wires I cut
there<00:01:30.479> are<00:01:30.600> simply<00:01:31.369> two<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.520> each<00:01:33.140> okay<00:01:34.670> that's

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
there are simply two of each okay that's

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.890 
there are simply two of each okay that's
how<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.880> did<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:37.130> I<00:01:38.130> also<00:01:38.369> took<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:39.150> third

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
how I did it and I also took the third

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.300 
how I did it and I also took the third
channel<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.250> factory<00:01:41.729> remote<00:01:43.310> receiver

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
channel of the factory remote receiver

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.080 
channel of the factory remote receiver
and<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.720> put<00:01:45.930> an<00:01:46.049> extra<00:01:46.409> servo<00:01:46.890> right<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:47.369> top<00:01:47.610> of

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
and I put an extra servo right on top of

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.499 
and I put an extra servo right on top of
the<00:01:48.299> steering<00:01:48.689> servo<00:01:49.880> with<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.970> little<00:01:51.240> arm

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
the steering servo with the little arm

00:01:51.509 --> 00:02:00.440 
the steering servo with the little arm
so<00:01:51.960> when<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.170> hit<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.649> third<00:01:52.860> channel<00:01:59.450> it's

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
so when I hit the third channel it's

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.090 
so when I hit the third channel it's
been<00:02:00.600> like<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.960> ever<00:02:01.170> since<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.590> got<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:01.979> there

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
been like that ever since I got it there

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.639 
been like that ever since I got it there
was<00:02:02.189> been<00:02:02.369> about<00:02:02.750> seven<00:02:03.750> eight<00:02:04.020> months<00:02:04.259> ago

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
was been about seven eight months ago

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.090 
was been about seven eight months ago
you<00:02:05.549> can<00:02:05.729> jump<00:02:06.000> with<00:02:06.090> it

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
you can jump with it

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.300 
you can jump with it
roll<00:02:07.610> it<00:02:07.820> around<00:02:07.910> flip<00:02:08.690> it<00:02:08.899> and<00:02:09.619> it<00:02:10.040> still

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
roll it around flip it and it still

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.240 
roll it around flip it and it still
won't<00:02:10.460> go<00:02:10.670> nowhere<00:02:11.050> so<00:02:12.050> let<00:02:12.740> me<00:02:12.890> know<00:02:13.010> what<00:02:13.160> you
