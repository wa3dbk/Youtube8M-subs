00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
how much of formula 1 is about aerobic

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:56.460 
how much of formula 1 is about aerobic
general<00:00:55.450> things<00:00:55.690> how<00:00:56.050> much<00:00:56.230> of<00:00:56.320> it<00:00:56.440> is

general things how much of it is

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.069 
general things how much of it is
specific<00:00:57.040> to<00:00:57.070> the<00:00:57.190> sport<00:00:57.489> we<00:00:58.030> expect<00:00:58.450> an<00:00:58.690> above

condition<00:01:00.730> but<00:01:01.720> certainly<00:01:02.019> our<00:01:02.140> guys<00:01:02.320> are<00:01:02.500> not

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590

marathon<00:01:02.949> runners<00:01:03.220> but<00:01:04.000> there's<00:01:04.210> some<00:01:04.330> very

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
marathon runners but there's some very

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.540 
marathon runners but there's some very
specific<00:01:04.750> work<00:01:05.140> that<00:01:05.320> we<00:01:05.379> need<00:01:05.409> to<00:01:05.650> do<00:01:05.800> for<00:01:06.340> the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
specific work that we need to do for the

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.090 
specific work that we need to do for the
muscles<00:01:07.210> of<00:01:07.300> control<00:01:07.630> the<00:01:07.780> head<00:01:08.229> and<00:01:08.440> neck<00:01:08.560> so

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
muscles of control the head and neck so

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:16.050 
muscles of control the head and neck so
that's<00:01:09.670> in<00:01:09.790> a<00:01:09.850> different<00:01:10.119> place<00:01:14.880> tell<00:01:15.880> me<00:01:15.970> this

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
that's in a different place tell me this

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.490 
that's in a different place tell me this
looks<00:01:16.330> like<00:01:16.479> you<00:01:16.630> brought<00:01:16.810> me<00:01:16.990> to<00:01:17.110> your<00:01:17.259> sort

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
looks like you brought me to your sort

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.350 
looks like you brought me to your sort
of<00:01:17.560> secret<00:01:17.920> and<00:01:18.220> torture<00:01:18.610> chamber<00:01:19.090> it<00:01:19.149> looks

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
of secret and torture chamber it looks

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.630 
of secret and torture chamber it looks
almost<00:01:19.960> like<00:01:20.290> a<00:01:20.380> thing<00:01:20.830> that<00:01:20.950> a<00:01:20.979> bond<00:01:21.280> Bonnie

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
almost like a thing that a bond Bonnie

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.900 
almost like a thing that a bond Bonnie
will<00:01:21.880> use<00:01:22.090> what<00:01:22.330> exactly<00:01:23.140> is<00:01:23.350> this<00:01:23.500> and<00:01:23.910> yeah

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
will use what exactly is this and yeah

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.730 
will use what exactly is this and yeah
we<00:01:25.119> have<00:01:25.270> this<00:01:25.360> machine<00:01:25.660> built<00:01:25.960> for<00:01:26.259> us<00:01:26.440> and

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
we have this machine built for us and

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.249 
we have this machine built for us and
really<00:01:27.160> to<00:01:27.670> try<00:01:27.880> and<00:01:28.030> reproduce<00:01:28.180> some<00:01:29.080> of<00:01:29.200> the

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
really to try and reproduce some of the

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:30.540 
really to try and reproduce some of the
loads<00:01:29.440> that<00:01:29.740> typically<00:01:30.160> a<00:01:30.280> driver

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
loads that typically a driver

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.320 
loads that typically a driver
experiences<00:01:31.300> when<00:01:31.479> he's<00:01:31.600> racing<00:01:31.960> or<00:01:32.080> tested

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
experiences when he's racing or tested

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.359 
experiences when he's racing or tested
so<00:01:34.330> this<00:01:34.479> is<00:01:34.509> this<00:01:35.080> is<00:01:35.259> a<00:01:35.289> simulating<00:01:36.100> what<00:01:36.130> the

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
so this is this is a simulating what the

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.389 
so this is this is a simulating what the
GP<00:01:36.869> what<00:01:37.869> is<00:01:37.990> this<00:01:38.140> is<00:01:38.289> simulating<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:38.920> G

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
GP what is this is simulating the G

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.940 
GP what is this is simulating the G
loading<00:01:39.729> on<00:01:39.850> a<00:01:39.880> cup<00:01:40.119> well<00:01:40.950> approximating

loading on a cup well approximating

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.590 
loading on a cup well approximating
giddy<00:01:42.100> you<00:01:42.340> can<00:01:42.520> never<00:01:42.640> get<00:01:42.850> exactly<00:01:43.240> what<00:01:43.330> you

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
giddy you can never get exactly what you

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.810 
giddy you can never get exactly what you
want<00:01:43.630> from<00:01:44.020> a<00:01:44.140> machine<00:01:44.289> but<00:01:44.920> so<00:01:45.160> it<00:01:45.369> gives<00:01:45.550> some

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
want from a machine but so it gives some

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.310 
want from a machine but so it gives some
idea<00:01:45.850> of<00:01:46.479> the<00:01:46.509> loads<00:01:46.840> that<00:01:47.080> you'll<00:01:47.229> actually

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
idea of the loads that you'll actually

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.440 
idea of the loads that you'll actually
have<00:01:47.679> to<00:01:47.860> tolerate<00:01:48.039> and<00:01:48.789> clearly<00:01:49.090> we<00:01:49.300> can

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
have to tolerate and clearly we can

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.270 
have to tolerate and clearly we can
design<00:01:49.600> training<00:01:50.050> programs<00:01:50.649> which<00:01:51.159> are

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
design training programs which are

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.370 
design training programs which are
bespoke<00:01:51.670> I<00:01:51.940> tell<00:01:52.659> you<00:01:52.750> what<00:01:52.780> why<00:01:53.110> don't<00:01:53.140> you

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
bespoke I tell you what why don't you

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.460 
bespoke I tell you what why don't you
just<00:01:53.530> try<00:01:53.770> this<00:01:54.250> load<00:01:55.240> that<00:01:55.750> we've<00:01:55.899> set<00:01:56.110> up<00:01:56.140> for

bring your head towards me crisis were

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:08.300 
bring your head towards me crisis were
under<00:02:01.079> control<00:02:03.289> come<00:02:04.289> back<00:02:04.469> towards<00:02:04.679> me<00:02:07.310> and

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
under control come back towards me and

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.860 
under control come back towards me and
then<00:02:08.369> hold<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.450> position<00:02:11.510> hear<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.629> a<00:02:12.720> lot

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
then hold this position hear it a lot

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.330 
then hold this position hear it a lot
when<00:02:13.019> we<00:02:13.170> listen<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.500> TV<00:02:13.680> commentary<00:02:14.190> and

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
when we listen to TV commentary and

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.089 
when we listen to TV commentary and
things<00:02:14.489> like<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:14.700> about<00:02:14.879> 3g<00:02:15.840> 4g<00:02:16.200> 50<00:02:16.920> what

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
things like that about 3g 4g 50 what

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.979 
things like that about 3g 4g 50 what
what<00:02:17.280> exactly<00:02:17.700> does<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:17.970> mean<00:02:18.030> yeah<00:02:18.780> the

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
what exactly does that mean yeah the

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.339 
what exactly does that mean yeah the
figure<00:02:19.500> 3<00:02:19.799> 4<00:02:20.099> or<00:02:20.129> 5<00:02:20.519> is<00:02:20.849> a<00:02:21.299> multiplication<00:02:21.720> of

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
figure 3 4 or 5 is a multiplication of

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.860 
figure 3 4 or 5 is a multiplication of
the<00:02:22.950> acceleration<00:02:23.519> due<00:02:23.549> to<00:02:23.700> gravity<00:02:23.870> so

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
the acceleration due to gravity so

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.890 
the acceleration due to gravity so
basically<00:02:25.410> if<00:02:25.950> your<00:02:26.700> head<00:02:27.030> with<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.420> helmet<00:02:27.660> on

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
basically if your head with a helmet on

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.050 
basically if your head with a helmet on
and<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.319> head<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.620> neck<00:02:28.709> safety<00:02:29.129> device<00:02:29.400> ways

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
and the head and neck safety device ways

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.150 
and the head and neck safety device ways
for<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.690> drive<00:02:30.930> about<00:02:31.140> six<00:02:31.590> six<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.130> half

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
for a drive about six six and a half

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.580 
for a drive about six six and a half
kilograms<00:02:32.819> if<00:02:33.420> you've<00:02:33.750> got<00:02:33.780> 3g<00:02:34.410> it's

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
kilograms if you've got 3g it's

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.740 
kilograms if you've got 3g it's
equivalent<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:35.130> multiplying<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.819> by<00:02:35.849> three<00:02:36.269> if

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
equivalent to multiplying it by three if

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.520 
equivalent to multiplying it by three if
you've<00:02:36.959> got<00:02:36.989> 4<00:02:37.290> g's<00:02:37.319> equivalence<00:02:38.010> x<00:02:38.610> 45<00:02:39.360> etc<00:02:40.019> so

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
you've got 4 g's equivalence x 45 etc so

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.289 
you've got 4 g's equivalence x 45 etc so
effectively<00:02:40.980> if<00:02:41.130> you've<00:02:41.250> got<00:02:41.370> 5<00:02:41.640> g<00:02:41.940> you're

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
effectively if you've got 5 g you're

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.660 
effectively if you've got 5 g you're
talking<00:02:42.660> about<00:02:42.840> over<00:02:43.140> 30<00:02:43.379> kilograms<00:02:43.769> of<00:02:44.160> force

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
talking about over 30 kilograms of force

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.000 
talking about over 30 kilograms of force
so<00:02:45.090> it's<00:02:45.239> almost<00:02:45.480> like<00:02:45.720> having<00:02:45.840> 30<00:02:46.560> bags<00:02:46.829> of

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
so it's almost like having 30 bags of

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.800 
so it's almost like having 30 bags of
sugar<00:02:47.160> straps<00:02:47.610> beside<00:02:47.940> your<00:02:48.090> head<00:02:48.239> yeah<00:02:48.599> it's

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
sugar straps beside your head yeah it's

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.940 
sugar straps beside your head yeah it's
a<00:02:48.840> big<00:02:48.989> load<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:51.780> g-forces<00:02:52.349> were<00:02:52.560> arguably

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
a big load the g-forces were arguably

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.619 
a big load the g-forces were arguably
the<00:02:53.160> biggest<00:02:53.340> challenge<00:02:53.879> facing<00:02:54.090> Honda

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
the biggest challenge facing Honda

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.869 
the biggest challenge facing Honda
deserve<00:02:54.959> driver<00:02:55.260> Christian<00:02:55.860> clien<00:02:56.220> as<00:02:56.670> he

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
deserve driver Christian clien as he

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.300 
deserve driver Christian clien as he
stepped<00:02:57.150> up<00:02:57.329> from<00:02:57.569> Formula<00:02:58.019> three<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.860> Formula

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
stepped up from Formula three to Formula

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.520 
stepped up from Formula three to Formula
One<00:02:59.459> obviously<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.780> chief<00:03:00.989> horses<00:03:01.349> in<00:03:01.470> a

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
One obviously the chief horses in a

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.390 
One obviously the chief horses in a
former<00:03:01.859> streak<00:03:02.160> are<00:03:02.400> relatively<00:03:03.060> low<00:03:03.269> and<00:03:04.400> you

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
former streak are relatively low and you

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.250 
former streak are relatively low and you
know<00:03:05.519> my<00:03:05.670> first<00:03:05.850> test<00:03:06.180> I<00:03:06.389> could<00:03:06.569> do<00:03:06.720> only<00:03:06.900> maybe

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
know my first test I could do only maybe

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.410 
know my first test I could do only maybe
about<00:03:07.500> 10<00:03:07.769> laps<00:03:08.010> in<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.340> row<00:03:08.489> and<00:03:08.700> then<00:03:09.090> my<00:03:09.239> neck

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
about 10 laps in a row and then my neck

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.890 
about 10 laps in a row and then my neck
was<00:03:09.660> really<00:03:09.959> was<00:03:10.319> really<00:03:10.590> tired<00:03:11.569> really<00:03:12.569> watch

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
was really was really tired really watch

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.589 
was really was really tired really watch
the<00:03:13.079> in-car<00:03:13.380> footage<00:03:13.440> of<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.910> drivers<00:03:15.329> had

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
the in-car footage of the drivers had

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.559 
the in-car footage of the drivers had
music<00:03:16.109> Robin<00:03:16.410> around<00:03:16.950> them<00:03:17.359> it's<00:03:18.359> very

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
music Robin around them it's very

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:19.910 
music Robin around them it's very
difficult<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:19.079> imagine<00:03:19.319> how<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:19.709> actually

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
difficult to imagine how you actually

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.800 
difficult to imagine how you actually
concentrate<00:03:20.459> I<00:03:20.880> mean<00:03:21.239> how<00:03:21.359> is<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:21.540> just

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
concentrate I mean how is it just

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.900 
concentrate I mean how is it just
something<00:03:21.959> that<00:03:22.170> you<00:03:22.260> get<00:03:22.410> used<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.799> I<00:03:23.010> think

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
something that you get used to I think

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.759 
something that you get used to I think
you<00:03:24.000> get<00:03:24.180> used<00:03:24.420> to<00:03:24.569> obviously<00:03:25.079> the<00:03:25.200> tracks<00:03:25.500> are

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
you get used to obviously the tracks are

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.800 
you get used to obviously the tracks are
quite<00:03:26.340> bumpy<00:03:26.609> and<00:03:26.940> there<00:03:27.450> are<00:03:27.569> a<00:03:27.599> lot<00:03:27.780> of

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
quite bumpy and there are a lot of

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.629 
quite bumpy and there are a lot of
vibrations<00:03:28.530> on<00:03:28.709> your<00:03:29.069> body<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.459> especially

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
vibrations on your body and especially

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.659 
vibrations on your body and especially
on<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.359> head<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.780> helmet<00:03:31.079> on<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.319> neck

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
on the head and the helmet on the neck

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:34.670 
on the head and the helmet on the neck
but<00:03:32.669> you<00:03:32.760> get<00:03:32.880> used<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.299> it<00:03:33.450> so<00:03:34.049> you<00:03:34.109> you<00:03:34.590> know

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
but you get used to it so you you know

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.839 
but you get used to it so you you know
it<00:03:34.769> doesn't<00:03:34.919> affect<00:03:35.340> actually<00:03:35.760> the

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
it doesn't affect actually the

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.690 
it doesn't affect actually the
concentration

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.970 

it's<00:03:39.300> all<00:03:39.480> about<00:03:39.690> control<00:03:39.959> I<00:03:40.410> think<00:03:40.860> that's

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
it's all about control I think that's

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.190 
it's all about control I think that's
what<00:03:41.129> people<00:03:41.360> underestimate<00:03:42.360> is<00:03:42.629> not<00:03:42.959> just

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
what people underestimate is not just

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.449 
what people underestimate is not just
about<00:03:43.290> strength<00:03:43.769> it's<00:03:43.980> not<00:03:44.129> just<00:03:44.370> about

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
about strength it's not just about

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.100 
about strength it's not just about
endurance<00:03:45.000> it's<00:03:45.209> about<00:03:45.420> controlling<00:03:45.870> the

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
endurance it's about controlling the

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.229 
endurance it's about controlling the
position<00:03:46.530> of<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.650> head<00:03:46.890> so<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.430> can<00:03:47.580> focus<00:03:47.910> on

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
position of the head so you can focus on

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:57.830 
position of the head so you can focus on
the<00:03:48.330> things<00:03:48.510> that<00:03:48.660> matter<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:52.340> stop<00:03:56.690> in<00:03:57.690> the

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
the things that matter to stop in the

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.990 
the things that matter to stop in the
corners<00:03:58.290> in<00:03:58.440> a<00:03:58.530> very<00:03:58.709> high<00:03:58.890> speed<00:03:59.190> corners<00:03:59.340> we

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
corners in a very high speed corners we

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.199 
corners in a very high speed corners we
get<00:04:00.180> up<00:04:00.390> to<00:04:00.599> like<00:04:00.780> four<00:04:01.530> to<00:04:01.709> five<00:04:01.739> G<00:04:02.250> lecturers

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
get up to like four to five G lecturers

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.420 
get up to like four to five G lecturers
and<00:04:03.510> that's<00:04:03.780> it's<00:04:04.560> quite<00:04:04.920> challenging<00:04:05.099> and

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
and that's it's quite challenging and

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.400 
and that's it's quite challenging and
this<00:04:08.430> presumably<00:04:08.790> tony<00:04:09.299> is<00:04:09.450> equivalent<00:04:09.959> to<00:04:09.989> 5g

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
this presumably tony is equivalent to 5g

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.920 
this presumably tony is equivalent to 5g
is<00:04:10.470> it<00:04:10.680> it's<00:04:11.310> nowhere<00:04:11.700> near<00:04:11.730> it<00:04:12.030> basically

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
is it it's nowhere near it basically

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.390 
is it it's nowhere near it basically
what<00:04:13.110> we've<00:04:13.260> got<00:04:13.440> now<00:04:13.470> is<00:04:13.680> a<00:04:13.920> very<00:04:14.190> simple

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
what we've got now is a very simple

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.849 
what we've got now is a very simple
warm-up<00:04:15.000> exercise<00:04:15.900> this<00:04:16.200> is<00:04:16.350> like<00:04:16.470> this<00:04:16.709> in

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
warm-up exercise this is like this in

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.349 
warm-up exercise this is like this in
the<00:04:16.950> wall<00:04:17.130> intent<00:04:17.489> that's<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:17.910> warm-up<00:04:18.209> an

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
the wall intent that's the warm-up an

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:19.789 
the wall intent that's the warm-up an
ass<00:04:18.479> the<00:04:18.630> lightest<00:04:18.989> load<00:04:19.200> we<00:04:19.380> would<00:04:19.530> ever<00:04:19.680> use

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
ass the lightest load we would ever use

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.400 
ass the lightest load we would ever use
so<00:04:20.609> could<00:04:20.910> my<00:04:20.940> Nate<00:04:21.359> withstand<00:04:21.780> the<00:04:21.900> strain<00:04:22.139> of

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
so could my Nate withstand the strain of

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.190 
so could my Nate withstand the strain of
a<00:04:22.500> couple<00:04:22.889> of<00:04:22.979> laps<00:04:23.190> in<00:04:23.430> a<00:04:23.520> grand<00:04:23.760> prix<00:04:24.030> car<00:04:24.240> hmm

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
a couple of laps in a grand prix car hmm

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.180 
a couple of laps in a grand prix car hmm
Tony's<00:04:26.040> answer<00:04:26.340> wasn't<00:04:26.580> exactly<00:04:27.030> encouraging

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
Tony's answer wasn't exactly encouraging

Tony's answer wasn't exactly encouraging
no<00:04:29.190> but<00:04:29.490> he<00:04:29.580> did<00:04:29.700> suggest<00:04:29.970> this<00:04:30.330> simple

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
no but he did suggest this simple

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.780 
no but he did suggest this simple
exercise<00:04:30.900> that<00:04:31.830> could<00:04:32.070> improve<00:04:32.280> everyone's

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
exercise that could improve everyone's

the muscle condition may be making a

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.190 
the muscle condition may be making a
little<00:04:35.040> bit<00:04:35.160> faster<00:04:35.370> than<00:04:35.700> it<00:04:35.820> is

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
little bit faster than it is

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.270 
little bit faster than it is
particularly<00:04:37.200> since<00:04:37.500> you<00:04:37.530> got<00:04:37.710> a<00:04:37.770> tiny<00:04:38.070> little

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
particularly since you got a tiny little

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.129 
particularly since you got a tiny little
dumbbell<00:04:38.580> double<00:04:39.479> that's<00:04:39.600> a<00:04:39.690> lot<00:04:39.840> bigger<00:04:40.020> than

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
dumbbell double that's a lot bigger than

mine<00:04:40.350> this<00:04:40.830> is<00:04:40.950> an<00:04:41.070> exercise<00:04:41.370> and<00:04:41.729> she's<00:04:41.850> great

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
mine this is an exercise and she's great

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.029 
mine this is an exercise and she's great
for<00:04:42.270> all-round<00:04:42.389> condition<00:04:43.020> the<00:04:43.830> legs

for all-round condition the legs

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.100 
for all-round condition the legs
obviously<00:04:44.430> have<00:04:44.789> to<00:04:44.880> drive<00:04:45.120> it<00:04:45.300> up<00:04:45.419> it<00:04:45.840> works

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
obviously have to drive it up it works

obviously have to drive it up it works
the<00:04:46.289> core<00:04:46.560> it<00:04:46.740> works<00:04:46.950> the<00:04:47.100> trunk<00:04:47.400> and

the core it works the trunk and

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.159 
the core it works the trunk and
obviously<00:04:48.120> works<00:04:48.330> the<00:04:48.479> shoulders<00:04:48.810> in<00:04:48.930> the<00:04:49.020> arm

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
obviously works the shoulders in the arm
