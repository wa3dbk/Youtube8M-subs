a little bit of a feeling of bondage
that<00:02:48.730> sort<00:02:49.180> of<00:02:49.239> I've<00:02:49.360> made<00:02:49.630> this<00:02:49.840> bed<00:02:50.140> and<00:02:50.290> now

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
that sort of I've made this bed and now

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.289 
that sort of I've made this bed and now
I<00:02:50.440> have<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.739> lie<00:02:50.950> in<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.280> and<00:02:51.459> and<00:02:51.610> even<00:02:52.120> though

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
I have to lie in it and and even though

I have to lie in it and and even though
I<00:02:52.540> would<00:02:52.930> like<00:02:53.079> to<00:02:53.110> reach<00:02:53.440> beyond<00:02:53.920> it<00:02:54.250> I<00:02:54.519> can't

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
I would like to reach beyond it I can't

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.660 
I would like to reach beyond it I can't
reach<00:02:55.690> far<00:02:55.989> beyond<00:02:56.319> this<00:02:56.590> sort<00:02:56.860> of<00:02:56.950> is<00:02:57.250> what<00:02:57.519> it

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
reach far beyond this sort of is what it

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.059 
reach far beyond this sort of is what it
is<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:58.269> so<00:02:58.750> I'm<00:02:58.900> feeling<00:02:59.140> a<00:02:59.380> little<00:02:59.470> bound<00:02:59.769> in

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
is and so I'm feeling a little bound in

is and so I'm feeling a little bound in
that<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:00.519> so<00:03:00.940> then<00:03:01.480> we<00:03:01.780> say<00:03:01.959> start<00:03:02.410> telling
