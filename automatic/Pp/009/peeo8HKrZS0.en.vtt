at all times no matter you know on the
price<00:03:27.730> rises<00:03:28.209> or<00:03:28.420> dips<00:03:28.690> even<00:03:29.650> through<00:03:29.829> this

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
price rises or dips even through this

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.680 
price rises or dips even through this
precious<00:03:30.340> metal<00:03:30.489> bull<00:03:30.760> market<00:03:31.120> or<00:03:31.150> even<00:03:31.389> after

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
precious metal bull market or even after

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.020 
precious metal bull market or even after
it<00:03:31.799> because<00:03:32.799> paper<00:03:33.100> currencies<00:03:33.639> are<00:03:33.790> paper

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
it because paper currencies are paper

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.330 
it because paper currencies are paper
currencies<00:03:34.540> and<00:03:34.750> they<00:03:34.870> always<00:03:35.079> fail<00:03:35.470> so<00:03:36.220> you

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
currencies and they always fail so you

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.360 
currencies and they always fail so you
have<00:03:36.639> to<00:03:36.819> keep<00:03:36.940> that<00:03:37.180> in<00:03:37.269> mind<00:03:37.889> and<00:03:38.889> you<00:03:39.010> always

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
have to keep that in mind and you always

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.069 
have to keep that in mind and you always
consistently<00:03:39.910> lose<00:03:40.269> your<00:03:40.450> purchasing<00:03:40.900> power

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
consistently lose your purchasing power

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.539 
consistently lose your purchasing power
so<00:03:41.200> you<00:03:41.380> have<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.650> keep<00:03:41.799> that<00:03:41.950> stuff<00:03:42.190> in<00:03:42.340> mind

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
so you have to keep that stuff in mind

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.910 
so you have to keep that stuff in mind
and<00:03:43.450> I<00:03:43.569> will<00:03:43.630> never<00:03:44.230> ever<00:03:44.440> be<00:03:44.709> without

skyrockets people sell out in the actual
mania<00:03:50.049> phase<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.620> bubble<00:03:50.859> that<00:03:50.889> takes

mania phase and the bubble that takes

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.280 
mania phase and the bubble that takes
shape<00:03:51.400> I<00:03:51.579> will<00:03:51.669> still<00:03:52.389> have<00:03:52.540> my<00:03:52.660> core<00:03:52.870> position

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290
