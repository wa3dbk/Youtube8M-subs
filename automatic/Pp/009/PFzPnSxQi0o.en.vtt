00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.240 

potassium<00:00:01.319> chlorate<00:00:01.650> is<00:00:02.100> an<00:00:02.610> oxidant<00:00:03.149> and<00:00:04.250> so

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
potassium chlorate is an oxidant and so

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.130 
potassium chlorate is an oxidant and so
it's<00:00:05.609> a<00:00:05.730> ready<00:00:05.970> source<00:00:06.150> of<00:00:06.390> Austin<00:00:06.779> for<00:00:06.990> the

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
it's a ready source of Austin for the

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.959 
it's a ready source of Austin for the
for<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.799> dehydration<00:00:08.610> process<00:00:10.580> that's<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.700> high

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
for a dehydration process that's a high

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.000 
for a dehydration process that's a high
can<00:00:12.900> we<00:00:12.929> turn<00:00:13.170> up<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:15.800> mic<00:00:16.800> where's

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
can we turn up the mic where's

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:25.400 
can we turn up the mic where's
internalized<00:00:17.490> out<00:00:22.970> there<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.060> go<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:25.140> first

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
internalized out there you go so first

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.810 
internalized out there you go so first
we<00:00:25.769> melt<00:00:26.519> um<00:00:27.980> the<00:00:28.980> potassium<00:00:29.310> chlorate

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
we melt um the potassium chlorate

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.700 
we melt um the potassium chlorate
because<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:31.019> contact<00:00:31.710> with<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:33.380> Jolly<00:00:34.380> Roger

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
because the contact with the Jolly Roger

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.080 
because the contact with the Jolly Roger
will<00:00:35.130> be<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> lot<00:00:35.489> better<00:00:35.670> because<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.000> just

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
will be a lot better because you just

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.940 
will be a lot better because you just
have<00:00:36.239> powder<00:00:36.510> touching<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.140> solid<00:00:37.620> they<00:00:37.800> don't

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
have powder touching a solid they don't

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.660 
have powder touching a solid they don't
really<00:00:38.129> mix<00:00:38.280> very<00:00:38.489> intimately<00:00:38.910> but<00:00:39.120> if<00:00:39.239> we<00:00:39.390> can

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
really mix very intimately but if we can

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.479 
really mix very intimately but if we can
I<00:00:42.170> should<00:00:43.170> have<00:00:43.290> tested<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.920> first<00:00:44.219> to

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
I should have tested this first to

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.130 
I should have tested this first to
subscribe<00:00:45.200> shoot<00:00:47.809> hopefully<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:48.960> big

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
subscribe shoot hopefully this is big

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.360 
subscribe shoot hopefully this is big
enough<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.379> fit<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:49.710> there<00:00:49.800> because<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.190> looks

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
enough to fit in there because it looks

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.910 
enough to fit in there because it looks
kind<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.760> Epis<00:00:51.239> melted<00:00:51.739> smell<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:54.770> when<00:00:55.770> all

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
kind of Epis melted smell it when all

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.459 
kind of Epis melted smell it when all
else<00:00:56.129> fails<00:00:56.899> neighbors<00:00:57.899> him<00:00:58.140> did<00:00:58.379> you

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
else fails neighbors him did you

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.360 
else fails neighbors him did you
difference<00:00:58.829> major<00:00:59.129> yeah<00:01:00.980> just<00:01:01.980> breaking<00:01:02.340> a

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
difference major yeah just breaking a

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.399 
difference major yeah just breaking a
little<00:01:02.579> pieces<00:01:03.019> this<00:01:04.019> makes<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.320> more

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
little pieces this makes it more

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.780 
little pieces this makes it more
challenging<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.890> drop<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.339> there<00:01:05.489> because<00:01:05.640> in

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
challenging to drop in there because in

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.969 
challenging to drop in there because in
the<00:01:05.850> first<00:01:06.000> one<00:01:06.240> hits<00:01:06.530> hopefully<00:01:07.530> your<00:01:07.619> hand

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the first one hits hopefully your hand

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.420 
the first one hits hopefully your hand
is<00:01:08.189> not<00:01:08.340> over<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.729> top<00:01:10.100> second<00:01:11.100> won't<00:01:11.250> you

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
is not over the top second won't you

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.270 
is not over the top second won't you
like<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> spoon<00:01:12.150> or<00:01:12.299> something<00:01:13.790> loser<00:01:14.790> pet<00:01:16.280> your

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
like a spoon or something loser pet your

like a spoon or something loser pet your
what<00:01:17.490> here<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.119> test

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
what here the test

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.249 
what here the test
I<00:01:22.210> might<00:01:23.210> go<00:01:23.360> to<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:23.509> ramrod<00:01:23.750> but<00:01:24.079> i<00:01:24.140> have

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
I might go to the ramrod but i have

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.200 
I might go to the ramrod but i have
class<00:01:24.290> I<00:01:24.829> don't<00:01:24.979> want<00:01:25.100> to<00:01:25.159> a<00:01:25.369> class<00:01:25.640> a<00:01:25.670> playoff

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
class I don't want to a class a playoff
