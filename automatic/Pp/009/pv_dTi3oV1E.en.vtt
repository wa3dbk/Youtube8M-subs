create an if statement to put back

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:13.240 
create an if statement to put back
inside<00:02:07.220> so<00:02:08.220> if<00:02:10.100> pressed<00:02:11.480> no<00:02:12.480> sorry<00:02:12.780> press

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:21.800 
inside so if pressed no sorry press
equals<00:02:15.319> 0<00:02:18.769> open<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:20.150> close<00:02:21.150> bracket<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:21.630> if<00:02:21.780> r

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
equals 0 open and close bracket so if r

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.229 
equals 0 open and close bracket so if r
is<00:02:21.930> equal<00:02:22.049> 0<00:02:22.470> draw<00:02:22.769> that<00:02:22.920> bit<00:02:23.100> of<00:02:23.130> text<00:02:23.489> let's

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
is equal 0 draw that bit of text let's

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:30.680 
is equal 0 draw that bit of text let's
copy<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.720> paste<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:27.049> and<00:02:29.269> this<00:02:30.269> time<00:02:30.480> is<00:02:30.600> going

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
copy and paste it and this time is going

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.630 
copy and paste it and this time is going
to<00:02:30.750> be<00:02:30.840> in<00:02:31.080> fair<00:02:31.260> price<00:02:31.470> equals<00:02:31.830> 1<00:02:32.040> so<00:02:32.310> if<00:02:32.489> you

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
to be in fair price equals 1 so if you

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.060

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
I'm gonna actually make a different

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.309

version of press the button the

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.729 
version of press the button the
in<00:03:40.379> place<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.980> same<00:03:41.189> way<00:03:41.599> but<00:03:42.599> i'm<00:03:43.469> going<00:03:43.650> to

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
in place the same way but i'm going to

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.530 
in place the same way but i'm going to
create<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.069> object<00:03:44.159> differently<00:03:44.519> and<00:03:45.060> i<00:03:45.480> do

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
create the object differently and i do

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.970 
create the object differently and i do
believe<00:03:45.689> this<00:03:46.079> is<00:03:46.200> actually<00:03:46.290> a<00:03:46.469> better<00:03:46.709> way<00:03:46.920> to

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980
