00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello girls welcome to my channel 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.910
 continuing with natural products 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.099
 today I'm going to talk to you about maybe not 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.929
 is very well known but that I 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.500
 a lot of time my boss also what 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:18.850
 love and it's red tea 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:21.790
 who call it in strong Chinese culture 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.700
 it's pretty good and basically we 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:27.100
 it serves for red antioxidants 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:30.160
 but to rejuvenate does not have four 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:33.880
 basic uses that I know are going to 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.440
 love and the first is your high power 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.539
 diuretic does not allow 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.910
 inflamed in the face the inflamed 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.559
 legs are inflamed nothing to have 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.829
 fluid retention of the moments in 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:52.160
 those of us who have the period and help 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:57.700
 eliminate toxins naturally 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:01:01.670
 the second use is totally digestive 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:05.810
 It is stimulating the production or 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.000
 generation of bile salts is 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.890
 he needed the bile then he's going to 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.220
 help instead of taking a fas tal or 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.080
 any other little pill for the 700 and 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.720
 you take it before eating or you're going to 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.720
 help the food you fall very well 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.830
 the third place this is to go down 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.110
 weight should help accelerate a 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.440
 metabolism and it's taking out the fat that 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.050
 have accumulated in the liver 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.170
 so if you take two cups a day of 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.490
 this topic being concentrated is to say or 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:44.610
 prepare your cup with your tea bag 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:48.900
 red and let it stand about 5 to 10 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:52.200
 minutes or while she what is dry you 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.000
 you place half a teaspoon with half 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.550
 teaspoon according to account remember 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.619
 cover it to concentrate the steam and 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.330
 you can concentrate the tea that's going 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.270
 help reduce remember to take it before 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.520
 of eating first in fasting and in 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.040
 second place in the afternoon before the 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.720
 dinner with taking it twice a day as 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.060
 a week will begin to see results 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.950
 there is also something called the 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.320
 fast of the red tea and you can make it a 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.989
 weekend just to get off 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.750
 fast weight or detoxify your body 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.210
 it really is very good for example if it goes 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.310
 to go to the beach or something 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.740
 is to see you as more stylized more 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.980
 qualified then what you have to do 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:36.300
 it is in those days first do not eat dairy 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:39.540
 because red tea is not called movement 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.640
 then first do not eat dairy what 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.960
 you're going to do is eat your three 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.660
 meals with vegetables and fruits always 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.000
 with vegetables and fruits and a cup of tea 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.160
 red before them and this is going to 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.870
 Detoxify or sow all metabolism 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.600
 the most you going to do to draw the 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.180
 fats that are in your liver because you 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.620
 body consume the reserves this is 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.840
 great to do the days not in terms 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.970
 of mana ordered Thursday and Friday before 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.400
 to go to the beach really is excellent 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.110
 and you get it says pink and red tea what 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.870
 you can get in any store that 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.610
 sells simply there in any 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.490
 shop to take out of grain and all 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.770
 these things you go and ask for iron not 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.110
 this one from jamaica although they may have the 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.430
 same color no no no no this leaves a mark 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.710
 Jamaican tea has a very flavor 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.810
 characteristic red tea is something else 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.270
 totally different 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.400
 ok and also in Chinese stores is 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.080
 where I buy it if you see one of 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.330
 these Chinese stores that sells little things 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.030
 this is there you go with if you red 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.910
 because he is their favorite 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.550
 Asian culture loves him and is one of 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.220
 your secrets to stay in shape and 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.630
 the last use and that is more important is 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.819
 that helps a lot to decrease the 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.470
 cholesterol then the people who have 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.410
 tendency for cholesterol to rise or 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.900
 have a hereditary disease that 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.340
 causes your cholesterol to rise 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.620
 regardless of what they take if 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.569
 they drink a cup of red tea a day 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.950
 preferably in the morning they go to 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.959
 maintain their levels of 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.790
 cholesterol 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.980
 then girls these were the four 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.040
 we like red tea I hope you have them 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.900
 liked this is special for beauty 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.579
 and health because if you have a good 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.070
 state of health that is going to be this 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.650
 beautiful on the outside and inside because the 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.990
 mental health will also be beautiful 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.729
 inside then we see each other in the 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.470
 next video how many months ago when 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:32.120
