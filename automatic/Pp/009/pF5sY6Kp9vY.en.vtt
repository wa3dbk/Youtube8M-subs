so<00:00:04.470> in<00:00:04.710> part<00:00:05.160> 1<00:00:05.490> of<00:00:05.819> how<00:00:06.690> which<00:00:07.020> chords<00:00:07.470> go<00:00:07.680> well

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
so in part 1 of how which chords go well

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.120 
so in part 1 of how which chords go well
together<00:00:08.130> I<00:00:09.200> showed<00:00:10.200> you<00:00:10.230> handle<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.800> find<00:00:11.010> a

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
together I showed you handle to find a

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.430 
together I showed you handle to find a
group<00:00:11.340> of<00:00:11.460> courts<00:00:11.759> will<00:00:11.880> go<00:00:12.000> well<00:00:12.179> together

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440 
group of courts will go well together

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.129 
group of courts will go well together
based<00:00:13.440> upon<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.740> major<00:00:13.980> scale<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.990> with<00:00:15.990> this

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
based upon a major scale and with this

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.370 
based upon a major scale and with this

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.980 
video part 2 i'm explaining to you why
those<00:00:19.800> chords<00:00:20.400> go<00:00:20.580> well<00:00:20.820> together<00:00:21.060> so<00:00:21.689> here's

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
those chords go well together so here's

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.560 
those chords go well together so here's
how<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.170> play<00:00:22.439> AC<00:00:22.769> major<00:00:22.800> scale<00:00:23.220> starting<00:00:23.789> on

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
how to play AC major scale starting on

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:43.310 
how to play AC major scale starting on
the<00:00:24.689> fifth<00:00:24.930> string<00:00:41.270> so<00:00:42.270> that's<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.600> across<00:00:42.930> two

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
the fifth string so that's it across two

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.889 
the fifth string so that's it across two
octaves<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.239> as<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.360> can<00:00:45.480> see<00:00:45.510> from<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
octaves and as you can see from the

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.410 
octaves and as you can see from the
diagram<00:00:46.460> that<00:00:47.460> will<00:00:47.610> show<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.820> where<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.270> put

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
call them now if we take the C major

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.170 
call them now if we take the C major
scale<00:01:01.550> just<00:01:02.550> take<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.820> first<00:01:03.030> note<00:01:05.030> if<00:01:06.030> we

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
scale just take the first note if we

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.960 
scale just take the first note if we
take<00:01:06.360> two<00:01:06.750> notes<00:01:07.020> any<00:01:07.500> two<00:01:07.950> notes<00:01:08.220> then<00:01:08.610> we

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
take two notes any two notes then we

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.990 
take two notes any two notes then we
call<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:10.040> musical<00:01:11.040> distance<00:01:11.430> between<00:01:11.820> them

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
call the musical distance between them

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.750 
call the musical distance between them
an<00:01:12.090> interval<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.950> some<00:01:13.950> intervals<00:01:14.460> we

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
an interval and some intervals we

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.760 
an interval and some intervals we
particularly<00:01:15.210> like<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.390> sound<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.320> some

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
particularly like the sound of and some

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.880 
particularly like the sound of and some
intervals<00:01:17.369> less<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:19.170> if<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.470> took<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.770> first

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
intervals less so so if I took the first

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.960 
intervals less so so if I took the first
and<00:01:20.250> second<00:01:20.670> loads<00:01:22.400> play<00:01:23.400> them<00:01:23.610> at<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.790> same

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
and second loads play them at the same

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.190 
and second loads play them at the same
time<00:01:26.240> something<00:01:27.240> but<00:01:27.390> they<00:01:27.479> like<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.900> sound

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
time something but they like that sound

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.940 
time something but they like that sound
too<00:01:28.409> much

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
too much

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.310 
too much
I<00:01:30.039> went<00:01:30.789> to<00:01:30.880> take<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.180> first<00:01:31.390> and<00:01:31.810> third<00:01:32.200> notes

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
I went to take the first and third notes

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.719 
I went to take the first and third notes
play<00:01:35.320> them<00:01:35.500> at<00:01:35.619> the<00:01:35.680> same<00:01:35.860> time<00:01:38.399> that<00:01:39.399> tends<00:01:39.640> to

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
play them at the same time that tends to

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.440 
play them at the same time that tends to
give<00:01:39.909> a<00:01:39.969> sound<00:01:40.210> that<00:01:40.360> we<00:01:40.509> like<00:01:40.750> a<00:01:40.780> lot<00:01:42.450> so

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
give a sound that we like a lot so

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.569 
give a sound that we like a lot so
basically<00:01:43.960> what<00:01:44.170> we<00:01:44.289> do<00:01:44.439> is<00:01:44.649> we<00:01:45.130> continue

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
basically what we do is we continue

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:47.899 
basically what we do is we continue
doing<00:01:45.909> that<00:01:45.939> it's<00:01:46.390> called<00:01:46.659> piling<00:01:47.259> on<00:01:47.380> third

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
doing that it's called piling on third

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.990 
doing that it's called piling on third
so<00:01:48.909> I<00:01:48.939> take<00:01:49.149> the<00:01:49.210> first<00:01:49.479> note<00:01:49.720> from<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:50.020> scale

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
so I take the first note from the scale

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.730 
so I take the first note from the scale
and<00:01:52.000> then<00:01:52.329> I<00:01:52.450> take<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.689> cam<00:01:53.140> top<00:01:53.380> from<00:01:53.560> there

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
and then I take the cam top from there

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.550 
and then I take the cam top from there
three<00:01:54.130> notes<00:01:55.860> then<00:01:56.860> take<00:01:57.100> those<00:01:57.280> two<00:01:57.549> notes

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
three notes then take those two notes

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.559 
three notes then take those two notes
come<00:01:59.560> together<00:02:01.319> then<00:02:02.319> take<00:02:02.649> that<00:02:03.330> note<00:02:04.330> and

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
come together then take that note and

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.960 
come together then take that note and
count<00:02:04.990> up<00:02:05.140> again<00:02:05.380> three<00:02:05.950> notes<00:02:06.189> from<00:02:06.459> there

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.770 

and<00:02:09.970> then<00:02:10.090> end<00:02:10.269> up<00:02:10.390> with<00:02:10.539> that<00:02:10.630> note<00:02:12.450> if<00:02:13.450> I<00:02:13.569> take

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
and then end up with that note if I take

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.479 
and then end up with that note if I take
those<00:02:13.959> three<00:02:14.290> notes<00:02:14.440> together<00:02:14.709> I've<00:02:15.280> got

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
those three notes together I've got

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:21.539 
those three notes together I've got
scene<00:02:15.819> II<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:18.120> Jim<00:02:19.319> if<00:02:20.319> I<00:02:20.500> planeloads<00:02:21.099> of<00:02:21.099> c

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
scene II and Jim if I planeloads of c

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.660 
scene II and Jim if I planeloads of c
ing<00:02:22.090> together<00:02:22.630> lo<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:23.440> behold

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.199 

I<00:02:25.819> get<00:02:26.300> a<00:02:26.330> C<00:02:26.630> major<00:02:26.959> chord<00:02:27.910> you'll<00:02:28.910> see<00:02:29.090> that

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
I get a C major chord you'll see that

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.010 
I get a C major chord you'll see that
I'm<00:02:29.330> strumming<00:02:29.750> five<00:02:30.050> strings<00:02:30.560> their<00:02:31.840> sex<00:02:32.840> if

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
I'm strumming five strings their sex if

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.640 
I'm strumming five strings their sex if
a<00:02:33.110> blight<00:02:33.319> like<00:02:33.500> that<00:02:35.050> but<00:02:36.050> if<00:02:36.110> you<00:02:36.200> go<00:02:36.380> through

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
a blight like that but if you go through

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.650 
a blight like that but if you go through
each<00:02:36.800> of<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:37.160> strings<00:02:37.489> and<00:02:37.819> work<00:02:38.180> out<00:02:38.450> which

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
each of the strings and work out which

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.750 
each of the strings and work out which
note<00:02:38.930> is<00:02:39.110> being<00:02:39.349> played<00:02:39.590> every<00:02:40.310> single<00:02:40.610> one<00:02:40.730> of

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
note is being played every single one of

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.090 
note is being played every single one of
those<00:02:40.940> notes<00:02:41.239> is<00:02:41.450> either<00:02:41.630> a<00:02:41.840> C<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.380> E<00:02:42.830> orgy<00:02:45.100> so

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
those notes is either a C and E orgy so

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.010 
those notes is either a C and E orgy so
if<00:02:46.190> we're<00:02:46.280> doing<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.520> same<00:02:46.640> again<00:02:47.000> but<00:02:47.900> this

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
if we're doing the same again but this

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.449 
if we're doing the same again but this
time<00:02:48.080> taking<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.650> second<00:02:49.010> note<00:02:49.130> of<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.370> scale

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.790 
time taking the second note of the scale
so<00:02:50.090> remember<00:02:50.330> we're<00:02:50.450> taking<00:02:50.750> C<00:02:50.989> major<00:02:51.200> I've

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
so remember we're taking C major I've

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.380 
so remember we're taking C major I've
chosen<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.220> see<00:02:52.400> major<00:02:52.610> because<00:02:53.030> it's<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.269> one

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
chosen to see major because it's the one

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.630 
chosen to see major because it's the one
scale<00:02:53.780> that's<00:02:53.930> got<00:02:54.080> no<00:02:54.230> sharps<00:02:54.650> or<00:02:54.769> flats<00:02:54.830> the

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
scale that's got no sharps or flats the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:04.390 
scale that's got no sharps or flats the
notes<00:02:55.849> of<00:02:56.000> C<00:02:56.209> major<00:02:56.239> are<00:02:56.750> c<00:02:57.110> d<00:02:57.530> e<00:02:57.800> f<00:02:58.190> g<00:02:58.310> a<00:02:59.060> b<00:03:03.370> so<00:03:04.370> i

beginners this this method is called

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:08.249 
beginners this this method is called
harmonizing<00:05:06.370> the<00:05:06.400> major<00:05:06.669> scale<00:05:06.909> and<00:05:07.389> for

harmonizing the major scale and for

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:11.640 
harmonizing the major scale and for
those<00:05:08.380> of<00:05:08.440> you<00:05:08.919> who<00:05:10.110> would<00:05:11.110> probably<00:05:11.500> say

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
those of you who would probably say

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.460 
those of you who would probably say
lucky<00:05:12.039> enough<00:05:12.340> to<00:05:12.639> understand<00:05:13.449> written<00:05:14.319> music

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
lucky enough to understand written music

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.029 
lucky enough to understand written music
then<00:05:15.310> he's<00:05:15.699> the<00:05:15.880> harmonized<00:05:16.560> C<00:05:17.560> major<00:05:17.770> scale

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
then he's the harmonized C major scale

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:30.629 
then he's the harmonized C major scale
in<00:05:18.460> a<00:05:19.419> musical<00:05:20.169> notation

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:32.790 

so<00:05:31.449> what<00:05:31.659> we've<00:05:31.810> done<00:05:31.840> there<00:05:32.229> is<00:05:32.439> we've<00:05:32.650> taken

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
so what we've done there is we've taken

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:39.330 
so what we've done there is we've taken
a<00:05:33.039> major<00:05:33.219> scale<00:05:33.580> in<00:05:34.030> this<00:05:34.509> example<00:05:34.719> C<00:05:38.219> and<00:05:39.219> we

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
a major scale in this example C and we

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.659 
a major scale in this example C and we
built<00:05:39.669> up<00:05:39.909> a<00:05:40.210> group<00:05:40.539> of<00:05:40.749> court<00:05:41.139> and<00:05:41.560> each<00:05:42.430> of

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
built up a group of court and each of

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:45.510 
built up a group of court and each of
those<00:05:42.789> chords<00:05:43.419> are<00:05:43.539> only<00:05:43.749> using<00:05:44.259> notes<00:05:44.710> from

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
those chords are only using notes from

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.119 
those chords are only using notes from
that<00:05:46.090> single<00:05:46.419> scale<00:05:46.870> in<00:05:47.319> our<00:05:47.469> example<00:05:47.560> the<00:05:47.949> C

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:48.129 
that single scale in our example the C

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:51.029 
that single scale in our example the C
major<00:05:48.340> scale<00:05:48.610> and<00:05:49.499> that's<00:05:50.499> the<00:05:50.650> reason<00:05:50.770> may

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 
major scale and that's the reason may

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:52.769 
major scale and that's the reason may
sound<00:05:51.249> good<00:05:51.400> together<00:05:51.610> so<00:05:52.300> I<00:05:52.330> hope<00:05:52.539> now<00:05:52.719> you
