00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.129
 was to filter data with visual basic 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:11.769
 for visual applications see 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.709
 let's see here we have an example of the 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:18.369
 many that we're going to make an example of 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:20.770
 how some data is filtered for the 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:24.760
 example we are going to have here is called 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:27.730
 excel search engine if we call it what 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:32.119
 What it does is search for data within a 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.879
 listed in this case of products 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.170
 and within this product we have these 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.969
 data 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.480
 and let's look inside the 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:46.200
 description 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.200
 data for example cream sauces 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:53.010
 wine yes 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.510
 we only need 31 to do the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.899
 search 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.850
 one where all the products are and one 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.429
 third we indicate by which column 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.199
 let's look healthy in this case let's 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:09.900
 search by column 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:13.140
 2 that is, the column of products 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.260
 of the product description then 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.120
 how it works we simply tell you here 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.900
 look for me this product in this case 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:26.410
 says I have tuna here 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:30.910
 and what does it bring me all the products 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.910
 whose registration is tuna 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.820
 the same could do with wine 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.860
 managed all the products that 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.580
 they have wine that are inside this 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:49.720
 list 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.720
 another product can be salsa 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:58.120
 and while of all the products whose 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.250
 description have the word sauce 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.860
 has many applications we are going to do 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.860
 a subdivision here tomato sauce 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:24.590
 and while of all the products whose 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.590
 tomato sauce 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.830
 What else can we attract here? 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.300
 for example 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:45.360
 if you bring me all the products we are going to 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.360
 see what other example compotes 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.420
 and we already have all the floodgates 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.620
 and we are going to bring everything 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.220
 so this template works only 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.220
 has a macro between those macro has 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.849
 basic visual code that later 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.980
 and we will publish so that they can 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:24.980
 to download
