going<00:01:28.040> on<00:01:28.220> stage<00:01:28.250> for<00:01:28.760> example<00:01:29.210> I<00:01:29.390> think<00:01:29.840> this

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
going on stage for example I think this

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.710 
going on stage for example I think this
is<00:01:29.990> probably<00:01:30.110> even<00:01:30.560> more<00:01:30.710> important<00:01:31.550> than<00:01:32.479> to

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
is probably even more important than to

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.630 
is probably even more important than to
see<00:01:32.960> me<00:01:33.110> on<00:01:33.229> stage<00:01:33.380> because<00:01:33.920> people<00:01:34.430> saw<00:01:34.610> me

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
see me on stage because people saw me

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.219 
see me on stage because people saw me
onstage<00:01:34.880> before<00:01:39.160> it's<00:01:40.160> very<00:01:40.369> difficult<00:01:40.640> to

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
onstage before it's very difficult to

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.710
