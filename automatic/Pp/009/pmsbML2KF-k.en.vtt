00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.120
 the materials that we need for this 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.910
 project is a wooden altarpiece or 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.850
 mdf in this case I have one of drawer 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.460
 but they can use a wood rooted 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:22.900
 in mdf sprinkling we need then 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:26.490
 also silk paper can be recycled 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:30.270
 it does not matter what you have 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.040
 we are going to need a wood cut 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.930
 in this case I have a margarita that is 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.270
 of 4 millimeters thick you 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.829
 can have a fruit another type of flower 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.260
 whichever you wish 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:44.199
 let's also use brushes 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:48.110
 different sizes a super spatula 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:51.440
 important we need white vinyl 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:55.780
 glue or vinyl glue we need 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.719
 vanilla color white and coffee 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:02.000
 and we're also going to need stucco 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:04.190
 plastic from which it is already prepared 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.340
 the next process then we go 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.650
 to do is dilute the glue a measure 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.170
 of glue with a measure of water that 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.970
 is diluted and then we will apply 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.550
 on the altarpiece we are going to take also 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.970
 the paper and we're going to wrinkle it very very 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.640
 all right 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.600
 to be able to place it then 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.960
 we started to apply the abundant glue 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.850
 throughout the altarpiece and after that 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.610
 we have done this we are going to place the 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.770
 paper on top so it stays with the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.050
 wrinkled texture and then we go back to 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.500
 put back glue with the brush 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:45.450
 over there all over the altarpiece again 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.450
 until it is even 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.640
 after there is master this process 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.790
 and that we let the paper dry and 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.420
 all we are going then to sand the edges 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:01.720
 with a sandpaper it can be a sandpaper 180 for 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.540
 then remove the excess paper 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.670
 that we have here I have another altarpiece 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.009
 that I already worked in this case with a paper 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.350
 I've already removed all the edges 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.630
 It is also dry after having 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.700
 applied the glue and everything and he 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.730
 next thing we're going to do is give you a 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.830
 base color to this project in this case 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.470
 I'm going to use a blue color here 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:28.769
 I have another altarpiece that I already paint with 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.769
 blue acrylic to start working it 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.220
 now the next step we are going to take a 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.540
 brush that this old man dreamed like 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.490
 we say here in my country 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.130
 let's take then also a 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.220
 poquitico white vinyl or acrylic 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.830
 white and we will download it over a 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.410
 role a mess the important thing in this 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.930
 technique is that the brush does not remain 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:55.010
 loaded with paint but very little and 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:58.650
 let's move it gently very very smooth 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:01.560
 especially the altarpiece to highlight 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.810
 the texture that we have had this technique 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.560
 it's called dry brush what we're 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.560
 applying here 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.910
 the next step that we are going to take 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.070
 then it is to put the plastic stucco in 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.530
 a container we are going to take our 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:25.580
 trimming and with the spatula we are going to 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:29.710
 start to place the stucco on each one 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:33.340
 of the petals and give shape to each 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.340
 space that we are working 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.590
 we go then now to take we have already 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:55.480
 made each one of the petals we are going to 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.450
 take then with the spatula more 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.239
 amount of stucco to make the seed 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.730
 we are going to use quite a lot and 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:06.640
 let's do in this case not a circle 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.709
 but an oval by the design of the 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.950
 daisy that we're working on and we're going 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:16.209
 to go distributing it carefully with the 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:18.639
 spatula and for now to finish after 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:22.000
 If we have given it the form, we will 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:24.940
 work him a texture doing like 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.460
 piquitos making little circles so that 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.850
 is the texture of the seed 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.340
 and we're going to let him out from 15 to 20 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.229
 approximately minutes depending on the 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.390
 weather of you until it stays with 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:40.790
 hard consistency 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.430
 here I have then already my dry figure in 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:46.160
 this case I just applied a layer 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.200
 of a cream color that is removed from 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.900
 lowering the vanilla color with a 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.870
 little bit of white then then we're going to 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.940
 start making the volume the shadows 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.000
 of the petals for that I take my brush 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:02.930
 diagonal and pulled apart a little bit of 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.940
 coffee and a little bit of vanilla and 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.040
 I dissolve with the same brush to 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.900
 start applying the shadows we have 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.480
 to take into account and define before 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.010
 where will the lights go and where are they going to 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.010
 go the shadows of each of the 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:21.170
 petals and so we will continue to work 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:23.840
 those on the side with coffee are going to 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:27.130
 work all the shadows until 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.130
 let's finish each one of the petals 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.760
 after having painted then all 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:50.490
 the shadows we go to the ends your side 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.490
 opposite with white paint the lights 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.380
 I have then now the daisy 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:02.530
 finished painted I have just applied 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.840
 the lights and shadows in each of 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.270
 the petals for the seed I applied a 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:10.090
 coffee base and then with another coffee more 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.789
 dark applied asia around I took 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:16.030
 then also three flower appliques 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:18.490
 three different sizes sticking the most 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.860
 small upstairs so that one would see a 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.830
 feeling of perspective in the box 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.840
 then then I hit the sconces with 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.659
 Hot silicone gun 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.680
 silicone over there then finalize 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:34.960
 our painting ending with a resin 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.659
 over to make it look better 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.960
 quality in this kind of pictures is a lot 

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:42.550
 better finish with resin well I hope 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.250
