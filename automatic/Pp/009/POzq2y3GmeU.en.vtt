00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
hey guys so on got the engine apart here

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.230 
hey guys so on got the engine apart here
the<00:00:04.140> crank<00:00:04.470> and<00:00:04.740> it's<00:00:05.009> not<00:00:05.250> looking<00:00:05.819> too<00:00:06.000> good

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
the crank and it's not looking too good

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.470 
the crank and it's not looking too good
as<00:00:07.109> you<00:00:07.919> can<00:00:08.069> see<00:00:08.309> by<00:00:08.580> all<00:00:08.730> that<00:00:08.880> nasty<00:00:09.450> stuff

as you can see by all that nasty stuff

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.290 
as you can see by all that nasty stuff
that's<00:00:09.840> all<00:00:10.019> engine<00:00:10.410> sludge<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:10.980> got<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.059> cam

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
that's all engine sludge and got the cam

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.349 
that's all engine sludge and got the cam
off<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.750> clean<00:00:13.080> all<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:13.320> off<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:14.150> yeah<00:00:16.250> yeah

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359 
off I clean all that off and yeah yeah

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.150 
off I clean all that off and yeah yeah
but<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.390> got<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.869> pretty<00:00:19.230> much<00:00:19.439> cleaned<00:00:19.770> up<00:00:19.980> but

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
but I got it pretty much cleaned up but

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.200 
but I got it pretty much cleaned up but
uh<00:00:21.410> I<00:00:22.410> still<00:00:22.920> need<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.130> take<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.430> crank<00:00:23.699> outlaw

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
uh I still need to take the crank outlaw

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
uh I still need to take the crank outlaw
but<00:00:24.510> it's<00:00:24.750> not<00:00:25.140> really<00:00:25.890> looking<00:00:26.460> up<00:00:27.050> too<00:00:28.050> much

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
but it's not really looking up too much

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.679 
but it's not really looking up too much
but<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.369> do<00:00:29.429> have<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.849> question<00:00:30.119> about<00:00:30.420> this

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
but I do have a question about this

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.819 
but I do have a question about this
engine<00:00:31.199> um<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.830> couple<00:00:32.430> actually<00:00:33.200> why<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:34.260> the

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
engine um a couple actually why is the

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.620 
engine um a couple actually why is the
intake<00:00:35.280> valve<00:00:35.309> bigger<00:00:35.969> than<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.270> exhaust

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
intake valve bigger than the exhaust

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.910 
intake valve bigger than the exhaust
valves<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.290> that's<00:00:37.410> supposed<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.680> be<00:00:37.739> the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
valves and that's supposed to be the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.280 
valves and that's supposed to be the
other<00:00:38.040> way<00:00:38.219> around<00:00:38.250> um<00:00:40.070> and<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.850> know<00:00:41.879> in<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
other way around um and you know in the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.360 
other way around um and you know in the
head<00:00:43.530> there's<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.579> know<00:00:44.700> like<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:46.010> i<00:00:47.010> think

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
head there's you know like I i think

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.369 
head there's you know like I i think
they<00:00:47.460> call<00:00:47.579> them<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.850> browser<00:00:48.170> something<00:00:49.170> and

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
they call them I browser something and

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.380 
they call them I browser something and
there's<00:00:50.219> none<00:00:50.489> on<00:00:50.520> here<00:00:50.910> when<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.059> took<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
there's none on here when I took the

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.439 
there's none on here when I took the
head<00:00:51.570> off<00:00:51.600> um<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.469> do<00:00:53.340> not<00:00:53.550> know<00:00:53.820> what<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.390> is

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
head off um I do not know what this is

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.139 
head off um I do not know what this is
all<00:00:54.690> about<00:00:54.719> but<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.500> kind<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.219> look<00:00:56.399> but<00:00:56.820> anyway

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
all about but I kind of look but anyway

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.910 
all about but I kind of look but anyway
back<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.960> what<00:00:58.079> we<00:00:58.320> were<00:00:58.530> talking<00:00:58.559> about

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
back to what we were talking about

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.510 
back to what we were talking about
there's<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.489> there<00:00:59.910> was<00:01:00.030> water<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.859> so<00:01:01.859> it's

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
there's a there was water in it so it's

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.960 
there's a there was water in it so it's
not<00:01:02.699> really<00:01:03.000> too<00:01:03.780> good<00:01:03.809> but<00:01:04.500> I'm<00:01:05.400> going<00:01:05.790> to

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
not really too good but I'm going to

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.660 
not really too good but I'm going to
take<00:01:06.450> off<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:07.140> push<00:01:07.619> rod<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.310> take<00:01:08.490> out<00:01:08.640> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
take off the push rod and take out the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.399 
take off the push rod and take out the
crankshaft<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.540> all<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.840> clean<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.260> all<00:01:10.380> up

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
crankshaft and all that clean it all up

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.070 
crankshaft and all that clean it all up
and<00:01:11.060> see<00:01:12.060> how<00:01:12.299> we're<00:01:12.479> looking<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:12.960> then

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
and see how we're looking and then

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.170 
and see how we're looking and then
probably<00:01:13.950> put<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.280> back<00:01:14.400> together<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.880> run<00:01:15.030> it

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
probably put it back together and run it

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.270 
probably put it back together and run it
soon<00:01:15.360> because<00:01:15.750> as<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:16.680> see<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.950> got<00:01:17.159> it

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
soon because as you can see I got it

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.980 
soon because as you can see I got it
really<00:01:17.549> nice<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.880> clean<00:01:18.119> in<00:01:18.270> there<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.479> got<00:01:18.810> it

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
really nice and clean in there I got it

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.260 
really nice and clean in there I got it
all<00:01:19.439> decarbonize<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.490> all<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:20.729> it's

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
all decarbonize and all that it's

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.780 
all decarbonize and all that it's
getting<00:01:21.509> spark<00:01:21.840> finally<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.619> had<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.549> put<00:01:23.700> in

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
getting spark finally I had to put in

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.310 
getting spark finally I had to put in
your<00:01:23.820> coil<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.479> never<00:01:24.630> just<00:01:24.930> took<00:01:26.479> um<00:01:27.479> it

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
your coil and never just took um it

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.100 
your coil and never just took um it
originally<00:01:29.100> came<00:01:29.130> off<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> v-twin<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.600> had<00:01:31.079> to

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
originally came off a v-twin so I had to

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.350 
originally came off a v-twin so I had to
take<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.500> course<00:01:31.799> these<00:01:32.520> off<00:01:32.790> her<00:01:32.970> know<00:01:33.119> that

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
take of course these off her know that

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.899 
take of course these off her know that
was<00:01:33.540> but<00:01:33.840> just<00:01:34.380> took<00:01:34.500> him<00:01:34.650> off<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.070> grounded

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
was but just took him off and grounded

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.210 
was but just took him off and grounded
it<00:01:36.030> out<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.450> block<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.320> got<00:01:37.500> spark<00:01:37.860> so

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
it out to the block and it got spark so

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.850 
it out to the block and it got spark so
um<00:01:39.259> looking<00:01:40.259> pretty<00:01:40.439> good<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:40.860> oh<00:01:42.619> I'm<00:01:43.619> gonna

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
um looking pretty good so oh I'm gonna

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.280 
um looking pretty good so oh I'm gonna
go<00:01:43.950> ahead<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:45.860> try<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.420> rotate<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.600> crank<00:01:48.990> so

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
go ahead and try and rotate the crank so

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:59.709 
go ahead and try and rotate the crank so
I<00:01:49.350> can<00:01:49.470> get<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:50.509> connecting<00:01:51.509> rod<00:01:51.810> out<00:01:56.000> okay

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:03.859 

it's<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.899> lowest<00:02:01.380> point<00:02:01.740> right<00:02:01.920> now<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.869> go

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
it's that lowest point right now so go

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.779 
it's that lowest point right now so go
ahead<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.079> tip<00:02:04.319> it<00:02:04.490> sideways<00:02:06.140> and<00:02:07.640> star<00:02:08.640> and

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
ahead and tip it sideways and star and

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.750 
ahead and tip it sideways and star and
get<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:09.030> crank<00:02:09.360> out<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:10.220> do<00:02:11.220> not<00:02:11.430> know<00:02:11.489> what

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
get that crank out I do not know what

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.600 
get that crank out I do not know what
size<00:02:12.030> rinse<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.660> yet<00:02:12.989> but<00:02:13.400> we<00:02:14.400> will<00:02:14.430> find

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
size rinse it is yet but we will find

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:23.390 
size rinse it is yet but we will find
out<00:02:15.090> in<00:02:15.739> a<00:02:16.739> second<00:02:17.129> I<00:02:21.440> guess<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:22.739> start<00:02:23.069> looking

counter weight but I'm not really gonna

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.259 
counter weight but I'm not really gonna
worry<00:02:58.980> about<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.280> excess<00:02:59.609> at<00:02:59.819> the<00:02:59.940> counter
