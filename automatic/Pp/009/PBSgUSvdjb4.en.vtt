Jason Leffler when you guys got together
the<00:00:34.350> first<00:00:34.500> time<00:00:34.680> leave<00:00:34.920> needless<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.430> say<00:00:35.460> he

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
the first time leave needless to say he

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.310 
the first time leave needless to say he
was<00:00:35.760> pretty<00:00:36.030> frustrated<00:00:36.690> was<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.290> a

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
was pretty frustrated was that a

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.500 
was pretty frustrated was that a
coincidence<00:00:37.530> there<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.489> don't<00:00:39.180> think<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.390> was<00:00:39.449> a

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
coincidence there I don't think it was a

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.610 
coincidence there I don't think it was a
coincidence<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:40.140> think<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.350> was<00:00:40.440> probably

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
coincidence I think it was probably

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.860 
coincidence I think it was probably
intentional<00:00:41.309> we<00:00:41.879> did<00:00:42.030> get<00:00:42.239> together<00:00:42.360> earlier

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
intentional we did get together earlier

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.040 
intentional we did get together earlier
and<00:00:43.489> he<00:00:44.489> crowded<00:00:45.059> me<00:00:45.120> down<00:00:45.269> on<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.720> white<00:00:45.839> line

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
and he crowded me down on the white line

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.810 
and he crowded me down on the white line
I<00:00:46.080> just<00:00:46.409> got<00:00:46.559> loose<00:00:46.710> under<00:00:46.979> him<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.280> didn't<00:00:47.699> mean

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
I just got loose under him I didn't mean

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.539 
I just got loose under him I didn't mean
to<00:00:47.909> do<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.120> at<00:00:48.210> all<00:00:48.330> but<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:49.140> guess<00:00:50.040> he's<00:00:50.190> mad<00:00:50.430> at

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:50.549 
to do it at all but I guess he's mad at

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:53.090 
to do it at all but I guess he's mad at
me<00:00:50.580> for<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:50.879> but<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.390> would<00:00:52.110> be<00:00:52.229> mad<00:00:52.379> too<00:00:52.589> but<00:00:52.890> I

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
me for it but I would be mad too but I

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.619

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
mean he tried to wreck me under caution

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.110 
mean he tried to wreck me under caution
a<00:00:54.870> couple<00:00:55.260> cautions<00:00:55.620> earlier<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.190> then<00:00:56.670> just

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
a couple cautions earlier and then just

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.939 
a couple cautions earlier and then just

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
little bit overkill I didn't I mean he

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.130

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
intentional at all what he did was

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.990 
intentional at all what he did was

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
don't know it seems like quite a few

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.800 
don't know it seems like quite a few
drivers<00:01:14.909> have<00:01:15.149> been<00:01:15.270> getting<00:01:15.450> mad<00:01:15.659> at<00:01:15.780> me

lately

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
lately

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.440 
lately
I'm<00:01:17.440> just<00:01:17.650> trying<00:01:17.830> to<00:01:17.860> run<00:01:17.950> my<00:01:18.130> race<00:01:18.310> and<00:01:18.450> get

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
I'm just trying to run my race and get

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.960 
I'm just trying to run my race and get
up<00:01:19.540> front<00:01:19.900> and<00:01:20.250> we<00:01:21.250> were<00:01:21.400> leading<00:01:21.640> the<00:01:21.730> rookie

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
up front and we were leading the rookie

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.190 
up front and we were leading the rookie
points<00:01:22.240> we'll<00:01:22.360> probably<00:01:22.540> lose<00:01:22.780> that<00:01:23.020> this

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
points we'll probably lose that this

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.500 
points we'll probably lose that this
weekend<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:24.220> 11<00:01:24.550> still<00:01:24.820> running<00:01:25.090> pretty

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
weekend the 11 still running pretty

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.290 
weekend the 11 still running pretty
decent<00:01:25.900> I<00:01:25.930> think<00:01:26.170> and<00:01:26.380> I<00:01:26.800> saw<00:01:27.520> the<00:01:27.580> 16<00:01:28.000> getting

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
decent I think and I saw the 16 getting

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.300 
decent I think and I saw the 16 getting
back<00:01:28.420> out<00:01:28.570> there<00:01:28.780> so<00:01:29.020> we'll<00:01:29.800> probably<00:01:29.950> lose<00:01:30.250> a

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
back out there so we'll probably lose a

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.830 
back out there so we'll probably lose a
bit<00:01:30.580> a<00:01:30.640> little<00:01:30.790> bit<00:01:30.940> of<00:01:31.090> a<00:01:31.120> rookie<00:01:31.270> points<00:01:31.660> but

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
bit a little bit of a rookie points but

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.420 
bit a little bit of a rookie points but
I<00:01:32.320> don't<00:01:32.560> know<00:01:32.650> all<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:32.860> guys<00:01:32.950> at<00:01:33.190> Phoenix

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430

about<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.290> right<00:03:04.439> front<00:03:04.739> it<00:03:04.829> just<00:03:04.859> took<00:03:05.129> off

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
about the right front it just took off

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.449 
about the right front it just took off
on<00:03:05.549> me<00:03:05.670> so<00:03:05.879> that's<00:03:06.480> part<00:03:06.810> of<00:03:06.870> racing<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.470> it's

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
on me so that's part of racing and it's

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:09.949 
on me so that's part of racing and it's
a<00:03:08.519> shame<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.849> Great<00:03:09.000> Clips<00:03:09.120> Camry<00:03:09.629> was<00:03:09.720> really

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
a shame the Great Clips Camry was really

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.990 
a shame the Great Clips Camry was really
good<00:03:10.140> even<00:03:10.290> like<00:03:10.500> I<00:03:10.620> said<00:03:10.859> where<00:03:11.579> the<00:03:11.670> tore<00:03:11.909> off

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
good even like I said where the tore off

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.819 
good even like I said where the tore off
as<00:03:12.150> bad<00:03:12.299> as<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:12.629> was<00:03:12.659> our<00:03:13.170> times<00:03:13.470> are<00:03:13.590> really

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
as bad as it was our times are really

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.619 
as bad as it was our times are really
good<00:03:14.010> so<00:03:14.250> that's<00:03:14.849> frustrating<00:03:15.389> when<00:03:15.480> you<00:03:15.540> get

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
good so that's frustrating when you get

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.839 
good so that's frustrating when you get
taken<00:03:15.810> out<00:03:15.959> early<00:03:16.230> like<00:03:16.349> that<00:03:16.530> but<00:03:16.739> it's<00:03:17.639> part

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
taken out early like that but it's part

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.640
