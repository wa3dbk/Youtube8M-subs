00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello and welcome to this 

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.290
 Tiny little test video on a branch 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.300
 on my step channel the rumble box 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.740
 and although this video is only a whole 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.809
 be smaller audio test 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.199
 from my new microphone that madoff 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.730
 because we have the red deer 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.560
 can just listen a bit 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.910
 and make you a picture of it when 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.850
 you because the video full quality 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.189
 asked what did this microphone so 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.740
 can afford and what a toni of 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.810
 this microphone can expect to setup 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.989
 I'll explain that for a moment 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.180
 am here to the normal of the small big one 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.530
 All the windows and doors are closed 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.840
 I have no special 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.329
 Soundproofing or something like this 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.340
 Room is silent that means no laptop 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.960
 does not make any fan noise 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.629
 computer makes fan noise i have 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.280
 no fan one provide the heater 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.840
 nothing is possible here 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.219
 room is silent if you have any 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.210
 Listening to noise in the background then it is 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.910
 probably the fault of that 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.329
 microphone and not from the room here only 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.250
 so that you know that I take with you 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.870
 road video maike So I call that 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.020
 video namely synonymous with the canon eos 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.119
 600d but the red video is me 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.790
 not at the canon eos 600d 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.650
 connected but at a zoom age 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.049
 one audio recorder 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.509
 which has just the following reason that 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.210
 the audio compression in the 600d very much 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.770
 very bad is therefore proportionate 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.000
 is very bad and that's the way it is 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.250
 rushing a bit and such a shit 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.020
 with purely expected if I red because that 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.759
 connect video directly there and that 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.650
 That would be a bit of the result 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.119
 falsify and the microphone worse 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.890
 to stand as it is 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.689
 so has the now so make one 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.759
 as a recording device to that the video 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.210
 not connected because it is so 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.430
 Swollen is a dedicated one here 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.689
 an apple-made audio device becomes a device 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.329
 was made for you also 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.579
 record and do a lot 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.799
 better job than the canon eos 600d and 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.500
 therefore I take with the thus of the 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.229
 red video with and then the in 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.969
 afterwards with the picture at this point 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.590
 would like to briefly explain why 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.180
 I ever bought this microphone 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.980
 because I've sure if that's me 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.990
 that some of you are asking 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.600
 that is relatively relative 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.240
 simple is so easy in 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.740
 greece where I normally live 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.300
 So I'm in right now 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.920
 germany so for one and a half months 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.640
 make vacation see my family and stuff 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.960
 on and on 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.440
 but in greece where i am 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.150
 usually live and live at the moment 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.010
 it so that in the garden of a house 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.700
 where I live a lot of barbecue too 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.980
 cicadas called rum chill and the 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.660
 we make quite annoying sound for 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.010
 the partnersuche because they are there 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.560
 somehow want to impress each other 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.140
 the two stay that way and it's so loud 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.710
 that in every room in the house this one 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.760
 Sound always stops and the xoom tours with 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.690
 I used to always have my sound 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.520
 it was his microphone 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.590
 These are the ambient sound and when in the 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.270
 the small room of these works 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.580
 grill from the garden is in there then 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.560
 you have a rush on the microphone and 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.390
 a rushing audio track that's easy 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.550
 not nice not professional 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.170
 does not sound good but sounds 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.850
 sounds cheap and I want to 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.800
 my main channel not further 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.170
 because that's just not what it is 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.490
 want to show my main channel 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.980
 That's why we have this now 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.780
 Rectal microphone bought the red video market 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.990
 because the auÃŸenrum the whole tone 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.000
 should ignore but straight the 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.230
 sound from my mouth should record 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.450
 And she definitely hopes for that 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.250
 better the quality but at this 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.930
 you can place me down in the 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.440
 Comments write in what the 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.880
 sound from the red video mike so keep yourselves 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.170
 in any case over a feedback 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.810
 that's better, or better 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.000
 worse than my old videos or 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:43.860
 is that common or more generally 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.830
 not so much yellow from egg on everyone 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.570
 case ruby and thus already connected 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.130
 to record that stopped in this 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.989
 moments can be said 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.330
 this sound 100 euro worth because the bread 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.680
 video may cost 100 euros or not 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.300
 do not write in below will not 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.190
 in any case very interested in one 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.900
 detailed comparison between super 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.489
 and red video night will be there 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.140
 I probably promise nothing 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.780
 but it will probably be on mine 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.690
 main channel fix was 94 sometime in 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.710
 next time give for all the 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.320
 can not decide what to buy 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.300
 I should have her second of the same 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.380
 make a good comparison so that can 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.600
 you then on my main channel 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.130
 but eventually I might expect 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.930
 I have too much thoughts again 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.460
 I now like to watch for 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.980
 Let me leave feedback on the sound 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.630
 down there in the comments and we 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:31.660
 Definitely see us in some 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.660
 video sometime bite then again
