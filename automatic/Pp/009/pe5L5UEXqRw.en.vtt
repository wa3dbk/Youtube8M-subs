00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.990
 for the second consecutive year the 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.540
 kawasaki er 6n is the best selling of 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.849
 motorcycles in France the recipe is simple a 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.150
 vigorous motor soft alert in the 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:12.160
 towers 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.559
 short an engine players an excellent 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.969
 rigid chassis but not too much a very 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.029
 good suspension cohesion and a 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:21.429
 braking with the endorsement brief kawasaki on 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.170
 this shot there understood everything but another 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:25.330
 manufacturer has included everything in 2014 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:29.080
 these yamaha who lands in the segment 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.939
 with its mt 0 7 7 mt 07 it's a whole 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.110
 yamaha's new motorcycle did not get 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:32.770
 just dressed up an existing model 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.540
 in the range 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.480
 not at all so we have a brand new 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.240
 a 689 online twin engine 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.580
 cubic centimeters which develops 74.8 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.570
 horses and 68 münchen m of torque 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.910
 this one trees gone to wedge it to 270 ° 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.400
 where that of the er 6n is set to 180 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.070
 degrees to use it results in a more 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.930
 great flexibility for the mt 0 7 which 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.880
 accepts the stride 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.070
 walks at very low speed to 1500 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.560
 towers where the Kawasaki is more 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.360
 rough in town 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.190
 it's a mom argument 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.990
 who feels and who doubles with a 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.980
 injection more finely manage on the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.200
 yamaha 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.790
 traveling and easily dosable and a 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.810
 selection is softer less brilliant 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.780
 on the Camargue 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.400
 in short, an additional pleasure really 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.810
 which is really very nice 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.550
 to driving in thermodynamics 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.080
 now this engine it's far from 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.580
 facts denying propulsion to the machine 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.610
 really with a force and cut coach 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.820
 from 4000 to 6000 for a look completely 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.160
 1 st 6n who she expresses herself in a 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.840
 higher speed range she goes the 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.910
 kawasaki will actually come back from 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.170
 7-8 thousand laps and the lgv arpida one 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.710
 know more furious it's more explosive 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.600
 more party finally lotto about it 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.880
 in terms of the ability to take back 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.350
 koyama revival also benefits from a weight 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.900
 feather a record weight for the category 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.660
 with 179 kg all full facts announced 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.160
 25 kg less than kawasaki 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.780
 versys m you imagine that at this 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.640
 level is still huge 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.800
 so necessarily it is felt in 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.270
 dynamic but it also feels for 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.370
 all that is engine maneuver cut 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.870
 for all that is half a turn for everything 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.070
 what is parking and that's a 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.210
 important point especially for 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.620
 young permits that are obviously the 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.179
 first targets for this type of motorcycle 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.480
 it's important also for motorcycles 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.760
 schools 

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.400
 remember your years of two codes 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.350
 of plateau lessons where you had to do 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.300
 really delicate maneuvers with 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.720
 this bike is like a letter to 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.030
 the post office 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.350
 would we be tempted to say let's go 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.020
 now to the more dynamic part 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.250
 sportier the the kawasaki conserve 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.230
 the ascendant why because she 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.239
 enjoys a really deep front train 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.130
 very precise franc of braking more 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.630
 easily dosable from a chassis more 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.230
 rigorous damping cohesion 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.110
 firmer 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.070
 short kawa and more athletic and it gets 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.410
 feels elsewhere to the position 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.300
 which is a little bit more so at the level 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.890
 handlebar that is more on the very front 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.120
 if raise them but especially at the level 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.650
 footrests that are really 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.630
 back up higher that bends the legs 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.920
 it's a second advantage this 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.209
 driving position on the kawa was 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.989
 so she likes better guard 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.970
 on the ground that yamaha 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.770
 we must admit that yamaha for 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.209
 more seasoned some will be able to stay 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.250
 on their hunger anyway with the 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.670
 studs that motorcycle net.com has copiously 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.050
 nor but remains that the original the guard 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.970
 on the ground is still relatively 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.680
 satisfactory that we can transfer his 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.390
 pins anyway so eventually the 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.790
 problem can be easily postponed 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.380
 and that as mt 0 7 is really 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.780
 rigorous even to the limit when that 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.930
 rubs I want to say it's not 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.930
 dramatic 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.150
 now the question is whether 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.830
 the kawasaki will keep its laurels 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.330
 for the third year in a row for 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.340
 keep its number one spot on the 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.680
 french market kawasaki er 6n 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.000
 still has strong arguments to 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.440
 start with a line that kawasaki 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.810
 refresh regularly so it stays 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.920
 still perfectly in tune with the times 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.270
 the lines are prominent 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.490
 but we are not on the mind either 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.040
 manga like the on the 800 aids or the 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.290
 enemies in addition kawasaki has worked 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.180
 fundamental chapters including the 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.080
 saddle that is more comfortable than the one 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.730
 from mt 0 7 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.260
 there are passenger handles also this 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.190
 which do not have the mt 0 7 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.050
 look like it's small details 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.430
 very practical everyday on the other hand 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.470
 even the 0.7 he opposes a 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.330
 younger instrumentation completely 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.960
 digital and that has an indicator of 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.750
 committed report 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.490
 now remains the question of price a 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.060
 aspect so decisive especially on this 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.460
 kind of motorcycle 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:16.060
 regarding the yamaha this tariff is established 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.980
 to 5699 euros a well placed price 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:22.270
 especially for a brand new motorcycle the 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:24.430
 kawasaki er 6n is 5999 euros and 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.220
 the gap is even greater if we opt for 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.890
 the abs version which is charged 500 euros 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.690
 more on the yamaha while the note 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.730
 amounted to 600 euros for the decline on 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.340
 the scene r6 you will tell me it's gaps 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:39.130
 tariffs it is not very important 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.330
 certainly except for a young license that 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.520
 may have some power 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.150
 limited purchase this gap is no 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.590
 negligible 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.230
 it will allow him to 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.270
 buy why not equipment 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.980
 for the rest all our impressions our 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.930
 measures our sensations that we have 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.490
 felt on these two bikes I you
