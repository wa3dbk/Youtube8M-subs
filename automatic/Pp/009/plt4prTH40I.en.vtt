00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
out of here this can be really tough

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.600 
out of here this can be really tough
chamber<00:04:33.690> checking<00:04:34.200> okay<00:04:34.740> so<00:04:35.280> what<00:04:35.430> you're

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
if that hammers down like this it's

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.320 
if that hammers down like this it's
going<00:04:46.770> to<00:04:46.830> be<00:04:46.980> real<00:04:47.220> difficult<00:04:47.520> to<00:04:48.060> get<00:04:48.180> that

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
going to be real difficult to get that

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.260 
going to be real difficult to get that
to<00:04:48.480> do<00:04:48.660> it<00:04:48.810> any<00:04:49.320> of<00:04:49.650> the<00:04:49.770> three<00:04:50.010> ways<00:04:50.250> so<00:04:51.180> you

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
to do it any of the three ways so you

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
just cock your hammer like that it

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.320 
just cock your hammer like that it
should<00:04:53.340> be<00:04:53.430> right<00:04:53.550> here<00:04:53.610> keep<00:04:53.880> your<00:04:53.910> finger

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.230 
we never want to put our finger in the
trigger<00:05:28.770> alright<00:05:29.190> there's<00:05:29.400> no<00:05:29.610> way<00:05:29.850> to<00:05:29.910> check

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
trigger alright there's no way to check

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.120 
trigger alright there's no way to check
a<00:05:30.270> weapon<00:05:30.720> although<00:05:31.290> you<00:05:31.380> can<00:05:31.620> check<00:05:31.830> it<00:05:31.980> that

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
a weapon although you can check it that

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.480 
a weapon although you can check it that
way

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
way

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.970 
way
it<00:05:32.580> ain't<00:05:33.000> the<00:05:33.120> best<00:05:33.150> way<00:05:33.570> so<00:05:34.170> again<00:05:34.590> that's

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
it ain't the best way so again that's

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.310 
it ain't the best way so again that's
three<00:05:35.430> different<00:05:35.580> ways<00:05:36.000> to<00:05:36.660> check<00:05:36.870> to<00:05:37.050> see<00:05:37.080> if

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
three different ways to check to see if

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.580 
three different ways to check to see if

of<00:06:22.110> the<00:06:22.169> problems<00:06:22.620> with<00:06:22.890> the<00:06:23.610> third<00:06:23.910> way<00:06:24.090> to

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
of the problems with the third way to

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.300 
of the problems with the third way to
check<00:06:24.570> I<00:06:24.810> see<00:06:25.020> a<00:06:25.050> lot<00:06:25.260> of<00:06:25.290> women<00:06:25.590> checking<00:06:26.190> like

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
check I see a lot of women checking like

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.200 
check I see a lot of women checking like
this<00:06:26.460> because<00:06:26.640> your<00:06:26.760> back

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.210 
this because your back

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.510

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.320 
than then here this is the problem that

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.469 
than then here this is the problem that
I<00:06:31.500> get<00:06:31.680> is<00:06:31.830> oh<00:06:32.160> this<00:06:32.370> is<00:06:32.490> too<00:06:32.639> tough<00:06:33.120> for<00:06:33.360> me<00:06:33.449> I

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 
I get is oh this is too tough for me I

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:35.540 
I get is oh this is too tough for me I
can't<00:06:33.810> do<00:06:33.990> this<00:06:34.199> so<00:06:34.710> they'll<00:06:34.860> usually<00:06:35.009> be<00:06:35.370> back

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
can't do this so they'll usually be back

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.969 
can't do this so they'll usually be back
here<00:06:35.820> on<00:06:35.850> the<00:06:36.060> third<00:06:36.600> method<00:06:36.840> checking<00:06:37.500> the

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:37.979 
here on the third method checking the

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:39.710 
here on the third method checking the
problem<00:06:38.340> is<00:06:38.430> you<00:06:38.550> you're<00:06:38.940> here<00:06:39.240> you<00:06:39.389> get<00:06:39.570> so

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 
problem is you you're here you get so

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.870 
problem is you you're here you get so
strong<00:06:40.110> that<00:06:40.560> the<00:06:40.919> problem<00:06:41.250> makes<00:06:41.400> you<00:06:41.550> open

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
this up and around will get ejected out

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.890 
this up and around will get ejected out
or<00:06:43.949> it'll<00:06:44.100> cause<00:06:44.280> a<00:06:44.310> type<00:06:44.639> 3<00:06:44.880> malfunction<00:06:45.479> so

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
or it'll cause a type 3 malfunction so

grab here you should push and pull on
the<00:06:52.440> slide<00:06:52.770> slide<00:06:53.520> pulls<00:06:53.820> back<00:06:54.060> the<00:06:54.389> frame

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 
the slide slide pulls back the frame

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.350 
the slide slide pulls back the frame
pushes<00:06:55.259> forward<00:06:55.530> and<00:06:55.770> I<00:06:55.800> just<00:06:55.830> need<00:06:56.340> enough<00:06:56.610> to
