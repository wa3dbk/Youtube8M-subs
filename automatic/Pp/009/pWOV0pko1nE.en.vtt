now next thing you want to do is
obviously<00:02:08.940> incorporate<00:02:09.940> all<00:02:10.090> of<00:02:10.119> the

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
obviously incorporate all of the

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.820 
obviously incorporate all of the
ingredients<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:10.899> some<00:02:11.080> people<00:02:11.470> might<00:02:11.800> choose

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830

to blend it but I think if you wanted to
have<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.170> really<00:02:14.440> rustic<00:02:15.220> chunky<00:02:16.140> texture<00:02:17.140> then

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
have a really rustic chunky texture then

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.600 
have a really rustic chunky texture then
