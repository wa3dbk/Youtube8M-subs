 Day, I also asked you, would you like 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.980

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.809
 cup ounces speak here yes and I loved it 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.760
 because nothing better that encourages 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.500
 The economy is not easy for anyone 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.180
 then to each of them what the 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.250
 people can save to realize 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.500
 big little thing already helps 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.870
 So I've decided to show you more. 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.940
 modern in the piggy bank that's the one here I 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.489
 I made a side stamped plant here from 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.559
 On the other hand koch shows you that 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.600
 it is possible to do with pattern print 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.340
 Which do you like most but of course? 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.140
 you can do both sides with the 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.330
 same stamp this is at the discretion of 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.399
 You and the cool of this cup that 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.560
 using material in this club that has 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.330
 the hills around everyone has at home 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.610
 because we're talking about 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.679
 economics will also save matter 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.990
 cousin it's personal and if you want to do it 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:34.670
 this box and that picture is only to continue 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:36.140
 so the video to make your piggy bank 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.350
 You'll need a can of 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.970
 Coolant to mark metal and glass I 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.860
 I always like to use it because it goes 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.560
 prevent the peeling paint with 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.110
 time will also need a brush and 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.540
 ink and the ink that I like to use 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.700
 gossip crafts because I think she 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.549
 it has a very nice effect going 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.939
 also need a stylus pencil 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.549
 hot glue scissors on a piece of 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:04.570
 paper for the cardboard and also a 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.570
 piece of f &amp; a 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.989
 and to start just painting all our 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.940
 can with the first and then with the ink 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.430
 I always like to use two layers of 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.280
 and two other layers of the 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.500
 until it covers the bottom well and is 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.420
 It is always good to dry well 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.110
 layer and another to avoid danger of 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.110
 to peel 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.230
 after it is very white and 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.940
 totally dry 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.160
 you can draw with the help of a 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.650
 pencil the drawing you want 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.530
 I decided to make two drawings on one side 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.870
 pana and on the other hand to koch I stay 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.910
 There are two options for you, but you 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.220
 can decide if you want a drawing 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.920
 only want two or can do any 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.690
 another that you want the technique is 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.430
 It 's just creativity. 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.860
 but in case you want to do the same 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.720
 drawing I'm just this using the video 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.630
 and looking pretty straight drawing that I 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.310
 doing it will work out I believe 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.500
 that looking at this part where I 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.510
 drawing with pencil is more complicated than 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.820
 You understand that I'm doing more 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.710
 then with ready-made drawing already painted 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.480
 looking at photos there by blog 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.310
 You'll be able to do it right. 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.070
 drawing to copy to make it well 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.750
 I just did it by the hand, that's all. 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.300
 have a little of the dedication of 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.170
 Patience a little affection that goes 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.430
 succeed 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.320
 Ideally it is to use creativity 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.760
 also put some of your 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.760
 personality in the drawing 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.980
 here comes the most fun part that is 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.350
 to paint 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.390
 The more detail you make the more 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.430
 beautiful stay, then it's only with 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.750
 enough patience abusing colors 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.750
 that's gonna be cool 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.120
 To do the details you can use 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.610
 glue relief just like I think 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.860
 that looks pretty good or can 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:48.560
 using a permanent pen is also 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:50.510
 your criteria and to do the part of 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.850
 up our piggy bank and also choose 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.430
 this ugly part of the can is just cutting a 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:57.980
 circle of paper paranÃ¡ make a cut 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:01.130
 in the middle and do the same thing is to see the 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:03.970
 glue one to the other and then 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.970
 can top 

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:36.370
 the bottom of the can is just cut a piece of 

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:38.440
 see the same paste that's alright 

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:40.270
 so this is it folks do not forget to 

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.910
 spend there on the blog to check more 

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:44.830
 photos and more information with the photo 

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:47.260
 from the piggy bank you can have 

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:49.540
 more notion of the drawing see well right 

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.640
 how was it to be able to play at home 

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:53.350
 Do not forget to click I liked it here.

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:57.910
