00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
disappointing so these headphones retail

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.539 
disappointing so these headphones retail
for<00:03:00.159> 249<00:03:00.790> 99<00:03:01.540> which<00:03:02.349> are<00:03:02.560> a<00:03:02.829> little<00:03:02.919> bit<00:03:03.250> pricey

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
for 249 99 which are a little bit pricey

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.759 
for 249 99 which are a little bit pricey
I<00:03:03.939> mean<00:03:04.689> again<00:03:04.989> all<00:03:05.200> these<00:03:05.409> animals<00:03:05.709> are

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
I mean again all these animals are

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.470 
I mean again all these animals are
pricey<00:03:06.099> but<00:03:06.310> for<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:06.549> price<00:03:06.849> they're

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
pricey but for the price they're

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.210 
pricey but for the price they're
definitely<00:03:07.599> pricier<00:03:08.319> than<00:03:08.409> some<00:03:08.620> beat<00:03:08.769> solos

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
definitely pricier than some beat solos

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.890 
definitely pricier than some beat solos
and<00:03:09.370> beat<00:03:09.519> stores<00:03:09.879> they're<00:03:10.569> all<00:03:10.720> most

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
and beat stores they're all most

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.619 
and beat stores they're all most
expensive<00:03:11.409> those<00:03:11.500> beats<00:03:11.709> studios<00:03:12.599> and<00:03:13.599> the

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
expensive those beats studios and the

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:15.390 
expensive those beats studios and the
beasters<00:03:14.049> have<00:03:14.260> noise<00:03:14.470> cancellation<00:03:15.250> these

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
beasters have noise cancellation these

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.719

as<00:03:26.680> a<00:03:26.739> matter<00:03:26.919> of<00:03:27.010> fact<00:03:27.099> the<00:03:27.970> base<00:03:28.180> here<00:03:28.419> is

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
as a matter of fact the base here is

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.580 
as a matter of fact the base here is
actually<00:03:29.459> not<00:03:30.459> good<00:03:30.699> at<00:03:30.790> all<00:03:30.940> it's<00:03:31.629> has<00:03:32.290> pump

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
actually not good at all it's has pump

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.460 
actually not good at all it's has pump
but<00:03:32.889> the<00:03:33.040> base<00:03:33.190> is<00:03:33.220> not<00:03:33.430> clean<00:03:33.790> so<00:03:34.090> it<00:03:34.180> actually

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
but the base is not clean so it actually

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.899 
but the base is not clean so it actually
affects<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:36.010> audio<00:03:36.310> quality<00:03:36.459> of<00:03:36.669> what<00:03:36.760> you're
