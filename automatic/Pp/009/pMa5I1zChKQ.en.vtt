00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.590 

the<00:01:15.539> way<00:01:15.689> I'm<00:01:15.780> going<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.020> raise<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.590> up<00:01:17.450> more<00:01:18.450> to

the way I'm going to raise it up more to
raise<00:01:18.869> her<00:01:19.140> hook<00:01:21.350> because<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.590> don't<00:01:22.770> want<00:01:22.890> it

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
raise her hook because you don't want it

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
it wouldn't really look right so we just

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:41.800 
it wouldn't really look right so we just
take<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:29.969> little<00:01:30.359> bit<00:01:30.479> higher
