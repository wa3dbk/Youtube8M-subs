00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.620 
movie it's a little bit more little
budget<00:03:14.440> than<00:03:14.769> the<00:03:14.859> last<00:03:15.040> ones<00:03:15.430> now<00:03:16.120> I<00:03:16.480> know

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
budget than the last ones now I know

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.660 
budget than the last ones now I know
after<00:03:17.079> part<00:03:17.350> to<00:03:17.590> reach<00:03:17.859> movie<00:03:18.190> kind<00:03:18.430> of<00:03:18.519> got<00:03:18.640> a

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
after part to reach movie kind of got a

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.060 
after part to reach movie kind of got a
little<00:03:18.820> bit<00:03:19.150> more<00:03:19.390> lower<00:03:20.320> in<00:03:20.560> production

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
little bit more lower in production

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.069 
little bit more lower in production
value<00:03:21.489> and<00:03:21.730> then<00:03:22.299> kind<00:03:22.450> of<00:03:22.570> stripped<00:03:22.900> down

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
value and then kind of stripped down

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.430 
value and then kind of stripped down
each<00:03:23.350> time<00:03:23.380> because<00:03:24.010> like<00:03:24.160> part<00:03:24.820> 4<00:03:25.200> they<00:03:26.200> did

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
each time because like part 4 they did

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.490 
each time because like part 4 they did
less<00:03:26.650> shooting<00:03:27.100> on<00:03:27.280> it<00:03:27.459> and<00:03:28.049> it<00:03:29.049> was<00:03:29.170> kind<00:03:29.350> of

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
less shooting on it and it was kind of

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.530 
less shooting on it and it was kind of
more<00:03:29.709> like<00:03:29.769> a<00:03:29.920> or<00:03:30.370> admitted<00:03:30.940> into<00:03:31.060> more<00:03:31.359> like

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
part one in the part for to make it a

part one in the part for to make it a
whole<00:03:37.959> movie<00:03:38.380> and<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.370> help<00:03:39.579> they<00:03:39.700> also<00:03:39.850> have

characters<00:03:43.060> in<00:03:43.420> it<00:03:43.540> so<00:03:44.319> I<00:03:44.739> mean<00:03:45.250> part<00:03:45.489> 4<00:03:45.730> still

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
characters in it so I mean part 4 still

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.970 
characters in it so I mean part 4 still
kinda<00:03:46.269> had<00:03:46.420> a<00:03:46.450> big<00:03:46.720> budget<00:03:46.930> look<00:03:47.290> to<00:03:47.500> it<00:03:47.650> as<00:03:47.769> far

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
kinda had a big budget look to it as far

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.220 
kinda had a big budget look to it as far
as<00:03:48.130> how<00:03:48.310> you<00:03:48.880> know<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.239> Senate<00:03:49.690> photography

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
as how you know the Senate photography

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.099 
as how you know the Senate photography
book<00:03:50.410> but<00:03:50.769> par-5<00:03:51.760> looks<00:03:52.030> a<00:03:52.120> little<00:03:52.299> bit<00:03:52.540> on<00:03:52.750> the

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
book but par-5 looks a little bit on the

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.440 
book but par-5 looks a little bit on the
low<00:03:53.380> budget<00:03:53.829> side<00:03:54.100> it<00:03:54.819> looks<00:03:54.940> like<00:03:55.150> they<00:03:55.269> use<00:03:55.420> a

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
low budget side it looks like they use a

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.500 
low budget side it looks like they use a
lot<00:03:55.540> of<00:03:55.690> CGI<00:03:56.579> special<00:03:57.579> effects<00:03:57.910> in<00:03:58.120> this<00:03:58.269> one

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
lot of CGI special effects in this one

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.680 
lot of CGI special effects in this one
with<00:03:59.319> the<00:03:59.410> green<00:03:59.590> screen<00:03:59.650> so<00:04:00.370> we<00:04:01.269> got<00:04:01.420> to<00:04:01.540> see

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
with the green screen so we got to see

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:02.940 
with the green screen so we got to see
if<00:04:01.750> that's<00:04:01.900> going<00:04:02.049> to<00:04:02.139> be<00:04:02.230> more<00:04:02.440> of<00:04:02.500> a<00:04:02.650> hit<00:04:02.829> or

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
if that's going to be more of a hit or

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.340 
if that's going to be more of a hit or
miss<00:04:02.980> so<00:04:03.519> hopefully<00:04:04.480> you<00:04:05.019> know<00:04:05.139> hopefully

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
miss so hopefully you know hopefully

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.680 
miss so hopefully you know hopefully
it's<00:04:05.650> more<00:04:05.709> of<00:04:06.010> a<00:04:06.190> hit<00:04:06.519> because<00:04:06.700> I<00:04:07.060> really

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
it's more of a hit because I really

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.300 
it's more of a hit because I really
either<00:04:07.870> look<00:04:08.200> forward<00:04:08.560> to<00:04:08.620> seeing<00:04:08.980> how<00:04:09.100> they

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
either look forward to seeing how they

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.309 
either look forward to seeing how they
you<00:04:09.970> know<00:04:10.000> did<00:04:10.329> a<00:04:10.359> lot<00:04:10.600> of<00:04:10.630> things<00:04:11.019> with<00:04:11.200> it

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
you know did a lot of things with it

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.500 
you know did a lot of things with it
because<00:04:11.410> I<00:04:11.650> do<00:04:11.799> prefer<00:04:12.209> practical<00:04:13.209> effects

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
because I do prefer practical effects

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.690 
because I do prefer practical effects
but<00:04:13.840> you<00:04:14.620> know<00:04:14.709> we<00:04:14.799> just<00:04:14.920> have<00:04:15.100> to<00:04:15.220> wait<00:04:15.370> signal

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
but you know we just have to wait signal

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.490 
but you know we just have to wait signal
the<00:04:15.970> tall<00:04:16.180> man<00:04:16.389> he's<00:04:16.600> back<00:04:16.840> in<00:04:17.019> his<00:04:17.109> role

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
the tall man he's back in his role

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.620 
the tall man he's back in his role
when<00:04:17.650> of<00:04:17.950> course<00:04:18.190> he<00:04:18.310> looks<00:04:18.489> a<00:04:18.579> lot<00:04:18.730> older<00:04:18.970> so<00:04:19.450> I

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
when of course he looks a lot older so I

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.120 
when of course he looks a lot older so I
was<00:04:20.140> really<00:04:20.200> glad<00:04:20.410> that<00:04:20.530> they<00:04:20.799> finally

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
was really glad that they finally

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.370 
was really glad that they finally
decided<00:04:21.670> to<00:04:21.820> make<00:04:22.030> this<00:04:22.180> movie<00:04:22.660> before<00:04:23.020> they

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
decided to make this movie before they

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.860 
decided to make this movie before they
wait<00:04:23.590> with<00:04:24.250> any<00:04:24.460> time<00:04:25.120> longer<00:04:25.540> into<00:04:25.750> the

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
wait with any time longer into the

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.960 
wait with any time longer into the
future<00:04:26.170> so<00:04:26.560> that's<00:04:27.280> another<00:04:27.550> thing<00:04:27.790> I'm

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
future so that's another thing I'm

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.550 
future so that's another thing I'm
really<00:04:28.180> looking<00:04:28.450> forward<00:04:28.480> to<00:04:28.900> to<00:04:29.230> see<00:04:29.440> you

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
know the whole the original cast members

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.320 
know the whole the original cast members
back<00:04:32.290> into<00:04:32.560> this<00:04:32.680> you<00:04:33.640> know<00:04:33.760> back<00:04:33.970> into<00:04:34.210> this

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
back into this you know back into this

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.510 
back into this you know back into this
phantasm<00:04:35.080> world<00:04:35.500> and<00:04:35.920> hopefully<00:04:36.280> they<00:04:36.340> could

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
phantasm world and hopefully they could

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.850 
phantasm world and hopefully they could
still<00:04:36.670> keep<00:04:37.000> it<00:04:37.150> alive<00:04:37.450> I<00:04:37.810> think<00:04:38.320> this<00:04:38.440> movie

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
still keep it alive I think this movie

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.130 
still keep it alive I think this movie
from<00:04:39.670> what<00:04:39.850> we're<00:04:40.000> seeing<00:04:40.030> you<00:04:40.750> know<00:04:40.870> we're

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
from what we're seeing you know we're

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.630 
from what we're seeing you know we're
not<00:04:41.260> hearing<00:04:41.440> too<00:04:41.620> much<00:04:41.800> about<00:04:42.040> it<00:04:42.250> i'm<00:04:42.370> pretty

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
not hearing too much about it i'm pretty

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.940 
not hearing too much about it i'm pretty
sure<00:04:42.820> it's<00:04:42.970> just<00:04:43.120> going<00:04:43.480> to<00:04:43.720> straight<00:04:44.650> to<00:04:44.770> DVD

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
sure it's just going to straight to DVD

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.100 
sure it's just going to straight to DVD
and<00:04:45.310> blu-ray<00:04:45.520> and<00:04:46.000> it'll<00:04:46.690> probably<00:04:46.870> go<00:04:47.050> to

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
and blu-ray and it'll probably go to

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.159 
and blu-ray and it'll probably go to
netflix<00:04:47.620> of<00:04:47.770> course<00:04:48.100> but<00:04:49.030> uh<00:04:49.090> hopefully<00:04:49.870> just

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
netflix of course but uh hopefully just

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.400 
netflix of course but uh hopefully just
play<00:04:50.440> on<00:04:50.590> demand<00:04:51.070> also<00:04:51.669> but<00:04:52.030> and<00:04:53.020> i'm<00:04:53.140> going<00:04:53.260> to

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
play on demand also but and i'm going to

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
the darkness of part one and action

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.620 
the darkness of part one and action
compart<00:05:28.479> to<00:05:28.750> inaction<00:05:29.200> from<00:05:29.380> part<00:05:29.770> 3<00:05:30.160> and<00:05:30.630> more

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
compart to inaction from part 3 and more

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.600 
compart to inaction from part 3 and more
of<00:05:31.750> that<00:05:31.870> origin<00:05:32.320> story<00:05:32.680> part<00:05:33.040> for<00:05:33.280> so<00:05:33.460> we<00:05:33.580> can

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
of that origin story part for so we can

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.640 
of that origin story part for so we can
see<00:05:33.880> if<00:05:33.970> they<00:05:34.090> can<00:05:34.300> go<00:05:34.780> cram<00:05:35.080> all<00:05:35.290> four<00:05:35.620> of

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
see if they can go cram all four of

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.940 
see if they can go cram all four of
those<00:05:35.770> elements<00:05:36.220> into<00:05:37.120> this<00:05:37.419> one<00:05:37.750> movie<00:05:38.169> but

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
those elements into this one movie but

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.010 
those elements into this one movie but
since<00:05:39.490> it<00:05:39.669> is<00:05:39.790> a<00:05:39.820> little<00:05:40.090> budget<00:05:40.300> movie<00:05:40.780> I

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
since it is a little budget movie I

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.110 
since it is a little budget movie I
really<00:05:41.800> doubt<00:05:41.979> that<00:05:42.040> we'll<00:05:42.430> have<00:05:42.640> like<00:05:42.910> this
