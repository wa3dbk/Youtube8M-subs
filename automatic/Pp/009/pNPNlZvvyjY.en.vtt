so hopefully by now you get a little
more<00:00:01.709> familiar<00:00:02.040> with<00:00:02.250> slurs<00:00:02.720> so<00:00:03.720> we're<00:00:03.840> going

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
more familiar with slurs so we're going

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.849 
more familiar with slurs so we're going
to<00:00:04.049> add<00:00:04.380> one<00:00:04.650> more<00:00:04.799> thing<00:00:05.100> to<00:00:05.870> the<00:00:06.870> concept<00:00:07.500> to

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
to add one more thing to the concept to

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.620 
to add one more thing to the concept to
make<00:00:08.010> it<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.130> little<00:00:08.250> bit<00:00:08.429> harder<00:00:08.910> for<00:00:09.150> you<00:00:09.300> so

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
we flew all quarter notes we've slurred

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.070 
we flew all quarter notes we've slurred
half<00:00:11.969> note<00:00:12.240> so<00:00:12.420> now<00:00:12.509> we're<00:00:12.599> going<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.750> slur

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080

2 a 1 down bow and then I did that up oh
so<00:00:38.010> let's<00:00:38.760> learn<00:00:39.570> some<00:00:39.629> songs<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.170> have<00:00:40.350> some

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
so let's learn some songs I have some

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.310 
so let's learn some songs I have some
slow<00:00:41.850> crossings<00:00:42.390> with<00:00:42.540> eighth<00:00:42.719> notes<00:00:42.960> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
slow crossings with eighth notes the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.440 
slow crossings with eighth notes the
first<00:00:43.530> one<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.710> going<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.920> be<00:00:44.040> treetops<00:00:44.610> so

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
first one is going to be treetops so

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.770 
first one is going to be treetops so
it's<00:00:45.600> going<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.809> start<00:00:45.960> off<00:00:46.050> with<00:00:46.260> up<00:00:46.440> 0<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.860> 0

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
it's going to start off with up 0 a 0

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
it's going to start off with up 0 a 0
and<00:00:48.780> then<00:00:49.440> 2d0<00:00:50.010> cornell's

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
and then 2d0 cornell's

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.150 
and then 2d0 cornell's
I<00:00:54.090> have<00:00:55.090> an<00:00:55.180> up<00:00:55.390> bow<00:00:55.629> slur<00:00:56.230> crossing<00:00:56.890> eighth

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
I have an up bow slur crossing eighth

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.149 
I have an up bow slur crossing eighth
notes<00:00:57.489> d<00:00:58.030> 2<00:00:58.239> a<00:00:58.510> 0<00:01:00.000> then<00:01:01.000> you<00:01:01.089> have<00:01:01.300> D<00:01:01.960> 2<00:01:02.260> for<00:01:02.769> 3

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.159 
notes d 2 a 0 then you have D 2 for 3

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:05.520 
notes d 2 a 0 then you have D 2 for 3
beats

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.480 

rest<00:01:06.430> and<00:01:06.729> then<00:01:06.820> lift<00:01:07.560> d3<00:01:09.030> d2<00:01:11.190> now<00:01:12.190> you<00:01:12.250> have<00:01:12.430> a

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
rest and then lift d3 d2 now you have a

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.070 
rest and then lift d3 d2 now you have a
slur<00:01:12.760> crossing<00:01:13.390> eighth<00:01:13.630> notes<00:01:13.930> d12<00:01:14.650> a<00:01:14.680> zero<00:01:16.080> do

slur crossing eighth notes d12 a zero do

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.080 
slur crossing eighth notes d12 a zero do
you<00:01:17.170> want<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.610> d<00:01:19.060> 0<00:01:19.299> /<00:01:19.450> 2<00:01:19.479> b's<00:01:20.490> rest<00:01:21.490> rest

you want and d 0 / 2 b's rest rest

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:33.630 
you want and d 0 / 2 b's rest rest
alright<00:01:22.840> let's<00:01:22.990> try<00:01:23.020> that<00:01:23.229> once<00:01:23.409> top

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.200 

you

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.780 

it's<00:01:38.210> like<00:01:38.360> that<00:01:38.570> that's<00:01:38.930> true<00:01:39.170> taps<00:01:39.790> next

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
it's like that that's true taps next

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.420 
it's like that that's true taps next
one's<00:01:41.030> going<00:01:41.210> to<00:01:41.270> be<00:01:41.470> tricky<00:01:42.470> slurs<00:01:42.770> and<00:01:43.130> as

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
one's going to be tricky slurs and as

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.240 
one's going to be tricky slurs and as
you<00:01:43.550> see<00:01:43.760> also<00:01:44.180> it<00:01:44.530> shows<00:01:45.530> that<00:01:45.830> the<00:01:46.010> song<00:01:46.220> is

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
you see also it shows that the song is

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.740 
you see also it shows that the song is
moderato<00:01:46.850> know<00:01:47.270> if<00:01:47.330> you<00:01:47.390> remember<00:01:47.630> what

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
moderato know if you remember what

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.570 
moderato know if you remember what
moderato<00:01:48.050> is<00:01:48.470> that's<00:01:49.010> when<00:01:49.220> you<00:01:49.280> play<00:01:49.460> the

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
moderato is that's when you play the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.260 
moderato is that's when you play the
song<00:01:49.820> slowly<00:01:50.740> so<00:01:51.740> make<00:01:51.980> sure<00:01:52.010> that<00:01:52.220> you<00:01:52.700> don't

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
song slowly so make sure that you don't

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.750 
song slowly so make sure that you don't
rush<00:01:53.510> the<00:01:53.690> Sun<00:01:53.960> learn<00:01:54.440> its<00:01:54.620> low-end<00:01:54.890> keep<00:01:55.610> it

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
rush the Sun learn its low-end keep it

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.240 
rush the Sun learn its low-end keep it
at<00:01:55.940> that<00:01:56.000> speed<00:01:56.479> so<00:01:57.350> let's<00:01:57.530> try<00:01:57.860> it's<00:01:58.070> going<00:01:58.190> to

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
at that speed so let's try it's going to

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.340 
at that speed so let's try it's going to
start<00:01:58.400> off<00:01:58.490> on<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:58.729> g<00:01:58.940> string<00:01:58.970> G<00:01:59.600> to<00:02:00.130> dumbo<00:02:02.350> and

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
start off on the g string G to dumbo and

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.639 
start off on the g string G to dumbo and
drop<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:03.830> elbow<00:02:04.070> to<00:02:04.220> d<00:02:04.520> 0<00:02:05.140> d<00:02:06.140> 3<00:02:06.920> for<00:02:07.100> two<00:02:07.190> beats

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
drop the elbow to d 0 d 3 for two beats

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.780 
drop the elbow to d 0 d 3 for two beats
back<00:02:09.489> over<00:02:09.729> to<00:02:09.909> the<00:02:10.000> gg2<00:02:10.869> ah<00:02:11.250> d<00:02:12.250> 0<00:02:12.519> d<00:02:13.500> 342<00:02:14.500> beads

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
back over to the gg2 ah d 0 d 342 beads

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.240 
back over to the gg2 ah d 0 d 342 beads
down<00:02:16.750> below<00:02:18.239> d3a<00:02:19.709> know<00:02:20.709> this<00:02:20.859> could<00:02:21.129> be<00:02:21.219> a

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
down below d3a know this could be a

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.059 
down below d3a know this could be a
little<00:02:21.340> tricky<00:02:21.700> so<00:02:21.819> we<00:02:21.879> have<00:02:22.000> a<00:02:22.209> 1<00:02:22.450> 2<00:02:22.659> D<00:02:22.870> 3<00:02:23.069> slur

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
little tricky so we have a 1 2 D 3 slur

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:31.019 
little tricky so we have a 1 2 D 3 slur
crossing<00:02:24.609> aids<00:02:26.519> and<00:02:27.519> then<00:02:27.640> a<00:02:27.909> 3<00:02:28.420> 2<00:02:28.810> d<00:02:28.989> 2
