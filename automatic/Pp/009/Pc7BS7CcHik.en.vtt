20 X 15 watts cathode bias to 6 v6 power
tubes<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:26.099> did<00:00:26.369> kind<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.820> come<00:00:27.090> from<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:28.019> rebel

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
tubes it did kind of come from the rebel

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.450 
tubes it did kind of come from the rebel
20<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.609> it's<00:00:30.449> not<00:00:30.810> less<00:00:31.619> it's<00:00:31.949> just<00:00:32.219> different

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
20 and it's not less it's just different

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.120 
20 and it's not less it's just different
we've<00:00:33.239> taken<00:00:33.660> off<00:00:33.870> some<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.469> little<00:00:34.980> bit

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
we've taken off some of the little bit

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.190 
we've taken off some of the little bit
kind<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.640> more<00:00:35.790> esoteric<00:00:36.000> features<00:00:36.870> like<00:00:37.079> the

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
kind of more esoteric features like the

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.720 
kind of more esoteric features like the
tube<00:00:37.380> mix<00:00:37.620> on<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.920> watts<00:00:38.100> knob<00:00:38.430> we<00:00:38.610> would

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
tube mix on the watts knob we would

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.110 
tube mix on the watts knob we would
remove<00:00:39.030> those<00:00:39.770> from<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.860> but<00:00:41.760> we've<00:00:41.940> added

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
remove those from that but we've added

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.209 
remove those from that but we've added
some<00:00:42.390> other<00:00:42.570> stuff<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.079> gives<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.680> bunch

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
some other stuff that gives you a bunch

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.510 
some other stuff that gives you a bunch
of<00:00:44.340> new<00:00:44.489> total<00:00:45.559> possibilities<00:00:46.559> okay<00:00:46.860> like

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
of new total possibilities okay like

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.279 
of new total possibilities okay like
most<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.940> our<00:00:48.030> stuff<00:00:48.329> we<00:00:48.570> have<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.899> titan

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
most of our stuff we have the titan

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.810 
most of our stuff we have the titan
brights<00:00:49.530> which<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.190> brights<00:00:50.399> which<00:00:50.640> we

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
brights which is the brights which we

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.189 
brights which is the brights which we
did<00:00:51.000> not<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.329> then<00:00:51.449> it's<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.660> bright<00:00:51.870> switch

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
did not and then it's a bright switch

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.290 
did not and then it's a bright switch
the<00:00:52.860> tights<00:00:53.129> which<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.579> kind<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.850> cool<00:00:54.030> when

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
the tights which is kind of cool when

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.209 
the tights which is kind of cool when
you<00:00:54.420> get<00:00:54.570> into<00:00:54.750> higher<00:00:55.020> gain<00:00:55.350> stuff<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:56.010> can

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
you get into higher gain stuff you can

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.010 
you get into higher gain stuff you can
cut<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.610> low<00:00:56.760> end<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.270> preamp<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.870> it

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
cut the low end in the preamp and it

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.569 
cut the low end in the preamp and it
definitely<00:00:58.379> tightens<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.070> up<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.340> it's<00:00:59.430> not

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
definitely tightens it up and it's not

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.420 
definitely tightens it up and it's not
as<00:00:59.730> money<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:01.230> one<00:01:01.440> we<00:01:01.590> also<00:01:01.770> have<00:01:02.039> added

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
as money so this one we also have added

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.690 
as money so this one we also have added
a<00:01:02.640> gain<00:01:03.059> switch<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.470> what<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.339> does<00:01:05.519> is

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
a gain switch and what it does is

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.340 
a gain switch and what it does is
broaden<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.240> range<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.750> game<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.170> this

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
broaden the range of the game so this

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.929 
broaden the range of the game so this
one<00:01:07.500> will<00:01:07.590> actually<00:01:07.979> play<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.189> little<00:01:08.430> cleaner

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
one will actually play a little cleaner

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.090 
one will actually play a little cleaner
than<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.299> 20<00:01:09.689> but<00:01:10.020> when<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.470> switch<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
than the 20 but when you switch to the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.480 
than the 20 but when you switch to the
hot<00:01:11.430> mode<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.780> know<00:01:12.840> it'll<00:01:13.380> go<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.310> other<00:01:14.400> way

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
hot mode you know it'll go the other way

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.710 
hot mode you know it'll go the other way
and<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.700> have<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> little<00:01:15.000> more<00:01:15.150> gain<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.600> it's

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
and you have a little more gain so it's

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.890 
and you have a little more gain so it's
just<00:01:15.780> got<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:15.990> wider<00:01:16.229> gain<00:01:16.530> range<00:01:16.860> than<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.189> 20

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
just got a wider gain range than the 20

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.330 
just got a wider gain range than the 20
duck<00:01:18.900> foot<00:01:19.110> switchable<00:01:19.500> only<00:01:19.860> notice<00:01:20.189> that

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
duck foot switchable only notice that

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.999 
duck foot switchable only notice that
like<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.729> single<00:01:21.090> channel<00:01:21.560> no<00:01:22.560> foot<00:01:22.770> switches

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
like a single channel no foot switches

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.859 
like a single channel no foot switches
no<00:01:23.640> nothing<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.299> just<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.479> bunch<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.720> cool

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
no nothing it's just a bunch of cool

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.310 
no nothing it's just a bunch of cool
tough<00:01:25.140> yeah<00:01:26.540> one<00:01:27.540> other<00:01:27.659> little<00:01:27.960> switch<00:01:28.170> on

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
tough yeah one other little switch on

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.539 
tough yeah one other little switch on
here<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.890> where<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.159> name<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
here and this is where the name the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.310 
here and this is where the name the
Tweaker<00:01:29.970> came<00:01:30.180> from<00:01:30.420> because<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.869> can<00:01:31.049> tweak

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
Tweaker came from because you can tweak

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.929 
Tweaker came from because you can tweak
all<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.650> sounds<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:32.130> kind<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.430> a

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
all the sounds it's kind of a

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.240 
all the sounds it's kind of a
it<00:01:33.420> says<00:01:33.659> vintage<00:01:34.020> modern<00:01:34.439> vintage<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:35.009> in<00:01:35.159> the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
it says vintage modern vintage is in the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.219 
it says vintage modern vintage is in the
power<00:01:35.460> amp<00:01:35.729> section<00:01:36.000> or<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.810> switch<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.140> in

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
power amp section or the switch is in

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.260 
power amp section or the switch is in
the<00:01:37.259> program<00:01:37.649> section<00:01:37.920> yeah<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.700> it's

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
the program section yeah and it's

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.210 
the program section yeah and it's
essentially<00:01:40.259> flat<00:01:40.530> when<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
essentially flat when it's in the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.580 
essentially flat when it's in the
vintage<00:01:41.399> low<00:01:41.700> not<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> bad<00:01:42.240> way<00:01:42.420> just<00:01:42.590> doing

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
vintage low not in a bad way just doing

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.289 
vintage low not in a bad way just doing
anything<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.520> when<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.670> go<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.939> moderate

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
anything and when you go to the moderate

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.760 
anything and when you go to the moderate
it<00:01:45.390> bumps<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.780> low<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.049> high<00:01:46.110> end<00:01:46.470> off<00:01:46.649> so

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
it bumps the low and high end off so

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.380 
it bumps the low and high end off so
it's<00:01:46.950> sort<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.220> like<00:01:47.340> having<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.820> presence<00:01:48.210> and

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
it's sort of like having a presence and

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.779 
it's sort of like having a presence and
in<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.840> density<00:01:49.619> or<00:01:49.740> resonance<00:01:50.130> control<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.729> it

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
in a density or resonance control and it

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.240 
in a density or resonance control and it
bumps<00:01:50.970> those<00:01:51.299> up<00:01:51.509> just<00:01:51.750> another<00:01:52.020> tone<00:01:52.380> but<00:01:52.950> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
bumps those up just another tone but the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.710 
bumps those up just another tone but the
coolest<00:01:53.640> thing<00:01:53.759> on<00:01:54.000> here<00:01:54.149> which<00:01:54.299> I've<00:01:54.479> saved

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
coolest thing on here which I've saved

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.840 
coolest thing on here which I've saved
for<00:01:54.899> last<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.799> switch<00:01:56.039> it<00:01:56.250> says<00:01:56.689> USA<00:01:57.689> AC

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
for last is this switch it says USA AC

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.270 
for last is this switch it says USA AC
print<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.329> what<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.079> does<00:02:01.289> is<00:02:01.649> magically

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
print and what that does is magically

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.429 
print and what that does is magically
changes<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.819> tone<00:02:03.030> controls<00:02:03.509> would<00:02:04.110> be<00:02:04.259> a

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
changes the tone controls would be a

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.850 
changes the tone controls would be a
Fender<00:02:04.979> box<00:02:05.610> or<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.000> Marshall<00:02:06.569> and<00:02:07.080> it<00:02:07.560> actually

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
Fender box or a Marshall and it actually

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.370 
Fender box or a Marshall and it actually
really<00:02:08.130> works<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.670> right<00:02:08.819> it's<00:02:09.209> cool<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.289> you

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
really works and right it's cool so you

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.740 
really works and right it's cool so you
can<00:02:10.470> get<00:02:10.560> fender<00:02:10.890> greens<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.430> guitar<00:02:11.910> yeah

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
can get fender greens and guitar yeah

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
you put the you go to the box over there

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.620 
you put the you go to the box over there
go<00:02:16.650> for<00:02:16.830> example<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.430> crank<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.760> game<00:02:17.970> yep

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
go for example and crank the game yep

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.630 
go for example and crank the game yep
and<00:02:18.870> use<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.260> high<00:02:19.440> gain<00:02:19.500> mode<00:02:19.950> on<00:02:20.130> it<00:02:20.370> yeah

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
and use the high gain mode on it yeah

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.089 
and use the high gain mode on it yeah
that's<00:02:20.910> almost<00:02:21.299> a<00:02:21.569> metal<00:02:22.140> feel<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:22.980> because

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
that's almost a metal feel to it because

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.580 
that's almost a metal feel to it because
it's<00:02:23.370> good<00:02:23.519> some<00:02:23.700> every<00:02:23.940> job<00:02:24.239> so<00:02:24.510> right<00:02:24.810> there

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
it's good some every job so right there

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.839 
it's good some every job so right there
are<00:02:25.799> even<00:02:26.069> things<00:02:26.310> in<00:02:26.459> here<00:02:26.549> you<00:02:26.610> wouldn't

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
are even things in here you wouldn't

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.390 
are even things in here you wouldn't
normally<00:02:27.000> think<00:02:27.239> of<00:02:27.569> doing<00:02:28.010> so<00:02:29.010> just<00:02:29.220> because

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
normally think of doing so just because

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.729 
normally think of doing so just because
it<00:02:29.640> has<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.269> brick<00:02:30.480> setting<00:02:31.380> it<00:02:31.500> doesn't

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
it has the the brick setting it doesn't

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:32.990 
it has the the brick setting it doesn't
necessarily<00:02:32.099> mean<00:02:32.190> you'll<00:02:32.370> be<00:02:32.400> using<00:02:32.670> it<00:02:32.910> in

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
necessarily mean you'll be using it in

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.180 
necessarily mean you'll be using it in
that<00:02:33.030> yeah<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:34.079> kind<00:02:34.319> of<00:02:34.380> why<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:34.590> sound<00:02:34.920> like

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
that yeah so kind of why you sound like

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.800 
that yeah so kind of why you sound like
a<00:02:35.489> Marshall<00:02:36.150> even<00:02:36.420> though<00:02:36.510> it's<00:02:36.599> in<00:02:36.690> the

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
a Marshall even though it's in the

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.690 
a Marshall even though it's in the
breath<00:02:37.049> mode<00:02:37.290> it's<00:02:37.560> very<00:02:37.739> cool<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.280> want<00:02:38.459> so

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
breath mode it's very cool you want so

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.930 
breath mode it's very cool you want so
kind<00:02:39.480> of<00:02:39.569> endless<00:02:39.780> little<00:02:40.560> tone<00:02:41.489> control

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
kind of endless little tone control

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.990 
kind of endless little tone control
things<00:02:42.769> does<00:02:43.769> have<00:02:43.950> an<00:02:44.069> effects<00:02:44.340> loop<00:02:44.459> all<00:02:44.850> of

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
things does have an effects loop all of

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.759 
things does have an effects loop all of
our<00:02:45.120> amps<00:02:45.359> have<00:02:45.510> effects<00:02:45.810> loop<00:02:46.049> is<00:02:46.230> one<00:02:46.530> thing

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
our amps have effects loop is one thing

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.590 
our amps have effects loop is one thing
that<00:02:46.799> a<00:02:46.980> lot<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.190> really<00:02:47.519> helps<00:02:47.910> nowadays<00:02:48.359> for

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
that a lot of really helps nowadays for

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.230 
that a lot of really helps nowadays for
some<00:02:48.810> reason<00:02:49.139> they<00:02:49.260> think

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
some reason they think

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.390 
some reason they think
if<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.230> manufacturers<00:02:51.890> feeling<00:02:52.220> you<00:02:52.280> don't

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
if the manufacturers feeling you don't

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.910 
if the manufacturers feeling you don't
need<00:02:52.670> that<00:02:52.910> I<00:02:52.940> personally<00:02:53.570> feel<00:02:53.750> it<00:02:53.960> do<00:02:54.260> yep<00:02:54.800> so

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920

you<00:02:55.010> did<00:02:55.130> have<00:02:55.220> an<00:02:55.310> attack<00:02:55.550> solution

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
you did have an attack solution

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.000 
you did have an attack solution
impedance<00:02:56.270> selector<00:02:56.750> switch<00:02:57.020> a<00:02:57.170> four<00:02:57.830> eight

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
impedance selector switch a four eight

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.390 
impedance selector switch a four eight
or<00:02:58.040> six<00:02:58.490> now<00:02:59.680> normal<00:03:00.680> stuff<00:03:00.890> these<00:03:01.190> aren't

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
or six now normal stuff these aren't

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.950 
or six now normal stuff these aren't
like<00:03:01.520> little<00:03:01.820> gimmicky<00:03:02.300> things<00:03:02.720> they're

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
like little gimmicky things they're

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.570 
like little gimmicky things they're
actually<00:03:02.990> eligible<00:03:03.530> things<00:03:03.980> because<00:03:04.400> higher

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
actually eligible things because higher

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.350 
actually eligible things because higher
players<00:03:05.560> yeah<00:03:06.560> like<00:03:07.000> me<00:03:08.000> being<00:03:08.150> a<00:03:08.240> guitar

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
players yeah like me being a guitar

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.030 
players yeah like me being a guitar
player<00:03:08.720> so<00:03:08.810> I<00:03:08.960> like<00:03:09.110> them<00:03:09.230> too<00:03:09.410> that's<00:03:09.800> closer

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
player so I like them too that's closer

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.100 
player so I like them too that's closer
that's<00:03:10.970> a<00:03:11.090> little<00:03:11.270> bit<00:03:11.390> different<00:03:11.690> look<00:03:11.840> than

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
that's a little bit different look than

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.250 
that's a little bit different look than
the<00:03:12.410> other<00:03:12.850> lines<00:03:13.850> that<00:03:13.970> we<00:03:14.120> do<00:03:14.270> and<00:03:14.540> part<00:03:15.230> of

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
the other lines that we do and part of

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.660 
the other lines that we do and part of
the<00:03:15.350> reason<00:03:15.590> for<00:03:15.620> that<00:03:15.770> is<00:03:16.070> it's<00:03:16.250> in<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.460> same

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
the reason for that is it's in the same

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.690 
the reason for that is it's in the same
size<00:03:17.000> box<00:03:17.360> as<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:17.990> rebel<00:03:18.290> of<00:03:18.350> money<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:19.370> we

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
size box as the rebel of money and we

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.800 
size box as the rebel of money and we
didn't<00:03:19.850> want<00:03:20.000> to<00:03:20.030> have<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.270> too<00:03:20.390> confused

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
didn't want to have the too confused

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.140
