Cameron<00:00:03.659> asks<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.319> question<00:00:04.770> about<00:00:05.100> working

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
Cameron asks the question about working

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.560 
Cameron asks the question about working
these<00:00:06.150> muscles<00:00:06.210> for<00:00:07.170> arms<00:00:07.620> abs<00:00:08.570> shoulders

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
these muscles for arms abs shoulders

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.140 
these muscles for arms abs shoulders
biceps<00:00:10.250> he<00:00:11.250> says<00:00:11.429> do<00:00:11.550> you<00:00:11.610> really<00:00:11.880> have<00:00:11.969> to

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
biceps he says do you really have to

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.030 
biceps he says do you really have to
work<00:00:12.360> these<00:00:12.570> hard<00:00:12.960> because<00:00:13.290> they're<00:00:13.650> sort<00:00:13.980> of

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
work these hard because they're sort of

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.709 
work these hard because they're sort of
worked<00:00:14.280> in<00:00:14.490> directly<00:00:15.120> when<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.420> do<00:00:15.540> other

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
worked in directly when you do other

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.840 
worked in directly when you do other
body<00:00:15.960> parts<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:17.279> answer<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.640> absolutely

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
body parts and the answer is absolutely

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.120 
body parts and the answer is absolutely
remember<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:21.359> can't<00:00:21.630> isolate<00:00:21.960> one<00:00:22.650> muscle

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
remember you can't isolate one muscle

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.040 
remember you can't isolate one muscle
without<00:00:23.340> sort<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.240> hitting<00:00:24.539> something<00:00:24.689> else

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
without sort of hitting something else

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.320 
without sort of hitting something else
when<00:00:25.680> you're<00:00:25.800> curling<00:00:26.250> dumbbells<00:00:26.699> you're<00:00:27.180> not

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
when you're curling dumbbells you're not

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.179 
when you're curling dumbbells you're not
just<00:00:27.359> working<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:27.960> biceps<00:00:28.170> you're<00:00:29.010> working

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
just working the biceps you're working

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.679 
just working the biceps you're working
the<00:00:29.400> floor<00:00:29.670> arms<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.060> hold<00:00:30.179> on<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.510> weight

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
the floor arms to hold on to the weight

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.849 
the floor arms to hold on to the weight
and<00:00:30.960> you're<00:00:31.170> actually<00:00:31.320> working<00:00:31.679> the

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
and you're actually working the

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.560 
and you're actually working the
shoulders<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.579> support<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.090> whole<00:00:33.239> structure

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
shoulders to support the whole structure

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.530 
shoulders to support the whole structure
I<00:00:33.960> mean<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:35.040> again<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:36.059> body<00:00:36.270> works

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
I mean so again the body works

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.930 
I mean so again the body works
synergistically<00:00:37.610> even<00:00:38.610> though<00:00:38.730> you're

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
synergistically even though you're

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.459 
synergistically even though you're
working<00:00:39.300> one<00:00:39.450> muscle<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.930> other<00:00:40.079> ones<00:00:40.320> are

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
working one muscle the other ones are

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.280 
working one muscle the other ones are
tightening<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.280> stabilizing<00:00:42.090> but<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.050> do

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
tightening and stabilizing but you do

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.319 
tightening and stabilizing but you do
have<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.739> work<00:00:43.920> shoulders<00:00:44.820> even<00:00:45.210> though

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
have to work shoulders even though

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.110 
have to work shoulders even though
they're<00:00:45.570> worked<00:00:45.840> when<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.440> hit<00:00:46.739> chest<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.879> do

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
they're worked when you hit chest you do

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.420 
they're worked when you hit chest you do
have<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.510> work<00:00:48.660> biceps<00:00:49.289> even<00:00:50.010> though<00:00:50.160> they're

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
have to work biceps even though they're

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.910 
have to work biceps even though they're
worked<00:00:50.700> when<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.180> hit<00:00:51.510> back<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.620> definitely

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
worked when you hit back you definitely

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.279 
worked when you hit back you definitely
have<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.399> train<00:00:53.789> abs<00:00:54.030> because<00:00:54.390> when<00:00:55.140> you

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
have to train abs because when you

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.709 
have to train abs because when you
actually<00:00:55.469> do<00:00:55.800> abdominal<00:00:56.100> exercises<00:00:57.030> that's

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
actually do abdominal exercises that's

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.900 
actually do abdominal exercises that's
much<00:00:57.989> more<00:00:58.199> intense<00:00:58.620> than<00:00:59.280> when<00:00:59.489> you're<00:00:59.640> just

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
much more intense than when you're just

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.029 
much more intense than when you're just
tightening<00:01:00.510> your<00:01:00.660> abdominals<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.800> bench

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
tightening your abdominals to bench

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.719 
tightening your abdominals to bench
press<00:01:02.160> or<00:01:02.699> curl<00:01:03.059> away<00:01:03.830> absolutely<00:01:04.830> forearms

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
press or curl away absolutely forearms

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.789 
press or curl away absolutely forearms
you<00:01:06.180> don't<00:01:06.330> have<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.750> train<00:01:07.020> them<00:01:07.229> but<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.619> do

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
you don't have to train them but I do

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.219 
you don't have to train them but I do
because<00:01:08.760> again<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.330> another<00:01:09.510> muscle<00:01:09.900> group

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
because again it's another muscle group

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.800 
because again it's another muscle group
in<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.439> body<00:01:11.180> when<00:01:12.180> you're<00:01:12.270> laying<00:01:12.540> out<00:01:12.780> your

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
in the body when you're laying out your

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.590 
in the body when you're laying out your
workout<00:01:13.470> how<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:13.920> lay<00:01:14.159> your<00:01:14.280> workout<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.880> not

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
workout how you lay your workout is not

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.980 
workout how you lay your workout is not
critical<00:01:16.200> but<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:17.460> will<00:01:17.729> say<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.150> if<00:01:18.479> you

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
critical but I will say this if you

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.080 
critical but I will say this if you
train<00:01:19.350> chest<00:01:19.799> you're<00:01:20.549> going<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.759> hit<00:01:20.909> your

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
train chest you're going to hit your

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.719 
train chest you're going to hit your
shoulders<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.600> little<00:01:21.780> bit<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.799> I'd<00:01:23.280> like<00:01:23.580> to

you use your biceps so they're going to
get<00:01:46.439> hidden<00:01:46.680> directly<00:01:47.340> if<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.210> did<00:01:48.390> biceps<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
get hidden directly if I did biceps the
