00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 Today because that May 1 celebration 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.879
 workers make a famous picture that 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.580
 talk about this is heard from 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.170
 fourth state the fourth state is not 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.630
 the one in which the glosses and after one 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.150
 disco night but it would be one of 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.760
 layers in which it used to be divided 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.250
 the company that first brought us one 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.920
 it would be more nobility than you owe us 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.109
 that is to say to see and yet a throw 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.930
 not like baron marquis prince like that 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.300
 the second would be clergy be priests 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.189
 and to the third it would be everything and I remain yes to the 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.079
 people who originally understood a 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.540
 miserable bourgeois traders 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.120
 artisan workers peasants and so on 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.790
 but this verse state if it divides into two 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.530
 that a bourgeoisie is a little more up than there is 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.320
 they have something good life to a 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.450
 shop a permanent place for the deaf and instead 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.730
 the fourth and last state is not small 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.620
 a bat and as the only thing there is 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.320
 in abundance only the children are called 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.480
 even the right-wing proletariat 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.949
 framework thanks to socialism finally 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.079
 also an agent of culture as well as 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.239
 artists begin to be careful 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.610
 poor people not only as a subject 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.950
 picturesque of novels or paintings 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.930
 sayings of the kind type scopes that 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.790
 nice peasant sti living in 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.340
 beautiful countryside blessed them 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.380
 in contact with nature and yet the work of art 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.630
 good you maybe on simple people but 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.250
 so true oh well ambrogio comeback but 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.170
 china namoc ai 7 ie the tournament of 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.670
 bridge core commendatore 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.500
 but if they begin to consider how 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.409
 subject of rights and claims 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.540
 politics has arisen knew here for example 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.060
 thought that art must be pursued a 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.729
 social duty type of complaint or one 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.829
 educational purpose that the masses that if one 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.710
 think so much of the right hat 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.259
 even if you always have to be careful not to 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.659
 makes a bad complaint picture ie 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.149
 as an artist says something right but 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.310
 you say wrong you said something right but 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.500
 you are not a good artist maybe you should 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.149
 doing politics that is talking about what 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.409
 you think it's enough that you do it as an art 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.509
 commands 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.490
 but let us return to the author he was 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.369
 son of the peasants pure he or describes 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.500
 so I'm painting the animated progression of a 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.990
 group of workers to the source 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.560
 brightly symbolizing my own 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.310
 all the big tv family of work 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.959
 see that these proletarians are on strike 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.819
 and the two that advance on the designated ones 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.709
 to talk to the bosses 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.440
 today it would be a delegation of unions 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.720
 go and to a woman who perhaps to wife of the 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.700
 painter holds an arm a little boy e 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.950
 with the book arm makes a gesture like of 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.300
 areas as we are today 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.519
 he would have freed that arm because 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.590
 she would work pure and therefore from one 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.480
 part smoking and the other would be a 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.180
 check mail of the job or answer 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.099
 on the phone and he has forgotten only one 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.010
 once the idea of ​​equal rights for 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.750
 everyone was not so clear and the rich ai 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.319
 gentlemen the dodged a lot ai 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.690
 workers 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.660
 yet manual work for them 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.580
 never did they still touch today 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.650
 always beware of those who work 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.660
 around us maybe in conditions 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.030
 unfair and almost unfair 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.630
 invisible and maybe even work some 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.330
 first of May 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.060
 like the drivers I journalists from 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.730
 tg the cops the doctors on duty and 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.130
 carers, waiters and tour guides 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.810
 sellers of pecorino beans those who 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.730
 dismounts in the park of the concertone a san 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.069
 john and so on 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.109
 to these and these and above all to whom 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.209
 Instead he has lost one job you can 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:21.660
