00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.080
 hello today we will tell you 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.600
 about the features of applying the front 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.520
 side almost all classic 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.320
 boxing punches 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.320
 have the direction of the vector that is forward 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.770
 I hit you right now with a glass and I hit 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:30.230
 at the side 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:30.230
 but clearly forward now plump 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.829
 this side option i beat glass and 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.690
 I try not to lift my elbow high 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:43.879
 Shot beat almost in a straight line clearly 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.879
 forward maybe a little bit diagonally 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.269
 where I step foot there and beat clearly 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.690
 forward i twist 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:58.589
 and beat forward it can be short 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.889
 the side can be long is a gift 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:08.750
 fights both on the steps and on the jump 

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:08.750
 here I am on stage show that's on the jump 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.840
 when I hit an opponent I step on him 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:18.120
 forward or jump on it forward vector 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:24.150
 direction of force forward therefore hit 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:32.520
 flies too forward pay attention I 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:34.560
 I beat not sideways but clearly forward this option 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.930
 hitting the hardest except 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.730
 this blow hard it possible 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.060
 short that helps not to beat 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.060
 safeguards 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.180
 maximum hard side beat on 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.670
 forward but if man 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.220
 tightly closed block we beat already on 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.560
 semicircle in the contour of his block we of course 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.280
 should not fall behind the ear line but 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:08.070
 must manage to get to the jaw and 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:10.979
 it already looks in an arc the same time we 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.570
 can beat the side forward with a glass but 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.820
 if we jump forward we can and 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:22.110
 strike harder with the hitter effect 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:24.300
 hammer that is raise your elbow up in 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.850
 turn in the block bypass we can 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.180
 hit only glass because if 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.890
 I'll beat lift my elbow up I 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.989
 would you hit with your thumb either 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.330
 front knuckle which is very traumatic 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.250
 except that we do side strokes 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.500
 forward we can beat them and 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.269
 to the side this happens if 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.060
 we are at close range 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:48.239
 very tight again take off my hand we 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.030
 can remove the jaw from above or do 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.830
 the same hit the side if we donâ€™t 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.049
 there is enough distance to strike forward 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.380
 could we do this on the side of any position 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.380
 fist 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.709
 Now I showed blows without accelerating 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.459
 shoulder i mean i beat forward but with increments 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.650
 or with a jump so that the blow was stronger we 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.980
 first do defensive actions either 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.280
 dive accelerating shoulder or accelerating 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.280
 shoulder 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:24.780
 Now we will tell you how it is easier 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:28.020
 work out front side boxer 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.750
 strikes a direct blow and with my front hand I 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.770
 defend myself and beat after bias or sockeye 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.770
 or towards
