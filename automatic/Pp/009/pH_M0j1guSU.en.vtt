00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
story that was a little bit more than a

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.700 
story that was a little bit more than a
kids<00:01:26.970> show<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.390> little<00:01:27.689> bit<00:01:27.840> more<00:01:28.170> like<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:29.299> an

kids show a little bit more like a an

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.390 
kids show a little bit more like a an
adult<00:01:31.710> adventure<00:01:32.369> show<00:01:32.549> but<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:33.060> still<00:01:34.400> you

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
adult adventure show but but still you

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.450 
adult adventure show but but still you
know<00:01:35.490> still<00:01:35.640> kid-friendly<00:01:36.270> but<00:01:36.659> but<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.930> little

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
know still kid-friendly but but a little

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.609 
know still kid-friendly but but a little
a<00:01:38.460> little<00:01:39.420> stronger<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:40.049> little<00:01:40.259> more<00:01:40.500> dramatic

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
a little stronger a little more dramatic

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.700 
a little stronger a little more dramatic
a<00:01:41.299> little<00:01:42.299> less<00:01:43.159> silly<00:01:44.159> comedy<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:45.530> think<00:01:46.530> that

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
a little less silly comedy I think that

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.300 
a little less silly comedy I think that
the<00:01:46.829> show<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.369> now<00:01:48.649> dramatically<00:01:49.649> stronger

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
the show is now dramatically stronger

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.270 
the show is now dramatically stronger
than<00:01:50.549> then<00:01:51.030> most<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.290> sort<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.829> costumed

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
than then most of the sort of costumed

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.630 
than then most of the sort of costumed
hero<00:01:53.549> shows<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:54.060> we've<00:01:54.210> seen<00:01:54.420> before<00:01:55.640> the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
hero shows that we've seen before the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.139 
hero shows that we've seen before the
fights<00:01:57.530> mean<00:01:58.530> something<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.579> characters

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
fights mean something the characters

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.539 
fights mean something the characters
grow<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.990> change<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:03.930> story<00:02:04.290> has<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:05.100> lot

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
grow and change and the story has a lot

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.650 
grow and change and the story has a lot
of<00:02:05.579> drama<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.860> I<00:02:07.860> think<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.819> big<00:02:08.970> payoff<00:02:09.270> at<00:02:09.629> the

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
of drama and I think a big payoff at the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.300 
of drama and I think a big payoff at the
end<00:02:09.780> and

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
end and

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.830 
end and
I<00:02:12.560> think<00:02:13.560> that<00:02:13.739> there<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.510> anybody<00:02:15.510> who<00:02:15.630> says

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
I think that there that anybody who says

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.420 
I think that there that anybody who says
that<00:02:15.870> it's<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.590> it's<00:02:16.800> dumbed<00:02:17.099> down<00:02:17.250> is

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
that it's that it's dumbed down is

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.580 
that it's that it's dumbed down is
reacting<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:21.000> fears<00:02:21.300> of<00:02:21.390> other<00:02:22.140> shows<00:02:22.349> that

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
reacting to to fears of other shows that

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.960 
reacting to to fears of other shows that
they've<00:02:22.739> seen<00:02:22.950> but<00:02:23.340> this<00:02:23.489> show<00:02:23.640> is<00:02:23.790> going<00:02:23.940> to

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
they've seen but this show is going to

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.449 
they've seen but this show is going to
be<00:02:24.030> different<00:02:24.590> if<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.709> show<00:02:25.920> definitely<00:02:26.220> has

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
be different if the show definitely has

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.380 
be different if the show definitely has
a<00:02:27.050> message<00:02:28.050> for<00:02:28.610> children<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:29.760> for<00:02:30.000> anybody

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
a message for children and for anybody

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
show he is faced with with choices that

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.390 
show he is faced with with choices that
he<00:03:12.690> has<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:13.049> make<00:03:13.200> which<00:03:13.769> are<00:03:13.890> difficult

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
he has to make which are difficult

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.849 
he has to make which are difficult
choices<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:15.090> when<00:03:15.959> he<00:03:16.079> makes<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.709> wrong

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
choices and when he makes the wrong

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.120 
choices and when he makes the wrong
choice<00:03:17.250> he<00:03:18.090> pays<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:18.600> consequence<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:19.500> when

he<00:03:20.220> makes<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.609> right<00:03:20.790> choice<00:03:21.890> he<00:03:22.890> learned

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
he makes the right choice he learned

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.660 
he makes the right choice he learned
something<00:03:23.519> and<00:03:23.900> things<00:03:24.900> get<00:03:25.079> better<00:03:25.640> so<00:03:26.640> I

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
something and things get better so I

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.870 
something and things get better so I
think<00:03:27.329> it<00:03:27.569> really<00:03:27.600> does<00:03:27.959> have<00:03:28.290> some<00:03:29.250> moral

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
think it really does have some moral

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.090 
think it really does have some moral
underpinnings<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:30.540> I<00:03:30.630> think<00:03:30.840> I<00:03:31.049> think<00:03:31.319> it'll

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.470 

you<00:03:35.100> know<00:03:35.220> it's<00:03:35.400> primarily<00:03:35.850> an<00:03:36.060> action<00:03:36.359> show

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
you know it's primarily an action show

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.980 
you know it's primarily an action show
but<00:03:36.660> it<00:03:36.780> will<00:03:36.930> teach<00:03:37.200> things<00:03:37.560> as<00:03:37.739> well
