00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
 Course talk 

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.910
 Summer festival talk 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.299
 Kimura 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:12.299
 It is news 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:15.269
 Hello 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.659
 It goes off during the prestigious association 

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:23.380
 This time I was studying about my father and mother 

00:00:23.379 --> 00:00:26.109
 Please tell me domestically in response to it 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.949
 Let's use jamosa 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.949
 Please make a text transaction 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.539
 By the way, here is the teacher of the management team 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:36.380
 I heard 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.930
 Mr. Neogawa 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.400
 I heard that the moon feels like a contribution slider once 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.880
 But what kind of thing 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.970
 It was low 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.800
 What does mother think 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.290
 Certainly the moon has been on the same side of the earth 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.320
 I think this is what you know 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.690
 Other Starbucks 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.790
 I like this 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.429
 I'm translating English 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:04.130
 I saw it from above my head 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.540
 Well, we need to evolve like this 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.850
 If so, the moon will face to the floating ball 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.820
 The decoding month is 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.690
 I will go around the earth for a long time 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.970
 If you come here and say what happens 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.430
 It is such a form 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.430
 And 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.150
 There are already 90 degrees 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.610
 And do 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.120
 And 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.700
 This is repeated like this 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.610
 I told you that 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.620
 closed 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.860
 All the movements this time are left strike 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.060
 Please participate on the day 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.850
 There is an exception in Airbus 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.850
 Realizes the earth number counterclockwise 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.970
 The following also revolves around the earth counterclockwise 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.380
 In fact, all the withdrawals in the hall will also turn left 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.690
 Emphasize that I want to do a little 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.330
 In this direction 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.730
 Oozu will continue to rotate 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.790
 I told you this teacher 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.670
 It is a thing of the country when it rotates to a contribution slider at one time
