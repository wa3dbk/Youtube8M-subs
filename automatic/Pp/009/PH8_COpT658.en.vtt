mentioned<00:00:19.029> in<00:00:19.239> the<00:00:19.570> d800<00:00:20.410> instruction<00:00:21.279> book

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
mentioned in the d800 instruction book

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.350 
mentioned in the d800 instruction book
on<00:00:21.669> page<00:00:22.060> 55<00:00:22.750> there<00:00:23.380> is<00:00:23.500> a<00:00:23.529> special<00:00:24.009> little

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
on page 55 there is a special little

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.690 
on page 55 there is a special little
part<00:00:25.360> here<00:00:25.419> saying<00:00:25.810> exposure<00:00:26.579> depending<00:00:27.579> on

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:27.700 
part here saying exposure depending on

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.389 
part here saying exposure depending on
the<00:00:27.790> scene<00:00:28.029> exposure<00:00:28.779> may<00:00:29.290> differ<00:00:29.649> from<00:00:30.309> that

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:30.399 
the scene exposure may differ from that

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:33.030 
the scene exposure may differ from that
which<00:00:30.759> would<00:00:31.180> be<00:00:31.480> obtained<00:00:32.200> with<00:00:32.470> live<00:00:32.739> view

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
which would be obtained with live view

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.650 
which would be obtained with live view
is<00:00:33.280> not<00:00:33.730> used<00:00:34.000> so<00:00:34.829> if<00:00:35.829> I<00:00:36.250> am<00:00:36.519> taking<00:00:37.329> photos

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
is not used so if I am taking photos

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.750 
is not used so if I am taking photos
normally<00:00:38.320> and<00:00:38.590> then<00:00:38.829> I<00:00:38.920> go<00:00:39.070> or<00:00:39.219> just<00:00:39.489> take<00:00:39.640> it

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
normally and then I go or just take it

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.720 
normally and then I go or just take it
in<00:00:39.850> my<00:00:39.879> view<00:00:40.350> suddenly<00:00:41.350> it's<00:00:42.129> taking

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
in my view suddenly it's taking

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.610 
in my view suddenly it's taking
completely<00:00:43.359> differently<00:00:43.750> differently

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
completely differently differently

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.579 
completely differently differently
exposed<00:00:45.129> images<00:00:46.000> let<00:00:46.359> me<00:00:46.539> show<00:00:46.870> you<00:00:46.929> the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:47.589 
exposed images let me show you the

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:50.520 
exposed images let me show you the
example<00:00:47.710> here<00:00:48.480> I've<00:00:49.480> got<00:00:49.780> the<00:00:49.899> camera<00:00:50.079> set<00:00:50.260> up

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
example here I've got the camera set up

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.160 
example here I've got the camera set up
on<00:00:50.800> a<00:00:50.829> tripod<00:00:51.070> and<00:00:51.670> we're<00:00:52.120> sitting<00:00:52.989> in<00:00:53.079> a

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
on a tripod and we're sitting in a

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.290 
on a tripod and we're sitting in a
shooting<00:00:53.739> a<00:00:53.980> scene<00:00:54.339> which<00:00:54.969> is<00:00:54.999> kind<00:00:55.269> of

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
shooting a scene which is kind of

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.700 
shooting a scene which is kind of
variable<00:00:55.659> like<00:00:55.809> we've<00:00:55.929> got<00:00:56.079> outdoor<00:00:56.499> light

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
variable like we've got outdoor light

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.919 
variable like we've got outdoor light
i've<00:00:57.070> got<00:00:57.219> internal<00:00:57.789> light<00:00:58.120> or<00:00:58.539> light<00:00:58.690> not

00:00:58.919 --> 00:00:58.929 
i've got internal light or light not

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:02.309 
i've got internal light or light not
hair<00:00:59.170> stuff<00:00:59.379> and<00:00:59.859> if<00:01:00.429> we<00:01:00.579> turn<00:01:01.480> the<00:01:01.749> camera<00:01:02.079> on

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:02.319 
hair stuff and if we turn the camera on

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:05.670 
hair stuff and if we turn the camera on
so<00:01:02.620> it's<00:01:03.370> in<00:01:03.579> aperture<00:01:03.839> apps<00:01:04.839> your<00:01:05.140> priority

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
so it's in aperture apps your priority

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.069 
so it's in aperture apps your priority
we've<00:01:06.280> got<00:01:06.460> no<00:01:06.670> exposure<00:01:07.119> compensation<00:01:07.390> going

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:08.079 
we've got no exposure compensation going

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:10.410 
we've got no exposure compensation going
on<00:01:08.170> at<00:01:08.320> that<00:01:08.649> it's<00:01:08.979> all<00:01:09.159> as<00:01:09.460> basic<00:01:10.180> as<00:01:10.360> it

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
on at that it's all as basic as it

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.679 
on at that it's all as basic as it
should<00:01:11.380> be<00:01:11.649> f4<00:01:12.280> give<00:01:12.939> me<00:01:13.090> a<00:01:13.119> two<00:01:13.329> hundredth<00:01:13.659> of

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 
should be f4 give me a two hundredth of

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:14.999 
should be f4 give me a two hundredth of
a<00:01:13.780> second<00:01:14.140> reading<00:01:14.320> and<00:01:14.560> that's<00:01:14.770> what<00:01:14.890> it's

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
a second reading and that's what it's

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.100 
a second reading and that's what it's
saying<00:01:15.189> should<00:01:15.490> be<00:01:15.670> right<00:01:16.390> in<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.689> middle<00:01:16.840> of

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
saying should be right in the middle of

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.069 
saying should be right in the middle of
the<00:01:17.649> exposure<00:01:18.009> the<00:01:18.579> exposure<00:01:19.360> setting<00:01:19.869> is<00:01:20.020> for

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079 
the exposure the exposure setting is for

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:23.490 
the exposure the exposure setting is for
a<00:01:21.040> value<00:01:21.520> tip<00:01:21.700> so<00:01:21.880> uses<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.329> whole<00:01:22.450> area<00:01:22.750> no

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
a value tip so uses the whole area no

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.289 
a value tip so uses the whole area no
problem<00:01:24.040> there<00:01:24.219> at<00:01:24.310> all<00:01:24.490> let's<00:01:24.790> go<00:01:24.969> take<00:01:25.270> a

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
problem there at all let's go take a

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
photo so it's taking a photo at two

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.929 
photo so it's taking a photo at two
hundredths<00:01:29.229> of<00:01:29.409> a<00:01:29.979> second<00:01:30.369> one<00:01:30.520> hundredth<00:01:30.880> of

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
hundredths of a second one hundredth of

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:37.679 
hundredths of a second one hundredth of

top two hundred 160th so it's kind of

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.130 
top two hundred 160th so it's kind of
is<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.879> point<00:02:16.329> where<00:02:16.510> it's<00:02:16.629> changing<00:02:16.810> the

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
is the point where it's changing the

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.220 
is the point where it's changing the
exposure<00:02:17.489> turn<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:18.640> live<00:02:18.790> view<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.659> now<00:02:20.079> it's

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
exposure turn the live view and now it's

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.899 
exposure turn the live view and now it's
four<00:02:20.860> hundredths<00:02:21.250> of<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:22.870> second<00:02:23.909> absolutely

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
four hundredths of a second absolutely

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.809 
four hundredths of a second absolutely
no<00:02:25.689> reason<00:02:26.290> why<00:02:26.799> and<00:02:27.040> let's<00:02:27.189> just<00:02:27.340> go<00:02:27.459> take<00:02:27.670> a

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
no reason why and let's just go take a

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.819 
no reason why and let's just go take a
photo<00:02:29.909> and<00:02:30.909> it<00:02:31.150> takes<00:02:31.329> it<00:02:31.480> at<00:02:31.689> four<00:02:32.049> hundredths

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
photo and it takes it at four hundredths

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:34.050 
photo and it takes it at four hundredths
of<00:02:32.980> a<00:02:33.340> second

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
of a second

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.089 
of a second
no<00:02:34.780> it<00:02:34.900> says<00:02:35.079> five<00:02:35.319> hundredths<00:02:35.650> of<00:02:35.680> a<00:02:35.739> second

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
no it says five hundredths of a second

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.890 
no it says five hundredths of a second
so<00:02:36.220> we've<00:02:36.340> also<00:02:36.459> got<00:02:36.670> some<00:02:36.700> tiny<00:02:37.299> amounts<00:02:37.750> of

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
so we've also got some tiny amounts of

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.280 
so we've also got some tiny amounts of
changing<00:02:38.349> light<00:02:38.560> outside<00:02:39.810> take<00:02:40.810> another<00:02:41.079> four

changing light outside take another four

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.750 
changing light outside take another four
to<00:02:42.659> five<00:02:43.659> hundredths<00:02:44.079> of<00:02:44.109> a<00:02:44.200> second<00:02:44.760> live
