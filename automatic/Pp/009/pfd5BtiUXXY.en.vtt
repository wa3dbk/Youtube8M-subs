in<00:04:40.950> a<00:04:41.160> flat<00:04:41.490> nur<00:04:41.700> this<00:04:42.480> was<00:04:42.660> a<00:04:42.690> weird<00:04:43.020> plane

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
in a flat nur this was a weird plane

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.280 
in a flat nur this was a weird plane
helicopter<00:04:43.710> hybrid<00:04:44.580> that<00:04:45.090> those<00:04:45.240> pesky<00:04:45.630> Nazis

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.900 
helicopter hybrid that those pesky Nazis
were<00:04:46.470> developing<00:04:46.950> on<00:04:47.100> during<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.460> war<00:04:47.669> I

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
were developing on during the war I

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.670 
were developing on during the war I
think<00:04:48.570> it<00:04:48.630> would<00:04:48.750> be<00:04:48.810> a<00:04:48.840> nice<00:04:49.110> little<00:04:49.260> joke

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
think it would be a nice little joke

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.140 
think it would be a nice little joke
just<00:04:49.950> to<00:04:50.070> have<00:04:50.220> this<00:04:50.370> thing<00:04:50.610> flying<00:04:50.880> around

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
the battlefield 4 I think it would be

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.010 
the battlefield 4 I think it would be
more<00:04:53.220> of<00:04:53.490> a<00:04:53.610> skid<00:04:54.030> loader<00:04:54.270> type<00:04:54.570> vehicle

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
more of a skid loader type vehicle

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.430 
more of a skid loader type vehicle
rather<00:04:55.620> than<00:04:55.919> a<00:04:55.980> serious<00:04:56.550> battle<00:04:56.820> asset

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440
