just a girl in disguise I personally see
her<00:02:34.970> as<00:02:35.090> genderqueer<00:02:35.480> but<00:02:36.020> that's<00:02:36.350> kind<00:02:36.680> of

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
her as genderqueer but that's kind of

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.980 
her as genderqueer but that's kind of
the<00:02:36.890> problem<00:02:37.160> it's<00:02:37.700> so<00:02:37.970> ambiguous<00:02:38.390> that<00:02:38.900> the

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
the problem it's so ambiguous that the

their own conclusions

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.990 
their own conclusions
you<00:02:42.080> could<00:02:42.350> chalk<00:02:42.650> this<00:02:42.890> up<00:02:42.950> to<00:02:43.160> Japan<00:02:43.730> having

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
you could chalk this up to Japan having

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.520 
you could chalk this up to Japan having
a<00:02:44.180> different<00:02:44.569> view<00:02:44.630> of<00:02:44.840> gender<00:02:45.319> and<00:02:45.440> sexuality

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
a different view of gender and sexuality

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.070 
a different view of gender and sexuality
that's<00:02:46.459> less<00:02:46.700> focused<00:02:47.090> on<00:02:47.180> assigning<00:02:47.660> labels

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
that's less focused on assigning labels

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.170 
that's less focused on assigning labels
but<00:02:48.500> I've<00:02:48.590> also<00:02:48.800> heard<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.310> exact<00:02:49.670> opposite

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
but I've also heard the exact opposite

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.510 
but I've also heard the exact opposite
that<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.690> Japanese<00:02:51.200> developer<00:02:51.770> was<00:02:51.950> actually

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
that the Japanese developer was actually

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.640 
that the Japanese developer was actually
really<00:02:52.790> specific<00:02:53.420> about<00:02:53.510> kanji<00:02:54.050> being<00:02:54.350> gay

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
really specific about kanji being gay

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.770 
really specific about kanji being gay
and<00:02:54.920> that<00:02:55.310> it's<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:55.580> English<00:02:55.790> localization

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
and that it's the English localization

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.720 
and that it's the English localization
that<00:02:56.810> made<00:02:57.110> it<00:02:57.230> more<00:02:57.380> ambiguous<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.280> could

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
that made it more ambiguous you could

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.400 
that made it more ambiguous you could
also<00:02:58.910> make<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.390> argument<00:02:59.840> that<00:02:59.900> this<00:03:00.170> is<00:03:00.230> a

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
also make the argument that this is a

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.680 
also make the argument that this is a
game<00:03:00.590> about<00:03:00.650> high<00:03:01.130> schoolers<00:03:01.610> and<00:03:01.910> this<00:03:02.510> is<00:03:02.660> a

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
game about high schoolers and this is a

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.540 
game about high schoolers and this is a
time<00:03:02.959> when<00:03:03.140> plenty<00:03:03.530> of<00:03:03.650> teens<00:03:03.890> are<00:03:04.130> still

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
time when plenty of teens are still

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.790 
time when plenty of teens are still
figuring<00:03:05.000> themselves<00:03:05.269> out<00:03:05.720> and<00:03:06.050> haven't

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
figuring themselves out and haven't

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.009 
figuring themselves out and haven't
quite<00:03:07.070> left<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.610> questioning<00:03:08.090> stage<00:03:08.300> yet<00:03:08.630> but

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
quite left the questioning stage yet but

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.780 
quite left the questioning stage yet but
it<00:03:09.140> just<00:03:09.350> seems<00:03:09.800> weird<00:03:10.190> that<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.489> writers

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
it just seems weird that the writers

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.880 
it just seems weird that the writers
would<00:03:11.000> treat<00:03:11.300> these<00:03:11.569> issues<00:03:12.050> with<00:03:12.290> such<00:03:12.530> kid

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
would treat these issues with such kid

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.820 
would treat these issues with such kid
gloves<00:03:13.220> in<00:03:13.550> a<00:03:13.670> story<00:03:13.970> that's<00:03:14.060> otherwise

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
gloves in a story that's otherwise

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.110 
gloves in a story that's otherwise
really<00:03:15.830> good<00:03:16.040> about<00:03:16.220> wrapping<00:03:16.610> up<00:03:16.730> every

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
really good about wrapping up every

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.420 
really good about wrapping up every
single<00:03:17.360> loose<00:03:17.690> end<00:03:17.959> what<00:03:18.530> I<00:03:18.560> think<00:03:18.890> is<00:03:19.100> really

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
single loose end what I think is really

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.130 
single loose end what I think is really
interesting<00:03:19.580> though<00:03:20.300> is<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.720> way<00:03:20.840> that<00:03:20.989> the

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
interesting though is the way that the

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.590 
interesting though is the way that the
other<00:03:21.319> characters<00:03:21.980> in<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.190> game<00:03:22.310> react<00:03:23.239> to
