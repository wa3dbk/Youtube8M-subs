to conclude let's find out what we did

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.310 
to conclude let's find out what we did
to<00:07:26.220> a<00:07:26.370> patient<00:07:26.940> well<00:07:27.210> he<00:07:27.720> was<00:07:27.840> started<00:07:28.260> on

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:28.320 
to a patient well he was started on

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.260 
to a patient well he was started on
neomycin<00:07:28.800> without<00:07:29.370> to<00:07:29.520> be<00:07:29.610> expected<00:07:30.150> he

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:30.270 
neomycin without to be expected he

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.570 
neomycin without to be expected he
developed<00:07:30.690> into<00:07:31.110> toxicity<00:07:31.800> after<00:07:32.190> around<00:07:32.460> a

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:32.580 
developed into toxicity after around a

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.180 
developed into toxicity after around a
month<00:07:32.790> this<00:07:33.630> was<00:07:33.840> swapped<00:07:34.170> to<00:07:34.320> metronidazole

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:35.190 
month this was swapped to metronidazole

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.850 
month this was swapped to metronidazole
but<00:07:35.400> again<00:07:35.730> he<00:07:36.540> developed<00:07:36.990> significant

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:37.860 
but again he developed significant

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.530 
but again he developed significant
peripheral<00:07:38.310> neuropathy<00:07:38.940> and<00:07:38.970> with<00:07:39.180> his<00:07:39.300> job

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:39.540 
peripheral neuropathy and with his job

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:43.100 
peripheral neuropathy and with his job
being<00:07:39.780> a<00:07:39.990> plumber<00:07:40.620> he<00:07:41.420> this<00:07:42.420> wasn't<00:07:42.720> an<00:07:42.960> option

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:43.110 
being a plumber he this wasn't an option

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.010 
being a plumber he this wasn't an option
in<00:07:43.470> the<00:07:43.560> long<00:07:43.740> term<00:07:44.120> finally<00:07:45.120> he<00:07:45.270> was<00:07:45.390> tried<00:07:45.690> on

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:46.020 
in the long term finally he was tried on

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.350 
in the long term finally he was tried on
reflux<00:07:46.500> amine<00:07:46.830> with<00:07:47.010> good<00:07:47.250> results<00:07:47.760> he's<00:07:48.120> now

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:48.360 
reflux amine with good results he's now

reflux amine with good results he's now
back<00:07:48.660> at<00:07:48.720> work<00:07:48.900> and<00:07:49.320> tiredness<00:07:49.740> is<00:07:50.130> less<00:07:50.430> of<00:07:50.460> an
