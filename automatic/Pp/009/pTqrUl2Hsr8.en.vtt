just<00:04:42.100> a<00:04:42.340> two<00:04:42.490> cycle<00:04:42.700> engine<00:04:43.180> so<00:04:43.450> that's

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
just a two cycle engine so that's

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.490 
just a two cycle engine so that's
telling<00:04:44.440> me<00:04:44.470> that<00:04:45.240> it's<00:04:46.240> the<00:04:46.690> carburetor<00:04:47.230> is

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
in there and without removing the whole

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.740 
in there and without removing the whole
cover<00:04:54.640> and<00:04:54.880> stuff<00:04:55.060> like<00:04:55.180> that<00:04:55.390> there's<00:04:55.600> really

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
cover and stuff like that there's really

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.680 
cover and stuff like that there's really
no<00:04:55.960> way<00:04:56.110> to<00:04:56.140> access<00:04:56.410> that<00:04:56.740> car<00:04:57.010> I<00:04:57.040> mean<00:04:57.310> and<00:04:57.700> the

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
no way to access that car I mean and the

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.060 
no way to access that car I mean and the
carburetor<00:04:59.170> doesn't<00:04:59.440> come<00:04:59.530> off<00:04:59.650> there<00:04:59.860> very

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
carburetor doesn't come off there very

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.410 
carburetor doesn't come off there very
easily<00:05:00.310> it's<00:05:00.580> some<00:05:00.730> kind<00:05:00.910> of<00:05:00.940> an<00:05:01.090> allen<00:05:01.390> wrench

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
easily it's some kind of an allen wrench

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.010 
easily it's some kind of an allen wrench
but<00:05:02.670> one<00:05:03.670> side<00:05:03.880> comes<00:05:04.120> off<00:05:04.300> okay<00:05:04.690> the<00:05:04.870> other

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
but one side comes off okay the other

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.370 
but one side comes off okay the other
side<00:05:05.260> not<00:05:05.440> so<00:05:05.470> much<00:05:05.830> so<00:05:06.900> I'm<00:05:07.900> thinking<00:05:08.260> this

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380
