week fermented in a glass carboy for a
week<00:00:30.590> and<00:00:30.830> then<00:00:31.369> its<00:00:31.580> bottle<00:00:32.000> conditioned<00:00:32.449> for

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629 
week and then its bottle conditioned for

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:34.570 
week and then its bottle conditioned for
two<00:00:32.809> weeks<00:00:33.080> that<00:00:33.260> we<00:00:33.379> did<00:00:33.500> at<00:00:33.590> a<00:00:33.739> sample<00:00:34.070> last

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:34.580 
two weeks that we did at a sample last

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.619 
two weeks that we did at a sample last
Saturday<00:00:36.460> and<00:00:37.460> it<00:00:37.580> left<00:00:37.820> a<00:00:37.940> little<00:00:38.090> bit<00:00:38.360> to<00:00:38.510> be

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
Saturday and it left a little bit to be

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.049 
Saturday and it left a little bit to be
desired<00:00:38.660> I<00:00:39.410> guess<00:00:39.650> so<00:00:39.980> we<00:00:40.519> just<00:00:40.640> had<00:00:40.820> to<00:00:40.940> go

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
desired I guess so we just had to go

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:42.189 
desired I guess so we just had to go
ahead<00:00:41.180> and<00:00:41.300> let<00:00:41.449> it<00:00:41.480> sit<00:00:41.750> a<00:00:41.780> little<00:00:42.019> longer

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
ahead and let it sit a little longer

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:44.380 
ahead and let it sit a little longer
we're<00:00:42.559> going<00:00:42.680> to<00:00:42.769> try<00:00:42.949> it<00:00:43.010> again<00:00:43.100> so<00:00:43.670> here<00:00:44.269> we

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
we're going to try it again so here we

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.560 
we're going to try it again so here we
are<00:00:44.420> a<00:00:44.629> week<00:00:44.780> later<00:00:45.550> with<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:46.610> second<00:00:47.210> bottle
