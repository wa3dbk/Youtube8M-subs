now<00:01:16.729> we'll<00:01:17.390> start<00:01:17.630> with<00:01:17.840> simple<00:01:18.259> things<00:01:18.500> like

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
now we'll start with simple things like

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.260 
now we'll start with simple things like
eighth<00:01:18.890> notes<00:01:19.190> moving<00:01:19.940> into<00:01:20.119> more

eighth notes moving into more

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.390 
eighth notes moving into more
complicated<00:01:20.659> patterns<00:01:21.290> like<00:01:21.440> triplets<00:01:21.770> the

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
complicated patterns like triplets the

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.779 
complicated patterns like triplets the
double<00:01:22.729> thumb<00:01:22.970> and<00:01:23.330> polyrhythm<00:01:23.990> I<00:01:24.710> came<00:01:25.640> up

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
double thumb and polyrhythm I came up

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:27.100 
double thumb and polyrhythm I came up
with<00:01:25.970> a<00:01:26.000> fun<00:01:26.240> section<00:01:26.570> called

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
with a fun section called

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.830 
with a fun section called
think<00:01:27.680> like<00:01:28.039> a<00:01:28.070> drummer<00:01:28.460> cuz<00:01:29.330> a<00:01:29.360> lot<00:01:29.630> of<00:01:29.750> these

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
think like a drummer cuz a lot of these

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.770 
think like a drummer cuz a lot of these
bass<00:01:30.229> patterns<00:01:30.770> really<00:01:31.130> come<00:01:31.460> from<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:32.450> funky

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
bass patterns really come from the funky

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.749 
bass patterns really come from the funky
patterns<00:01:33.170> that<00:01:33.259> are<00:01:33.380> dremel<00:01:33.710> reused<00:01:34.070> between

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
patterns that are dremel reused between

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.430 
patterns that are dremel reused between
his<00:01:34.880> kick<00:01:35.119> and<00:01:35.270> a<00:01:35.330> snare<00:01:35.360> drum<00:01:35.660> we<00:01:36.289> have<00:01:36.410> a

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
his kick and a snare drum we have a

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.620 
his kick and a snare drum we have a
whole<00:01:36.680> section<00:01:37.009> on<00:01:37.310> ghost<00:01:37.700> notes<00:01:38.060> which<00:01:38.479> is

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
whole section on ghost notes which is

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.690 
whole section on ghost notes which is
the<00:01:38.750> technique<00:01:39.140> of<00:01:39.320> making<00:01:39.920> a<00:01:40.009> rhythmic<00:01:40.399> sound

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
the technique of making a rhythmic sound

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.730 
the technique of making a rhythmic sound
that<00:01:40.850> is<00:01:40.940> not<00:01:41.149> actually<00:01:41.690> an<00:01:41.810> ode<00:01:42.020> to<00:01:42.050> create

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
that is not actually an ode to create

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.740 
that is not actually an ode to create
more<00:01:42.920> complex<00:01:43.369> rhythm<00:01:43.820> patterns<00:01:44.210> like<00:01:44.420> six

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
more complex rhythm patterns like six

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.320 
more complex rhythm patterns like six
templates<00:01:45.200> and<00:01:45.380> drones<00:01:48.130> do<00:01:49.130> you<00:01:49.460> slap<00:01:50.030> bass

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
templates and drones do you slap bass

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
techniques that we've been working on

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.870 
techniques that we've been working on
and<00:02:16.349> show<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.680> how<00:02:16.920> these<00:02:17.069> techniques<00:02:17.580> can

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
and show you how these techniques can

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.990 
and show you how these techniques can
become<00:02:18.150> music<00:02:18.680> so<00:02:19.680> I'll<00:02:19.769> set<00:02:20.040> up<00:02:20.069> a<00:02:20.220> real<00:02:20.459> basic

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
become music so I'll set up a real basic

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.570 
become music so I'll set up a real basic
groove<00:02:21.380> and<00:02:22.380> leave<00:02:22.650> space<00:02:22.920> for<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.310> play

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
groove and leave space for you to play

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.820 
groove and leave space for you to play
