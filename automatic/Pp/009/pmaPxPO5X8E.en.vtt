 now integrate into the game 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:17.290

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.780
 sometimes this object was to be honored 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.220
 but only added some players need 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.540

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.610
 object is downloaded 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.720
 with train simulator this becomes direct 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.579
 you can download it directly 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.090
 Yes, we'll play each other now 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:50.290
 look at 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.760

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.400
 The standard keyboard is yes and there 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.920
 also directly already near-traffic yes then 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.109
 even down here will be the stop 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.130
 needed dlc is then lend the music 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:07.599
 or you have to stretch if you can 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.639
 an addon does not have then this will be here 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.470
 like here at bigpoint I have 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.459
 not red and then you can 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.790
 the scenario, of course, not synonymous 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.790

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.030
 Yes 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.900
 and that would be it already 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.150
 you go down here then on traffic 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.620
 and then you click on it 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.210
 then he just lives the game or that 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.460
 scenario and you can do that nicely 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:35.950

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:37.240
