hey<00:00:01.829> guys<00:00:02.580> double-wide<00:00:03.149> six<00:00:03.600> here<00:00:03.990> and<00:00:05.029> kind

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
hey guys double-wide six here and kind

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.660 
hey guys double-wide six here and kind
of<00:00:06.060> question<00:00:06.540> for<00:00:06.779> you<00:00:06.960> when<00:00:07.830> does<00:00:08.130> a<00:00:08.160> light

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
of question for you when does a light

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.660 
of question for you when does a light
ball<00:00:09.000> burn<00:00:09.450> out<00:00:11.120> hmm<00:00:12.349> well<00:00:13.349> it<00:00:14.009> actually<00:00:14.460> burns

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
ball burn out hmm well it actually burns

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.660 
ball burn out hmm well it actually burns
out<00:00:15.000> right<00:00:15.780> when<00:00:15.990> you<00:00:16.109> hit<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.410> switch<00:00:16.560> so<00:00:17.430> if

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
out right when you hit the switch so if

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.300 
out right when you hit the switch so if
you<00:00:17.820> ever<00:00:17.910> notice<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.720> light<00:00:19.350> bulb<00:00:19.590> burning<00:00:20.130> out

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
you ever notice a light bulb burning out

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.720 
you ever notice a light bulb burning out
and<00:00:20.670> looking<00:00:21.240> like<00:00:21.449> that<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:22.439> always<00:00:22.890> happens

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
and looking like that it always happens

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.150 
and looking like that it always happens
instantly<00:00:24.660> when<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.050> hit<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.470> switch<00:00:25.769> and

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
instantly when you hit the switch and

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.599 
instantly when you hit the switch and
the<00:00:26.970> reason<00:00:27.480> for<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:28.230> because<00:00:28.560> our<00:00:29.189> light

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
the reason for that is because our light

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.999 
the reason for that is because our light
bulbs<00:00:30.060> at<00:00:30.210> least<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.960> United<00:00:31.679> States

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
bulbs at least in the United States

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.000 
bulbs at least in the United States
they're<00:00:32.640> powered<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.480> 120<00:00:34.290> volts<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.890> AC

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
they're powered on 120 volts of AC

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.760 
they're powered on 120 volts of AC
current<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.110> right<00:00:37.110> when<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.410> hit<00:00:37.590> the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
current and right when you hit the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.220 
current and right when you hit the
switch<00:00:37.980> there's<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.780> fluctuation<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.930> power

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
switch there's a fluctuation of power

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.170 
switch there's a fluctuation of power
our<00:00:41.239> power<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.570> normally<00:00:43.020> regulated<00:00:43.920> but<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
our power is normally regulated but the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.569 
our power is normally regulated but the
instant<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.750> hit<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.079> switch<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.710> takes<00:00:47.219> a

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
instant you hit the switch it takes a

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.180 
instant you hit the switch it takes a
little<00:00:48.000> bit<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.390> time<00:00:48.690> some<00:00:49.190> milliseconds

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
little bit of time some milliseconds

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.270 
little bit of time some milliseconds
just<00:00:50.850> for<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.300> light<00:00:51.750> bulb<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.320> get<00:00:52.559> exactly

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
just for that light bulb to get exactly

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.590 
just for that light bulb to get exactly
120<00:00:54.000> volts<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.289> might<00:00:55.530> get<00:00:55.770> more<00:00:56.430> than<00:00:56.600> 120

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
120 volts and it might get more than 120

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.110 
120 volts and it might get more than 120
volts<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.309> usually<00:00:59.309> that's<00:00:59.609> what's<00:00:59.940> actually

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
volts and usually that's what's actually

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.209 
volts and usually that's what's actually
happening<00:01:00.989> when<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.829> light<00:01:02.160> bulb<00:01:02.489> burns<00:01:03.300> out

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:06.219 

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:08.539 

so<00:01:06.789> recently<00:01:07.299> I<00:01:07.390> just<00:01:07.570> made<00:01:07.899> a<00:01:07.929> video<00:01:08.200> on

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
so recently I just made a video on

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.529 
so recently I just made a video on
rebuilding<00:01:09.549> NiCad<00:01:10.299> batteries<00:01:11.140> and<00:01:12.359> there<00:01:13.359> are

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
rebuilding NiCad batteries and there are

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.330 
rebuilding NiCad batteries and there are
a<00:01:13.600> ton<00:01:13.929> of<00:01:13.960> videos<00:01:14.439> on<00:01:14.679> the<00:01:14.799> internet<00:01:15.039> about

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
a ton of videos on the internet about

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.029 
a ton of videos on the internet about
shocking<00:01:15.819> these<00:01:16.299> things<00:01:16.600> and<00:01:16.929> in<00:01:17.649> the<00:01:17.770> past

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:18.039 
shocking these things and in the past

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:20.609 
shocking these things and in the past
couple<00:01:18.549> maybe<00:01:19.539> about<00:01:19.750> a<00:01:19.810> year<00:01:19.869> and<00:01:20.170> a<00:01:20.229> half<00:01:20.439> ago

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
couple maybe about a year and a half ago

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.099 
couple maybe about a year and a half ago
I<00:01:20.950> tried<00:01:21.189> to<00:01:21.340> shock<00:01:21.549> some<00:01:21.909> batteries<00:01:22.450> and<00:01:22.750> I

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:23.109 
I tried to shock some batteries and I

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:26.099 
I tried to shock some batteries and I
was<00:01:23.259> relatively<00:01:23.799> successful<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:25.659> can<00:01:25.840> tie<00:01:26.079> a

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:26.109 
was relatively successful you can tie a

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:29.130 
was relatively successful you can tie a
couple<00:01:26.500> of<00:01:26.799> these<00:01:27.009> 18<00:01:27.459> volts<00:01:28.000> in<00:01:28.179> series<00:01:28.780> and

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
couple of these 18 volts in series and

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.069 
couple of these 18 volts in series and
take<00:01:29.679> the<00:01:30.009> two<00:01:30.159> leads<00:01:30.459> off<00:01:30.909> those<00:01:31.240> and<00:01:31.689> shock

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
take the two leads off those and shock

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:37.260 
take the two leads off those and shock
another<00:01:32.500> battery<00:01:33.099> with<00:01:33.929> 36<00:01:34.929> volts<00:01:35.500> so<00:01:36.270> that'll

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
another battery with 36 volts so that'll

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.479 
another battery with 36 volts so that'll
work<00:01:37.299> and<00:01:37.810> basically<00:01:38.469> what<00:01:38.920> you're<00:01:39.009> doing<00:01:39.069> is

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:39.489 
work and basically what you're doing is

00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:42.020 
work and basically what you're doing is
these<00:01:39.700> batteries<00:01:40.209> over<00:01:40.390> time<00:01:40.689> develop<00:01:41.319> like

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
these batteries over time develop like

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.429 
these batteries over time develop like
whiskers<00:01:43.030> or<00:01:43.360> something<00:01:43.719> to<00:01:43.840> call<00:01:44.049> it<00:01:44.200> between

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
whiskers or something to call it between

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.800 
whiskers or something to call it between
the<00:01:44.649> plates<00:01:44.979> and<00:01:45.369> they<00:01:46.119> don't<00:01:46.329> charge

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
the plates and they don't charge

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.380 
the plates and they don't charge
properly<00:01:47.590> they<00:01:47.739> don't<00:01:47.920> discharge<00:01:48.610> properly

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
properly they don't discharge properly

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.080 
properly they don't discharge properly
they<00:01:49.840> start<00:01:50.140> to<00:01:50.229> get<00:01:50.349> a<00:01:50.409> weird<00:01:50.739> memory<00:01:51.099> and<00:01:51.610> by

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
they start to get a weird memory and by

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.839 
they start to get a weird memory and by
shocking<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.810> battery<00:01:53.319> and<00:01:53.709> this<00:01:54.280> is<00:01:54.520> for

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:54.849 
shocking the battery and this is for

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:57.089 
shocking the battery and this is for
nickel-cadmium<00:01:55.530> batteries<00:01:56.530> it<00:01:56.739> won't<00:01:56.950> work

00:01:57.089 --> 00:01:57.099 
nickel-cadmium batteries it won't work

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:59.369 
nickel-cadmium batteries it won't work
for<00:01:57.159> lithium-ion<00:01:58.030> in<00:01:58.479> fact<00:01:58.750> those<00:01:58.959> will<00:01:59.140> even

00:01:59.369 --> 00:01:59.379 
for lithium-ion in fact those will even

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:02.910 
for lithium-ion in fact those will even
blow<00:01:59.709> up<00:01:59.950> but<00:02:00.670> you<00:02:01.209> can<00:02:01.390> shock<00:02:01.689> them<00:02:02.020> and<00:02:02.289> you

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
blow up but you can shock them and you

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.800 
blow up but you can shock them and you
can<00:02:03.099> get<00:02:03.310> them<00:02:03.489> to<00:02:03.759> charge<00:02:04.090> properly<00:02:04.989> and<00:02:05.549> I

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
can get them to charge properly and I

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.259 
can get them to charge properly and I
did<00:02:07.810> that<00:02:07.989> and<00:02:08.079> I<00:02:08.170> was<00:02:08.289> very<00:02:08.379> successful<00:02:09.369> and<00:02:09.579> I

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
did that and I was very successful and I

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.559 
did that and I was very successful and I
did<00:02:10.479> come<00:02:10.720> across<00:02:11.109> a<00:02:11.139> video<00:02:11.980> on<00:02:12.430> YouTube<00:02:13.090> that

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
did come across a video on YouTube that

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.890 
did come across a video on YouTube that
a<00:02:14.200> young<00:02:15.069> sounded<00:02:15.849> like<00:02:15.940> a<00:02:16.000> young<00:02:16.269> kid<00:02:16.599> made

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
a young sounded like a young kid made

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.520 
a young sounded like a young kid made
and<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:18.400> works<00:02:18.639> off<00:02:18.910> that<00:02:19.120> same<00:02:19.389> principle<00:02:19.870> as

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
and it works off that same principle as

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.879 
and it works off that same principle as
that<00:02:20.590> light<00:02:21.370> bulb<00:02:21.730> and<00:02:22.380> I'm<00:02:23.380> going<00:02:23.560> to<00:02:23.650> show

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:23.889 
that light bulb and I'm going to show

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:27.629 
that light bulb and I'm going to show
you<00:02:24.000> what<00:02:25.000> he<00:02:25.329> did<00:02:25.599> and<00:02:26.250> we're<00:02:27.250> going<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:27.430> try

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:27.639 
you what he did and we're going to try

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:30.360 
you what he did and we're going to try
it<00:02:27.700> out<00:02:27.940> with<00:02:27.970> this<00:02:28.239> battery<00:02:28.859> all<00:02:29.859> right<00:02:30.040> so

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
it out with this battery all right so

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.580 
it out with this battery all right so
this<00:02:31.060> battery<00:02:31.690> is<00:02:31.840> 18<00:02:32.290> volt<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:33.299> if<00:02:34.299> we<00:02:35.260> put

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
this battery is 18 volt and if we put

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.059 
this battery is 18 volt and if we put
our<00:02:36.430> leads<00:02:36.880> on<00:02:37.239> it<00:02:37.450> you<00:02:37.959> can<00:02:38.109> see<00:02:38.349> it's<00:02:38.799> got

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
our leads on it you can see it's got

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.789 
our leads on it you can see it's got
about<00:02:39.340> seven<00:02:39.819> point<00:02:40.000> two<00:02:40.239> seven<00:02:40.540> volts<00:02:41.319> all

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
about seven point two seven volts all

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.979 
about seven point two seven volts all
right<00:02:41.980> it's<00:02:42.220> been<00:02:42.459> sitting<00:02:43.060> kind<00:02:43.450> in<00:02:43.660> a<00:02:43.750> cold

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
right it's been sitting kind in a cold

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.710 
right it's been sitting kind in a cold
garage<00:02:44.349> but<00:02:45.340> I<00:02:45.669> can<00:02:46.150> tell<00:02:46.299> you<00:02:46.419> for<00:02:46.630> a<00:02:46.660> fact

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
garage but I can tell you for a fact

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.860 
garage but I can tell you for a fact
that<00:02:47.459> it<00:02:48.459> doesn't<00:02:48.910> necessarily<00:02:49.569> take<00:02:49.840> a

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
that it doesn't necessarily take a

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.559 
that it doesn't necessarily take a
charge<00:02:50.230> it'll<00:02:50.680> it'll<00:02:51.400> charge<00:02:52.000> a<00:02:52.180> little<00:02:52.450> bit

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
charge it'll it'll charge a little bit

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.199 
charge it'll it'll charge a little bit
but<00:02:52.989> it<00:02:53.079> won't<00:02:53.530> really<00:02:53.590> hold<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.220> charge<00:02:54.489> it's

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
but it won't really hold the charge it's

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.210 
but it won't really hold the charge it's
kind<00:02:55.660> of<00:02:55.840> sort<00:02:56.530> of<00:02:56.680> worn<00:02:56.980> out<00:02:57.310> okay<00:02:58.209> so<00:02:59.220> here

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
kind of sort of worn out okay so here

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.020 
kind of sort of worn out okay so here
here's<00:03:00.669> the<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:02.620> method<00:03:03.129> that<00:03:03.370> this<00:03:03.579> kid<00:03:03.819> was

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
here's the the method that this kid was

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.849 
here's the the method that this kid was
talking<00:03:04.540> about<00:03:04.840> and<00:03:05.079> this<00:03:05.200> this<00:03:05.590> one's

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
talking about and this this one's

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:09.059 
talking about and this this one's
actually<00:03:06.190> a<00:03:06.519> royal<00:03:07.239> be<00:03:07.510> so<00:03:08.230> I'm<00:03:08.650> just<00:03:08.829> going<00:03:09.040> to

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
actually a royal be so I'm just going to

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.400 
actually a royal be so I'm just going to
stick<00:03:09.609> it<00:03:09.730> in<00:03:09.849> there<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.359> you<00:03:10.690> can<00:03:10.840> see<00:03:11.049> on<00:03:11.260> the

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
stick it in there and you can see on the

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.969 
stick it in there and you can see on the
charger<00:03:12.069> you're<00:03:12.970> getting<00:03:13.389> the<00:03:13.629> the<00:03:14.320> code<00:03:14.620> here

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:14.979 
charger you're getting the the code here

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:19.290 
charger you're getting the the code here
these<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.519> the<00:03:17.220> yellow<00:03:18.220> and<00:03:18.699> the

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
these the the yellow and the

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.950 
these the the yellow and the
light<00:03:19.600> which<00:03:19.900> means<00:03:20.140> it's<00:03:20.380> not<00:03:20.620> charging<00:03:21.960> okay

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960 
light which means it's not charging okay

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.630 
light which means it's not charging okay
so<00:03:23.020> here's<00:03:23.470> a<00:03:23.530> battery<00:03:23.830> we're<00:03:24.280> going<00:03:24.400> to<00:03:24.460> take

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
so here's a battery we're going to take

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.180 
so here's a battery we're going to take
a<00:03:24.670> look<00:03:24.910> at<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.210> voltage<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:26.830> we're<00:03:26.980> showing

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
a look at the voltage and we're showing

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.450 
a look at the voltage and we're showing
about<00:03:27.430> six<00:03:28.210> point<00:03:28.630> two<00:03:29.100> six<00:03:30.100> point<00:03:30.400> three

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 
about six point two six point three

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.560 
about six point two six point three
volts<00:03:31.260> all<00:03:32.260> right<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:33.220> here<00:03:33.580> here's<00:03:34.030> what<00:03:34.390> you

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
volts all right and here here's what you

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.030 
volts all right and here here's what you
need<00:03:34.750> to<00:03:35.350> do<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:36.520> take<00:03:36.790> this<00:03:36.970> battery<00:03:37.270> and<00:03:38.040> the

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
need to do you take this battery and the

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.650 
need to do you take this battery and the
reason<00:03:39.370> I'm<00:03:39.460> showing<00:03:39.670> you<00:03:39.880> this<00:03:40.030> is<00:03:40.450> because

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
reason I'm showing you this is because

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.880 
reason I'm showing you this is because
it's<00:03:41.050> like<00:03:41.230> the<00:03:41.440> easiest<00:03:42.010> way<00:03:42.400> to<00:03:43.390> possibly

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
it's like the easiest way to possibly

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.370 
it's like the easiest way to possibly
try<00:03:44.890> and<00:03:45.100> jumpstart<00:03:45.790> a<00:03:45.910> battery<00:03:46.360> you<00:03:46.840> put<00:03:47.050> in<00:03:47.200> a

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
try and jumpstart a battery you put in a

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.230 
try and jumpstart a battery you put in a
charger<00:03:48.040> okay<00:03:48.700> just<00:03:49.060> like<00:03:49.270> that<00:03:49.540> and<00:03:51.240> what

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
charger okay just like that and what

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.170 
charger okay just like that and what
we're<00:03:52.360> going<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.600> do<00:03:52.840> is<00:03:53.370> we're<00:03:54.370> going<00:03:54.490> to<00:03:54.550> plug

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
we're going to do is we're going to plug

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.730 
we're going to do is we're going to plug
in<00:03:55.570> and<00:03:55.960> unplug<00:03:56.800> the<00:03:57.220> charger<00:03:57.960> like<00:03:58.960> this<00:03:59.320> all

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.740 
in and unplug the charger like this all

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.380 
in and unplug the charger like this all
right<00:03:59.950> and<00:04:00.370> I'm<00:04:00.460> just<00:04:00.670> doing<00:04:00.820> this<00:04:01.060> with<00:04:01.270> an

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
right and I'm just doing this with an

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.170 
right and I'm just doing this with an
extension<00:04:01.780> cord<00:04:02.230> so<00:04:02.560> that<00:04:02.740> you<00:04:03.010> can<00:04:03.220> see<00:04:03.520> so

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
extension cord so that you can see so

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.450 
extension cord so that you can see so
you<00:04:04.900> just<00:04:05.050> want<00:04:05.290> to<00:04:05.380> put<00:04:05.680> it<00:04:05.800> in<00:04:05.950> there<00:04:06.190> and

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:06.460 
you just want to put it in there and

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.760 
you just want to put it in there and
till<00:04:06.700> those<00:04:06.850> lights<00:04:07.240> flicker<00:04:08.080> a<00:04:08.230> little<00:04:08.590> bit

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
till those lights flicker a little bit

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.360 
till those lights flicker a little bit
and<00:04:09.070> you<00:04:09.910> can<00:04:10.090> see<00:04:10.590> see<00:04:11.590> how<00:04:11.680> they're<00:04:11.830> all<00:04:11.890> kind

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
and you can see see how they're all kind

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.520 
and you can see see how they're all kind
of<00:04:12.460> flickering<00:04:12.940> and<00:04:13.210> what<00:04:14.170> you're<00:04:14.320> actually

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
of flickering and what you're actually

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.479 
of flickering and what you're actually
doing<00:04:15.010> is<00:04:15.720> you're<00:04:16.720> you're<00:04:17.380> sending<00:04:18.040> in<00:04:18.250> this

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
doing is you're you're sending in this

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.789 
doing is you're you're sending in this
case<00:04:18.820> I<00:04:19.090> think<00:04:19.209> this<00:04:19.570> charger<00:04:20.109> sends<00:04:20.470> about

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
case I think this charger sends about

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.659 
case I think this charger sends about
thirty<00:04:21.340> six<00:04:21.730> volts<00:04:22.270> to<00:04:23.020> the<00:04:23.050> battery<00:04:23.590> when<00:04:24.520> it

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
thirty six volts to the battery when it

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.490 
thirty six volts to the battery when it
charges<00:04:24.880> I'm<00:04:25.390> not<00:04:25.540> sure<00:04:25.720> we<00:04:25.870> can<00:04:25.990> double<00:04:26.290> check

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
charges I'm not sure we can double check

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.310 
charges I'm not sure we can double check
it<00:04:26.680> but<00:04:27.310> anyhow<00:04:27.850> if<00:04:28.060> it<00:04:28.210> sends<00:04:28.630> thirty<00:04:28.960> volts

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
it but anyhow if it sends thirty volts

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.030 
it but anyhow if it sends thirty volts
with<00:04:30.040> this<00:04:30.250> quick<00:04:30.610> load<00:04:31.000> of<00:04:31.360> power<00:04:31.710> after<00:04:32.710> it

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
with this quick load of power after it

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.530 
with this quick load of power after it
comes<00:04:33.160> through<00:04:33.400> that<00:04:33.550> transformer<00:04:34.300> in<00:04:34.450> the

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
comes through that transformer in the

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.780 
comes through that transformer in the
charger<00:04:35.140> instead<00:04:35.950> of<00:04:36.070> sending<00:04:36.250> like<00:04:36.520> thirty

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
charger instead of sending like thirty

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.700 
charger instead of sending like thirty
six<00:04:37.120> volts<00:04:37.480> might<00:04:37.720> be<00:04:37.870> sending<00:04:38.350> a<00:04:38.470> higher

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
six volts might be sending a higher

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.900 
six volts might be sending a higher
voltage<00:04:39.040> like<00:04:39.669> thirty<00:04:40.090> six<00:04:40.830> like<00:04:41.830> forty<00:04:42.370> okay

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
voltage like thirty six like forty okay

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.110 
voltage like thirty six like forty okay
or<00:04:43.570> a<00:04:43.600> little<00:04:43.930> more<00:04:43.960> me<00:04:44.320> forty<00:04:44.740> two<00:04:44.980> who<00:04:45.910> knows

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
or a little more me forty two who knows

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.110 
or a little more me forty two who knows
so<00:04:46.720> anyhow<00:04:47.080> after<00:04:47.350> you<00:04:47.590> do<00:04:47.770> that<00:04:47.800> about<00:04:48.520> I

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
so anyhow after you do that about I

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.780 
so anyhow after you do that about I
don't<00:04:49.480> know<00:04:49.750> five<00:04:50.050> six<00:04:50.380> ten<00:04:50.680> times<00:04:50.980> you<00:04:51.610> can

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
don't know five six ten times you can

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.050 
don't know five six ten times you can
plug<00:04:52.090> this<00:04:52.330> thing<00:04:52.390> in<00:04:52.900> and<00:04:53.730> you'll<00:04:54.730> notice

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
plug this thing in and you'll notice

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.260 
plug this thing in and you'll notice
that<00:04:55.470> from<00:04:56.470> those<00:04:56.910> shocks<00:04:57.990> the<00:04:58.990> battery

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
that from those shocks the battery

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.150 
that from those shocks the battery
sorry<00:05:01.270> about<00:05:01.450> that<00:05:01.570> the<00:05:01.990> battery<00:05:02.470> actually

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
sorry about that the battery actually

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.909 
sorry about that the battery actually
resets<00:05:04.140> okay<00:05:05.140> and<00:05:06.360> it's<00:05:07.360> now<00:05:07.810> on<00:05:08.080> fast<00:05:08.410> charge

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
resets okay and it's now on fast charge

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.810 
resets okay and it's now on fast charge
and<00:05:09.250> it<00:05:09.340> doesn't<00:05:09.610> have<00:05:09.730> that<00:05:09.970> code<00:05:10.360> so<00:05:11.820> that's

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
and it doesn't have that code so that's

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.260 
and it doesn't have that code so that's
a<00:05:13.150> real<00:05:13.360> quick<00:05:13.390> way<00:05:14.050> to<00:05:14.560> send<00:05:14.800> a<00:05:14.919> pretty<00:05:15.270> good

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
a real quick way to send a pretty good

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.500 
a real quick way to send a pretty good
sized<00:05:16.540> jolt<00:05:17.080> to<00:05:17.350> your<00:05:17.380> battery<00:05:17.950> now<00:05:18.510> let's

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
sized jolt to your battery now let's

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.840 
sized jolt to your battery now let's
check<00:05:19.870> this<00:05:20.169> instantly<00:05:21.130> we'll<00:05:21.460> pull<00:05:21.700> this

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
check this instantly we'll pull this

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.150 
check this instantly we'll pull this
thing<00:05:22.150> off<00:05:22.330> the<00:05:22.570> charger<00:05:23.140> okay<00:05:23.860> and<00:05:24.730> we'll<00:05:25.690> go

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
thing off the charger okay and we'll go

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.330 
thing off the charger okay and we'll go
right<00:05:27.160> here

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:37.630 

and<00:05:31.540> you<00:05:32.540> can<00:05:32.690> see<00:05:32.990> it's<00:05:33.200> showing<00:05:34.270> 21.0<00:05:36.640> volts

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
and you can see it's showing 21.0 volts

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.630 
and you can see it's showing 21.0 volts
okay<00:05:38.480> and<00:05:38.810> it's<00:05:39.200> it's<00:05:39.950> going<00:05:40.220> to<00:05:40.280> drop<00:05:40.610> very

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
okay and it's it's going to drop very

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.640 
okay and it's it's going to drop very
fast<00:05:41.300> because<00:05:41.510> it's<00:05:41.720> not<00:05:41.870> really<00:05:42.110> charged

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
fast because it's not really charged

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.150 
fast because it's not really charged
it's<00:05:43.040> just<00:05:44.260> you<00:05:45.260> know<00:05:45.350> it<00:05:45.500> basically<00:05:45.680> got

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
it's just you know it basically got

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.040 
it's just you know it basically got
popped<00:05:46.460> with<00:05:46.730> a<00:05:46.790> little<00:05:47.090> bit<00:05:47.210> of<00:05:47.300> power<00:05:47.510> so

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
popped with a little bit of power so

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.630 
popped with a little bit of power so
it's<00:05:48.290> shown<00:05:48.560> in<00:05:48.710> the<00:05:48.950> battery<00:05:49.400> but<00:05:49.550> the

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
it's shown in the battery but the

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.460 
it's shown in the battery but the
batteries<00:05:50.090> aren't<00:05:50.360> actually<00:05:50.690> charged<00:05:51.200> all

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
batteries aren't actually charged all

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.800 
batteries aren't actually charged all
the<00:05:51.560> way<00:05:51.710> up<00:05:51.860> so<00:05:52.640> what<00:05:52.850> we<00:05:52.970> want<00:05:53.150> to<00:05:53.270> do<00:05:53.390> is<00:05:53.570> take

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
the way up so what we want to do is take

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.100 
the way up so what we want to do is take
this<00:05:53.990> battery<00:05:54.560> and<00:05:54.890> now<00:05:55.490> that<00:05:55.820> you<00:05:56.810> know<00:05:56.840> we

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
this battery and now that you know we

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.290 
this battery and now that you know we
removed<00:05:57.500> the<00:05:57.800> memory<00:05:58.280> and<00:05:58.640> we<00:05:58.730> cleaned<00:05:59.060> up<00:05:59.240> the

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
removed the memory and we cleaned up the

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.660 
removed the memory and we cleaned up the
little<00:05:59.600> whiskers<00:06:00.140> now<00:06:00.860> you<00:06:00.920> want<00:06:01.310> to<00:06:01.370> give<00:06:01.550> it

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:01.670 
little whiskers now you want to give it

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.660 
little whiskers now you want to give it
a<00:06:01.730> charge<00:06:02.030> and<00:06:02.620> sure<00:06:03.620> enough<00:06:03.650> you're<00:06:04.430> going<00:06:04.580> to

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:04.670 
a charge and sure enough you're going to

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.970 
a charge and sure enough you're going to
find<00:06:04.910> out<00:06:05.150> that<00:06:05.570> this<00:06:06.170> is<00:06:06.230> a<00:06:06.470> really

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:06.980 
find out that this is a really

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.610 
find out that this is a really
successful<00:06:07.220> method<00:06:08.180> it's<00:06:08.420> really<00:06:08.780> easy<00:06:09.110> to<00:06:09.290> do

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
successful method it's really easy to do

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.830 
successful method it's really easy to do
so<00:06:10.310> if<00:06:10.430> you<00:06:10.490> have<00:06:10.730> some<00:06:11.030> older<00:06:11.330> NiCad

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
so if you have some older NiCad

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.950 
so if you have some older NiCad
batteries<00:06:12.790> it's<00:06:13.790> worth<00:06:14.060> giving<00:06:14.360> it<00:06:14.570> a<00:06:14.720> shot

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
batteries it's worth giving it a shot

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.380 
batteries it's worth giving it a shot
now<00:06:15.590> I<00:06:15.620> don't<00:06:15.800> know<00:06:16.010> if<00:06:16.040> every<00:06:16.490> single<00:06:16.700> charger

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
now I don't know if every single charger

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.130 
now I don't know if every single charger
works<00:06:17.600> exactly<00:06:18.170> the<00:06:18.740> same<00:06:18.920> as<00:06:19.460> this<00:06:19.910> one<00:06:20.140> but

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:21.140 
works exactly the same as this one but

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.460 
works exactly the same as this one but
for<00:06:21.760> the<00:06:22.760> royal<00:06:23.300> be<00:06:23.480> one<00:06:23.690> it<00:06:23.960> works<00:06:24.140> really

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
for the royal be one it works really

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.850 
for the royal be one it works really
well<00:06:24.620> and<00:06:24.980> at<00:06:25.520> work<00:06:25.730> we<00:06:25.970> have<00:06:26.150> some<00:06:26.870> Hitachi's

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
well and at work we have some Hitachi's

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.010 
well and at work we have some Hitachi's
and<00:06:28.220> I<00:06:28.310> did<00:06:28.520> it<00:06:28.640> with<00:06:28.760> them<00:06:29.000> and<00:06:29.270> it<00:06:29.540> seemed<00:06:29.810> to

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
and I did it with them and it seemed to

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.870 
and I did it with them and it seemed to
really<00:06:30.320> work<00:06:30.730> ok<00:06:31.730> so<00:06:33.430> here's<00:06:34.430> what<00:06:34.580> I<00:06:34.670> want<00:06:34.790> to

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 
really work ok so here's what I want to

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.880 
really work ok so here's what I want to
check<00:06:35.210> I'm<00:06:35.930> going<00:06:36.110> to<00:06:36.170> just<00:06:36.380> check<00:06:36.650> the

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:36.890 
check I'm going to just check the

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:41.140 
check I'm going to just check the
voltage<00:06:37.930> that<00:06:38.930> this<00:06:39.140> charger<00:06:39.800> has<00:06:40.150> because

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 
voltage that this charger has because

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.120 
voltage that this charger has because
it's<00:06:41.330> actually<00:06:41.510> trying<00:06:41.930> all<00:06:42.110> right<00:06:42.140> so<00:06:42.500> it's

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.130 
it's actually trying all right so it's

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.430 
it's actually trying all right so it's
about<00:06:43.460> 30<00:06:44.000> volts<00:06:44.660> I<00:06:44.780> don't<00:06:44.930> know<00:06:45.020> if<00:06:45.140> you<00:06:45.260> can

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 
about 30 volts I don't know if you can

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.360 
about 30 volts I don't know if you can
see<00:06:46.390> it's<00:06:47.390> giving<00:06:47.900> 30<00:06:48.260> volts<00:06:48.740> I<00:06:48.800> got<00:06:48.950> my<00:06:49.100> leads

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370 
see it's giving 30 volts I got my leads

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:55.360 
see it's giving 30 volts I got my leads
on<00:06:49.670> the<00:06:49.820> wrong<00:06:50.000> way<00:06:50.710> so<00:06:51.710> 30<00:06:52.160> DC<00:06:52.820> volts<00:06:54.370> so

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:55.370 
on the wrong way so 30 DC volts so

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.480 
on the wrong way so 30 DC volts so
that's<00:06:55.580> what<00:06:55.790> it<00:06:55.910> takes<00:06:56.090> to<00:06:56.360> charge<00:06:57.200> and<00:06:57.740> that

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:58.490 
that's what it takes to charge and that
