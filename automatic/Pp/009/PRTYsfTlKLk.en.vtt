harvests off of them but lately there's

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.500 
harvests off of them but lately there's
been<00:04:11.620> as<00:04:12.040> you<00:04:12.190> probably<00:04:12.489> see<00:04:12.880> the<00:04:12.910> bugs<00:04:13.209> flying

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
been as you probably see the bugs flying

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.180 
been as you probably see the bugs flying
off<00:04:13.810> there's<00:04:14.110> been<00:04:14.319> some<00:04:14.709> kind<00:04:14.920> of<00:04:14.980> bugs

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
off there's been some kind of bugs

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.680 
off there's been some kind of bugs
eating<00:04:15.910> at<00:04:16.239> them<00:04:16.919> so<00:04:17.919> that<00:04:18.340> I<00:04:18.970> just<00:04:19.389> need<00:04:19.660> to

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
eating at them so that I just need to

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.340 
eating at them so that I just need to
cut<00:04:19.930> it<00:04:20.019> all<00:04:20.139> back<00:04:20.380> and<00:04:21.000> like<00:04:22.000> I<00:04:22.150> said<00:04:22.350> separate

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
cut it all back and like I said separate

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.720 
cut it all back and like I said separate
it<00:04:23.470> out<00:04:23.590> and<00:04:23.889> give<00:04:24.190> my<00:04:24.310> friend<00:04:24.610> some<00:04:24.910> and<00:04:26.730> and

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
it out and give my friend some and and

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.670 
it out and give my friend some and and
then<00:04:28.000> there's<00:04:28.300> those<00:04:28.570> cucumber<00:04:29.139> plants<00:04:29.500> which

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
then there's those cucumber plants which

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.770 
then there's those cucumber plants which
didn't<00:04:30.250> do<00:04:30.340> anything<00:04:30.580> except<00:04:31.210> forget<00:04:31.660> already

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
didn't do anything except forget already

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.620 
didn't do anything except forget already
looking<00:04:32.470> so<00:04:33.280> I<00:04:33.310> think<00:04:33.550> it's<00:04:33.790> just<00:04:33.880> too<00:04:34.330> hot

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
looking so I think it's just too hot

guess I should let this go I hope this

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.830 
guess I should let this go I hope this
