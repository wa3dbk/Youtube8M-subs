00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:04.860 

okay<00:00:03.100> the<00:00:03.250> aviation<00:00:03.790> college<00:00:04.210> thing<00:00:04.479> this<00:00:04.660> is

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:04.870 
okay the aviation college thing this is

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.559 
okay the aviation college thing this is
all<00:00:04.990> about<00:00:05.170> the<00:00:05.529> guys<00:00:06.160> that<00:00:06.759> ask<00:00:07.120> me<00:00:07.330> what's

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:07.569 
all about the guys that ask me what's

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:09.570 
all about the guys that ask me what's
the<00:00:07.689> cheapest<00:00:08.080> way<00:00:08.170> to<00:00:08.200> go<00:00:08.440> and<00:00:08.740> what<00:00:08.950> way<00:00:09.190> do

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:09.580 
the cheapest way to go and what way do

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.200 
the cheapest way to go and what way do
you<00:00:09.639> have<00:00:10.120> to<00:00:10.389> go<00:00:11.309> that<00:00:12.309> the<00:00:12.429> airline's<00:00:12.759> prefer

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.210 
you have to go that the airline's prefer

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.209 
you have to go that the airline's prefer
and<00:00:13.570> the<00:00:13.660> answer<00:00:14.080> is<00:00:14.259> they<00:00:14.440> really<00:00:14.710> don't<00:00:14.830> care

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219 
and the answer is they really don't care

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.260 
and the answer is they really don't care
what<00:00:15.969> your<00:00:16.119> degrees<00:00:16.540> in<00:00:17.580> or<00:00:18.580> how<00:00:18.910> you<00:00:18.970> get<00:00:19.180> the

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
what your degrees in or how you get the

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.760 
what your degrees in or how you get the
four<00:00:19.510> years<00:00:19.779> so<00:00:20.109> what<00:00:20.260> I'm<00:00:20.380> talking<00:00:20.710> about

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
four years so what I'm talking about

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.349 
four years so what I'm talking about
with<00:00:20.980> how<00:00:21.189> you<00:00:21.250> get<00:00:21.430> the<00:00:21.519> Fourier<00:00:21.789> out<00:00:22.240> with

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:22.359 
with how you get the Fourier out with

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:24.150 
with how you get the Fourier out with
that<00:00:22.480> it<00:00:22.779> doesn't<00:00:22.840> matter<00:00:23.320> you<00:00:23.740> don't<00:00:23.890> have<00:00:24.070> to

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
that it doesn't matter you don't have to

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.000 
that it doesn't matter you don't have to
go<00:00:24.310> to<00:00:24.369> embry-riddle<00:00:25.060> or<00:00:25.570> North<00:00:26.439> Dakota<00:00:26.830> or

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.010 
go to embry-riddle or North Dakota or

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.189 
go to embry-riddle or North Dakota or
you<00:00:27.400> know<00:00:27.490> any<00:00:27.670> of<00:00:27.820> them<00:00:27.970> they<00:00:28.779> gets<00:00:28.960> North

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 
you know any of them they gets North

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.080 
you know any of them they gets North
Dakota<00:00:29.529> they<00:00:29.800> get<00:00:29.949> South<00:00:30.160> Dakota<00:00:30.550> I<00:00:30.760> know<00:00:30.970> it's

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
Dakota they get South Dakota I know it's

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.840 
Dakota they get South Dakota I know it's
a<00:00:31.150> Dakota<00:00:31.590> maybe<00:00:32.590> it<00:00:32.710> was<00:00:32.830> Nebraska<00:00:33.370> anyhow

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
a Dakota maybe it was Nebraska anyhow

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.910 
a Dakota maybe it was Nebraska anyhow
I'm<00:00:34.540> not<00:00:34.690> familiar<00:00:34.839> with<00:00:35.049> the<00:00:35.170> school<00:00:35.379> but<00:00:35.589> you

I'm not familiar with the school but you
know<00:00:36.220> as<00:00:36.280> aviation<00:00:36.549> colleges<00:00:37.210> around<00:00:37.330> the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
know as aviation colleges around the

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.630 
know as aviation colleges around the
u.s.<00:00:37.870> you<00:00:38.379> don't<00:00:38.680> have<00:00:39.040> to<00:00:39.250> go<00:00:39.400> to<00:00:39.460> those

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
u.s. you don't have to go to those

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.719 
u.s. you don't have to go to those
colleges<00:00:40.019> to<00:00:41.019> become<00:00:41.500> an<00:00:41.589> airline<00:00:41.890> guy<00:00:42.159> again

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:42.729 
colleges to become an airline guy again

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:43.829 
colleges to become an airline guy again
like<00:00:42.909> I<00:00:43.030> said<00:00:43.210> if<00:00:43.299> you<00:00:43.360> want<00:00:43.479> to<00:00:43.540> be<00:00:43.600> an<00:00:43.690> airline

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:43.839 
like I said if you want to be an airline

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:45.689 
like I said if you want to be an airline
guy<00:00:44.110> yeah<00:00:44.320> you<00:00:44.379> got<00:00:44.559> to<00:00:44.680> get<00:00:44.890> a<00:00:44.920> four-year<00:00:45.220> but

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
guy yeah you got to get a four-year but

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:48.450 
guy yeah you got to get a four-year but
it<00:00:45.820> doesn't<00:00:46.299> have<00:00:46.690> to<00:00:46.960> be<00:00:47.199> from<00:00:48.190> an<00:00:48.339> aviation

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
it doesn't have to be from an aviation

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.399 
it doesn't have to be from an aviation
college<00:00:49.150> when<00:00:49.540> you<00:00:49.570> go<00:00:49.750> to<00:00:49.809> interview<00:00:50.229> at<00:00:50.320> an

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:50.409 
college when you go to interview at an

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:52.740 
college when you go to interview at an
airline<00:00:50.589> really<00:00:51.489> all<00:00:51.729> that<00:00:51.879> boxes<00:00:52.420> looked<00:00:52.629> out

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
airline really all that boxes looked out

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.880 
airline really all that boxes looked out
they<00:00:52.900> just<00:00:52.930> looked<00:00:53.290> at<00:00:53.379> it<00:00:53.440> and<00:00:53.500> see<00:00:53.650> if<00:00:53.680> it's

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
they just looked at it and see if it's

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.280 
they just looked at it and see if it's
checked<00:00:54.159> off<00:00:54.309> because<00:00:55.000> that's<00:00:55.659> how<00:00:55.989> you<00:00:56.049> get

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
checked off because that's how you get

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.049 
checked off because that's how you get
into<00:00:56.440> the<00:00:56.589> door<00:00:56.799> without<00:00:57.339> being<00:00:57.879> able<00:00:57.970> to

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
into the door without being able to

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.840 
into the door without being able to
check<00:00:58.299> the<00:00:58.420> four-year<00:00:58.780> degree<00:00:59.049> box<00:00:59.729> with<00:01:00.729> any

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
check the four-year degree box with any

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.600 
check the four-year degree box with any
major<00:01:01.059> airline<00:01:01.949> unless<00:01:02.949> you<00:01:03.189> know<00:01:03.339> someone

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
major airline unless you know someone

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.000 
major airline unless you know someone
way<00:01:04.030> way<00:01:04.330> high<00:01:04.570> up<00:01:04.600> and<00:01:05.170> even<00:01:05.590> then<00:01:05.740> it's<00:01:05.890> going

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
way way high up and even then it's going

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.940 
way way high up and even then it's going
to<00:01:06.070> be<00:01:06.220> tough<00:01:06.780> that's<00:01:07.780> really<00:01:08.290> all<00:01:08.470> that<00:01:08.500> does

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
to be tough that's really all that does

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.190 
to be tough that's really all that does
it<00:01:09.220> just<00:01:09.250> makes<00:01:09.880> us<00:01:10.030> your<00:01:10.180> resume<00:01:10.510> actually<00:01:11.110> is

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
it just makes us your resume actually is

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.320 
it just makes us your resume actually is
accepted<00:01:11.710> without<00:01:12.310> checking<00:01:12.760> it<00:01:12.940> for<00:01:12.970> your

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
accepted without checking it for your

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.690 
accepted without checking it for your
you<00:01:13.990> see<00:01:14.140> what's<00:01:14.290> going<00:01:14.350> to<00:01:14.470> happen<00:01:14.560> so<00:01:14.890> do

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
you see what's going to happen so do

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.420 
you see what's going to happen so do
they<00:01:15.850> look<00:01:16.060> at<00:01:16.240> what<00:01:16.390> your<00:01:16.540> degree<00:01:17.170> is<00:01:17.500> yeah<00:01:18.160> I

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
they look at what your degree is yeah I

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.700 
they look at what your degree is yeah I
think<00:01:18.520> to<00:01:18.790> some<00:01:19.000> degree<00:01:19.300> I<00:01:19.900> don't<00:01:20.500> think<00:01:20.650> it

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
think to some degree I don't think it

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.050 
think to some degree I don't think it
puts<00:01:20.890> a<00:01:20.980> whole<00:01:21.010> lot<00:01:21.280> of<00:01:21.400> weight<00:01:21.550> on<00:01:21.730> it<00:01:21.850> unless

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
puts a whole lot of weight on it unless

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.060 
puts a whole lot of weight on it unless
you've<00:01:22.420> got<00:01:22.630> a<00:01:22.660> say<00:01:23.530> a<00:01:23.560> degree<00:01:23.980> in

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
you've got a say a degree in

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.800 
you've got a say a degree in
aeronautical<00:01:24.670> engineering<00:01:24.790> I<00:01:25.480> mean<00:01:25.690> that

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
aeronautical engineering I mean that

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.390 
aeronautical engineering I mean that
would<00:01:25.960> definitely<00:01:26.080> get<00:01:26.530> their<00:01:26.710> attention<00:01:27.190> but

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
would definitely get their attention but

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.370 
would definitely get their attention but
what<00:01:28.180> I<00:01:28.210> really<00:01:28.570> think<00:01:28.720> what's<00:01:28.930> important

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
what I really think what's important

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.990 
what I really think what's important
these<00:01:29.470> days<00:01:29.740> is<00:01:30.250> if<00:01:30.400> you<00:01:30.490> can<00:01:30.670> somehow

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
these days is if you can somehow

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.590 
these days is if you can somehow
incorporate<00:01:31.780> your<00:01:31.930> degree<00:01:32.290> in<00:01:32.950> a<00:01:33.100> way<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:34.420> if

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
incorporate your degree in a way that if

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.750 
incorporate your degree in a way that if
you<00:01:34.750> become<00:01:35.110> furloughed<00:01:35.650> that<00:01:36.250> you<00:01:36.370> can<00:01:36.520> use

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
you become furloughed that you can use

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.760 
you become furloughed that you can use
that<00:01:36.970> degree<00:01:37.330> in<00:01:37.450> a<00:01:37.570> plan<00:01:38.110> toward<00:01:38.409> something

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
that degree in a plan toward something

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:39.899 
that degree in a plan toward something
and<00:01:38.920> I<00:01:38.950> don't<00:01:39.010> think<00:01:39.280> today<00:01:39.400> that<00:01:39.520> would<00:01:39.790> be

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
and I don't think today that would be

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.399 
and I don't think today that would be
computers<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:41.530> in<00:01:41.680> terms<00:01:41.950> of<00:01:42.390> what<00:01:43.390> school<00:01:43.810> you

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
computers so in terms of what school you

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.680 
computers so in terms of what school you
have<00:01:44.590> to<00:01:44.620> go<00:01:44.860> to<00:01:44.920> it's<00:01:45.700> not<00:01:45.940> important<00:01:46.420> so<00:01:46.600> if

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
have to go to it's not important so if

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.510 
have to go to it's not important so if
you're<00:01:46.840> looking<00:01:46.990> for<00:01:47.560> an<00:01:47.680> economical<00:01:48.370> way<00:01:48.490> to

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
you're looking for an economical way to

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.740 
you're looking for an economical way to
do<00:01:48.790> it<00:01:48.940> there's<00:01:49.090> a<00:01:49.180> couple<00:01:49.360> of<00:01:49.450> different<00:01:49.690> ways

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
do it there's a couple of different ways

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.899 
do it there's a couple of different ways
to<00:01:49.900> do<00:01:49.990> it<00:01:50.140> I<00:01:50.229> you<00:01:50.920> could<00:01:51.040> just<00:01:51.250> live<00:01:51.670> at<00:01:51.760> home

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
to do it I you could just live at home

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.300 
to do it I you could just live at home
with<00:01:52.060> mom<00:01:52.180> and<00:01:52.330> dad<00:01:52.420> for<00:01:52.690> a<00:01:52.720> while<00:01:52.810> and<00:01:53.250> go<00:01:54.250> to

with mom and dad for a while and go to

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.270 
with mom and dad for a while and go to

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
then finish up there I'm starting to see

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.610 
then finish up there I'm starting to see
now<00:02:04.299> that<00:02:04.330> some<00:02:04.659> community<00:02:05.110> colleges<00:02:05.140> are

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
now that some community colleges are

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.200 
now that some community colleges are
actually<00:02:05.950> offering<00:02:06.310> four-year<00:02:06.700> degrees<00:02:07.000> so

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
actually offering four-year degrees so

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.930 
actually offering four-year degrees so
that's<00:02:07.390> by<00:02:07.600> far<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.920> least<00:02:09.190> expensive<00:02:09.759> way<00:02:09.909> to

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
that's by far the least expensive way to

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.460 
that's by far the least expensive way to
do<00:02:10.179> it<00:02:10.300> and<00:02:10.479> again<00:02:10.569> you<00:02:10.990> just<00:02:11.080> want<00:02:11.170> to<00:02:11.350> be<00:02:11.410> able

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
do it and again you just want to be able

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.690 
do it and again you just want to be able
to<00:02:11.590> check<00:02:11.770> that<00:02:11.800> box<00:02:12.160> it's<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.490> most

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
to check that box it's the most

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.770 
to check that box it's the most
important<00:02:13.180> thing<00:02:13.209> you<00:02:13.660> know

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
important thing you know

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.600 
important thing you know
then<00:02:13.990> after<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.650> associate<00:02:15.160> degree<00:02:15.459> if

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
then after the associate degree if

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.920 
then after the associate degree if
you're<00:02:15.790> if<00:02:15.970> you're<00:02:16.000> going<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.270> do<00:02:16.360> associates

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
you're if you're going to do associates

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.630 
you're if you're going to do associates
yeah<00:02:17.410> you<00:02:17.500> could<00:02:17.740> transfer<00:02:18.069> that<00:02:18.250> temporary

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
yeah you could transfer that temporary

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.940 
yeah you could transfer that temporary
rental<00:02:18.790> so<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:19.780> could<00:02:19.990> have<00:02:20.260> that<00:02:20.290> name<00:02:20.740> on

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
rental so you could have that name on

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.670 
rental so you could have that name on
your<00:02:21.130> on<00:02:21.400> your<00:02:22.080> application<00:02:23.080> if<00:02:23.170> you<00:02:23.260> want<00:02:23.500> to

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
your on your application if you want to

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.320 
your on your application if you want to
but<00:02:23.860> do<00:02:24.069> I<00:02:24.130> think<00:02:24.250> that<00:02:24.760> that<00:02:25.000> made<00:02:25.209> any

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
but do I think that that made any

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.760 
but do I think that that made any
difference<00:02:25.480> for<00:02:25.900> me<00:02:26.400> no<00:02:28.110> really<00:02:29.110> I<00:02:29.380> mean<00:02:29.440> it

look at a lot of stuff on YouTube that

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.460 
look at a lot of stuff on YouTube that
was<00:02:48.610> shot<00:02:48.850> at<00:02:49.000> MIT<00:02:49.360> and<00:02:49.750> I<00:02:49.810> think<00:02:49.989> that's<00:02:50.110> just

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
was shot at MIT and I think that's just

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.860 
was shot at MIT and I think that's just
fascinating<00:02:50.739> and<00:02:51.340> I'm<00:02:51.519> assuming<00:02:52.090> they<00:02:52.209> might

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
fascinating and I'm assuming they might

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.170 
fascinating and I'm assuming they might
have<00:02:53.170> some<00:02:53.470> sort<00:02:53.680> of<00:02:53.709> degree<00:02:53.860> program<00:02:54.519> to<00:02:54.940> date

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
have some sort of degree program to date

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.050
