so chance chance maybe um with all this
going<00:01:12.800> on<00:01:13.070> they<00:01:13.250> might<00:01:13.580> go<00:01:13.910> ahead<00:01:14.180> and<00:01:15.220> have

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
going on they might go ahead and have

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.310 
going on they might go ahead and have
them<00:01:16.430> spawn<00:01:16.729> naturally<00:01:16.940> in<00:01:17.360> the<00:01:17.420> world<00:01:17.660> and<00:01:17.990> as

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
eat carrots raw only I think you may be

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.070 
eat carrots raw only I think you may be
able<00:01:46.820> to<00:01:46.909> cook<00:01:47.030> them<00:01:47.210> I<00:01:47.299> don't<00:01:47.479> remember<00:01:47.600> but<00:01:47.840> I

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
able to cook them I don't remember but I

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.870 
able to cook them I don't remember but I
think<00:01:48.259> you<00:01:48.350> can<00:01:48.380> lead<00:01:48.680> them<00:01:48.740> rather<00:01:48.979> pretty

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
think you can lead them rather pretty

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.730 
think you can lead them rather pretty
easy<00:01:50.119> to<00:01:50.270> grow<00:01:50.479> and<00:01:50.750> then<00:01:51.229> right<00:01:51.439> next<00:01:51.560> to<00:01:51.710> it

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
easy to grow and then right next to it

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.770 
easy to grow and then right next to it
as<00:01:51.890> potatoes<00:01:52.400> which<00:01:52.670> in<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.030> pc<00:01:53.299> version<00:01:53.330> can

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
as potatoes which in the pc version can

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.390 
as potatoes which in the pc version can
be<00:01:53.810> baked<00:01:54.140> I<00:01:54.350> assume<00:01:54.680> they'll<00:01:54.890> be<00:01:55.009> able<00:01:55.130> to<00:01:55.280> be

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
be baked I assume they'll be able to be

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.580 
be baked I assume they'll be able to be
baked<00:01:55.580> in<00:01:55.729> pok<00:01:55.909> addition<00:01:56.299> as<00:01:56.420> well<00:01:57.140> but<00:01:57.409> both

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
baked in pok addition as well but both

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.620

and you can lay it on top of another
block<00:03:35.880> so<00:03:36.180> that's<00:03:36.780> really<00:03:37.110> cool<00:03:37.410> for<00:03:37.560> design

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
block so that's really cool for design

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.670 
block so that's really cool for design
and<00:03:37.890> stuff<00:03:38.330> yeah<00:03:39.330> and<00:03:39.600> then<00:03:39.750> also<00:03:39.989> iron<00:03:40.410> bars

being added which is just sort of like a
window<00:03:43.560> but<00:03:43.950> lesson<00:03:44.489> you<00:03:44.580> can<00:03:44.610> see<00:03:44.910> through<00:03:45.239> it

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
window but lesson you can see through it

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.479 
window but lesson you can see through it
but<00:03:45.959> you<00:03:46.170> just<00:03:46.350> set<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.830> basically<00:03:47.100> just<00:03:47.280> iron

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
but you just set the basically just iron

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.400 
but you just set the basically just iron
bars<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:48.060> it's<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.209> full<00:03:48.420> block<00:03:48.750> you<00:03:49.110> know<00:03:49.230> one

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
bars and it's a full block you know one

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.550 
bars and it's a full block you know one
by<00:03:49.560> one<00:03:49.739> area<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:50.670> then<00:03:51.269> awesomely<00:03:52.230> awesome

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
by one area and then awesomely awesome

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.910 
by one area and then awesomely awesome
least<00:03:53.040> as<00:03:53.160> a<00:03:53.190> word<00:03:53.370> um<00:03:53.940> they<00:03:54.420> are<00:03:54.600> adding<00:03:54.959> Flynn

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
least as a word um they are adding Flynn

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.440 
least as a word um they are adding Flynn
steel<00:03:56.160> and<00:03:56.370> creative<00:03:56.730> mode<00:03:56.910> which<00:03:57.209> so<00:03:57.390> you

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
steel and creative mode which so you

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.289 
steel and creative mode which so you
know<00:03:57.570> you<00:03:57.630> can<00:03:57.720> light<00:03:57.930> TNT<00:03:58.110> as<00:03:58.650> well<00:03:59.100> as<00:03:59.370> lava

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
know you can light TNT as well as lava

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.970 
know you can light TNT as well as lava
is<00:04:00.630> going<00:04:00.810> to<00:04:00.870> be<00:04:00.959> able<00:04:01.049> to<00:04:01.230> light<00:04:01.350> CMC<00:04:01.709> and

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
is going to be able to light CMC and

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.460 
is going to be able to light CMC and
fire<00:04:02.310> so<00:04:02.730> if<00:04:03.209> you<00:04:03.269> have<00:04:03.360> TNT<00:04:03.870> you<00:04:04.049> randomly

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
fire so if you have TNT you randomly

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.740 
fire so if you have TNT you randomly
sitting<00:04:04.739> under<00:04:05.010> a<00:04:05.040> lava<00:04:05.850> waterfall<00:04:06.510> then

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
sitting under a lava waterfall then

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.830 
sitting under a lava waterfall then
better<00:04:07.290> watch<00:04:07.799> out<00:04:08.040> because<00:04:08.450> eight<00:04:09.450> once<00:04:09.720> a

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
better watch out because eight once a

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.810 
better watch out because eight once a
point<00:04:10.079> O<00:04:10.140> rolls<00:04:10.350> around<00:04:10.500> you<00:04:10.829> won't<00:04:10.860> be<00:04:11.190> having

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
point O rolls around you won't be having

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.460 
point O rolls around you won't be having
that<00:04:12.000> tnt<00:04:12.390> on<00:04:12.420> their<00:04:12.630> love<00:04:12.780> fall<00:04:12.989> anymore<00:04:13.170> you

yeah and then also the grass color may
look<00:04:19.769> a<00:04:19.890> little<00:04:19.919> bit<00:04:20.250> different<00:04:20.519> as<00:04:21.209> you<00:04:21.269> can

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
look a little bit different as you can

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.260 
look a little bit different as you can
see<00:04:21.780> it's<00:04:22.079> it's<00:04:22.290> lighter<00:04:22.760> Tom<00:04:23.760> set<00:04:24.000> is<00:04:24.090> too

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
see it's it's lighter Tom set is too

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.930 
see it's it's lighter Tom set is too
saturated<00:04:24.830> but<00:04:25.830> it's<00:04:26.070> actually<00:04:26.550> even<00:04:26.729> a

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
saturated but it's actually even a

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.140 
saturated but it's actually even a
little<00:04:27.150> bit<00:04:27.270> more<00:04:27.660> light<00:04:28.530> than<00:04:28.800> PC<00:04:29.760> minecraft

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
little bit more light than PC minecraft

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.790 
little bit more light than PC minecraft
has<00:04:30.300> so<00:04:30.479> they<00:04:30.570> may<00:04:30.720> make<00:04:31.050> it<00:04:31.110> a<00:04:31.229> tad<00:04:31.470> bit<00:04:31.650> more

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
has so they may make it a tad bit more

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.790 
has so they may make it a tad bit more
green<00:04:32.270> but<00:04:33.270> yeah<00:04:33.450> still<00:04:34.080> really<00:04:34.320> cool<00:04:34.560> looks

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
green but yeah still really cool looks

green but yeah still really cool looks
nicer<00:04:35.190> I<00:04:35.250> think<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.789> shading<00:04:36.210> on<00:04:36.330> animals

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
nicer I think the shading on animals

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.420 
nicer I think the shading on animals
look<00:04:37.289> a<00:04:37.320> little<00:04:37.410> bit<00:04:37.560> different<00:04:37.860> to<00:04:38.039> they<00:04:38.250> said

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
look a little bit different to they said

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.670 
look a little bit different to they said

so far as you can see there is clocks

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.450 
so far as you can see there is clocks
compasses<00:04:56.840> or<00:04:57.770> compass<00:04:58.570> and<00:04:59.570> a<00:05:00.080> hay<00:05:00.650> bale<00:05:00.680> we

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
compasses or compass and a hay bale we

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.620 
compasses or compass and a hay bale we
all<00:05:01.550> talk<00:05:01.669> about<00:05:01.699> the<00:05:01.910> hay<00:05:02.030> bale<00:05:02.210> in<00:05:02.330> a<00:05:02.389> minute

positioned<00:05:14.360> unless<00:05:14.900> here<00:05:15.080> in<00:05:15.199> a<00:05:15.259> cave<00:05:15.470> when

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
positioned unless here in a cave when

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.570 
positioned unless here in a cave when
you<00:05:15.740> know<00:05:15.949> if<00:05:16.009> it's<00:05:16.130> nighttime<00:05:16.310> or<00:05:16.550> daytime

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
you know if it's nighttime or daytime

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.969 
you know if it's nighttime or daytime
you<00:05:17.060> can<00:05:17.419> whip<00:05:17.720> out<00:05:17.840> your<00:05:17.900> clock<00:05:18.289> and<00:05:18.560> it<00:05:18.680> shows

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
you can whip out your clock and it shows

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.689 
you can whip out your clock and it shows
where<00:05:19.370> the<00:05:19.520> moon<00:05:19.729> is<00:05:19.940> and<00:05:20.780> where<00:05:20.990> the<00:05:21.110> Sun<00:05:21.349> is

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:21.699 
where the moon is and where the Sun is

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:24.790 
where the moon is and where the Sun is
and<00:05:22.699> it's<00:05:23.389> weird<00:05:23.630> is<00:05:23.810> he's<00:05:23.930> in<00:05:24.080> creative<00:05:24.560> and

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
and it's weird is he's in creative and

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.740 
and it's weird is he's in creative and
you<00:05:25.250> can<00:05:25.400> see<00:05:25.550> where<00:05:25.759> the<00:05:25.849> Sun<00:05:26.060> is<00:05:26.090> in<00:05:26.599> its

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
you can see where the Sun is in its

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.930 
you can see where the Sun is in its
actually<00:05:27.050> setting<00:05:27.380> which<00:05:27.949> shows<00:05:28.550> you<00:05:28.759> that

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
actually setting which shows you that

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.580 
actually setting which shows you that
there<00:05:29.000> will<00:05:29.210> be<00:05:29.240> a<00:05:29.360> day<00:05:29.630> and<00:05:29.840> night<00:05:29.960> time<00:05:30.139> cycle

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
there will be a day and night time cycle

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.430 
there will be a day and night time cycle
in<00:05:30.710> creative<00:05:31.160> mode<00:05:31.360> and<00:05:32.360> he<00:05:32.720> tweeted<00:05:33.349> out<00:05:33.380> a

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
in creative mode and he tweeted out a

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.810 
in creative mode and he tweeted out a
long<00:05:33.740> time<00:05:33.770> ago<00:05:33.979> that<00:05:34.310> they<00:05:34.400> might<00:05:34.610> add<00:05:34.789> a

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
long time ago that they might add a

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.159 
long time ago that they might add a
slider<00:05:35.150> bar<00:05:35.419> so<00:05:35.570> I<00:05:35.630> hope<00:05:35.750> that's<00:05:35.930> they're

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:36.169 
slider bar so I hope that's they're

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.839 
slider bar so I hope that's they're
basically<00:05:36.470> hit<00:05:36.680> the<00:05:36.710> pause<00:05:36.889> button<00:05:36.949> there'll

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:37.849 
basically hit the pause button there'll

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:39.189 
basically hit the pause button there'll
be<00:05:37.880> a<00:05:37.970> little<00:05:38.120> slider<00:05:38.479> bar<00:05:38.750> there<00:05:39.020> in<00:05:39.110> your

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 
be a little slider bar there in your

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:41.200 
be a little slider bar there in your
menu<00:05:39.560> to<00:05:39.740> change<00:05:39.919> the<00:05:40.160> time<00:05:40.460> of<00:05:40.699> day<00:05:40.880> which<00:05:41.060> I

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
menu to change the time of day which I

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.409 
menu to change the time of day which I
thinks<00:05:41.449> that's<00:05:41.509> really<00:05:42.229> really<00:05:42.380> cool<00:05:42.440> and

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
thinks that's really really cool and

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.719 
thinks that's really really cool and
compasses<00:05:44.419> just<00:05:44.900> point<00:05:45.229> towards<00:05:45.979> your<00:05:46.220> spawn

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:46.729 
compasses just point towards your spawn

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:48.370 
compasses just point towards your spawn
point<00:05:47.060> and<00:05:47.270> I<00:05:47.330> think<00:05:47.599> what<00:05:47.840> it<00:05:47.930> is<00:05:48.050> let's<00:05:48.320> say

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
point and I think what it is let's say

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.379 
point and I think what it is let's say
you<00:05:48.530> slept<00:05:48.650> in<00:05:48.800> a<00:05:48.919> bed<00:05:49.099> in<00:05:49.370> the<00:05:49.940> southwest

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
you slept in a bed in the southwest

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:51.969 
you slept in a bed in the southwest
direction<00:05:50.840> and<00:05:51.080> you<00:05:51.349> want<00:05:51.530> to<00:05:51.620> find<00:05:51.770> your<00:05:51.889> way

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
direction and you want to find your way

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:53.320 
direction and you want to find your way
home<00:05:52.190> with<00:05:52.430> your<00:05:52.550> super<00:05:52.789> far<00:05:52.940> away<00:05:52.970> and<00:05:53.240> you

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
home with your super far away and you

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.450 
home with your super far away and you
don't<00:05:53.449> have<00:05:53.539> a<00:05:53.570> map<00:05:53.780> you<00:05:54.470> can<00:05:54.770> look<00:05:55.190> at<00:05:55.340> your

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
don't have a map you can look at your

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.070 
don't have a map you can look at your
compass<00:05:55.820> in<00:05:56.000> the<00:05:56.030> needle<00:05:56.449> the<00:05:56.690> red<00:05:56.870> needle

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
compass in the needle the red needle

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.930 
compass in the needle the red needle
will<00:05:57.260> point<00:05:57.560> towards<00:05:57.770> that<00:05:58.159> spawn<00:05:58.460> point<00:05:58.729> I'm

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
will point towards that spawn point I'm

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.060 
will point towards that spawn point I'm
pretty<00:05:59.720> sure<00:06:00.050> points<00:06:00.380> towards<00:06:00.620> beds<00:06:00.830> but<00:06:01.039> I

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
pretty sure points towards beds but I

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.469 
pretty sure points towards beds but I
know<00:06:01.130> for<00:06:01.460> sure<00:06:01.490> points<00:06:02.060> towards<00:06:02.330> the

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 
know for sure points towards the

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:04.029 
know for sure points towards the
original<00:06:02.870> spawn<00:06:03.199> so<00:06:03.530> if<00:06:03.590> your<00:06:03.710> house<00:06:03.830> is

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 
original spawn so if your house is

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:05.350 
original spawn so if your house is
around<00:06:04.280> there<00:06:04.460> you'll<00:06:04.699> know<00:06:04.849> where<00:06:04.970> to<00:06:05.000> go<00:06:05.120> um

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
around there you'll know where to go um

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.550 
around there you'll know where to go um
and<00:06:06.169> last<00:06:06.710> but<00:06:06.860> not<00:06:07.099> least<00:06:07.159> my<00:06:07.729> favorite<00:06:08.240> thing

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
and last but not least my favorite thing

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.589 
and last but not least my favorite thing
did<00:06:09.560> I<00:06:09.590> speculate<00:06:10.159> there<00:06:10.880> you<00:06:11.090> can<00:06:11.120> see<00:06:11.270> hey

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:11.599 
did I speculate there you can see hey

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:14.320 
did I speculate there you can see hey
bills<00:06:11.810> which<00:06:12.139> is<00:06:12.289> a<00:06:12.320> block<00:06:12.830> which<00:06:13.520> is<00:06:13.550> a<00:06:13.729> just

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
bills which is a block which is a just

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.120 
bills which is a block which is a just
wheat<00:06:14.599> you<00:06:14.900> take<00:06:15.080> wheat<00:06:15.320> and<00:06:15.470> you<00:06:15.560> make<00:06:15.740> a<00:06:15.770> full

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
wheat you take wheat and you make a full

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.580 
wheat you take wheat and you make a full
not<00:06:16.610> three<00:06:16.909> by<00:06:17.060> three<00:06:17.330> crafting<00:06:17.870> spot<00:06:18.289> so<00:06:18.500> it

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
not three by three crafting spot so it

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.670 
not three by three crafting spot so it
takes<00:06:18.740> nine<00:06:19.039> wheat<00:06:19.400> to<00:06:19.610> make<00:06:19.639> this<00:06:20.449> hey<00:06:21.409> block

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
takes nine wheat to make this hey block

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.439 
takes nine wheat to make this hey block
and<00:06:22.240> the<00:06:23.240> only<00:06:23.659> purpose<00:06:23.960> of<00:06:24.199> a<00:06:24.259> hey<00:06:24.470> block

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:25.449 
and the only purpose of a hey block

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:28.060 
and the only purpose of a hey block
besides<00:06:26.449> like<00:06:26.599> design<00:06:26.900> I<00:06:26.930> guess<00:06:27.259> is<00:06:27.530> to<00:06:27.620> feed

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.070 
besides like design I guess is to feed

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.830 
besides like design I guess is to feed
horses<00:06:28.430> so<00:06:28.849> for<00:06:29.060> them<00:06:29.180> adding<00:06:29.479> this<00:06:29.570> to<00:06:29.630> the

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
horses so for them adding this to the

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.460 
horses so for them adding this to the
game<00:06:30.080> in<00:06:30.380> a<00:06:30.949> point<00:06:31.220> 0<00:06:31.340> means<00:06:32.240> basically<00:06:33.020> for

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470 
game in a point 0 means basically for

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.070 
game in a point 0 means basically for
sure<00:06:33.620> they're<00:06:34.460> going<00:06:34.699> to<00:06:34.789> add<00:06:34.880> horses<00:06:35.419> soon<00:06:35.810> if

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 
sure they're going to add horses soon if

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.439 
sure they're going to add horses soon if
not<00:06:36.470> in<00:06:37.009> eight<00:06:37.159> point<00:06:37.400> oh<00:06:37.460> I<00:06:37.520> speculate<00:06:38.240> to<00:06:38.330> add

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:38.449 
not in eight point oh I speculate to add

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:41.529 
not in eight point oh I speculate to add
them<00:06:38.570> in<00:06:38.720> either<00:06:39.139> nine<00:06:39.530> point<00:06:39.800> 0<00:06:39.919> or<00:06:40.210> one<00:06:41.210> point

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:41.539 
them in either nine point 0 or one point

zero point zero the final reason

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:47.020 
zero point zero the final reason
micropropagation<00:06:44.060> or<00:06:44.509> the<00:06:44.599> big<00:06:44.810> I<00:06:45.970> think<00:06:46.970> it'd

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.030 
micropropagation or the big I think it'd

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.570
