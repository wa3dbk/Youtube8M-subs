skateboard<00:00:25.710> bearings<00:00:26.210> when<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.300> get<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.449> brand

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
skateboard bearings when you get a brand

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.230 
skateboard bearings when you get a brand
new<00:00:27.810> set<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.230> bearings<00:00:28.580> they're<00:00:29.580> they're

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
new set of bearings they're they're

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.479 
new set of bearings they're they're
really<00:00:30.269> kind<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.869> like<00:00:31.080> can<00:00:32.040> be<00:00:32.189> they're

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
really kind of like can be they're

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.610 
really kind of like can be they're
really<00:00:32.969> precise<00:00:33.390> skateboard<00:00:34.230> bearings<00:00:34.350> are

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
really precise skateboard bearings are

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.069 
really precise skateboard bearings are
like<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.770> really<00:00:34.980> precise<00:00:35.460> instrument

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
like a really precise instrument

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:38.119 
like a really precise instrument
bearings<00:00:37.079> are<00:00:37.200> used<00:00:37.230> in<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.559> lot<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.860> different

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
bearings are used in a lot of different

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.860 
bearings are used in a lot of different
things<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.579> can<00:00:38.730> use<00:00:38.790> they<00:00:39.090> use<00:00:39.360> them<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.660> in

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
things you can use they use them in in

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.770 
things you can use they use them in in
the<00:00:40.469> wheels<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:41.340> roll<00:00:41.520> around<00:00:41.910> for<00:00:42.239> chairs

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
the wheels that roll around for chairs

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.200 
the wheels that roll around for chairs
things<00:00:43.379> like<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.770> machinery<00:00:44.250> uses<00:00:44.820> bearings

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
things like that machinery uses bearings

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.819 
things like that machinery uses bearings
so<00:00:45.809> when<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.020> get<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.200> set<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.590> bearings

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
so when you get a set of bearings

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.889 
so when you get a set of bearings
they're<00:00:47.550> really<00:00:47.879> clean<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.480> they're<00:00:48.750> really

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
they're really clean and they're really

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.110 
they're really clean and they're really
perfect<00:00:49.469> when<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.010> first<00:00:50.190> get<00:00:50.370> them<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.969> they

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
perfect when you first get them so they

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.330 
perfect when you first get them so they
sort<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.449> roll<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.199> very<00:00:52.410> precise<00:00:52.800> way<00:00:53.100> and

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
sort of roll in a very precise way and

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.760 
sort of roll in a very precise way and
they<00:00:54.030> just<00:00:54.270> they<00:00:54.899> just<00:00:54.930> go<00:00:55.289> they<00:00:55.469> don't<00:00:55.559> make

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
they just they just go they don't make

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.670 
they just they just go they don't make
any<00:00:55.920> noise<00:00:56.190> they're<00:00:56.850> perfect<00:00:57.680> eventually

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
any noise they're perfect eventually

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.410 
any noise they're perfect eventually
after<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.070> skateboard<00:00:59.579> with<00:00:59.730> them<00:00:59.879> hopefully

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
after you skateboard with them hopefully

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.700 
after you skateboard with them hopefully
if<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.600> buy<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> good<00:01:00.989> brand<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.379> bearings

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
if you buy a good brand of bearings

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.840 
if you buy a good brand of bearings
they're<00:01:01.920> going<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.100> last<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.520> for<00:01:02.699> like<00:01:02.820> a

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
skateboard bearing will last you a year

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.530 
skateboard bearing will last you a year
and<00:01:07.549> that's<00:01:08.549> what<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.880> pay<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> little<00:01:09.299> more

and that's what you pay a little more
for<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.140> get<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> bearing<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.710> lasts<00:01:10.979> that

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
for is to get a bearing that lasts that

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.570 
for is to get a bearing that lasts that
long

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
long
