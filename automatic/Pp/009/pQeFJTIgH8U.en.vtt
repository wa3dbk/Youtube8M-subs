00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
there are a lot of people that really

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.800 
there are a lot of people that really
don't<00:00:20.070> like<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.760> interface<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.630> thought

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
don't like the interface so I thought

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.939 
don't like the interface so I thought
I'd<00:00:21.930> start<00:00:22.109> with<00:00:22.199> some<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.590> things<00:00:22.769> that<00:00:22.920> I

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
I'd start with some of the things that I

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.550 
I'd start with some of the things that I
do<00:00:23.039> like<00:00:23.490> one<00:00:24.090> thing<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.420> do<00:00:24.600> like<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:25.019> this

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
do like one thing that I do like is this

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.609 
do like one thing that I do like is this
election<00:00:26.189> for<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.670> first<00:00:27.000> time<00:00:27.330> in<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:28.289> while

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
election for the first time in a while

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.299 
election for the first time in a while
you<00:00:29.039> can<00:00:29.250> stream<00:00:29.640> Taylor<00:00:30.300> Swift<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:31.050> know<00:00:31.949> it's

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
you can stream Taylor Swift I know it's

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.340 
you can stream Taylor Swift I know it's
it's<00:00:33.120> pretty<00:00:33.390> much<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.570> greatest<00:00:33.750> thing<00:00:34.230> ever

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
it's pretty much the greatest thing ever

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.569 
it's pretty much the greatest thing ever
now<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.130> can<00:00:35.489> actually<00:00:35.610> listen<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.239> 1989<00:00:37.079> I

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
now I can actually listen to 1989 I

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.760 
now I can actually listen to 1989 I
still<00:00:38.579> have<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.450> theory<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.140> could<00:00:40.500> and

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
still have it but in theory I could and

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.100 
still have it but in theory I could and
that<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:41.399> what<00:00:41.640> sets<00:00:41.879> apple<00:00:42.300> music<00:00:42.390> apart<00:00:42.870> but

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
that is what sets apple music apart but

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.600 
that is what sets apple music apart but
actually<00:00:43.469> there<00:00:43.620> are<00:00:43.800> other<00:00:44.040> things<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.430> are

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
actually there are other things that are

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.310 
actually there are other things that are
great<00:00:44.789> about<00:00:44.969> Apple<00:00:45.300> music<00:00:45.390> for<00:00:46.020> instance

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
great about Apple music for instance

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.799 
great about Apple music for instance
Apple<00:00:46.920> music<00:00:46.980> relies<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> lot<00:00:47.670> more<00:00:48.090> on<00:00:48.329> human

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
Apple music relies a lot more on human

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.930 
Apple music relies a lot more on human
curators<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:50.129> are<00:00:50.309> actually<00:00:50.670> going<00:00:50.820> through

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
curators that are actually going through

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.430 
curators that are actually going through
the<00:00:51.180> music<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.690> picking<00:00:51.989> out<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.170> ones<00:00:52.350> that

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
the music and picking out the ones that

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.080 
the music and picking out the ones that
they<00:00:52.710> think<00:00:52.770> you'll<00:00:53.129> like<00:00:53.340> now<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.030> is

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
they think you'll like now this is

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.420 
they think you'll like now this is
opposed<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.719> letting<00:00:54.989> algorithms<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.010> robots

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
opposed to letting algorithms and robots

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.889 
opposed to letting algorithms and robots
and<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.699> know<00:00:56.910> those<00:00:57.090> kind<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.449> things<00:00:57.629> pick

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
and you know those kind of things pick

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.080 
and you know those kind of things pick
out<00:00:58.050> your<00:00:58.170> music<00:00:58.500> now<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.039> will<00:00:59.370> say<00:00:59.609> you<00:01:00.059> know

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
out your music now I will say you know

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.790 
out your music now I will say you know
robots<00:01:00.600> picking<00:01:00.809> up<00:01:01.050> my<00:01:01.140> music<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.620> pretty

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
robots picking up my music is pretty

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.219 
robots picking up my music is pretty
cool<00:01:02.129> but<00:01:02.699> humans<00:01:03.239> are<00:01:03.390> also<00:01:03.570> doing<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:04.049> pretty

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
cool but humans are also doing a pretty

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.810 
cool but humans are also doing a pretty
good<00:01:04.320> job<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.799> seems<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.189> number<00:01:05.460> comes<00:01:05.700> to

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
good job it seems that number comes to

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.210 
good job it seems that number comes to
things<00:01:06.000> like<00:01:06.060> music<00:01:06.570> robots<00:01:07.560> can<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:07.830> kind<00:01:08.159> of

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
things like music robots can be kind of

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.969 
things like music robots can be kind of
iffy<00:01:08.700> now<00:01:08.939> speaking<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.869> human<00:01:10.409> curation

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
iffy now speaking of human curation

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.010 
iffy now speaking of human curation

into they play a whole lot of different

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.090 
into they play a whole lot of different
music<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:37.350> there's<00:01:37.590> probably<00:01:37.860> going<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.040> be

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
music so there's probably going to be

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.499 
music so there's probably going to be
something<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:38.520> there<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.909> will<00:01:39.000> appeal<00:01:39.360> to

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
you but I think what's really great
about<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:42.479> just<00:01:42.659> something

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
about it is that it's just something

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.630
