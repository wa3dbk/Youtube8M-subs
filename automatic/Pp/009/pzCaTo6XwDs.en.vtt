00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
could be slightly orange on some of them

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.080 
could be slightly orange on some of them
they're<00:01:01.170> usually<00:01:01.350> sprawling<00:01:01.949> plants<00:01:02.640> some<00:01:03.030> of

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
they're usually sprawling plants some of

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.640 
they're usually sprawling plants some of
them<00:01:03.210> can<00:01:03.449> be<00:01:03.539> more<00:01:03.719> upright<00:01:03.930> than<00:01:04.199> others

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
them can be more upright than others

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.730 
them can be more upright than others
they're<00:01:04.890> usually<00:01:05.070> good<00:01:05.250> for<00:01:05.460> ground<00:01:05.939> covers

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
they're usually good for ground covers

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.160 
they're usually good for ground covers
and<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:07.979> case<00:01:08.540> they're<00:01:09.540> very<00:01:09.720> good<00:01:09.840> for

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
and in this case they're very good for

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.170 
and in this case they're very good for
erosion<00:01:10.560> control<00:01:10.770> as<00:01:11.310> well<00:01:11.340> because<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:11.939> one

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
erosion control as well because this one

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.260 
erosion control as well because this one
in<00:01:12.450> particular<00:01:12.570> as<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.740> branches<00:01:14.220> arch<00:01:14.580> they

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
in particular as the branches arch they

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.560 
in particular as the branches arch they
will<00:01:15.420> hit<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.659> ground<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.080> root<00:01:16.549> right<00:01:17.570> so

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
will hit the ground and root right so

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.499 
will hit the ground and root right so
you<00:01:18.659> get<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.900> lot<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.110> coverage<00:01:19.610> area<00:01:20.610> now<00:01:21.450> the

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
you get a lot of coverage area now the

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.359 
you get a lot of coverage area now the
resident<00:01:22.049> there<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.500> some<00:01:22.680> disadvantages<00:01:23.250> and

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
resident there is some disadvantages and

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.710 
resident there is some disadvantages and
this<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.610> one<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:23.850> don't<00:01:24.210> particularly<00:01:24.479> like

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
this is one I don't particularly like

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.080 
this is one I don't particularly like
and<00:01:24.930> I've<00:01:24.990> never<00:01:25.200> used<00:01:25.490> but<00:01:26.490> it's<00:01:26.610> commonly

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
and I've never used but it's commonly

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.789 
and I've never used but it's commonly
used<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.600> institutional<00:01:28.350> commercial

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
used in institutional commercial

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:29.929

landscaping<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.369> what<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.610> have<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.790> realize

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
landscaping so what you have to realize

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.260 
landscaping so what you have to realize
here<00:01:30.270> we've<00:01:30.720> got<00:01:30.750> remnants<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.619> an<00:01:31.799> old

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
landscape that was designed a number of

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.520 
landscape that was designed a number of
years<00:01:35.130> ago<00:01:35.340> by<00:01:35.729> landscape<00:01:36.270> architects<00:01:36.689> I'm

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
years ago by landscape architects I'm

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.600 
years ago by landscape architects I'm
not<00:01:37.710> going<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.950> beat<00:01:38.070> up<00:01:38.220> landscape

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
not going to beat up landscape

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.710 
not going to beat up landscape
architects<00:01:39.030> but<00:01:39.180> they<00:01:39.270> know<00:01:39.360> about<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.570> hundred

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
architects but they know about a hundred

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.249 
architects but they know about a hundred
plants<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.850> you<00:01:41.850> know<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.210> one<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.140> the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
plants and you know this is one of the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.899 
plants and you know this is one of the
hundred<00:01:43.530> blue<00:01:43.740> spruce<00:01:44.100> with<00:01:44.369> her<00:01:44.460> now<00:01:44.579> dying

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
hundred blue spruce with her now dying

it's a common plan you need to know the

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.949 
it's a common plan you need to know the
common<00:03:46.760> stuff<00:03:47.000> before<00:03:47.390> you<00:03:47.480> start<00:03:47.720> to<00:03:47.840> learn

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
common stuff before you start to learn

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.490 
common stuff before you start to learn
you<00:03:48.620> know<00:03:48.799> learn<00:03:49.730> the

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
you know learn the

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.750 
you know learn the
more<00:03:50.740> interesting<00:03:51.370> stuff<00:03:52.140> ok<00:03:53.700> any<00:03:54.700> questions

on<00:03:55.270> cotoneaster<00:03:55.600> I<00:03:56.250> find<00:03:57.250> that<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:57.520> number<00:03:58.030> of

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
on cotoneaster I find that the number of

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.820 
on cotoneaster I find that the number of
questions<00:03:58.480> decrease<00:03:58.900> dramatically<00:03:59.470> in

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
questions decrease dramatically in

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.800 
questions decrease dramatically in
proportion<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.460> the<00:04:00.820> temperature<00:04:01.270> and

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
proportion to the temperature and

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.760 
proportion to the temperature and
precipitation<00:04:02.500> levels<00:04:03.450> hmm<00:04:07.260> I've<00:04:08.260> never<00:04:08.500> get
