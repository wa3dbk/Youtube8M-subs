okay<00:03:13.030> I<00:03:13.239> know<00:03:13.540> some<00:03:13.840> videos<00:03:14.230> from<00:03:14.470> say<00:03:14.709> to<00:03:14.769> use

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
okay I know some videos from say to use

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.860 
okay I know some videos from say to use
fuel<00:03:15.430> for<00:03:15.670> cleaning<00:03:15.970> your<00:03:16.000> air<00:03:16.239> filter<00:03:16.480> and

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
fuel for cleaning your air filter and

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.770 
fuel for cleaning your air filter and
yeah<00:03:17.439> you<00:03:17.500> can<00:03:17.799> do<00:03:17.920> that<00:03:17.950> it's<00:03:18.370> fine<00:03:18.730> but<00:03:19.480> what

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
yeah you can do that it's fine but what

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.539 
yeah you can do that it's fine but what
it<00:03:19.900> tends<00:03:20.109> to<00:03:20.230> do<00:03:20.439> is<00:03:20.709> it<00:03:20.859> makes<00:03:21.220> your<00:03:21.400> air

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
it tends to do is it makes your air

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.149 
it tends to do is it makes your air
filter<00:03:21.760> expand<00:03:22.359> which<00:03:23.230> isn't<00:03:23.799> so<00:03:23.950> good

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 
filter expand which isn't so good

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.399 
filter expand which isn't so good
because<00:03:24.519> it<00:03:24.939> reduces<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.930> chance<00:03:26.139> of<00:03:26.260> it

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:26.409 
because it reduces the chance of it

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.129 
because it reduces the chance of it
capturing<00:03:26.799> the<00:03:26.919> stuff<00:03:27.159> and<00:03:27.400> also<00:03:28.239> fuel<00:03:28.900> I

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139 
capturing the stuff and also fuel I

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:30.720 
capturing the stuff and also fuel I
don't<00:03:29.829> know<00:03:29.889> whether<00:03:30.010> you've<00:03:30.159> noticed<00:03:30.189> but

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
don't know whether you've noticed but

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.929 
don't know whether you've noticed but
it's<00:03:30.790> quite<00:03:31.180> expensive<00:03:31.389> just<00:03:32.290> like<00:03:32.609> 15<00:03:33.609> quid

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:33.939 
it's quite expensive just like 15 quid

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:38.369 
it's quite expensive just like 15 quid
or<00:03:34.500> twenty<00:03:35.500> dollars<00:03:35.829> for<00:03:36.220> a<00:03:36.359> liter<00:03:37.359> I<00:03:37.720> dunno

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379 
or twenty dollars for a liter I dunno

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:41.250 
or twenty dollars for a liter I dunno
about<00:03:38.470> you<00:03:38.620> but<00:03:38.799> that's<00:03:39.040> quite<00:03:39.310> a<00:03:39.340> lot<00:03:40.260> right
