 tricks and despite on the sweat off to 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.470

 donate and bring sorrow on the tables 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.390
 I sit like me when I stop 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.760
 just sitting at the table during ryse 59 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.860
 time only 50 to midnight trying on 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.229
 his name to find a pure need 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.909
 but no chance of escaping anymore 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.220
 unless you phorms on his 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.770
 still put a hot air balloon on 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.720
 word for the outfit baggy pants josef 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.270

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.040
 shirt not to sport it for that 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.170
 Paradoxical sounds are rich just like 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.630
 glasses always wear sunglasses 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.180
 while you learn to look in the camera 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.920

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.650

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.800
 No effect I wondered how 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.450
 you start in the tournament and think about it 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.940
