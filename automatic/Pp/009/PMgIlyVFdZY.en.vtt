00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
 hello my name is Misha today 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.750
 we'll talk about the movie 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:13.950
 new spiderman 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:15.929
 high voltage and we should 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.390
 dwell on extreme stupidity 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.020
 this name years already before me more than once 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.020
 chewed 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.730
 The last film cannot be called good 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.519
 the plot was dull and the tube villain didn't 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.410
 impressed quite but the man himself 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.690
 spider 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.809
 incredibly infuriated by his every appearance 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.250
 in the frame I realized that it was but not 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:46.000
 then i'm afraid when lord . 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:01:03.920
 but if you compare it with what came out in 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:01:05.929
 2007 that it was peter parker 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.350
 depicted a fever bedroom the evening before 

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:08.350
 our window 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:19.610
 just forget about this restart you can 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:26.750
 consider successful know why me 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:29.140
 like being a spiderman because 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.140
 that's cool 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.950
 this time the filmmakers check and 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.350
 some work on the bugs and done 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.740
 many shoals inherent in the past 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.440
 film and added and a huge amount 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.000
 new 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.910
 the plot no longer seems dull 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.940
 on the contrary, he is full of events that 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.960
 clearly interfere with each other and weakly with each other 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.660
 friend bound 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.390
 especially got the romantic line 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.690
 instead of showing us distinctly and 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.570
 development of relations parker and queen us 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:09.430
 showed somewhere 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:15.170
 45 45 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:18.650
 If we take the final scene Well, yes 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.940
 Generally four or five scenes from walking 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.310
 partings this back room is the most 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.760
 a hackneyed place from wherever possible 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:33.400
 hide my apologize that i don't 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.400
 prepared for us normal steal i 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:41.000
 the villain had a hard time too 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.500
 Electro Spider foe is incredibly cool 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.710
 although it is quite primitive 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.650
 the backstory of the embittered zadrota those 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.630
 less he really gives a light to all 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:55.130
 other villains including villains from 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:57.680
 last trilogy I just wanted to 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.620
 we did not pay attention to the Lithuanian 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.630
 and shoot then come with me just 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.630
 talk away from all these people 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:13.980
 no shoot and everything would be fine 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:17.519
 if he were the only adversary 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.920
 spider but all its awesomeness and coolness 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.079
 smeared with the presence of a green goblin 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.700
 which appeared literally five minutes 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:30.090
 and really did not show himself but he 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.530
 type of reserved for the next movie and I 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:40.459
 I would say that I do not want him there because 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:40.459
 Well, do not surpass him electro well, no way 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:56.069
 rhino why what was it who was 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:58.760
 In general, this rhino is in the cartoon though 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.760
 would have been 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.500
 image of a spiderman is unique 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.620
 improved at least he is no longer 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:16.070
 grimaces just joking in a friendly way 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:20.570
 with villains on the other hand he started 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:31.460
 much more whining something to me this 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:33.790
 reminds in general strictly speaking 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:38.919
 spiderman 2 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.919
 do you mind if I call him that 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:45.139
 spiderman 2 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:49.039
 this is just a bad sequel 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:52.370
 but if you don't care about all those stupid 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:56.720
 plot tricks on completely empty 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:05:01.030
 characters, I still advise you to go to 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:08.120
 this film and preferably in aimax 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:09.470
 because action decides you want 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.389
 to measure strength 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.389
 I don't think you like it 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.760
 become or help with the role of 3d 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.450
 popcorn movie 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:34.370
 copes 100 percent 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:38.090
 especially flying on the web they were 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:40.160
 just gorgeous and of course scale 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:45.290
 spectacular fight with electro 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:46.490
 the fact that the spider in them survived is very 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.220
 great luck 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:53.180
 although really just bad 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:56.270
 script to uniquely Electrical this 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:06:00.500
 the film was the coolest from here 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:02.810
 morals do not offend zadrotov they can 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:07.310
 silently take a punch in the face 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:11.360
 but it may be a month later and may 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:14.270
 be in 10 years they will kill you yours 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.850
 family and your fucking dog 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:20.690
 that is, you justify what you 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:27.070
 hit in the sixth grade film put 6 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:31.390
 points out of 10 on this all goodbye 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.390
 I will kill of all 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:42.909
 but they forgot about me in my opinion someone hastily 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.909
 wrote the script
