00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
for two and a half years and really it's

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.490 
for two and a half years and really it's
the<00:00:56.190> work<00:00:56.399> I've<00:00:56.610> seen<00:00:56.879> there<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.329> sent<00:00:58.079> me<00:00:58.230> to

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
the work I've seen there that sent me to

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.619 
the work I've seen there that sent me to
just<00:00:59.309> find<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.609> biggest<00:00:59.910> challenge<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.420> could

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
just find the biggest challenge I could

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.959 
just find the biggest challenge I could
and<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.410> guess<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:02.129> know<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.579> drive

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
and I guess you know that that drive

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.460 
and I guess you know that that drive
probably<00:01:03.570> kept<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:04.019> going<00:01:04.170> because<00:01:04.439> I

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
probably kept you going because I

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.859 
probably kept you going because I
understand<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.830> broke<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.309> records<00:01:05.760> by<00:01:06.210> 20

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
understand you broke the records by 20

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.560 
understand you broke the records by 20
days<00:01:07.140> that's<00:01:07.439> no<00:01:07.680> mean<00:01:07.950> feat<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.820> there<00:01:09.360> must

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
days that's no mean feat and there must

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.690 
days that's no mean feat and there must
have<00:01:09.720> been<00:01:09.810> some<00:01:10.320> really<00:01:10.590> challenging<00:01:11.220> times

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
have been some really challenging times

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.000 
have been some really challenging times
yeah<00:01:12.060> there's<00:01:12.420> no<00:01:12.570> easy<00:01:12.810> day<00:01:13.110> doing<00:01:13.650> something

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
yeah there's no easy day doing something

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.070 
yeah there's no easy day doing something
like<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.400> but<00:01:15.770> I've<00:01:16.770> crossed<00:01:17.369> India<00:01:17.729> with

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
like that but I've crossed India with

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.070 
like that but I've crossed India with
Delhi<00:01:19.080> Belly<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.530> lost<00:01:20.240> about<00:01:21.240> 20<00:01:21.659> percent<00:01:21.990> of

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
Delhi Belly and lost about 20 percent of

my body weight in about 10 days that was

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.280 
my body weight in about 10 days that was
probably<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.159> worst<00:01:26.310> section<00:01:27.200> lonely<00:01:30.290> lonely

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
probably the worst section lonely lonely

at times the I miss people but there's
so<00:01:35.040> many<00:01:35.130> things<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.670> engage<00:01:35.880> with<00:01:36.240> everyday

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
so many things to engage with everyday

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.620 
so many things to engage with everyday
that<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.320> don't<00:01:37.530> really<00:01:37.619> have<00:01:37.829> time<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.310> be
