00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.279
 you have to take a new video from 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.010
 dsv and as you see now I am bringing you 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:15.200
 a new super mode called airplane 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:19.160
 rather common plane but rather it 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.590
 it knows or is commonly called plane does not 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.960
 we do not usually talk about airplane but 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.240
 well this world is pretty good already 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.289
 that the creator in this way I'm going to 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.690
 leave in the video inscription 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.000
 giving the credits all to him and them 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.879
 I'm going to leave a place where here comes the 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.219
 texture and scripts mode comes only one 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:41.420
 instant and as we have always done 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:42.800
 It is the same before and right now 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.530
 in the next week I'm showing 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.889
 a little about the postmen that you 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.929
 they have to do well more than it is 

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:52.219
 I will explain how the plane is made 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:57.289
 because it 's pretty easy it's just 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:01:02.070
 they use three tires the body is made 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:05.430
 I think it's like the body something like that 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.280
 I understand that they want to understand the creator 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:13.060
 of the windows are some wings 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.390
 I think that nothing else but that there is a 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.210
 key and we also have to bring a 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.940
 bucket with gasoline is good enough 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.860
 good is this mode since they include 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.110
 texture that is quite adequate to what 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.079
 which means that the mode is the plane 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.520
 well now as you see 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.560
 to turn on the plane we're just going to 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.290
 put that yes you have to have the difficulty 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.299
 to the maximum that yes they are not forgotten because 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.009
 if they do not put it they will give the same 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.930
 error that the bulldozer that it NomÃ¡s 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.520
 put and want to put it back on 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.470
 true with the difficulty they are not going to 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.740
 can put because you can only put 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.530
 an airplane by map and you try to put and 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.200
 If they put it on, you can not see it. 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.820
 another mode or the same but on another map 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.530
 it is the same what you have to do is 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.299
 delete the mode and reinstall it and 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.299
 put the difficulty to the maximum and so 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.670
 we put right the plane again 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.190
 to start the plane to get on 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.679
 we give the key now that we are there 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.269
 it sounds like a kripper is going to 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.110
 burst but the truth is not that but 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:19.709
 which is like a defect and a default that 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.720
 brought the plane and good for that for 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.700
 start and start flying alone we are going to 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.470
 need the gas tank or the 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.500
 gasoline we click on the plane and there 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.640
 are you going to tell us what 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:35.780
 is full is full of gasoline 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.560
 tank well now if we move forward and where 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.700
 we want to go 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.350
 you have to point the view in the 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.910
 screen that is if we want to go 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.830
 up obviously we have to do 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.209
 the screen like we were watching 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.790
 towards the sky and so we will continue to 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:53.750
 power we will be able to fly and good for 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.480
 go down the same thing I think nothing else that's 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.520
 You have to explain for this mod 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.130
 It's pretty good I could not say 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.260
 as a simple means because if they include 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.840
 many craft but at the time of 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.239
 hours are the hours of works forgiveness 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.890
 it will be agreed and they will see what it is 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.120
 pretty easy to find these coffee or 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.850
 so I 'm leaving you some 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.770
 images and as good I tell you that in 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.660
 the same download to the description if 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.870
 you liked the video and the mode too 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.660
 a like to this video subscribe comments 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.800
 suggest topics or some way you want 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:30.170
 give us a suggestion about a way 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.330
 that you want me to do maybe I 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.930
 can communicate with a meter mode for 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.439
 what 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.939
 maybe I suggest him and maybe he does and 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:39.980
 well up here we leave the video not 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:42.319
 forget to subscribe to the like and as you see 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.939
 I already repeated the same thing you get here 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.689
 we leave the video and see you in the 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:46.689
 next goodbye
