bieber-style bait they're thinking of

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.260 
bieber-style bait they're thinking of
two<00:01:05.489> things<00:01:05.820> one<00:01:06.210> thing<00:01:06.540> would<00:01:06.810> be<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.020> would<00:01:08.010> be

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
two things one thing would be a would be

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.600 
two things one thing would be a would be
possibly<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.360> bait<00:01:09.720> fish<00:01:10.020> shad<00:01:10.799> or<00:01:10.830> brim<00:01:11.369> and

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
possibly the bait fish shad or brim and

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.789 
possibly the bait fish shad or brim and
then<00:01:12.479> another<00:01:12.689> thing<00:01:12.960> they'd<00:01:13.170> be<00:01:13.320> looking<00:01:13.470> at

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
then another thing they'd be looking at

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.100 
then another thing they'd be looking at
is<00:01:14.010> possibly<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.610> claw<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.299> think<00:01:15.600> beavers

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
is possibly a claw I think beavers

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.469 
is possibly a claw I think beavers
represent<00:01:17.040> two<00:01:17.310> different<00:01:17.340> styles<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.240> bait

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
represent two different styles of bait

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.010 
represent two different styles of bait
for<00:01:18.840> for<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.500> bass<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:21.030> one<00:01:21.270> we<00:01:21.450> decided<00:01:21.810> to

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
for for a bass so this one we decided to

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.820 
for for a bass so this one we decided to
go<00:01:22.170> with<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.770> brim<00:01:23.100> style<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:24.830> therefore

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
go with the brim style and therefore

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.080 
go with the brim style and therefore
it's<00:01:25.979> called<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.369> shell<00:01:26.580> cracker

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
it's called a shell cracker

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.020 
it's called a shell cracker
now<00:01:27.930> can<00:01:28.229> we<00:01:28.259> rig<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.710> different<00:01:29.070> ways<00:01:29.220> yes<00:01:29.729> of

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
now can we rig it different ways yes of
