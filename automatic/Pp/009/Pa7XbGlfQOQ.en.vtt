00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.630

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.710
 two outfits and a small gift 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.710
 have lots of fun with it 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:33.290
 after I use my moisturizer 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.329
 I applied my eyes 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.110
 and at all red spots in the face 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.430
 with concealer around a eyebrow 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.199
 to lend a bit of form 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.019
 I use an eye and a pen and 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.970
 fix the whole thing with gel after the 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:48.860
 Apply the setting base I do 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.800
 a light-footed eyeshadow on it 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.460
 and then a golden and year very 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.260
 Shimmering color on my eye 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.690
 to look a bit bigger with my eyes 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.120
 I'll give you something in the lid fold 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.920
 darker shimmering browns 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.780
 then blindfolded the whole thing now 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.240
 I highlight a little bit below 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.159
 raise your eyebrows to keep it that way 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.810
 beautiful faith comes afterwards 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.970
 I compete my face with a 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.649
 natural browser I mine 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.630
 cheeks on the sleeps and on his 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.009
 wear on the front nose and your children 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.369
 so that's a bit before that 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.369
 had 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.250
 I'm still wearing for a watchful look 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.200
 one with colors the kajalstift on mine 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.160
 Waterline on extra glamorous and 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.850
 just look a bit more 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:40.320
 Apply highlighter in the eye angle 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.320
 Now pull a dull lock 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.680
 and the mascara and I do that 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.760
 Twice it with the eyelashes 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.979
 a little bit longer are more volume 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.170
 get the natural make up 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.550
 Looks almost finished was red lips 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.080
 Of course you are not allowed on valentines day 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.229
 I'm missing a dark red 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.229
 lips 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.230
 as in the make up, yes, very natural 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.640
 stay and classic with the red 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.170
 lipstick, I have for a very 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.000
 simple hairstyle decided and easy 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.410
 a side braided job 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.330
 made if you have a few more now 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.039
 strands from the side looks like the 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.610
 look even more romantic and also one 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.610
 a bit playful 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.150
 i have matching the red lipstick 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.959
 me, of course, the fingernails 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.959
 painted red 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.620
 this requires a lot of white chocolate 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.240
 Milk chocolate and everything you want 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.040
 would like to have chocolate on it 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.810
 First we cut the chocolate 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.400
 in very small pieces that prevents 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.850
 the lump education amount the chocolate 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.850
 melts 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:42.169
 If I have the chocolate too small and 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.479
 you can start the white one 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.039
 to melt chocolate first 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.800
 that could be done in the microwave or 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:51.680
 even in a water bath now could the 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.939
 white chocolate and easy to occur 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.219
 So a little bit form I am now 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:56.870
 here for the squares it makes the 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:59.960
 best a little thinner it is yet to come 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.920
 another layer on top 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.540
 once the white chocolate is good 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.740
 filled you can already the 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.740
 brown layer makes Romans 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.890
 the chocolate is good on the white 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.600
 so chocolate distribute the form 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.790
 you can already fit in now 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.190

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.600

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.790
 distribute chocolate I have 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.880
 for this cashew nuts for almonds 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:28.390
 hazelnuts coconut flakes and something to and 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.160
 decided to give a special note 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.410

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.210
 chocolate chocolate cool down 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.420
 leave and the result looks like this 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.420

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.390

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:44.220
 packaging for you the chocolate in 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.220

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:54.870
