00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
much better but the drawing position

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.680 
much better but the drawing position
well<00:00:56.549> it's<00:00:57.549> just<00:00:57.699> the<00:00:57.999> same<00:00:58.210> as<00:00:58.359> the<00:00:58.479> Elise

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
quicker than our tracking car so we're

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.050 
quicker than our tracking car so we're
left<00:01:46.899> with<00:01:47.109> a<00:01:47.170> simple<00:01:47.649> question<00:01:48.159> is<00:01:48.549> this

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
left with a simple question is this

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.359 
left with a simple question is this
really<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.600> Lotus<00:01:50.109> you<00:01:50.799> could<00:01:50.979> take<00:01:51.159> on<00:01:51.310> a

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
really the Lotus you could take on a

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:52.410 
really the Lotus you could take on a
long<00:01:51.549> journey

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
long journey

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.719 
long journey
there's<00:01:52.869> no<00:01:53.049> doubt<00:01:53.080> it<00:01:53.530> it's<00:01:54.040> great<00:01:54.430> fun<00:01:54.670> to

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
there's no doubt it it's great fun to

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.149 
there's no doubt it it's great fun to
drive<00:01:55.060> with<00:01:55.299> its<00:01:55.420> mid-engine<00:01:56.049> layout<00:01:56.159> the

drive with its mid-engine layout the

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.020 
drive with its mid-engine layout the
engine<00:01:57.520> is<00:01:57.759> most<00:01:58.240> certainly<00:01:59.460> been<00:02:00.460> tuned<00:02:00.790> in<00:02:00.970> a

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
engine is most certainly been tuned in a

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.929 
engine is most certainly been tuned in a
way<00:02:01.180> that<00:02:01.390> is<00:02:01.479> better<00:02:02.189> for<00:02:03.189> longer<00:02:03.520> journeys

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
way that is better for longer journeys

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.050 
way that is better for longer journeys
it's<00:02:04.180> more<00:02:04.360> talking<00:02:04.990> it's<00:02:05.649> not<00:02:05.799> as<00:02:06.009> harsh<00:02:06.700> as
