volcana as well in my opinion they are

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.360 
volcana as well in my opinion they are

the more we see these things in they're
gonna<00:03:24.880> go<00:03:25.120> unexplained<00:03:25.750> this<00:03:26.739> would<00:03:26.919> go<00:03:27.040> down

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
gonna go unexplained this would go down

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
that's all we know until somebody can

that's all we know until somebody can

these things to where we really get some
