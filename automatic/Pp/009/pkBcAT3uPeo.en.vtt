00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
don't even care the gameplay walkthrough

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.780 
don't even care the gameplay walkthrough
on<00:00:37.380> such<00:00:37.710> as<00:00:37.800> what<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:37.950> please<00:00:38.100> have<00:00:38.280> fun<00:00:38.550> I

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
think that's probably the best way that

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.000 
think that's probably the best way that
cuz<00:00:41.550> I've<00:00:41.940> sort<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.750> been<00:00:42.930> enjoying<00:00:43.530> public<00:00:43.920> I

cuz I've sort of been enjoying public I

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.850 
cuz I've sort of been enjoying public I
bet<00:00:44.160> more<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:45.500> because<00:00:46.500> I've<00:00:46.620> not<00:00:46.739> been

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
we'll see what it was and i'll probably

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.130 
we'll see what it was and i'll probably
continue<00:01:20.640> doing<00:01:20.790> if<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.119> does<00:01:21.240> well<00:01:21.509> if<00:01:21.810> not

then i'll probably just pause it now and
then<00:01:24.590> and<00:01:25.590> then<00:01:25.860> i'll<00:01:26.159> just<00:01:26.189> sweat

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640
