00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 good the red and black team sees gone 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.160
 keeps the first part that passes 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.140
 the second time I do not remember very 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.790
 similar in the dynamics the best 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.120
 controller of the actions of the team 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.760
 Argentinian 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.119
 he really needed greater precision 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.550
 the manatee team suffered flames in this 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.130
 part defense always he kept the 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.420
 order however it finally broke 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.520
 after this very good opportunity 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.960
 that had valencia perhaps the best 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:33.350
 offensive play created by the team 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.329
 Manudo in a court where they marked him 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.489
 very well they made the best moment of 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.040
 red and black team together with the score 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.079
 that will invalidate it was chaves 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.600
 really a very good move if 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.149
 But I gave him 421 as we did 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.440
 anticipate if they go with the whole front 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.379
 patrick pemberton who was of the 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.329
 main figures is from that box 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.280
 Costa Rican and it's going to come 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.039
 then the first entry of the 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.199
 73 minute commitment 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.510
 that go to the arrival of figueroa as 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.829
 connects with the maxi rodríguez that later 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.689
 to run 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.950
 if they put a lot of attention on a 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:11.000
 color of very good displacements 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.649
 I was in a rush, I was back 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.409
 out to run back to receive 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.960
 the ball or in this one that does the reverse of 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.500
 back forward take away two 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.210
 brands and that's how you get out of football because 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.369
 there is when the first pass maybe the 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.159
 first and then it would be about it 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:31.039
 hook up there and there's a cost martín 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.890
 is the player who tries to hook him 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:36.890
 but very absurd defines very well the 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.229
 footballer in his dream comeback we can 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.610
 tell them that for this player there would be 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.560
 to see if he's dreamed of it but he's very 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.259
 good for fans who receive 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.240
 the reward and the hope that 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.880
 can get very good dividends with 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.490
 the maxi Rodríguez and then alajuelense 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.130
 it cost him the clearance of the ball in the 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.899
 area at some times and in others 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.979
 circumstances is the ball but 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.509
 is not no I can not stand lionel vangioni 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.580
 I was putting in four minutes 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.819
 they practically cooked this game of 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.750
 the Argentines 74 and 78 the minutes of 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.820
 goal 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.490
 he made the pemberton attempt but it was already 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.080
 very difficult to get to that shot and a 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.730
 bit of luck also for a detour and 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.580
 of kevin sancho that the ball also 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.740
 ends at the bottom of the strings 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.840
 in this second entry and it was missing 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.030
 very little was missing just 13 minutes to 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.130
 to make the commitment and the box 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.140
 of the Juarez because I can not do much 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.110
 in front of the attack but yes in 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.940
 this move also the last one follows 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.640
 being a very good experience for me 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.459
 these parties for institutions 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.470
 the national teams could 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.090
 repeat them often earn hours 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.820
 of experience in handling the ball 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.239
 in the game pressure in order so many 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.239
 good things
