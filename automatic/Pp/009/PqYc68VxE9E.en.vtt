um<00:00:13.679> basically<00:00:14.670> this<00:00:15.570> solves<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.139> dilemma<00:00:16.260> of

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
um basically this solves the dilemma of

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.980 
um basically this solves the dilemma of
if<00:00:17.310> you've<00:00:17.490> ever<00:00:17.670> wanted<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.300> use<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.779> nether

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
if you've ever wanted to use the nether

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.630 
if you've ever wanted to use the nether
to<00:00:19.080> fast<00:00:19.650> travel<00:00:19.890> between<00:00:20.130> two<00:00:20.430> different

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
to fast travel between two different

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.420 
to fast travel between two different
locations<00:00:21.330> but<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.439> nether<00:00:22.619> portals<00:00:23.039> kind<00:00:23.310> of

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
locations but the nether portals kind of

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.670 
locations but the nether portals kind of
just<00:00:23.670> appear<00:00:24.180> wherever<00:00:24.420> they<00:00:24.600> want<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.080> maybe

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
just appear wherever they want and maybe

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.570 
just appear wherever they want and maybe
you<00:00:25.830> want<00:00:26.039> them<00:00:26.189> in<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.369> certain<00:00:26.640> place<00:00:26.789> and

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
you want them in a certain place and

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.600 
you want them in a certain place and
this<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> way<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:29.970> kind<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:31.219> make<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.369> nether

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
this is a way to kind of make the nether

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.930 
this is a way to kind of make the nether
behave<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.780> way<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:33.930> want<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.730> so<00:00:35.730> you're

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
behave the way you want it to so you're

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.810 
behave the way you want it to so you're
going<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.120> create<00:00:36.360> one<00:00:36.660> portal<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.820> you

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
going to create one portal and you

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.310 
going to create one portal and you
probably<00:00:39.000> don't<00:00:39.210> actually<00:00:39.450> have<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.809> go<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.290> it

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
probably don't actually have to go in it

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.200 
probably don't actually have to go in it
at<00:00:40.500> this<00:00:40.620> point<00:00:40.890> but<00:00:41.520> I'm<00:00:41.640> going<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.059> anyway

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
at this point but I'm going to anyway

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.200 
at this point but I'm going to anyway
just<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.719> kind<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:42.960> get<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.170> lay<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.500> land

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
just to kind of get a lay of the land

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.400 
just to kind of get a lay of the land
it's<00:00:45.210> helpful<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.660> know<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:46.020> when<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.230> go

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
it's helpful to know that when you go

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.619 
it's helpful to know that when you go
through<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:47.129> nether<00:00:47.550> portal<00:00:47.969> you're<00:00:48.390> facing

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
through a nether portal you're facing

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.510 
through a nether portal you're facing
the<00:00:48.899> same<00:00:49.079> direction<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.680> nether<00:00:49.920> that

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
the same direction in the nether that

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.580 
the same direction in the nether that
you<00:00:50.640> were<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.420> real<00:00:51.600> world<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.110> vice

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
you were in the real world and vice

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.060 
you were in the real world and vice
versa

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
versa

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
versa
so<00:00:54.000> if<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.870> are<00:00:55.590> facing<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.219> way<00:00:56.280> now<00:00:56.640> you'll

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
so if you are facing this way now you'll

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.569 
so if you are facing this way now you'll
still<00:00:57.390> be<00:00:57.480> facing<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.829> way<00:00:59.070> in<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
still be facing in this way in the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.910 
still be facing in this way in the
normal<00:00:59.910> world<00:01:00.350> so<00:01:01.350> we're<00:01:01.469> going<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.620> go<00:01:01.739> back

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
normal world so we're going to go back

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.530 
normal world so we're going to go back
out<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.340> normal<00:01:02.699> world<00:01:03.199> and<00:01:05.540> basically

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
out to the normal world and basically

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.880 
out to the normal world and basically
we're<00:01:06.810> working<00:01:06.840> under<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.439> assumption<00:01:07.860> that

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
we're working under the assumption that

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.640 
we're working under the assumption that
hey<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.299> where<00:01:09.960> we've<00:01:10.170> been<00:01:10.409> building

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
hey this is where we've been building

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.800 
hey this is where we've been building
let's<00:01:11.070> just<00:01:11.310> say<00:01:11.490> we<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> house<00:01:12.150> near<00:01:12.479> here

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
let's just say we have a house near here

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.450 
let's just say we have a house near here
this<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.560> where<00:01:13.740> we<00:01:13.830> decided<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.280> make<00:01:14.430> our

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
this is where we decided to make our

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.640 
this is where we decided to make our
another<00:01:14.760> portal<00:01:15.210> we<00:01:15.869> found<00:01:16.110> another<00:01:16.350> cool

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
another portal we found another cool

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.330 
another portal we found another cool
place<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.729> way<00:01:18.060> off<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.659> direction

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
place it's way off in this direction

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.010 
place it's way off in this direction
we're<00:01:20.340> playing<00:01:20.610> survival<00:01:21.360> mode<00:01:21.570> instead<00:01:21.869> of

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
we're playing survival mode instead of

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.679 
we're playing survival mode instead of
creative<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:23.150> we<00:01:24.150> don't<00:01:24.270> want<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.479> have<00:01:24.570> to

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
creative and we don't want to have to

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.109 
creative and we don't want to have to
walk<00:01:24.930> here<00:01:25.380> or<00:01:25.770> take<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> long<00:01:26.280> minecart<00:01:26.880> ride

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.660 
walk here or take a long minecart ride
or<00:01:27.450> something<00:01:27.810> every<00:01:28.710> time<00:01:28.740> we<00:01:29.220> want<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.549> go

negative 406 approximately you could

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.440 
negative 406 approximately you could
round<00:02:23.100> that<00:02:23.310> up<00:02:23.430> if<00:02:23.580> you<00:02:23.610> wanted<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.150> really

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
round that up if you wanted to it really

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.580 
round that up if you wanted to it really
doesn't<00:02:24.750> matter<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:25.020> doesn't<00:02:25.050> have<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.470> be

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
doesn't matter it doesn't have to be

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.940 
doesn't matter it doesn't have to be
exact<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.070> we're<00:02:26.790> at<00:02:26.880> Z<00:02:27.120> coordinate<00:02:28.490> positive

exact and we're at Z coordinate positive
257<00:02:33.110> okay<00:02:34.940> now<00:02:35.940> I'm<00:02:36.120> going<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.600> cut<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.960> video

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
257 okay now I'm going to cut the video

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.020 
257 okay now I'm going to cut the video
for<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.440> moment<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.830> I'm<00:02:38.190> going<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.640> do<00:02:38.790> some

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
for a moment and I'm going to do some

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.949 
for a moment and I'm going to do some
quick<00:02:39.180> math<00:02:39.240> to<00:02:39.690> figure<00:02:39.959> out<00:02:40.170> exactly<00:02:41.959> what

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
quick math to figure out exactly what

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.780 
quick math to figure out exactly what
those<00:02:43.110> numbers<00:02:43.290> are<00:02:43.620> if<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:44.160> were<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.459> divide

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
those numbers are if you were to divide

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.360 
those numbers are if you were to divide
them<00:02:45.090> by<00:02:45.330> eight<00:02:45.590> because<00:02:46.590> remember<00:02:47.040> that

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
them by eight because remember that

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.210 
them by eight because remember that
every<00:02:48.000> block<00:02:48.270> in<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.570> nether<00:02:49.320> is<00:02:49.560> equivalent

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
every block in the nether is equivalent

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.750 
every block in the nether is equivalent
to<00:02:50.540> traveling<00:02:51.540> eight<00:02:51.900> times<00:02:52.260> as<00:02:52.470> far<00:02:52.680> in<00:02:52.950> the

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
to traveling eight times as far in the

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.840 
to traveling eight times as far in the
real<00:02:53.940> world<00:02:54.120> so<00:02:54.750> one<00:02:55.230> moment<00:02:55.530> okay<00:02:56.340> so<00:02:56.580> I<00:02:56.610> did

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
real world so one moment okay so I did

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.280 
real world so one moment okay so I did
the<00:02:56.940> math<00:02:57.030> really<00:02:57.270> quick<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.870> basically

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
the math really quick and I basically

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.920 
the math really quick and I basically
came<00:02:58.590> up<00:02:58.800> with<00:02:59.070> what<00:02:59.310> I<00:02:59.340> decided<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.820> call<00:03:00.060> 50

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
came up with what I decided to call 50

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.180 
came up with what I decided to call 50
and<00:03:01.260> 32<00:03:02.030> so<00:03:03.030> just<00:03:03.780> so<00:03:04.350> that<00:03:04.530> we<00:03:04.620> know<00:03:04.650> that<00:03:04.830> this

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
and 32 so just so that we know that this

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.940 
and 32 so just so that we know that this
is<00:03:05.400> exactly<00:03:05.910> where<00:03:06.510> we<00:03:06.989> made<00:03:07.320> this<00:03:07.530> portal

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
is exactly where we made this portal

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.949 
is exactly where we made this portal
it's<00:03:08.250> right<00:03:08.520> next<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.790> this<00:03:08.970> pit<00:03:09.209> and<00:03:09.690> I'm

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
it's right next to this pit and I'm

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.510 
it's right next to this pit and I'm
going<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.140> place<00:03:10.320> two<00:03:10.530> torches<00:03:11.070> right<00:03:11.190> beside

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
going to place two torches right beside

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.490 
going to place two torches right beside
it<00:03:11.550> we're<00:03:12.360> going<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.510> go<00:03:12.660> back<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:13.230> our

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
it we're going to go back to our

it we're going to go back to our
original<00:03:14.100> portal<00:03:14.910> now<00:03:15.870> don't<00:03:16.340> remember<00:03:17.340> you

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
don't want to go back into that portal

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.800 
don't want to go back into that portal
behind<00:03:19.799> us<00:03:20.040> you<00:03:20.790> want<00:03:21.000> to<00:03:21.120> leave<00:03:21.330> that<00:03:21.570> one

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
alone and go into this portal over here

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.210 
alone and go into this portal over here
the<00:03:27.030> first<00:03:27.239> one<00:03:27.480> that<00:03:27.600> we<00:03:27.720> made<00:03:28.190> which<00:03:29.190> is

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
the first one that we made which is

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.670 
the first one that we made which is
right<00:03:29.459> there<00:03:29.959> this<00:03:30.959> is<00:03:31.019> going<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.320> be<00:03:31.440> a<00:03:31.470> pain

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
right there this is going to be a pain

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.840 
right there this is going to be a pain
in<00:03:31.769> the<00:03:31.860> butt<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.100> first<00:03:32.310> time<00:03:32.519> you<00:03:32.610> do<00:03:32.730> this

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
in the butt the first time you do this

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.310 
in the butt the first time you do this
especially<00:03:33.120> if<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.600> distance<00:03:33.989> is<00:03:34.140> really

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
especially if the distance is really

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.539 
especially if the distance is really
long<00:03:34.620> because<00:03:34.980> you're<00:03:35.100> going<00:03:35.220> to<00:03:35.280> have<00:03:35.400> to

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
long because you're going to have to

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.090 
long because you're going to have to
walk<00:03:35.760> all<00:03:35.970> this<00:03:36.120> way<00:03:36.180> back<00:03:36.799> but<00:03:37.799> it'll<00:03:38.010> be

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
walk all this way back but it'll be

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.070 
walk all this way back but it'll be
worth<00:03:38.280> it<00:03:38.459> we're<00:03:39.269> going<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:39.450> go<00:03:39.570> back<00:03:39.720> into<00:03:39.959> our

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
worth it we're going to go back into our

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.250 
worth it we're going to go back into our
portal

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.839 

now<00:03:46.260> our<00:03:46.440> numbers<00:03:46.800> when<00:03:47.040> divided<00:03:47.489> by<00:03:47.610> eight

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
now our numbers when divided by eight

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.670 
now our numbers when divided by eight
were<00:03:48.420> 50<00:03:48.900> and<00:03:49.049> 30<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.830> approximately<00:03:50.700> so<00:03:51.690> we're

divide it by eight go to that part of
the<00:05:02.320> nether<00:05:02.530> build<00:05:02.949> your<00:05:03.130> portal<00:05:03.460> and<00:05:03.610> you

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
the nether build your portal and you

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.409 
the nether build your portal and you
will<00:05:04.570> appear<00:05:04.870> right<00:05:05.020> here<00:05:05.850> at<00:05:06.850> the<00:05:07.030> very<00:05:07.060> same

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419

portal that you built here the reason

portal that you built here the reason
that<00:05:09.880> this<00:05:10.030> works<00:05:10.270> is<00:05:10.630> because<00:05:10.750> when<00:05:11.260> you<00:05:11.560> are

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
that this works is because when you are

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.490 
that this works is because when you are
