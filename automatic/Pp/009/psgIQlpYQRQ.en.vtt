 despite the soft 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:41.310
 I talked about how that little person tumbles

 go away companions please 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:22.229
 very well difficult easy easy and a 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.880
 little relaxed as much more than the 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.350
 time to be much more than passed ages 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.540
 right now we are going to listen to the 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.330
 opinion of our jury we begin with 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.060
 fernando arms to big sounding friends 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.910
 Luis Carrillo really funny 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.740
 that I enjoyed your presentation I 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.010
 only I recommend you while more 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:44.880
 natural you leave is going to be much better is 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:47.280
 say is the naturalness of the 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.010
 gestures the naturalness of the touching 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.470
 in sensual is going to be much better so that 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:55.189
 also go with the singing and have better 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:59.249
 imitation in the voice 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:05:01.590
 thank you very much fernando in your 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:04.199
 opinion please at the beginning we left 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.599
 a little bit shy after you grab 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:08.580
 security there were movements 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:11.219
 which are characteristic of your character 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.650
 vocally if you have to be careful with 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:14.939
 the detuning and in the times and 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.860
 precisely in the parts in which 

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:19.409
 have to sing well well sharp well 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.789
 addiction squared because you no longer 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:22.650
 I understood a lot you're a little more 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:26.300
 worried that where was the 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.879
 coffee and touch you and everything else 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.069
 I know it's your second presentation I think 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:33.379
 you 're on the right track you're fine 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:36.090
 You must hear what he did the jury and 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:38.370
 you have to raise it later in the essay 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:41.310
 thanks to mari carmen lord ricardo 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.230
 your opinion will please 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.450
 it seems to me that you have a ring of 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.580
 very similar voice and we have been telling you 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:50.040
 from the beginning and that is also one 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.080
 of your great strengths also what 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.520
 listened however that has to 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.890
 be supported by a series of things 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.720
 techniques that I have lacked today 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:00.270
 listened to low volume as if not 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.090
 you had support and air in the serious and not 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:06.390
 I understood you but more important than that 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:09.000
 is to concentrate on telling me what is 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:11.700
 telling the story of the song and you 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.380
 I saw more concentrated in which the 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.240
 position of the arms in what there was 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.580
 what to do in the movements that in 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.080
 tell me what the song says it is 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.870
 the most important thing is what 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.480
 finally transmits and that part has 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.070
 lacking in that sense I did not feel much 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.350
 connection neither with history nor with what 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:30.450
 that you were singing there was also a 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.280
 technical issue of times that you have to 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.990
 handle I think that also the subject the 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.980
 movements has to see and here I'm going to 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.660
 enter is an observation that is 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:40.490
 highly technical about handling 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:43.260
 Corporal Miguelo has made a career 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:46.290
 basically his whole life based on the 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.920
 ambiguity and ambiguity precisely 

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.770
 corp 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:52.740
 it really is based on that we can not 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:55.230
 define exactly the character of the 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.300
 gender through their movements to 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:59.190
 you have to do the gesture without accenting 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.410
 what and I think that you are putting a 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.900
 more accent grade by repeating the gesture 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:06.210
 and that means there's no ambiguity and what 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.520
 makes it less interesting scenicly 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.980
 I think you have to recover that 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.930
 ambiguity recover that subtlety and of 

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.880
 that form will appear light miguel in the 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:17.160
 stage today's presentation to 

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.990
 I do not like very well very many 

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:23.420
 thanks to the jury asked him to please 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:23.420
 take a seat with your classmates
