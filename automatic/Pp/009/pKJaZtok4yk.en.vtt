00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
sure it's snug and pump a little bit to

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.200 
sure it's snug and pump a little bit to
give<00:00:09.630> some<00:00:09.809> pressure<00:00:10.050> in<00:00:10.349> there<00:00:10.940> and<00:00:11.940> here's

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
give some pressure in there and here's

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.640 
give some pressure in there and here's
the<00:00:12.300> milk<00:00:13.639> and<00:00:14.639> it<00:00:14.730> just<00:00:14.940> pours<00:00:15.440> there's<00:00:16.440> no

dirt<00:00:16.980> but<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:17.699> like<00:00:17.910> about<00:00:18.060> this<00:00:18.359> system

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
dirt but I like about this system

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.200 
dirt but I like about this system
because<00:00:19.380> she's<00:00:19.770> been<00:00:19.980> thoroughly<00:00:20.250> washed

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
there's no hairs that get into the milk

I<00:00:23.640> don't<00:00:23.910> have<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.210> filter<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:27.109> start

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
I don't have to filter it start

I don't have to filter it start
discussion<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.920> moment<00:00:29.250> here<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:30.050> want<00:00:31.050> to

discussion in a moment here you want to

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.630 
discussion in a moment here you want to
make<00:00:31.140> sure<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.710> never<00:00:31.890> go<00:00:32.160> higher<00:00:32.369> than

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
make sure that you never go higher than

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.940 
make sure that you never go higher than
ten<00:00:32.880> times<00:00:33.090> with<00:00:33.329> pressure<00:00:36.410> as<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.559> can<00:00:37.739> see

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
ten times with pressure as you can see

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.730 
ten times with pressure as you can see
it's<00:00:38.100> just<00:00:38.219> stuff<00:00:38.700> flowing<00:00:39.149> freely

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:44.740 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.460

we have a lot of flies so I keep I keep

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.860 
we have a lot of flies so I keep I keep
a<00:00:47.740> hold<00:00:47.770> on<00:00:48.130> it<00:00:48.340> just<00:00:49.090> in<00:00:49.270> case<00:00:49.510> you<00:00:49.750> would

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
a hold on it just in case you would

a hold on it just in case you would
accidentally<00:00:50.500> kick<00:00:50.830> it<00:00:51.390> what's<00:00:52.390> the<00:00:52.540> flies

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
accidentally kick it what's the flies

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.840 
accidentally kick it what's the flies
that<00:00:52.810> are<00:00:53.110> bothering<00:00:53.380> him<00:00:53.800> and<00:00:54.040> while<00:00:54.700> I'm

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
she eats twice a day this is just some

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.000 
she eats twice a day this is just some
16%<00:01:01.870> protein<00:01:02.310> it's<00:01:03.310> sweet<00:01:03.640> seed<00:01:04.860> she<00:01:05.860> actually

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
16% protein it's sweet seed she actually

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.780 
16% protein it's sweet seed she actually
loves<00:01:06.490> that<00:01:06.700> the<00:01:06.970> breeder<00:01:07.540> used<00:01:07.930> to<00:01:08.580> mix<00:01:09.580> in

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
loves that the breeder used to mix in

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.620 
loves that the breeder used to mix in
some<00:01:09.820> sunflower<00:01:10.570> seed<00:01:10.930> and<00:01:11.230> I<00:01:11.380> found<00:01:11.740> that<00:01:11.980> she

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
some sunflower seed and I found that she

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.570 
some sunflower seed and I found that she
actually<00:01:13.630> sorts<00:01:14.140> it<00:01:14.260> out<00:01:14.350> and<00:01:14.710> she<00:01:14.890> stores<00:01:15.400> out

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
actually sorts it out and she stores out

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.150 
actually sorts it out and she stores out
the<00:01:15.760> sunflower<00:01:16.240> seeds<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:17.770> it<00:01:17.830> looks<00:01:18.010> like

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
the sunflower seeds so it looks like

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.920 
the sunflower seeds so it looks like
we're<00:01:18.340> done<00:01:18.520> also<00:01:18.729> on<00:01:19.030> this<00:01:19.210> side<00:01:19.479> I've<00:01:19.750> got

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
we're done also on this side I've got

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
we're done also on this side I've got
1/2<00:01:20.200> my<00:01:20.500> mason<00:01:20.920> jar<00:01:22.020> like<00:01:23.020> what<00:01:23.560> I'm<00:01:23.650> gonna<00:01:23.740> do

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
1/2 my mason jar like what I'm gonna do

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.570 
1/2 my mason jar like what I'm gonna do
here<00:01:24.220> is<00:01:24.250> I'm<00:01:24.460> gonna<00:01:24.610> let<00:01:25.510> go<00:01:25.690> some<00:01:25.930> pressure

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
here is I'm gonna let go some pressure

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:34.770 
here is I'm gonna let go some pressure
and<00:01:27.580> just<00:01:27.970> try<00:01:28.600> it<00:01:28.660> a<00:01:28.900> little<00:01:29.050> bit<00:01:29.229> more

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:42.359 

sometimes<00:01:35.780> it<00:01:35.960> gets<00:01:36.170> her<00:01:36.290> going<00:01:36.470> again

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.069 

people<00:01:43.360> are<00:01:43.450> about<00:01:43.600> done<00:01:45.780> let's<00:01:46.780> try<00:01:47.020> the

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:47.079 
people are about done let's try the

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:47.880 
people are about done let's try the
other<00:01:47.200> side

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
other side

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.550 
other side
this<00:01:48.220> little<00:01:48.549> girlies<00:01:48.939> pressure<00:01:49.299> button<00:01:49.720> and

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
this little girlies pressure button and

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.149 
this little girlies pressure button and
two<00:01:51.430> cup<00:01:51.700> just<00:01:51.909> flicks<00:01:52.240> out<00:01:52.420> switch<00:01:52.780> out<00:01:53.020> some

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:05.670 

more<00:01:57.159> coming<00:01:57.340> on<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.640> other<00:01:57.759> side

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.630 

and<00:02:06.130> I<00:02:06.250> think<00:02:06.310> that's<00:02:06.640> it

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.850 

once<00:02:12.240> again<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.750> see<00:02:12.900> my<00:02:13.050> little<00:02:13.520> hand<00:02:14.520> pump<00:02:14.760> I

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
once again you see my little hand pump I

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.320 
once again you see my little hand pump I
bought<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:17.040> online<00:02:17.190> if<00:02:17.610> you're<00:02:17.790> interested

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330
