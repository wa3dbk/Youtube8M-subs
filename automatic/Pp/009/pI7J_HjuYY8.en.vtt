 that you are quite well and today I bring you 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.990
 one step pretty curious textures 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:21.439
 for dragon ball z fans are going to 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.739
 love good let's create a world 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:27.110
 which is called the bbc of bz sorry is a 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:29.500
 teaching in a little what as are the 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.500
 armor 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.529
 what is different no no 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:44.170
 you see at first glance that instead of 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.170
 this we want to goku 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.460
 let's catch all 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.460
 Diamond 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.860
 they start a little we go 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.370
 in signs all the armors 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.090
 do not try the armor I do not know if more 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.090
 they have 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.770
 you see that there is a difference in 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.770
 armor 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.040
 you see that there is quite a difference in the 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.040
 armor this is the diamond 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.610
 and good is 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.610
 it's that simple no 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.540
 ace 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.050
 the Mayans 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.240
 it's pretty cool it's the same but 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:54.040
 and the black 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.040
 It's pretty cool 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.850
 We already teach the pearls because 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.580
 we know that they are two equal 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.570
 we are going to take the rest of the 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.570
 armor that are left 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.970
 leather 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.580
 fire 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.690
 leather iron and 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.690
 and as if prayed 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:33.599
 and well here we have to say goodbye 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.599
 the meshes 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.080
 and we went to 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.810
 we went to this is 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.750
 this 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.640
 It seems pretty simple to me I do not know 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.640
 who is this costume I do not know if he has it 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.390
 one in the series 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.390
 without seeing it 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.280
 although that is so incumbent 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.290
 good 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.290
 here 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.170
 mmm 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:45.150
 it takes me 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.150
 we will also teach iron helmet 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.580
 So, astronaut, you look like 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.220
 this is good 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.760
 now touch this 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.970
 It is also quite simple as it is already 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.360
 is issuing 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.900
 It's not easy because it's the weakest 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.319
 what is in main craft 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:20.519
 there you see it 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:20.519
 this and now well 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.470
 for my opinion 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:34.380
 well this one called it pretty as you see 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.380
 pretty moron 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.440
 we see 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:47.220
 I do not know if in some blocks but not 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:50.529
 there is a difference to me they have said yes 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:53.069
 but as I saw there was no 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:53.069
 all right 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:02.500
 I hope you liked it and soon 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:06.380
 we would have another pack of textures of 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:09.400
 adventure time and good 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.400
 and that's all 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:15.949
 and not be here 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.240
