00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.499
 prepare a rich lemon steak is very 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:15.039
 Easy is a healthy and nutritious recipe 

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:17.530
 It is also very low in fat then it is 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:20.290
 ideal for Lent or simply for 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.710
 if we want to lose a few pounds for 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:26.020
 this is going to need fish fillet 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.390
 equity in a steak we're going to 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.320
 I also need lemon that I already have 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.320
 sliced â€‹â€‹lemon 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.239
 if the protest washes lives infected 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.530

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.910
 Salt 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.340
 and olive oil 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.290
 the first thing we are going to do but 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.540
 they also know that it was happening to me 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.330
 We're going to need aluminum foil and a 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.380
 refractory that we can put in the oven 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:59.900
 the first thing we are going to do 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:04.120
 and put our steaks 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.120
 asked of the line 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.290
 remember that the blessing always goes 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.750
 into 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:19.890
 and we are going to put 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.890
 excuse us let's put slices 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.600
 and we are going to put some slices of tomato 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:48.240
 let's put our steak 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:52.380
 we are going to put salt that 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.810
 you seek and we are going to place 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.180
 a soy this foundation 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.880
 before cilantro I forget I do not know 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:04.100
 what am I thinking we are going to put 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.100
 just a touch of olive oil 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.550
 and now we are going to deliver our 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.550
 fillet 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.300
 we are going to seal it very well 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:38.060
 and we are going to put this steak 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.060
 in our salary that we already have 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.680
 so I stay doing the rest 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.799
 steaks 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.590
 to put them in the oven and I have here my 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:52.489
 steaks what I'm going to do is 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:55.430
 put them in the oven for about 5 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:58.519
 minutes or until they are at the point 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.790
