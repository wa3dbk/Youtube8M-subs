building<00:00:25.490> okay<00:00:26.490> my<00:00:27.480> first<00:00:27.810> advice<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.470> at

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
building okay my first advice is at

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.260 
building okay my first advice is at
least<00:00:29.670> have<00:00:30.660> 25<00:00:31.140> energies<00:00:31.669> that<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.000> most

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
least have 25 energies that is the most

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.410 
least have 25 energies that is the most
important<00:00:34.020> there<00:00:34.260> it's<00:00:34.980> gonna<00:00:35.130> map<00:00:35.309> at<00:00:35.520> 25

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
important there it's gonna map at 25

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.610 
important there it's gonna map at 25
energies<00:00:36.840> it's<00:00:37.440> what<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.680> need<00:00:37.860> at<00:00:38.520> least<00:00:38.670> I

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
energies it's what you need at least I

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.299 
energies it's what you need at least I
use<00:00:40.620> number<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.270> always<00:00:42.270> have<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.809> couple

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
use number to always have a couple

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.840 
use number to always have a couple
strong<00:00:44.510> basics<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:46.469> see<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:47.370> gives<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.820> a

good at math you either start seeing

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.160 
good at math you either start seeing
them<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:50.039> lot<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.399> cards<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:51.149> let<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.960> pick

it's an awesome car which work who basic
so<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.280> have<00:01:08.400> basics<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:08.970> always<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> good

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
so you have basics is always a good

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.240 
so you have basics is always a good
strong<00:01:09.750> basics<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:11.340> second<00:01:11.670> thing<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.420> um

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250

line goes like now it's a very useful
thing<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.310> have<00:01:35.400> second<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.329> all<00:01:36.420> don't<00:01:37.110> have

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
thing to have second of all don't have

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.330 
thing to have second of all don't have
morning<00:01:37.890> two<00:01:38.220> types<00:01:38.549> in<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.909> deck<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:40.340> just

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
morning two types in the deck that just

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.359 
morning two types in the deck that just
makes<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.850> too<00:01:42.720> big<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.380> just<00:01:43.829> causes<00:01:44.040> issues

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
makes it too big and just causes issues

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.600 
makes it too big and just causes issues
so<00:01:45.240> two<00:01:45.329> types<00:01:45.840> maximum<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.649> like<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.430> get<00:01:47.549> as

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
so two types maximum I like to get as

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.749 
so two types maximum I like to get as
normal<00:01:48.000> type<00:01:48.240> seeing<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.220> mean<00:01:50.490> and

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
normal type seeing that it is I mean and

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.789 
normal type seeing that it is I mean and
like<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.540> doesn't<00:01:51.869> bother<00:01:51.990> your<00:01:52.320> deck<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:52.560> you

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
like it doesn't bother your deck so you

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.350 
like it doesn't bother your deck so you
can<00:01:52.950> only<00:01:53.070> have<00:01:53.280> 100<00:01:53.670> one<00:01:53.939> type<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.119> energy

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
can only have 100 one type of energy

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.990 
can only have 100 one type of energy
which<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.780> perfect<00:01:55.259> that's<00:01:55.890> why<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.100> use<00:01:56.369> you

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
which is perfect that's why I use you

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.219 
which is perfect that's why I use you
know<00:01:57.060> I'm<00:01:57.149> okay<00:01:57.420> it's<00:01:57.570> not<00:01:57.689> gonna<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:58.049> that

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
know I'm okay it's not gonna have that
