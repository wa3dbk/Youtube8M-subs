00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.980
 unlike normal caramel and it is 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.260
 quite thick and the typical taste 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.789
 that of candy

 to prepare mourinho caramel 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.769
 first of all search and sugar e 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.589
 precisely 175 g then need 120 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:46.129
 milliliters of whipping cream 100 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:49.129
 milliliters water programs and 10 grams 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:56.449
 of possibly salted butter 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:58.059

 then pour over the water and stir 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.800
 with a teaspoon to melt it 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:09.740
 sugar let the mixture boil a 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.899
 moderate flame without mixing if 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.509
 you need to rotate the pan not 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:16.820
 as soon as the water starts to evaporate it 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.590
 sugar will start caramelizing if on 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.550
 you will notice the edges of the pot 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.200

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.149
 Celsius 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:38.149

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.800

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.300

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.459

 stir in all the cream, turn on the 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.349
 fire always moderate and let it stay for 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:03.020
 a few more minutes until 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:05.780
