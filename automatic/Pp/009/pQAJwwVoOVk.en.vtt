so<00:01:16.830> there<00:01:16.950> are<00:01:16.979> two<00:01:17.100> bits<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.369> code<00:01:17.580> obviously

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
so there are two bits of code obviously

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.850 
so there are two bits of code obviously
we<00:01:18.090> know<00:01:18.150> are<00:01:18.360> don't<00:01:18.630> use<00:01:18.720> taxes<00:01:19.080> far<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.740> is

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
for this sample anyway and then we have

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.319 
for this sample anyway and then we have
two<00:01:40.890> options<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.340> top<00:01:41.520> one<00:01:41.700> here<00:01:42.619> will<00:01:43.619> remove
