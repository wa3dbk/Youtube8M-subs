00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.270
 good europa league returns to the scene and 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.900
 there are three Spanish teams fighting for 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.019
 advance in the competition 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.320
 seville times a derby is played 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.910
 Sevillian in Europe sounds fancy but 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.490
 there was more 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.160
 last week on the last day the 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.150
 Betis won against the getafe then 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.910
 it has to be 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.010
 Well, well, the action 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.129
 really is that also in Seville he won 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.399
 out against almería and in almería so 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:37.170
 so much for a week the swords 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.329
 for all the high is not that the Betis and 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.210
 He has recovered energy and weapons 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.399
 It is said that it was abused 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.249
 lately by the referees and be 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.350
 attentive to the thing and I think it is 

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:52.809
 true is true but I always think 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.570
 that those coincidences coincidences 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.460
 I would not like to talk about campaign though 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.500
 yes it is true that the most faithful béticos 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.409
 they talk about that precisely that at a 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.920
 campaign against betis I do not believe it 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:09.490
 but apparently it is much better 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.909
 and Seville is a very shock 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:16.000
 important still and back in europe without 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:19.810
 have to catch a plane you can go in 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.149
 destination so much the going in the return then 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.429
 my friends live who know what my 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:27.640
 forecast for the game let's go 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:31.720
 forward with a few odds the victory 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.929
 it would pay 50 euro and we are always 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.799
 talking about the 95 minutes of the match 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:43.149
 the tie four euros 10 the victory the 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:47.250
 betis pays six euros 25 it seems a lot 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:49.890
 but I think that in that first envite 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.320
 it's a favorite I understand that it's a derby that 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.080
 anything can happen and it would not be 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.610
 a tremendous surprise the betis channel 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:02.400
 but I think he does not pay a 50 euro but 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.010
 I think little thing little thing for the 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.590
 commitment that I 'm seeing then 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.860
 the other party 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.350
 in Bulgaria plays the brave cons 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.959
 serious then let's make a 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.470
 combined I think it's going to win 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:23.670
 against the betis but that pays me one euro 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:26.130
 50 Well look at the valence I saw this end 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.190
 week and has a knife between 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.220
 teeth and are already seeing a thousand 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.010
 a hundred maybe his game was not so 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.709
 brilliant the combinations but I saw the 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.560
 footballers with the batteries put and I 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.420
 I think the valence in Canada in 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.910
 bulgaria let's go forward with the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.520
 quotes the victory of flush degree in 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.830
 house at home pay three euros 30 is 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.920
 much especially when at home the 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.790
 tie 340 and the victory of valencia 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.780
 a miserable 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.790
 10 euros considering that I had 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.670
 to travel to Bulgaria and Betis to see if 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.969
 do not put something in the food or something 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.969
 210 seems to me little now but I am 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:13.500
 convinced that valencia will win and that 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:17.519
 seville canada that accumulated that double 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.799
 put for three euros 15 then 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:23.730
 we are talking about it going to make a 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:27.269
 bet that seville wins at home and 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.069
 valencia out and that gives me back three of 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.060
 the three euros 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.060
 every euro played
