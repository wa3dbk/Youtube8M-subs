00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.700
 5

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.540
 go guys this is gone so this is 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.380
 against the porsche 918 spyder aulas who 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.930
 has already spat 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.329
 for it because it is the headline say boston 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.890

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.179
 to plant my dead if I do not know 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.079
 olala what is this era of 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:31.200
 Rillious functions here it is under bend 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:33.069
 sick of it turns it turns it turns 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.200
 it's a pity I do not have this 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:38.259
 speed I would have timbaut drif toulon 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.590
 there if I had a little bit of microphone to 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:45.340
 left it's gone we'll let them go 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.689
 closer and closer I amazes me 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.399
 do not move like that it's a little bit 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:50.470
 of challenges at the same time because if I 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.450
 know it but it's going to be funny but who 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.569

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.810

 oula oula holla holla where I have the back 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.280

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.020

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.680
 my part there I know this is the 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.109
 first race when we start with a 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:23.469

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:24.959

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:34.480
 north to disgust I drove well 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.159
 from the beginning you have to be careful 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.719
 because we are pursuing level 4a 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.370

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:41.290
