go slowly and softly on six right now

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.839 
go slowly and softly on six right now
basically<00:02:38.090> you<00:02:38.540> play<00:02:38.950> all<00:02:39.950> sides<00:02:40.159> we<00:02:40.459> just<00:02:40.670> run

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
basically you play all sides we just run

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.140 
basically you play all sides we just run
around<00:02:40.969> and<00:02:41.359> do<00:02:41.510> whatever<00:02:41.749> they<00:02:41.989> want<00:02:43.150> and

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
around and do whatever they want and

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.459 
around and do whatever they want and
right<00:02:44.359> now<00:02:44.480> I'm<00:02:44.540> really<00:02:44.840> not<00:02:44.989> trying<00:02:45.049> to<00:02:45.319> kill

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:45.469 
right now I'm really not trying to kill

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:48.849 
right now I'm really not trying to kill
them<00:02:45.709> so<00:02:46.540> they<00:02:47.540> don't<00:02:47.719> play<00:02:47.989> the<00:02:48.019> bomb<00:02:48.349> at<00:02:48.650> all

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:48.859 
them so they don't play the bomb at all

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:55.790 
them so they don't play the bomb at all
it's<00:02:49.310> fun<00:02:50.469> and<00:02:51.469> really

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.100 

so<00:02:56.800> that's<00:02:57.340> about<00:02:57.640> it<00:02:57.670> in<00:02:58.599> Search<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:59.080> Destroy

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
so that's about it in Search and Destroy

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.330 
so that's about it in Search and Destroy
is<00:02:59.890> actually<00:03:00.310> kind<00:03:00.520> of<00:03:00.580> hard<00:03:00.819> to<00:03:00.910> do<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.480> board

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
is actually kind of hard to do the board

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.120 
is actually kind of hard to do the board
so<00:03:03.340> that's<00:03:03.760> it<00:03:03.910> Oh
