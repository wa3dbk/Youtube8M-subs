I<00:02:53.760> do<00:02:53.880> is

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:11.100 

just<00:02:57.080> I<00:02:57.319> take<00:02:57.680> it<00:02:57.890> to<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.430> base<00:02:59.770> and<00:03:01.810> wiggle

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.940 

and<00:03:12.520> I<00:03:13.520> don't<00:03:13.850> get<00:03:14.390> on<00:03:14.570> the<00:03:14.780> waterline<00:03:15.110> like<00:03:15.740> if

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
and I don't get on the waterline like if

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.620 
and I don't get on the waterline like if
you<00:03:16.100> look<00:03:16.310> down<00:03:17.860> in<00:03:18.860> a<00:03:19.550> mirror<00:03:19.880> like<00:03:20.180> I'm<00:03:20.330> doing

now you can actually see where your
waterline<00:03:23.030> is<00:03:23.420> so<00:03:24.050> you<00:03:24.140> don't<00:03:24.560> poke<00:03:24.950> yourself

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130
