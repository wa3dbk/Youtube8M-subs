00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
okay in this lesson we're going to learn

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.630 
okay in this lesson we're going to learn
how<00:00:03.210> to<00:00:03.240> record<00:00:03.810> and<00:00:04.140> run<00:00:04.500> macros<00:00:05.040> using<00:00:05.549> the

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
how to record and run macros using the

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.049 
how to record and run macros using the
SolidWorks<00:00:06.299> macro<00:00:06.870> recorder<00:00:07.490> now<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.550> macro

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
SolidWorks macro recorder now the macro

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.560 
SolidWorks macro recorder now the macro
recorder<00:00:09.090> L<00:00:09.719> gives<00:00:10.260> us<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.500> means<00:00:10.740> of

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
recorder L gives us the means of

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.230 
recorder L gives us the means of
automating<00:00:12.570> simple<00:00:12.929> tasks<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.500> Saltworks<00:00:14.240> so

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
automating simple tasks and Saltworks so

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.630 
automating simple tasks and Saltworks so
give<00:00:15.900> you<00:00:15.990> brief<00:00:16.199> demo<00:00:16.500> let's<00:00:17.369> open<00:00:17.520> up

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
give you brief demo let's open up

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.960 
give you brief demo let's open up
SolidWorks<00:00:18.560> and<00:00:19.560> go<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.740> tools<00:00:21.619> macro<00:00:22.970> can

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
SolidWorks and go to tools macro can

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.509 
SolidWorks and go to tools macro can
record<00:00:24.830> now<00:00:25.830> at<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:26.070> point<00:00:26.250> in<00:00:26.400> time

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
record now at this point in time

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.910 
record now at this point in time
SolidWorks<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.599> recording<00:00:28.410> every<00:00:28.740> action

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
SolidWorks is recording every action

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.310 
SolidWorks is recording every action
that<00:00:29.099> we<00:00:29.279> make<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:30.330> what<00:00:30.449> we<00:00:30.510> can<00:00:30.630> do<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:31.019> and

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
that we make and what we can do is and

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.410 
that we make and what we can do is and
save<00:00:31.830> these<00:00:32.040> actions<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.700> play<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:32.880> back<00:00:33.149> at<00:00:33.390> a

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
save these actions and play it back at a

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.530 
save these actions and play it back at a
future<00:00:33.719> time<00:00:34.760> so<00:00:35.760> what<00:00:36.120> we're<00:00:36.210> going<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.360> do<00:00:36.450> is

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
future time so what we're going to do is

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.290 
future time so what we're going to do is
actually<00:00:36.719> make<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:37.140> quick<00:00:37.710> macro<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.430> very

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
actually make a quick macro a very

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.010 
actually make a quick macro a very
simple<00:00:39.600> one

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
simple one

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.130 
simple one
that<00:00:40.200> will<00:00:40.350> create<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.860> cube<00:00:41.690> so<00:00:42.690> let's<00:00:42.930> go<00:00:43.050> to

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
that will create a cube so let's go to

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.440 
that will create a cube so let's go to
file<00:00:43.850> new<00:00:45.050> new<00:00:46.050> part<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:47.120> let's<00:00:48.120> create<00:00:48.360> a

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
file new new part and let's create a

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.029 
file new new part and let's create a
cube<00:00:48.899> by<00:00:49.230> drawing<00:00:49.800> on<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.520> front<00:00:51.000> plane<00:00:52.039> so

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
cube by drawing on the front plane so

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.209 
cube by drawing on the front plane so
let's<00:00:53.370> draw<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.760> square<00:00:54.590> and<00:00:56.600> extrude<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:58.219> to

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
let's draw a square and extrude it to

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:06.170 
let's draw a square and extrude it to
inches<00:01:03.019> you'll<00:01:04.019> see<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.729> the<00:01:05.729> sketch<00:01:06.000> is

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
inches you'll see that the sketch is

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.300 
inches you'll see that the sketch is
still<00:01:06.390> selected<00:01:06.810> I'll<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.320> click<00:01:07.680> off<00:01:08.010> into

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
still selected I'll just click off into

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.179 
still selected I'll just click off into
empty<00:01:08.549> space<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.820> deselect<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.680> then<00:01:10.680> go

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
empty space to deselect it and then go

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:18.730 
empty space to deselect it and then go
to<00:01:11.250> tools<00:01:12.799> macro<00:01:14.330> and<00:01:15.330> stop<00:01:16.939> at<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.150> point

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
to tools macro and stop at this point

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.499 
to tools macro and stop at this point
the<00:01:19.740> backward<00:01:20.070> recorder<00:01:20.400> has<00:01:20.580> recorded<00:01:21.060> every

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
the backward recorder has recorded every

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.170 
the backward recorder has recorded every
actually<00:01:21.869> made<00:01:22.110> up<00:01:22.350> until<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.280> record<00:01:23.759> from

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
actually made up until the record from

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.240 
actually made up until the record from
the<00:01:24.360> record<00:01:24.450> up<00:01:24.990> until<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.409> point<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.860> we

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
the record up until this point and we

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.730 
the record up until this point and we
are<00:01:26.280> going<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.580> save<00:01:26.820> all<00:01:27.090> these<00:01:27.450> actions<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:28.110> a

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
are going to save all these actions in a

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.300 
are going to save all these actions in a
location<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.689> both<00:01:30.689> are<00:01:30.900> already<00:01:31.470> selected<00:01:31.799> so

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
location I both are already selected so

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:41.020 
location I both are already selected so
I'll<00:01:32.460> just<00:01:32.700> say<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.180> as<00:01:34.189> I<00:01:38.299> can<00:01:39.299> close<00:01:39.540> this

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
I'll just say this as I can close this

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.399 
I'll just say this as I can close this
and<00:01:42.030> what<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.180> can<00:01:42.329> do<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.540> actually<00:01:42.780> play<00:01:43.229> that

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
and what I can do is actually play that

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.219 
and what I can do is actually play that
back<00:01:43.649> you'll<00:01:44.399> see<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.759> actually<00:01:45.630> have<00:01:46.110> this

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
back you'll see that actually have this

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.859 
back you'll see that actually have this
macro<00:01:46.619> recorder<00:01:47.040> toolbar<00:01:47.509> already<00:01:48.509> displayed

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
macro recorder toolbar already displayed

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.420 
macro recorder toolbar already displayed
but<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.290> bet<00:01:50.810> so<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.869> can<00:01:52.049> go<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.229> tools<00:01:52.880> macro<00:01:53.880> run

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
but I bet so I can go to tools macro run

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.859 
but I bet so I can go to tools macro run
and<00:01:56.430> rerun<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:56.969> file<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.509> was<00:01:57.600> just<00:01:57.899> saved

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
and rerun the file that was just saved

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.990 
and rerun the file that was just saved
and<00:02:00.869> as<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.710> can<00:02:01.770> see<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.009> plays<00:02:02.310> back<00:02:02.640> our

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
and as you can see it plays back our

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.600 
and as you can see it plays back our
actions<00:02:03.540> even<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.680> camera<00:02:04.950> rotation

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
actions even to the camera rotation

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.749 
actions even to the camera rotation
that's<00:02:07.120> how<00:02:07.600> you<00:02:07.660> record<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:09.009> run<00:02:09.220> macros

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
that's how you record and run macros

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.320 
that's how you record and run macros
using<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.150> macro<00:02:10.360> recorder<00:02:10.930> recorder<00:02:12.330> now

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
using the macro recorder recorder now

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.050 
using the macro recorder recorder now
let's<00:02:13.570> say<00:02:13.750> that<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:14.920> want<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.400> use<00:02:15.670> macro

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
let's say that you want to use macro

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.150 
let's say that you want to use macro
recorder<00:02:16.360> very<00:02:16.540> often<00:02:16.960> what<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:17.650> can<00:02:17.890> do<00:02:18.040> is

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
recorder very often what you can do is

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.610 
recorder very often what you can do is
have<00:02:18.370> it<00:02:18.400> have<00:02:19.210> it<00:02:19.240> displaying<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.350> command

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
have it have it displaying a command

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.380 
have it have it displaying a command
window<00:02:20.770> all<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.070> time<00:02:21.160> simply<00:02:21.910> right-click

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
window all the time simply right-click

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.350 
window all the time simply right-click
on<00:02:22.540> your<00:02:22.600> command<00:02:23.050> manager<00:02:23.440> and<00:02:24.340> then<00:02:25.060> click

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
on your command manager and then click

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.950 
on your command manager and then click
on<00:02:25.570> macro<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:26.790> then<00:02:27.790> you'll<00:02:27.970> have<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.390> basic

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
on macro and then you'll have the basic

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.410 
on macro and then you'll have the basic
macro<00:02:29.260> toolbar<00:02:29.710> in<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.070> top<00:02:30.850> left<00:02:31.060> corner<00:02:31.150> all

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
macro toolbar in the top left corner all

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.200 
macro toolbar in the top left corner all
time<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:31.960> that<00:02:32.080> has<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.530> play<00:02:33.060> record<00:02:34.060> and

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
time and that has the play record and

VBA which is the visual basic
applications<00:04:52.310> code<00:04:52.810> so<00:04:53.810> I'm<00:04:53.960> going<00:04:54.080> to<00:04:54.139> open

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
applications code so I'm going to open

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.129 
applications code so I'm going to open
this<00:04:54.470> up<00:04:54.650> come<00:04:55.370> and<00:04:55.580> open<00:04:55.639> this<00:04:55.850> up<00:04:56.030> and<00:04:56.210> we'll

take a look at it
alright<00:05:00.650> this<00:05:01.460> is<00:05:01.700> the<00:05:02.180> Visual<00:05:02.960> Basic<00:05:02.990> for

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
alright this is the Visual Basic for

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
alright this is the Visual Basic for
applications<00:05:03.470> code<00:05:04.370> the<00:05:05.030> VBA<00:05:05.660> code<00:05:06.160> that<00:05:07.160> was

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
applications code the VBA code that was

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.080 
applications code the VBA code that was
created<00:05:08.150> when<00:05:08.360> we<00:05:08.570> recorded<00:05:09.320> our<00:05:10.090> SolidWorks

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
created when we recorded our SolidWorks

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.620 
created when we recorded our SolidWorks
API<00:05:11.450> macro<00:05:11.900> of<00:05:12.139> making<00:05:12.800> a<00:05:12.889> cube<00:05:13.270> now<00:05:14.270> we<00:05:14.330> can

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
API macro of making a cube now we can

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.200 
API macro of making a cube now we can
actually<00:05:14.780> go<00:05:15.110> into<00:05:15.470> this<00:05:16.070> code<00:05:16.340> and<00:05:16.639> edit<00:05:17.120> it

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
actually go into this code and edit it

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.590 
actually go into this code and edit it
manually<00:05:17.810> and<00:05:18.169> then<00:05:18.229> save<00:05:19.160> our<00:05:19.490> code<00:05:20.060> and<00:05:20.300> that

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
manually and then save our code and that

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.360 
manually and then save our code and that
will<00:05:20.720> actually<00:05:20.840> change<00:05:21.050> the<00:05:21.410> macro<00:05:21.770> and

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
will actually change the macro and

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.650 
will actually change the macro and
that's<00:05:22.550> what<00:05:22.910> we're<00:05:23.030> actually<00:05:23.150> gonna<00:05:23.390> do<00:05:23.479> for

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
that's what we're actually gonna do for

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.150 
that's what we're actually gonna do for
the<00:05:23.720> next<00:05:23.990> lesson<00:05:24.140> this<00:05:24.530> is<00:05:24.590> a<00:05:24.680> good<00:05:24.830> place<00:05:25.010> to
