 health section thank you happy 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.330
 have them here always the order what 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.460
 need 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.560
 good in today we have a 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.210
 very special routine and countable gabri 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.619
 viewers what is it about 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.260
 good today we are going to work the muscles 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.769
 that we like the men who are 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.019
 the chest and the videos then we're going 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.570
 to work in a super series form 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.790
 the super fairs consist of making a 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.610
 chest exercise immediately 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.250
 followed by an exercise says that 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.710
 while you are doing I made the chest 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.000
 he recovers for the next exercise 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.100
 then we are going to do three exercises 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.680
 of says let's do three exercises of 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.420
 chest 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.360
 and we are going to do four series of each 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.010
 super series is worth good friends outgoing 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.630
 already listened do not disconnect from their 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.130
 televisions because we're back with the 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:01.059
 today's routine we're going to start 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:04.070
 working the chest in the middle part 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.960
 whenever we work a flat bench it 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.760
 works the middle part of the chest to 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.650
 we tipped the bank a little 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.810
 let's work the chest in the part of 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.270
 up from here and when we 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.190
 we decline the bank or make funds 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.350
 we work the chest in the bottom 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.320
 then we will attack it for the part 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.149
 mean we are going to bench press with 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.310
 cufflinks I always recommend weights 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.530
 free not machines but free weights 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.720
 then we will explain the exercise 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.729
 takes air before starting and with the 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.729
 force boot to the air a 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.510
 2 very well 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.760
 the ideal is to always start the first 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:45.830
 series with a weight that can take some 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.830
 15 repetitions up to 20 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.670
 we immediately went to work biceps 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.409
 the biceps also has different 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.549
 angles then we are not working 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:06.250
 the first grip grip supine and then 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:09.340
 let's change the hammer type grip 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.040
 the last one we can do with grip 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.510
 inward or concentrated arnold what 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.580
 important is to always change the 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.510
 angles to attack the muscle by 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.510
 different parts 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.760
 ready then he just completed a 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.790
 back this is called a super series 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.560
 combined chest with biceps he 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.420
 while he was doing rest biceps 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.459
 the chest then is almost ready 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.950
 to start the other chest series 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.319
 let's do four laps he just 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.120
 make a star like we said 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.160
 I previously reminded you that they have 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.220
 than to increase the weight in each series 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.300
 and down to the reps ok 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.150
 these are the first two exercises 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.310
 let's do the next two 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.380
 at this time we are going to work 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.730
 openings to expand the muscles 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.890
 pectorals take air while you open 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.230
 Bogota while saw 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.970
 we have to feel how the chest opens 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.970
 how my muscle fibers break 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.569
 immediately we move on to the other exercise 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:20.459
 of biceps but we change the grip 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.459
 the grip here is hammer type 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.870
 let's work more the peaks of 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.870
 biceps 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.900
 full movements down to 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.900
 well up 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.030
 we have four exercises we have two 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.310
 super series to move to the last 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.740
 work chest down now we go for the 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.450
 last super series we already work the 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.520
 chest in the first series in the part 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.020
 mean the second we work on the 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.360
 high part because the bank was 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.850
 inclined and now in the lower part what 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.100
 let's work with funds the funds 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.520
 Failure to fail means until 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.530
 I can not do one more repetition 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.380
 remember complete movements up 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.300
 down pass the 90 degree angle the 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.920
 arm when you can no longer do any 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.920
 series more we spend sometimes 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.000
 let's make dices alternate 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.000
 with dumbbells 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.560
 first one arm then the other 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.460
 same as the others 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.380
 you rest a minute when you finish here 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:37.280
 you go back to breast make the funds that 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.410
 you can immediately do the biceps 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.870
 you rest a minute until you complete 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.479
 four laps this routine recommendable 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.539
 do it once a week or maximum two 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:50.820
 but separated apart the days between 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:53.160
 them so it may be Monday Friday 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.340
 Monday thursday is not a routine that 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.240
 recommend doing in a row 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.240
 thank you very much
