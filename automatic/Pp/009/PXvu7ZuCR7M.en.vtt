my haul video I have these listed

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.490 
my haul video I have these listed
they're<00:00:39.680> gonna<00:00:40.680> be<00:00:40.890> using<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.730> striper<00:00:42.239> brush

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
they're gonna be using a striper brush

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.869 
they're gonna be using a striper brush
this<00:00:43.500> one's<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.800> little<00:00:43.920> bit<00:00:44.100> thicker<00:00:44.399> not<00:00:44.730> as

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
this one's a little bit thicker not as

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.490 
this one's a little bit thicker not as
thin<00:00:45.600> but<00:00:46.079> that's<00:00:46.260> good<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:48.289> little<00:00:49.289> bit<00:00:49.410> of

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
thin but that's good a little bit of

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:59.010 
thin but that's good a little bit of
water

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.630 

I<00:01:01.960> have<00:01:02.960> everything<00:01:03.380> like<00:01:03.830> containers<00:01:04.460> like

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
I have everything like containers like

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.000 
I have everything like containers like
this<00:01:05.350> all<00:01:06.350> right<00:01:06.440> you<00:01:06.500> can't<00:01:06.710> see<00:01:06.830> that<00:01:06.950> right

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
this all right you can't see that right

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:13.590 
this all right you can't see that right
now<00:01:10.060> I'm<00:01:11.060> going<00:01:11.360> to<00:01:11.480> use<00:01:11.690> the<00:01:11.960> best<00:01:12.140> glue<00:01:12.410> ever

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
now I'm going to use the best glue ever

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.410 
now I'm going to use the best glue ever
simple<00:01:14.600> because<00:01:14.720> I<00:01:14.930> think<00:01:15.350> if<00:01:15.500> it's<00:01:15.980> for<00:01:16.790> me<00:01:16.940> it

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
simple because I think if it's for me it

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.450 
simple because I think if it's for me it
helped<00:01:18.080> keep<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.740> beat<00:01:18.920> down<00:01:19.100> a<00:01:19.160> little

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
helped keep the beat down a little

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.110 
helped keep the beat down a little
longer<00:01:19.670> than<00:01:20.270> just<00:01:20.540> a<00:01:20.630> regular<00:01:20.810> topcoat<00:01:22.120> all

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120 
longer than just a regular topcoat all

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.020 
longer than just a regular topcoat all
right<00:01:23.360> so<00:01:23.780> I'm<00:01:24.560> gonna<00:01:24.710> go<00:01:24.920> ahead<00:01:25.070> and<00:01:25.250> dilute

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
right so I'm gonna go ahead and dilute

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:33.280 
right so I'm gonna go ahead and dilute
some<00:01:26.270> of<00:01:26.300> this<00:01:30.100> here<00:01:31.780> now<00:01:32.780> usually<00:01:32.960> you<00:01:33.140> can

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
some of this here now usually you can

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.040 
some of this here now usually you can
just<00:01:33.470> squeeze<00:01:33.710> it<00:01:33.979> out<00:01:34.100> but<00:01:34.400> just<00:01:34.640> kind<00:01:35.420> of<00:01:35.510> the

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
just squeeze it out but just kind of the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:49.810 
just squeeze it out but just kind of the
tip<00:01:36.080> usually<00:01:36.500> dries<00:01:36.890> over

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.020 

hmm

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
hmm

00:01:52.030 --> 00:02:10.740 
hmm
not<00:01:52.660> that<00:01:52.840> much<00:01:53.020> just<00:01:53.050> a<00:01:53.560> little<00:01:53.860> bit

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.830 

just<00:02:11.710> a<00:02:11.830> cap<00:02:12.070> full<00:02:12.370> of<00:02:12.400> water<00:02:12.760> next<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.570> it<00:02:13.690> to

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
just a cap full of water next to it to

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.099 
just a cap full of water next to it to
dilute<00:02:14.140> it

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:19.109 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:28.770 

okay

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.260 

there<00:02:29.380> we<00:02:29.560> go<00:02:29.710> that<00:02:29.980> way<00:02:30.100> is<00:02:30.160> not<00:02:30.400> as<00:02:30.610> thick<00:02:30.910> and

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
there we go that way is not as thick and

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.570 
there we go that way is not as thick and
it<00:02:31.900> doesn't<00:02:32.200> take<00:02:32.350> forever<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:33.010> dry<00:02:33.160> okay<00:02:35.580> all

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
it doesn't take forever to dry okay all

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.800 
it doesn't take forever to dry okay all
right<00:02:36.760> so<00:02:37.270> now<00:02:37.390> that<00:02:37.450> I've<00:02:37.660> got<00:02:37.780> that

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
right so now that I've got that

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.280 
right so now that I've got that
believing<00:02:38.350> what<00:02:38.530> I'm<00:02:38.650> gonna<00:02:38.770> do<00:02:39.010> is<00:02:40.050> that<00:02:41.050> I'm

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
believing what I'm gonna do is that I'm

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.610 
believing what I'm gonna do is that I'm
just<00:02:41.770> going<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.100> create<00:02:42.520> a<00:02:43.320> little<00:02:44.320> bit<00:02:44.500> of

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
just going to create a little bit of

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.480 
just going to create a little bit of
randomness<00:02:45.130> this<00:02:46.060> dries<00:02:46.360> clear<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:48.220> will<00:02:48.340> go

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
randomness this dries clear it will go

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.370 
randomness this dries clear it will go
on<00:02:48.520> white<00:02:48.910> but<00:02:49.240> it<00:02:49.330> will<00:02:49.390> dry<00:02:49.600> clear<00:02:49.660> so<00:02:49.990> you

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
on white but it will dry clear so you

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.500 
on white but it will dry clear so you
don't<00:02:50.620> have<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:50.800> worry<00:02:50.950> about<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.730> if<00:02:52.390> you

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
don't have to worry about it and if you

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.790 
don't have to worry about it and if you
haven't<00:02:52.660> used<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:52.959> best<00:02:53.110> glue<00:02:53.290> ever<00:02:53.320> I

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
haven't used the best glue ever I

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.960 
haven't used the best glue ever I
recommend<00:02:54.490> it<00:02:54.640> that's<00:02:54.820> really<00:02:55.150> great<00:02:55.510> I<00:02:56.970> I'm
