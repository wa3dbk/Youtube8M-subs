00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.549
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.560
 a new piece of childhood history 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.510
 or to a milestone of 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.759
 game story my name is simon that 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.250
 is game play station and i'll show you 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.250
 today in a test dungeon keeper 2 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.490
 dungeon keeper series or, above all, part 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.110
 2 has no other one 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.600
 Strategy game has it easy 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.540
 unique it was said I do not know a game 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.400
 it is similar or even just like that 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.470
 there was there in between 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.420
 a game I do not remember 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.370
 so it's called similar to that 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.350
 be and build on the basic idea 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.790
 but it did not make it mine 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.320
 Eat how much would I have over 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.699
 Dungeon Keeper Three looked forward to seeing him 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.110
 unfortunately never will appear 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.489
 or maybe we do not know 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.690
 But I would say we start now 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.690
 just with the review 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.289
 yes, if you do not play the game yourself 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.289
 has played is the story to transfigure 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:08.300
 a bit difficult we are a kind 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:10.910
 the rulers we will be on that too 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.880
 called magna and have a dungeon 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.680
 Heart that, so to speak, accommodates us 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.630
 was definitely in need of protection 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.539
 makes use of a higher we will look at 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.950
 headed to conquer a world 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:23.869
 I just want to speculate now 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.310
 that's sort of like the underworld is 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.780
 It's difficult to say 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.400
 I think that gives the story of this 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.470
 In any case there is one 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.970
 to conquer variety of levels and worlds 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.430
 and we have to go there 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.490
 so-called portal who in the rest the 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.420
 all from human guards 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.670
 be protected 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.130
 story, it's only us 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.079
 from the beginning through the world to the 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.909
 fight the end and defeat the boss 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.100
 and so happy our ruler 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.710
 make our higher power say that 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.409
 that's how we get from the creature 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.970
 Horny felt and protects us so 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.189
 every now and then a bit under 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.590
 the poor attacks as I said the story is 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.299
 anything but easy to explain 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.320
 Gameplay technically are the whole if 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.960
 you 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.030
 his game is the camera is from above 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.440
 and we have the possibility of small 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.440
 to control workers 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.720
 then the stones and rocks break around so 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.120
 space for spaces to lay out these 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.310
 Rooms lure monster to the from 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.020
 we come across the portal ourselves 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.390
 first found and conquered 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.730
 there must be, for example, the 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.190
 torture chamber the iron virgins 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.050
 lured there is also one 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.900
 workshop in the knowledge fall with us 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.360
 and doors can all have had others 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.350
 nasty things then lure troll to the 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.300
 we also need 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.680
 ultimately the workshop at all 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.870
 to lead there as I said 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.520
 keep number of rooms and different 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.370
 monsters each other 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.660
 ability to have ourselves as a keeper 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.330
 because even the possibility too 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.790
 conjure up and can, among other things 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.950
 any harm, too 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.630
 take over the control of our monsters 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.580
 and, so to speak, the monster 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.260
 issuing such control but which is also 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.970
 with the workers and then can do so 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.950
 take part in the fight yourself 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.989
 the monsters have all themselves 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.150
 a levels with the expenses asn 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.459
 roleplaying character gives the 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.709
 monsters have other cities 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.360
 weaken and strengthen and ultimately 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.519
 also a level of us then one 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.080
 the indicator for this is how strong monster 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.519
 or we just can not stop 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.840
 Of course, these monsters too 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.000
 Send workout room where they because 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.769
 You can work out in the dormitory 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.959
 throw where you put the bed 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.340
 to heal or give them in the 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.470
 Feed space throw the bait 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.790
 can eat the way we have for 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.890
 Make sure we always have enough money 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.090
 in our treasure chamber 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.530
 otherwise we can not do the monster 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.390
 pay and that does not just lead to it 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.890
 that the monstrum will be happy and 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.600
 in the end even rebel against us 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.579
 but that also leads to that 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.329
 they do not want to fight us anymore 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.920
 are surrendered 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.870
 What is not bad for him is 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.120
 even other monsters in ours 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.220
 torture chambers torture that does not look 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.230
 just kind of funny is indeed 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.730
 censored but that could go but 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.590
 then bring us too 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.900
 Information about the world in which we 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.030
 We always have to be careful 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.500
 Also that there is enough building space for 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.329
 our rooms because of course you can 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.640
 Do not cut down on the stones or 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:09.530
 Lama blocks our way 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.449
 Water blocks our way for it 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.580
 but bridges in the story it is so 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:14.740
 that we are 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.950
 fight from mission to mission and in doing so 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.810
 more and more skills and thus spaces 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.060
 also get more opportunities 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.770
 in the ideal case it is like that if 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.810
 we have expanded our army 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.400
 make the way to fight the enemy 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.740
 Of course, this one also has an army 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.330
 only his does not consist of all 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.800
 creatures but mostly out 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.680
 human characters munich 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.750
 climb accustomed or other that we 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.210
 now have to fight with ours 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.190
 conjure creatures or just too 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.650
 skills through the fog of war 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.910
 and by the thousand things 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.860
 at the same time in this game 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.260
 this must create one 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.180
 always exciting atmosphere the mission 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.220
 they are always a bit different 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.990
 we are under power all the time 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.510
 new paths are always looking for the enemy 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.920
 fight and come to andy portals 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.660
 here and there also fight against 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.880
 Other keeper as well are not always just 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.470
 against humans and yes what should I you 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.930
 say dungeon keeper is easy from 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.760
 strategic partner very versatile 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.990
 and just a great game and me 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.820
 would say we'll have a look 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.050
 technology 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.990
 allegedly, this game is also under 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.370
 windows 7 and vista and but me 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.650
 somehow not with me it does not work 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.110
 more neatly under xp and i have 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.940
 Neat and try it until I get it 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.560
 found out that the page is coming 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.440
 This game I will offer her white 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.020
 confesses goc is well outdated games the 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.580
 offer elite version of games 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.500
 which then also on new and computer 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.660
 run and so it is here with the gp2 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.640
 on the graphics of the game it is not anymore 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.400
 currently the music program say that 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.470
 Game is I believe in 1997 in the coque 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.680
 version is missing also the hardware 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.669
 mode this is just the software mode and 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.569
 accordingly shit off nevertheless 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:51.969
 camera 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:53.949
 just as well with the sound and before 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:55.689
 All cheap murders and bars will pose 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:57.789
 not so he is so commentator is he 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:59.589
 All the time we talk about every German 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:01.179
 informed also brings lightning 

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:02.709
 in between and the counter below 

00:06:01.179 --> 00:06:04.929
 shit like that in his whole 

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:06.249
 yogurt is not quite that way 

00:06:04.929 --> 00:06:08.279
 funny but I still want you 

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:10.240
 make it clear that he is all the time 

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:12.339
 otherwise this game is fuller 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.919
 details of every corner there is something to see 

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:16.270
 and you are also entertained when you are 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:18.069
 the game is six hours late 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.860
 when in between no longer releases 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:22.899
 Well, in any case, I give the game 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.639
 10 out of 10 points 

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:25.930
 I think it's a dream of playing 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:28.059
 there is no play in this game 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.069
 arrives in the category it is easy 

00:06:28.059 --> 00:06:32.020
 unique in its form and it is 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:32.770
 It is a pity that there is never a part 3 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.199
 will give 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.270
 that 's it with the test myself 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:39.580
 Hope her new game found happened 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:42.099
 play and do not fall since 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:45.029
 death of what missed and maybe 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:45.029
 See you again next time
