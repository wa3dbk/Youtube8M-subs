00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
actually a very good puzzle basically

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.460 
actually a very good puzzle basically
you<00:00:17.940> have<00:00:18.090> three<00:00:19.220> couples<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.670> shapes<00:00:21.539> so<00:00:22.020> if

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
you have three couples of shapes so if

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.439 
you have three couples of shapes so if
you<00:00:22.619> look<00:00:22.769> closely<00:00:23.010> these<00:00:23.340> are<00:00:23.640> wooden

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
you look closely these are wooden

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.240 
you look closely these are wooden
spheres<00:00:24.990> glued<00:00:25.529> together<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:27.890> yeah<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:28.949> got

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
spheres glued together and yeah you got

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.990 
spheres glued together and yeah you got
a<00:00:29.279> couple<00:00:29.550> three<00:00:30.269> couples<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.720> shapes<00:00:31.399> so<00:00:32.399> the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
a couple three couples of shapes so the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000 
a couple three couples of shapes so the
balls<00:00:33.210> are<00:00:33.450> joined<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:33.960> three<00:00:34.680> different<00:00:34.860> ways

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
balls are joined in three different ways

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.400 
balls are joined in three different ways
and<00:00:35.460> there<00:00:35.550> are<00:00:35.640> two<00:00:35.850> copies<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.450> each<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.380> you

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
and there are two copies of each so you

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.670 
and there are two copies of each so you
got<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.980> line<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.309> three<00:00:39.050> you<00:00:40.050> have<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.350> strange

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
got a line of three you have the strange

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.490 
got a line of three you have the strange
diamonds<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.550> four<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.629> you've<00:00:43.230> got<00:00:43.469> a

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
diamonds of four and you've got a

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.220 
diamonds of four and you've got a
triangle<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:44.219> three<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:45.059> you've<00:00:45.719> got<00:00:45.989> two<00:00:46.200> of

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
triangle of three and you've got two of

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.619 
triangle of three and you've got two of
each<00:00:47.329> just<00:00:48.329> like<00:00:48.480> that

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
each just like that

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.979 
each just like that
and<00:00:51.629> your<00:00:51.840> goal<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.980> make<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.640> 4<00:00:54.980> mm<00:00:55.980> a

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
and your goal is to make a 4 mm a

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.500 
and your goal is to make a 4 mm a
triangular<00:00:57.989> pyramid<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.710> each<00:00:59.219> side<00:00:59.489> has<00:01:00.000> or

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
triangular pyramid and each side has or

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.990 
triangular pyramid and each side has or
each<00:01:00.780> edge<00:01:01.050> has<00:01:01.500> 4<00:01:01.800> balls<00:01:03.500> so<00:01:04.500> I'm<00:01:05.220> going<00:01:05.820> to

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
each edge has 4 balls so I'm going to

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.510 
each edge has 4 balls so I'm going to
attempt<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.630> arrange<00:01:07.470> them<00:01:07.710> right<00:01:07.860> now<00:01:08.040> but

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
attempt to arrange them right now but

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.450 
attempt to arrange them right now but
they<00:01:09.360> are<00:01:09.510> very<00:01:09.720> hard<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.680> keep<00:01:11.640> steady<00:01:13.460> so

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
they are very hard to keep steady so

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.140 
they are very hard to keep steady so
this<00:01:14.700> will<00:01:14.880> require<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> lot<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.680> patience<00:01:17.150> even

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
this will require a lot of patience even

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.240 
this will require a lot of patience even
just<00:01:18.390> figuring<00:01:18.720> out<00:01:18.840> how<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.080> put<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.950> puzzle

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
just figuring out how to put the puzzle

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.179 
just figuring out how to put the puzzle
together<00:01:20.369> take<00:01:20.850> some<00:01:21.090> time<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.950> I've<00:01:22.950> actually

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
together take some time so I've actually

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.580 
together take some time so I've actually
ahead<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.820> time<00:01:24.150> figured<00:01:24.540> out<00:01:24.720> or<00:01:24.930> we<00:01:25.350> learned

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
ahead of time figured out or we learned

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:36.640 
ahead of time figured out or we learned
how<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.860> solve<00:01:26.549> this

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.770 

and<00:01:37.280> it's<00:01:37.430> hard<00:01:37.700> to<00:01:37.790> keep<00:01:38.000> it<00:01:38.150> in<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.360> pyramid

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
and it's hard to keep it in the pyramid

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:49.160 
and it's hard to keep it in the pyramid
sheep

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.910 

okay<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.010> you<00:01:50.220> get<00:01:50.340> these<00:01:51.530> pieces<00:01:52.530> with<00:01:52.830> the

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
okay so you get these pieces with the

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.469 
okay so you get these pieces with the
four<00:01:53.130> balls<00:01:53.370> in<00:01:53.580> it<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.850> then<00:01:53.940> arrange<00:01:54.210> them

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
four balls in it and then arrange them

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.960 
four balls in it and then arrange them
like<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:56.510> and<00:01:57.510> you<00:01:57.720> put<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.260> street<00:01:58.979> piece

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
like so and you put the street piece

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:08.199 
like so and you put the street piece
there<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.500> triangle<00:02:01.979> piece<00:02:02.510> like<00:02:03.560> here

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:14.350 

and<00:02:10.070> get<00:02:11.070> these<00:02:11.280> other<00:02:11.580> two<00:02:11.850> pieces<00:02:12.330> like<00:02:13.080> that

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
and get these other two pieces like that

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.449 
and get these other two pieces like that
arrange<00:02:15.360> them<00:02:15.600> like<00:02:15.630> this<00:02:16.320> and<00:02:16.590> try<00:02:17.040> your<00:02:17.160> best

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
arrange them like this and try your best

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:23.479 
arrange them like this and try your best
to<00:02:17.880> put<00:02:18.270> them<00:02:18.450> on<00:02:18.569> top<00:02:18.900> like<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:22.130> it's<00:02:23.130> very

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
to put them on top like that it's very

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:33.600 
to put them on top like that it's very
hard<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.820> keep<00:02:24.000> them<00:02:24.209> stacked

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.870 

and<00:02:34.240> I<00:02:34.360> guess<00:02:34.540> that's<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.870> best<00:02:35.080> I<00:02:35.170> can<00:02:35.200> do<00:02:35.880> so

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
and I guess that's the best I can do so

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:48.990 
and I guess that's the best I can do so
let<00:02:37.360> me<00:02:37.570> just<00:02:37.870> move<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.560> camera<00:02:38.950> around

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.730 

yeah<00:02:50.000> that<00:02:50.390> was<00:02:50.540> basically<00:02:51.020> the<00:02:51.550> dollar<00:02:52.550> store

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
yeah that was basically the dollar store

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.530 
yeah that was basically the dollar store
the<00:02:54.740> dollar<00:02:54.950> store<00:02:55.340> pyramid<00:02:56.770> puzzle<00:02:57.770> and<00:02:58.540> of

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
the dollar store pyramid puzzle and of

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:12.210
