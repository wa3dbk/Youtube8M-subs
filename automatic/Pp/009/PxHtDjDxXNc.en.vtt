shrink 30 separate dumbbells down to two

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.520 
shrink 30 separate dumbbells down to two

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
success in working with dumbbells is

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.809 
success in working with dumbbells is
based<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.080> technique<00:02:12.530> and<00:02:12.800> that's<00:02:13.520> why<00:02:13.730> I'm

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.370 
based and technique and that's why I'm
going<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.060> show<00:02:14.209> you<00:02:14.270> how<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.599> do<00:02:14.750> each<00:02:15.020> rep

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
going to show you how to do each rep

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.500 
going to show you how to do each rep
profitably<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.220> demonstrate<00:02:17.060> on<00:02:17.180> more<00:02:17.360> than

30<00:02:17.810> basic<00:02:18.290> exercises<00:02:18.830> including<00:02:19.640> over<00:02:20.000> any

30 basic exercises including over any

30 basic exercises including over any
variations<00:02:21.170> that<00:02:21.290> you<00:02:21.380> can<00:02:21.620> do<00:02:21.770> with<00:02:21.920> this

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
variations that you can do with this
