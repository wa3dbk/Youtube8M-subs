00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
the four blocks work so we have center

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.270 
the four blocks work so we have center
again<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:28.350> now<00:01:28.440> you<00:01:28.530> just<00:01:28.650> want<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.860> go<00:01:28.980> free

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
again and now you just want to go free

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.090 
again and now you just want to go free
blocks<00:01:29.580> out<00:01:29.820> every<00:01:30.330> direction<00:01:30.740> place<00:01:31.740> blood

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
blocks out every direction place blood

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.300 
blocks out every direction place blood
there<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.700> do<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.620> make<00:01:34.620> a<00:01:34.650> little<00:01:34.980> pyramid

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
there and do that make a little pyramid

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.150 
there and do that make a little pyramid
like<00:01:35.640> shape<00:01:36.770> for<00:01:38.210> 323<00:01:39.740> one<00:01:40.740> block<00:01:40.980> in<00:01:41.010> the

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
like shape for 323 one block in the

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.730 
like shape for 323 one block in the
middle<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.880> ends<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.690> looks<00:01:42.870> like<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.230> we're

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
middle and ends it looks like this we're

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.660 
middle and ends it looks like this we're
going<00:01:43.830> to<00:01:43.890> do<00:01:44.010> the<00:01:44.130> unfold<00:01:44.640> all<00:01:45.000> four<00:01:45.420> sides

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
going to do the unfold all four sides

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.790 
going to do the unfold all four sides
place<00:01:47.670> water<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.180> all<00:01:48.330> corners<00:01:48.660> here<00:01:49.170> plays

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
place water in all corners here plays

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.340 
place water in all corners here plays
whether<00:01:50.100> their<00:01:50.990> face<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.140> wall<00:01:52.290> in<00:01:52.440> there<00:01:52.590> and

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
whether their face the wall in there and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.130 
whether their face the wall in there and
so<00:01:55.350> what<00:01:55.470> happens<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.220> you<00:01:57.210> just<00:01:57.450> dig<00:01:57.720> out<00:01:57.900> two

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
so what happens is you just dig out two

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.840 
so what happens is you just dig out two
more<00:01:58.440> in<00:01:58.500> every<00:01:58.890> side<00:02:01.370> and<00:02:02.370> what<00:02:02.520> happens

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
more in every side and what happens

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:10.040 
more in every side and what happens
where<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.479> all<00:02:03.600> flows<00:02:03.960> towards<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.470> middle

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.200 

and<00:02:10.140> this<00:02:10.890> will<00:02:11.040> be<00:02:11.160> our<00:02:11.340> kind<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.090> like

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
and this will be our kind of like

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.270 
and this will be our kind of like
killing<00:02:12.540> chamber<00:02:13.080> but<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.770> way<00:02:13.860> we're<00:02:14.010> coming

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
killing chamber but the way we're coming

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.820 
killing chamber but the way we're coming

which<00:05:15.530> actually<00:05:15.800> is<00:05:16.190> my<00:05:16.900> weight<00:05:17.900> no<00:05:18.080> that's

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
which actually is my weight no that's

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.570 
which actually is my weight no that's
not<00:05:18.500> right

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.239 

is<00:05:21.970> it

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:23.249 
is it

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:25.759 
is it
I<00:05:23.339> have<00:05:23.849> to<00:05:23.999> look<00:05:24.469> there<00:05:25.469> you're<00:05:25.559> going<00:05:25.679> to

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:25.769 
I have to look there you're going to

00:05:25.769 --> 00:05:28.279 
I have to look there you're going to
place<00:05:26.009> them<00:05:26.359> high<00:05:27.359> enough<00:05:27.389> so<00:05:27.749> they<00:05:27.869> won't<00:05:28.049> so

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
place them high enough so they won't so

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:31.609 
place them high enough so they won't so
you<00:05:28.469> just<00:05:28.559> die<00:05:29.989> so<00:05:30.989> you're<00:05:31.109> going<00:05:31.229> to<00:05:31.289> be<00:05:31.409> like

00:05:31.609 --> 00:05:31.619 
you just die so you're going to be like

00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:34.339 
you just die so you're going to be like
in<00:05:32.219> your<00:05:32.399> head<00:05:32.609> height<00:05:32.879> is<00:05:33.809> where<00:05:34.019> the<00:05:34.109> sign

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
in your head height is where the sign

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:38.110 
in your head height is where the sign
they're<00:05:34.559> going<00:05:34.709> to<00:05:34.889> be<00:05:35.009> which<00:05:35.999> is<00:05:36.179> to<00:05:36.449> I

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
they're going to be which is to I

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.959 
they're going to be which is to I
so<00:05:38.690> in<00:05:38.840> this<00:05:38.990> case<00:05:39.290> it's<00:05:39.590> going<00:05:39.740> to<00:05:39.889> be

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:40.969 
so in this case it's going to be

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:43.620 
so in this case it's going to be
one<00:05:41.569> and<00:05:41.689> a<00:05:41.719> half<00:05:41.779> mine

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
one and a half mine

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.380 
one and a half mine
doesn't<00:05:43.960> really<00:05:44.020> matter<00:05:44.490> meh<00:05:45.490> picture<00:05:45.880> lava

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
doesn't really matter meh picture lava

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.860 
doesn't really matter meh picture lava
in<00:05:46.600> the<00:05:46.750> corner

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.390 

and<00:05:50.410> what<00:05:50.560> happens<00:05:50.920> now<00:05:51.130> is<00:05:52.080> there's<00:05:53.080> no<00:05:53.260> way

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
and what happens now is there's no way

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.030 
and what happens now is there's no way
that<00:05:54.400> they're<00:05:54.820> not<00:05:55.060> going<00:05:55.240> to<00:05:55.330> die<00:05:55.510> we<00:05:56.470> fall<00:05:56.860> in

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
that they're not going to die we fall in

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.030 
that they're not going to die we fall in
here<00:05:57.540> their<00:05:58.540> heads<00:05:58.780> in<00:05:59.080> the<00:05:59.230> water<00:05:59.440> so<00:05:59.830> they<00:05:59.980> do

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.040 
here their heads in the water so they do

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.750 
here their heads in the water so they do
die

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:08.420
