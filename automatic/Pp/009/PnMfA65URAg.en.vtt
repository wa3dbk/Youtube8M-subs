00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:13.929
 we are all crampons welcome new video cost on pei of the two 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.980
 I publish this video as it discovered the safe method to understand 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.740
 which is the correct engine 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.410
 so you shouldn't be more than half an hour trying all the engines that mind 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.579
 you risk being maimed with police repetition 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.619
 first try not to let me find out 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.879
 the police will make more and more huge jumps and to make matters worse 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.480
 it will also turn off the lights of the underground preventing you from understanding what the 

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:42.740
 correct engine 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.580
 a very small promise made in the blue as in this mission and 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.270
 necessary to explain those small pills of physics and mathematical chemistry 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.170
 English of course 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.750
 which are necessary in order to decide as quickly as possible which one it is 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.030
 the right engine 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.410
 weights thank the school in these professors you know in advance of that 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.760
 what I will tell you 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.380
 fundamentally they are among the factors that allow you to understand with certainty 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.850
 which is the correct engine 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.890
 the color of the tank how many children and patois blut hydrogenated bets and the 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.750
 pressure 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.520
 each engine uses a different substance nightrage ad enzo 8 in 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.620
 the other yahoo but that is deuterium 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.120
 and that lilium that is edilio 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.719
 each substance contained in a tank of a particular color 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:36.580
 as indicated by the blackboard at the entrance to the laboratory 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.770
 but the right fuel is indicated by a note written on a sheet of paper 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.820
 like this 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.160
 you can always read one of the substances in huge letters 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.510
 first mentioned 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.920
 and then disk from this you will find out what color the container should be 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.990
 smaller 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.310
 caution 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.090
 this so far the only clue I discovered who could nundu fare 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.450
 inside the laboratory 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.710
 while you wait for it to be at the doors for the various security rooms it suits you 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.029
 always go around the house to look for any clues 

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:16.769
 once for example I found it on a table next to the one in the standards 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.129
 so however keep your eyes wide open and even before entering 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.379
 in the laboratory 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:26.779
 the second clue wolf various text always on another sheet of paper 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:32.719
 and you should be able to read something like kixd .h that is kixd times 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.920
 ark where x can be a 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.759
 mew mew ranging from 2 to 4 

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:42.680
 that number indicates how many hydrogen tubes are connected to the engine 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.280
 or how many tubes come out of the tip to hydrogen cylinders 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.590
 these hydrogen cylinders tend to be blue and white 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.639
 recognize because it is very often they have a big hm in the middle 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:01.510
 also seeds are recognizable because they are always those donuts with that 

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:06.829
 activity connector that allows the maximum output of three tubes 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:12.949
 the third clue is more difficult to elaborate 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:15.319
 about cylinder pressure 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.949
 i'm the computer of the broad lawyer you should be able to find out the kit that 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:23.899
 look for a tank with a pressure greater than a minor of a certain value 

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:25.949
 inr psx 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:27.109
 psi 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.819
 statera paunds obscure engraved ie free and its square inch 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.959
 but the pressure that the tanks read is measured in the boat 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.869
 don't panic 

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:44.459
 10 steps equals to zero, dump barter if you prefer that you can do it for me 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:45.230
 also in mind 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.930
 200 bar and equals to 2901 xi 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.109
 if you can not remember there is a computer with these conversions 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:58.309
 inside the laboratory and therefore also calculated ad hoc that cuddling 

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:01.139
 the value in spite of the pressure 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:04.949
 remember to thank your mom if you have learned to do these 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:06.020
 memory calculations 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.490
 otherwise be ashamed and bowed my head towards the cell phone I have the calculator 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.519
 nearest 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.120
 remember that in the computer there is not written the exact pressure of the 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.279
 tank says it can measure that 8 expo 

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:26.159
 but I could also be a minor, depending on the major symbol 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:29.159
 or less precisely a present on the account 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:35.180
 recapitulating in my case I look for an engine with a small yellow tank and in the 

00:04:35.179 --> 00:04:37.240
 my case it is nitrogen 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:44.220
 a pressure greater equal to e400 burr would actually be 398, 7 2 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.300
 2 centers etc morton given to give an idea 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.539
 and comet 3 hydrogen cables then 3 cables coming out of the blue pulse 4 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:56.949
 I always start from the neck of the tank because it is the one that skips the most 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.139
 quickly to the eye at least for mac 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.550
 then against the pressure and finally the cables because anyway on playstation 3 yes 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.539
 they see badly the needs eventually jumping over the table to be able to 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:08.729
 to check 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.529
 all the excavations in short 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:15.859
 check the children and other engines before taking the right one and 

00:05:15.859 --> 00:05:16.920
 remember 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.030
 never take an engine if you are not sure that it is possible 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.969
 treat of the right one 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:26.800
 once in the bag you won't be able to call out to check if 

00:05:26.799 --> 00:05:28.960
 meets these parameters 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.610
 so you will not know it is you will never know u again if it is an engine 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.439
 right or wrong 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:39.550
 this is what you need to know to always solve this 

00:05:39.549 --> 00:05:40.900
 problem with the inpdap 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.440
 wanting to add a couple of things, I have no idea if possible to have him speak 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:50.039
 scientist on dropping some spider from the hole taking this as a hostage 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:51.229
 scientist 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:54.819
 if on the first day of release you will retrieve some documents before they come 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:06:01.000
 rejected a few times you may discover a sheet in which he reveals himself 

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:03.180
 he knows a lot about the engine 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.290
 mini honestly I have no idea what to do with him 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:11.259
 another important thing is that in the second day briefing it is possible 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:14.330
 find out which is the right fuel 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.159
 if you managed to find information courses for beautician - in the 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:20.300
 previous day 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.389
 from the gang tables 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:25.610
 avoiding getting caught will save you time and 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:26.240
 fatigue 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.180
 because the sheet showing the right fuel is also 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.360
 the only clue that can appear throughout the house 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.400
 the very last thing about the bight mission 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.290
 of the contents as much as you can for hamas or fight all 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.100
 guards all the cameras 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.759
 the alarm will automatically go off when the helicopter lands 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:51.770
 however, try to bring a good friend's armor with you 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.979
 you risk ending up on the most beautiful ground 

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:58.489
 this concludes this here by terms with charge today 

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:03.060
 most viewed movies most heads that you found them interesting since this 

00:07:03.059 --> 00:07:06.949
 like here an example of those videogames that in the end they succeed in any case 

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:08.400
 teach you something 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.720
 like stealing engines to kill cops is actually good 

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.639
 and right 

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:18.150
 but this will also help you to avoid being beaten up unnecessarily 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.119
 by the police for more than half an hour 

00:07:21.119 --> 00:07:25.509
 having said that thanks for the vision and we get the next naboni
