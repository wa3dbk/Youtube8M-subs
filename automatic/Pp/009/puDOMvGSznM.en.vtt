00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
try to start the front it's the first

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
race in Europe what is your balance of

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:50.450 
race in Europe what is your balance of
the<00:01:48.399> first<00:01:48.939> four<00:01:49.180> races<00:01:49.360> of<00:01:49.719> the<00:01:49.750> season<00:01:49.869> I

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
the first four races of the season I

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.740 
the first four races of the season I
think<00:01:51.460> the<00:01:51.789> balance<00:01:51.939> of<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.360> first<00:01:52.600> four

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
think the balance of the first four

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.700 
think the balance of the first four
races<00:01:52.899> is<00:01:53.439> good<00:01:54.450> we<00:01:55.450> make<00:01:55.630> some<00:01:55.869> mistakes<00:01:56.259> so

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
races is good we make some mistakes so

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.510 
races is good we make some mistakes so
we<00:01:57.009> lost<00:01:57.270> some<00:01:58.270> points<00:01:58.539> but<00:01:58.869> overall<00:01:59.649> I<00:02:00.070> think

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
we lost some points but overall I think

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.760 
we lost some points but overall I think
we<00:02:00.909> are<00:02:01.030> in<00:02:01.509> a<00:02:01.689> very<00:02:01.719> good<00:02:02.020> position<00:02:02.200> for<00:02:02.560> the

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
we are in a very good position for the

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.700 
we are in a very good position for the
championship<00:02:03.189> and<00:02:04.060> also<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:05.049> best<00:02:05.200> thing<00:02:05.500> is

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
championship and also the best thing is

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.029

that<00:02:05.890> we<00:02:06.070> confirm<00:02:06.579> that<00:02:06.969> the<00:02:07.240> Dakar<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.380> f10

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039

track that you need a good car for the
high<00:03:48.390> speed<00:03:48.630> because<00:03:49.079> you<00:03:49.170> have<00:03:49.320> two

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560

important high speed corners 10 3 and 10

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.660 
important high speed corners 10 3 and 10
9<00:03:53.239> but<00:03:54.239> you<00:03:54.329> need<00:03:54.570> also<00:03:55.049> a<00:03:55.260> very<00:03:55.709> good<00:03:56.040> car<00:03:56.519> on

the<00:03:56.700> slow<00:03:57.030> corners<00:03:57.299> with<00:03:57.810> a<00:03:57.930> lot<00:03:58.079> of<00:03:58.109> downforce

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
the slow corners with a lot of downforce

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.530 
the slow corners with a lot of downforce
for<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.489> last<00:03:59.670> sector<00:03:59.910> especially<00:04:00.239> and<00:04:00.859> for

for the last sector especially and for

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.229 
for the last sector especially and for
some<00:04:03.650> strong<00:04:04.650> breaking<00:04:05.160> areas<00:04:05.730> that<00:04:05.910> you<00:04:06.060> need

some strong breaking areas that you need

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.229 
some strong breaking areas that you need
the<00:04:06.359> downforce<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:07.130> I<00:04:08.130> think<00:04:08.489> you<00:04:09.030> know<00:04:09.060> you

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.569 
the downforce and I think you know you
you<00:04:09.900> need<00:04:10.079> both<00:04:10.230> so<00:04:10.769> he's<00:04:10.980> a<00:04:11.010> track<00:04:11.310> that<00:04:11.340> you

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
you need both so he's a track that you

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:12.890 
you need both so he's a track that you
need<00:04:11.730> a<00:04:11.760> good<00:04:11.970> car<00:04:12.209> in<00:04:12.299> the<00:04:12.359> high<00:04:12.450> speed<00:04:12.690> but<00:04:12.870> as

need a good car in the high speed but as

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.559 
need a good car in the high speed but as
a<00:04:12.989> good<00:04:13.290> car<00:04:13.470> on<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.709> slow<00:04:13.920> corners<00:04:14.160> and<00:04:14.569> is

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
a good car on the slow corners and is

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.509 
a good car on the slow corners and is
not<00:04:15.720> easy<00:04:15.989> so<00:04:16.350> that's<00:04:16.709> why<00:04:16.859> we<00:04:16.890> working<00:04:17.489> so

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
not easy so that's why we working so

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.610 
not easy so that's why we working so
hard<00:04:17.789> to<00:04:18.090> try<00:04:18.120> to<00:04:18.539> bring<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:18.989> best<00:04:19.140> we<00:04:19.320> can<00:04:19.470> to

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
I was not happy with the qualifying you

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.150 
I was not happy with the qualifying you
know<00:04:47.790> we<00:04:48.090> took<00:04:48.479> a<00:04:48.630> bit<00:04:48.780> of<00:04:48.810> time<00:04:48.990> to<00:04:49.380> go<00:04:49.530> out<00:04:49.740> and

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
know we took a bit of time to go out and

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.550 
know we took a bit of time to go out and
it<00:04:50.940> starts<00:04:51.210> raining<00:04:51.360> very<00:04:51.600> heavily<00:04:51.960> when<00:04:52.410> we

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
it starts raining very heavily when we

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.920 
it starts raining very heavily when we
go<00:04:52.740> out<00:04:52.889> on<00:04:53.070> the<00:04:53.160> track<00:04:53.400> in<00:04:53.760> the<00:04:53.820> q1<00:04:54.240> and<00:04:54.449> will

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
go out on the track in the q1 and will

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.430 
go out on the track in the q1 and will
be<00:04:55.050> the<00:04:55.680> war<00:04:55.889> eliminated<00:04:56.610> so<00:04:57.260> that<00:04:58.260> is

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
be the war eliminated so that is

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.830 
be the war eliminated so that is
something<00:04:58.590> that<00:04:58.949> the<00:04:59.910> race<00:05:00.090> was<00:05:00.120> really<00:05:00.540> good

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
something that the race was really good

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.810 
something that the race was really good
but<00:05:01.350> suppose<00:05:01.770> should<00:05:01.919> be<00:05:02.010> much<00:05:02.190> better<00:05:02.430> start

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
but suppose should be much better start

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.950 
but suppose should be much better start
in<00:05:02.940> the<00:05:03.389> normal<00:05:03.870> position<00:05:04.190> so<00:05:05.190> and<00:05:06.180> then<00:05:06.360> China

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
in the normal position so and then China

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.439 
in the normal position so and then China

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.050 
think we need to improve the car from
the<00:07:00.780> performance<00:07:01.380> point<00:07:01.560> of<00:07:01.680> view<00:07:01.830> if<00:07:02.669> I<00:07:02.880> look

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.060 
the performance point of view if I look

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.510 
the performance point of view if I look
where<00:07:03.720> we<00:07:03.870> are<00:07:04.020> compared<00:07:04.560> to<00:07:04.710> the<00:07:04.830> competitors

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 
where we are compared to the competitors

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.589 
where we are compared to the competitors
and<00:07:06.030> I<00:07:06.780> would<00:07:06.930> say<00:07:07.199> that<00:07:07.729> the<00:07:08.729> fastest<00:07:09.180> car<00:07:09.479> in

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 
and I would say that the fastest car in

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:12.980 
and I would say that the fastest car in
this<00:07:09.720> moment<00:07:09.960> is<00:07:10.470> the<00:07:10.740> red<00:07:10.889> book<00:07:11.130> are<00:07:11.870> we<00:07:12.870> are

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:12.990 
this moment is the red book are we are

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.120 
this moment is the red book are we are
slightly<00:07:13.349> behind<00:07:13.740> and<00:07:14.430> we<00:07:15.210> need<00:07:15.360> to<00:07:15.780> recover<00:07:16.710> I

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:17.130 
slightly behind and we need to recover I

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.790 
slightly behind and we need to recover I
think<00:07:17.550> from<00:07:18.240> the<00:07:18.659> our<00:07:18.810> dynamic<00:07:19.229> performer

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 
think from the our dynamic performer

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.000 
think from the our dynamic performer
point<00:07:20.039> of<00:07:20.190> view<00:07:20.370> but<00:07:21.380> that's<00:07:22.380> only<00:07:22.530> the<00:07:22.680> main

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.010 
point of view but that's only the main

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.360 
point of view but that's only the main
aspect<00:07:23.610> in<00:07:24.150> all<00:07:24.599> the<00:07:24.810> rest<00:07:24.990> of<00:07:25.169> the<00:07:25.289> car<00:07:25.560> if<00:07:26.099> we

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:26.370 
aspect in all the rest of the car if we

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.270 
aspect in all the rest of the car if we
can<00:07:26.610> generate<00:07:27.000> better<00:07:27.990> lap<00:07:28.409> time<00:07:28.680> we<00:07:29.099> will

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 
can generate better lap time we will

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.339 
can generate better lap time we will
introduce<00:07:29.550> you<00:07:29.789> of<00:07:30.000> course<00:07:30.240> as<00:07:30.690> many

00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:31.349 
introduce you of course as many

00:07:31.349 --> 00:07:34.669 
introduce you of course as many
modification<00:07:32.130> as<00:07:32.250> we<00:07:32.430> could
