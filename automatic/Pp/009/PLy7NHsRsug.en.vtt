00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.360
 a change 

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.360
 ah 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.530
 Clear 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.769
 very good everything goes up here as always 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:13.869
 with more peace field and this time with another 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.580
 video related to ratify it 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:17.289
 but rather something different from what 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.640
 I usually comment in general and how 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.800
 probably already seen by the 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.840
 title today I decided to bring the 5 things that 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.820
 I would not like to see butterfield heart 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.259
 lane although I'm very excited about what 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.969
 which is the launch of the game despite 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.349
 of all the controversy that has already had 

00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:31.300
 from the moment it was announced 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.920
 there are always some things that we do not 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.870
 they finish convincing I invite them to 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.309
 share yours in the down in the 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.620
 comment section but as always 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.690
 let's start with point number one and without 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.630
 no particular order obviously 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.250
 well the first thing would be the reduced damage 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.960
 in what are all firearms 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.760
 automatic like assault rifles 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.930
 light machine guns defense weapons 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.730
 personal although there will be no 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.910
 light machine guns for each for 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.570
 some kind is more difficult is 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.790
 simply an example so that 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.010
 understand what I mean and what was 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.020
 part of a change that was made in the 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.970
 ct was passed after the game all 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.250
 this the excuse behind is to keep the 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.990
 time to kill that there with each weapon 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.630
 in the game of the automatic weapon 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.400
 obviously in this case in this case 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.750
 balanced to what it was before it 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.860
 did the ned changes with the 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.690
 change the movement of 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.060
 etcetera etcetera was removed 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.950
 visual recoil a lot of things is 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.270
 not just something that I never like 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.310
 I agreed to reduce the 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.980
 I think it adds less damage 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.870
 get more tactical forgiveness to the game every 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.000
 time it becomes a little more arcade and it's 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.680
 something that I do not like at all if 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.270
 I do not like to get to the extreme of 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.280
 what hardcore the game is also not 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.570
 balanced for that in my opinion the 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.460
 reduced damage of 25 24 and 34 33 broke the 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.140
 balance between many weapons within the 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.780
 which is a slow cadence weapon with a weapon 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.920
 faster firing rate 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.720
 I just did not like it I would like it 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.940
 let's go back to what was in battle 3 and 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.509
 bati phil 4 before the patch that 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:58.119
 ordinary weapons had 25 of the maximum year 18 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:02.530
 minimal damage or those that had a caliber 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:04.660
 highest they had 34 to 25 point number 2 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.759
 is the subject of assault rifles 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.770
 dominating before any class and in 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.320
 practically although they do not dominate in 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.360
 all situations are too 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.130
 solid let's say in any kind of 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.930
 confrontation society close combat 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.540
 with more than half distance or combat 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.430
 long distance it seems to me that something 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.530
 it would have to be done to be 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.939
 little while they were versatile as 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.489
 they are now as can also be 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:30.700
 carbines not that they are not so versatile 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:33.400
 so good in all kinds of situations 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.250
 for example a personal defense weapon is 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.109
 good is decently pretty good 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.180
 we could go to close combat already 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:42.040
 Medium long distance combat is 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.200
 simply a disgust is almost unusable 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.120
 however the assault rifle is 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.359
 pretty good at short distances 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.010
 let's say that one of each hamas are 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:53.919
 pretty good weapons at close range 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.450
 in the middle distance they are quite good and 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:57.220
 at long distances there are other reflexes 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.109
 assault that are also decent though 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.150
 there are some that are a little more stable 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:03.480
 between what is short stockings and long 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.159
 there are some that are a little more for 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.889
 you cut a little more for stockings and you do not 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:10.689
 both in long distances in me in my 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:12.849
 say we are too good at 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:13.810
 all situations weapons 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.599
 you prefer high I'm referring 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.000
 obviously I would not like there to be a 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.819
 good balance and that each each 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.829
 weapons category was good but very 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.449
 good in what is for example weapons 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.060
 personal defense in close combat 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:29.470
 sniper profile in combat 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.360
 what is long distance and what does not 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.040
 there can simply come a person with 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.130
 high rules and be good at any 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.010
 situation type point number 3 would be 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.930
 the 10,000 explosives that has more than 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.880
 phil 4 although I think that giving a rumor 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.680
 there or someone said there are not so many 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.780
 explosive attacks will fix is ​​something that 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.370
 I would like to see not completely 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.970
 removed the game but not that there 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.130
 we could both put some grenade and 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.349
 that a rpg and even there we are say 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.440
 maybe some weapon in some vehicle and 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.630
 up there simply because I think 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.360
 that brings the fun to the game and that 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.000
 you can think a lot you can think 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.739
 tactically avoid ways to control 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.569
 so that they do not kill us for example by 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.730
 back that they kill us in the side that does not 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.680
 we are flan to destroy us whatever 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.440
 but with the subject of explosives like 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.419
 what is the mortar the yucca bird and all 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.220
 that thing we just can not 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.169
 predict it in a tactical way not 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.600
 we can be a plan so that we do not 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.280
 affect in certain ways if I have in 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.169
 my partner looking at my back I already 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.120
 I know I will trust you that they are not going to 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.800
 kill from the back instead when 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.470
 come cassava and you fall from the sky and you 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.390
 explodes in the head 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.870
 I do not think it's fun for anyone 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.880
 happened point number 4 the subject 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.370
 of the headley you are seeing is being 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.350
 seen but not on the ct 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.270
 I would like to see it finally removed 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.980
 for those who do not know is when we are 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.990
 behind a cover in which 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.700
 we only see for example half 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.110
 from the head up or the forehead 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.880
 up or we are only seen the 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.620
 head however the person who is 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.780
 behind that coverage can shoot 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.220
 as if his weapon was sticking out 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.960
 up the coverage in some way 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.880
 this because it's because in the game 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.650
 let's say we could say that the 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.300
 bullets do not leave the gun barrel in 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.190
 actually come out of the height of 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.920
 your eyes then we can 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.690
 just be peeping our foreheads 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.400
 for example, what a person would see 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.440
 a person from another point of view 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.880
 however we can shoot at a 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.500
 person on the other side of the 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.380
 coverage as if our weapon already 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.230
 I say was at the height of the head 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.750
 point number 5 and final although I have a 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.030
 bonus point also that is the guns 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:36.240
 blocked by class that we saw in what 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.880
 it was a little bit of gameplay that was 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.320
 gave for some youtube make an event 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.130
 it does not finish convincing me I like the 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.230
 freedom 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.790
 I think row row had gone a long way 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.740
 that in butterfield 4 of the freedom of 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.090
 If you want to be long - distance passes 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.320
 long distance and you want to be cut 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.880
 is in this court are you if you want 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.890
 do this this can be this can be all 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.140
 what you want to play but when you 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.180
 bat fix it if I want to use my gun 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.700
 what I like in all the classes 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.800
 I can and I think it's going to end 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.480
 bringing a little trouble and I'm not going to 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.620
 do the only one who does not like that 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.840
 idea that the guns are 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.330
 blocked for each class 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.889
 and the bonus point that maybe some of me 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.510
 they will hate maybe not 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:14.639
 obviously remember that all this is 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.479
 a personal opinion and you can 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.430
 have a completely opinion 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:19.530
 different and that's perfect but it 's the 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:22.139
 theme of the former sister everywhere 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.330
 absolutely the game full of terex and 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:27.210
 developers focusing on more in 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:29.310
 put interest or give clues that 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.960
 will try to fix the game as in 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.180
 butterfield 4 that has had many 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.430
 problems still have them and there is a 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.930
 interest side by side I would like that 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.000
 there were some that another is not always 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.680
 fun to see how maybe he's in 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.630
 name that the plant is the plan of the 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.729
 surf zombies for example the megalodon 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.740
 It was very good too but we did not 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:49.370
 let's cross the line with the odd 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.660
 I would think it would be too good 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.190
 but good that has been everything for today 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.200
 I hope you liked this video 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.669
 as I said earlier I would like 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.650
 listen to what things they would not like to see 

00:06:56.669 --> 00:07:01.639
 you in mate land land and see you the 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.639
 next chau
