00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.320
 Y 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.059
 hello girls welcome to this new 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.160
 video today I bring you the 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.770
 products that I would not buy again and 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.539
 some alternatives for them as well 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.730
 that if you are interested in knowing 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.070
 which of all the products that I have 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.260
 purchased lately I would not go back to 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.260
 buy keep watching this video 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.110
 lip products I have quite like this 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.000
 that I will not extend in each of 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.500
 them but the first thing I want 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.360
 to mention is something that many of you 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:45.900
 maybe you love and are the mascara show to these 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.760
 labial or I do not know lip gloss or like 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.280
 want to call you in a 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.739
 incredible pigmentation they look very 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.460
 beautiful the colors are beautiful the two 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:00.900
 that I bought I are mate once in nude and 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.730
 clips and the other one is in the moon color and 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.860
 as you can see the colors that 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.869
 they are really beautiful but the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.970
 problem that I have with these products 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.430
 lip is that they are so creamy that they 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.490
 they come out of my mouth and ends up being 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.289
 really a disaster so five 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.810
 dollars for each of these products 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:20.160
 that I can not keep on my lips that 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.039
 I have to be retouching after 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.039
 half an hour or an hour definitely not 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:27.690
 I recommend it I feel that they do not work and 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:30.630
 if I have an alternative for him and 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.610
 these are the knicks barrel onces I have 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.560
 Various colors in my favorite of all 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.570
 the times is this that is incredible 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.520
 as you can see up here the 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.270
 pigmentation is very similar to the 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.280
 difference is that the mascara ones are more 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.590
 liquids and these are a little more like 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.409
 gel consistency that stays the 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:55.560
 lips for more time have install 499 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:57.729
 the ones with mascara come out 499 points 549 and 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.979
 I definitely would not buy it again 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.869
 but if I'm going to be buying more than 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.700
 these nicks for classes because I feel 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.780
 they do the same thing, nothing more than better 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.369
 than to another product that does not 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.739
 I would buy casually from 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.479
 knicks and that's going to show you that 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.400
 simply not because being a brand 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.530
 specifically, it is going to be a product that 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.230
 I will definitely like it 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.420
 this is the extremely green and it is the color 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.459
 natural the color looks very nice as 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.130
 you can see there but it's not 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:29.489
 really the color that comes out the color that 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:33.390
 it comes out like I do not know I do not know it 's a color 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:35.370
 pink but consultant see us 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.130
 in my lips they remain as I am a 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.620
 zombie this is supposed to dry up and it 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.120
 it is completely matt helps to be 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.280
 much more time the lips but 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.319
 I feel that this gets into each of 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.690
 the wrinkles of my lips in each one 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.150
 from those places in the corners and from 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.220
 true, even though I had a lot of time 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.840
 They last in a way that I like 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.690
 that I would not buy these nicks again 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.489
 extreme free another product that is not 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.260
 I would recommend neither to my worst enemy and not 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.750
 I'm going to extend on him is this webcam 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.000
 wild makeup remove and definitely 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.040
 this like applying alcohol to your eyes 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.340
 just like applying alcohol to your eyes 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.590
 it smells alcohol burns does not take away the 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.540
 makeup gives a lot of work to invite 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.760
 the makeup and as you can see is 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.070
 almost full because I used it once and 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.870
 I was ready to throw it away 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.150
 I kept only because I wanted 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.739
 show it to you but definitely if 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.019
 they want an eye make-up remover 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.880
 I'm going to recommend one that 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.880
 I will leave the name in the box 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.240
 of information come out 99 cents or 2 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.340
 Dollars 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.290
 beautiful and removes all makeup 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.810
 however this 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.330
 it did not come out super cheap I think it came out 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.890
 in 399 and definitely not what 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.230
 I recommend another of the products that do not 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.650
 I would buy again is this eyeliner 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:55.060
 elf brain in eyeliner definitely 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.710
 this is one of those delineators that if 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.050
 well it's super black and I'll leave it 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.570
 settle down a little bit runs for all 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.340
 sides does not work for the water line 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.140
 it serves as a shadow base because of 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.570
 it's really so creamy that you run for 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.760
 everywhere so a dollar but 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.380
 It was definitely not worth it if 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.620
 you want a good eyeliner 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.780
 recommend tuff guys made to last for 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.930
 jordan they are called liquid eyeliner 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.450
 in black point two dollars come out maybe 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.500
 a dollar more than this but 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.600
 definitely this is a product that 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.340
 I do not recommend I would not buy again and 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.200
 it really does not work for its purpose 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.730
 another product that I think I mentioned 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.830
 previously but it's worth it 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:36.130
 highlighting that I would not buy again is 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.860
 this mascara is a mascara eyeliner in 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.120
 The nude color is very dry for my eyes 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.370
 and I feel that really 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.320
 I have to stretch the ones that I have to 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.470
 do a lot of work going on several times 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.910
 in that delicate area of ​​the eyes there 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.430
 I would definitely buy it again 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.440
 I can use another jordan in one color 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.710
 very similar and have better results 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.780
 three more products that remain and two of 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.480
 lips and one of eyes the first of eyes 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:05.470
 is this perfect care 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:07.060
 of annual webb has on one side the part 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.780
 white that was supposed to want 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:13.330
 compare it with pencil knicks in fear 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.950
 that but it's really white but it's 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.650
 transparent you can see the skin 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:20.290
 perfectly so it's not what I 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.110
 I was looking for the eyeliner, but it's good and 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.880
 it's dark I feel like it's done with 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.550
 materials so cheap that the 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.530
 lid comes out on both sides the 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:34.880
 product is out at this time not 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:38.510
 it comes out but it usually falls white and 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:41.050
 no no, although it has two products and 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.850
 I really like the ease I feel that at 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.590
 to be so badly done yes that this comes out 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.450
 I can not take it to the portfolio that was 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.050
 for the purpose that I wanted it two 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:53.180
 products in one save you place but 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.970
 definitely not this is something that 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.710
 I would buy again I feel they are wrong 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.420
 facts I feel that the product is nothing 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.330
 spectacular and that is not the most 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:04.970
 economic as to say justify 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.070
 the wrong done or the package so bad that 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.080
 has this web webcam product the 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.390
 second product is something very similar to 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.480
 one side has the lipstick and the 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:17.000
 another side has the eyeliner once 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.280
 more the idea is to save place in the 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.640
 portfolio and that's why I bought it and if 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.730
 well the colors are very beautiful 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:27.590
 I feel that once again it is so bad 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:30.160
 made the packaging so poorly made the 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:33.890
 packaging that I have come to do any 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.510
 disaster in my portfolio I would not return it to 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.130
 buy I feel that it's nothing 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.260
 spectacular the colors are not 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.639
 really so exclusive as to say 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.490
 well worth it 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:45.289
 and once again that is, it was economical 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:48.169
 but not so cheap to have done it 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:50.240
 so bad and having put these layers on so 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:52.520
 cheap that are definitely 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.710
 drying the product very fast so 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.439
 unfortunately the idea is good but 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:07:00.169
 it did not work for me finally something that 

00:06:57.439 --> 00:07:01.729
 also came to my bag ipsi that many 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:04.520
 of you know that this is my pop 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:08.419
 beauty this I definitely do not like 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:11.629
 it has an extremely strong smell like 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:13.460
 I do not know how to chemistry as something that does not 

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:15.110
 I know too strong for my taste like that 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.430
 that this is something that I would not go back to 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.319
 buy and I'm happy that I 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.479
 they sent in my bag and yes because of 

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:22.520
 I was really tempted to buy some 

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:24.259
 colors in a is less bad that you do not 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.569
 I did because I definitely would have 

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:28.279
 had to return good girls that has 

00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:30.250
 been all for today I hope that 

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:32.180
 have enjoyed this video 

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.800
 I definitely wanted to give them some 

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.389
 alternatives to those products that do not 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.490
 they work so I hope that they have 

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:38.719
 Leave it in the comments like the 

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.819
 products that you have tried 

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:43.249
 lately and they would not buy again 

00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:44.689
 that way he avoids me in the bad time I send you a 

00:07:43.249 --> 00:07:48.460
 very big kiss and see you in the video 

00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:48.460
