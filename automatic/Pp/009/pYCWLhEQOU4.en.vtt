00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
one being the Nissan GTR I mean that's a

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:32.190 
one being the Nissan GTR I mean that's a
great<00:03:30.939> transmission<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:31.719> the<00:03:31.870> other<00:03:32.019> one

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
great transmission and the other one

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.920 
great transmission and the other one
being<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.650> 7-speed<00:03:33.189> automatic<00:03:33.430> transmission

here<00:03:34.930> in<00:03:35.049> the<00:03:35.140> c63<00:03:35.709> got<00:03:36.459> these<00:03:36.549> paddle

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
here in the c63 got these paddle

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.869 
here in the c63 got these paddle
shifters<00:03:37.420> and<00:03:37.629> the<00:03:38.079> shifts<00:03:38.349> are<00:03:38.439> so<00:03:38.769> quick<00:03:39.549> and
