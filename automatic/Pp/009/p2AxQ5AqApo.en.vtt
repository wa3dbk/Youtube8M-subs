00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
first one called Tracy you just draw

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.200 
first one called Tracy you just draw
lines<00:01:00.079> on<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:00.500> screen<00:01:00.649> and<00:01:01.100> then<00:01:01.850> the

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
lines on the screen and then the

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.880 
lines on the screen and then the
plankton<00:01:02.570> will<00:01:02.750> follow<00:01:02.989> those<00:01:03.260> lines<00:01:03.530> and

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
plankton will follow those lines and

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.310 
plankton will follow those lines and
create<00:01:04.399> piano<00:01:04.759> tones<00:01:05.119> as<00:01:05.449> it<00:01:05.660> goes<00:01:06.020> and

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
create piano tones as it goes and

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.590 
create piano tones as it goes and
depending<00:01:07.190> on<00:01:07.250> how<00:01:07.310> fast<00:01:07.700> you<00:01:08.060> draw<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.300> line

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
depending on how fast you draw the line

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.359 
depending on how fast you draw the line
and<00:01:08.869> where<00:01:09.080> you<00:01:09.229> draw<00:01:09.440> the<00:01:09.470> line<00:01:09.619> and<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.100> kind

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
and where you draw the line and the kind

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.430 
and where you draw the line and the kind
of<00:01:10.430> pattern<00:01:10.789> to<00:01:10.850> draw<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:11.090> lines<00:01:11.330> in<00:01:11.600> will

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
of pattern to draw the lines in will

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.490 
of pattern to draw the lines in will
determine<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:12.920> tones<00:01:13.220> that<00:01:13.460> it<00:01:13.549> makes<00:01:14.500> the

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
determine the tones that it makes the

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.990 
determine the tones that it makes the
hand<00:01:15.680> bow<00:01:15.860> plankton<00:01:16.310> seemed<00:01:16.520> the<00:01:16.640> most<00:01:16.760> like

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
hand bow plankton seemed the most like

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.179 
hand bow plankton seemed the most like
an<00:01:17.119> actual<00:01:17.240> game<00:01:17.689> of<00:01:18.200> all<00:01:18.409> of<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.650> plankton<00:01:19.010> in

an actual game of all of the plankton in

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.460 
an actual game of all of the plankton in
electroplankton<00:01:19.810> because<00:01:20.810> you<00:01:21.080> can<00:01:21.229> actually

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
electroplankton because you can actually

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.200 
electroplankton because you can actually
affect<00:01:22.040> the<00:01:22.280> environment<00:01:22.400> that<00:01:22.880> you're<00:01:23.030> in

tapping<00:01:47.720> on<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:48.500> touch<00:01:48.680> screen<00:01:48.860> you<00:01:49.490> can

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
tapping on the the touch screen you can

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.550 
tapping on the the touch screen you can
actually<00:01:49.759> record<00:01:50.180> sounds<00:01:50.840> in<00:01:50.990> some<00:01:51.259> of<00:01:51.380> them

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
actually record sounds in some of them

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.469 
actually record sounds in some of them
and<00:01:51.770> then<00:01:52.100> have<00:01:52.310> them<00:01:52.340> start<00:01:52.729> looping<00:01:52.909> back<00:01:53.180> to

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
and then have them start looping back to

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:54.880 
and then have them start looping back to
you<00:01:53.630> I<00:01:53.840> actually<00:01:54.140> had<00:01:54.439> a<00:01:54.470> really<00:01:54.530> interesting

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
you I actually had a really interesting

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.380 
you I actually had a really interesting
experience<00:01:55.520> with<00:01:55.640> this<00:01:55.790> I<00:01:55.909> was<00:01:56.030> playing<00:01:56.270> the

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
experience with this I was playing the

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.270 
experience with this I was playing the
game<00:01:56.540> on<00:01:56.689> the<00:01:56.780> bus<00:01:57.020> and<00:01:57.350> so<00:01:57.860> I<00:01:57.890> would<00:01:58.040> just

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
game on the bus and so I would just

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.399 
game on the bus and so I would just
start<00:01:58.460> recording<00:01:58.880> random<00:01:59.509> sounds<00:02:00.140> that<00:02:00.229> I<00:02:00.259> was

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
start recording random sounds that I was

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.200 
start recording random sounds that I was
hearing<00:02:00.710> and<00:02:00.979> it<00:02:01.369> would<00:02:01.460> start<00:02:01.640> looping<00:02:01.880> and

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
hearing and it would start looping and

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.350 
hearing and it would start looping and
you<00:02:02.570> would<00:02:02.720> start<00:02:02.899> realizing<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.740> sort<00:02:03.979> of

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
you would start realizing the sort of

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.090 
you would start realizing the sort of
random<00:02:05.360> patterns<00:02:05.810> that<00:02:06.079> would<00:02:06.320> emerge<00:02:06.860> and

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
random patterns that would emerge and

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.069 
random patterns that would emerge and
you<00:02:07.189> would<00:02:07.310> start<00:02:07.549> hearing<00:02:08.090> what<00:02:08.840> sounded

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:09.079 
you would start hearing what sounded

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:11.380 
you would start hearing what sounded
like<00:02:09.140> music<00:02:09.440> out<00:02:09.769> of<00:02:09.799> just<00:02:10.100> noise<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:11.180> that's

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
like music out of just noise and that's

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.580 
like music out of just noise and that's
kind<00:02:11.660> of<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.870> gist<00:02:12.079> of<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.470> olive

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
kind of the gist of the olive

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.970 
kind of the gist of the olive
electroplankton<00:02:13.310> is<00:02:14.260> turning<00:02:15.260> music<00:02:15.739> out<00:02:15.920> of

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
electroplankton is turning music out of

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.699 
electroplankton is turning music out of
just<00:02:16.430> seemingly<00:02:16.760> random<00:02:17.180> chaos<00:02:17.569> part<00:02:18.560> of<00:02:18.650> the

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
just seemingly random chaos part of the

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.590 
just seemingly random chaos part of the
problem<00:02:18.980> with<00:02:19.340> electroplankton<00:02:20.000> though

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
problem with electroplankton though

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.150 
problem with electroplankton though
is<00:02:20.660> that<00:02:21.550> there's<00:02:22.550> really<00:02:22.850> no<00:02:23.270> end<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:24.890> your

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
is that there's really no end to your

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.980 
is that there's really no end to your
creativity<00:02:25.670> you<00:02:26.000> can<00:02:26.150> noodle<00:02:26.420> around<00:02:26.510> with

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
creativity you can noodle around with

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.230 
creativity you can noodle around with
these<00:02:27.170> little<00:02:27.380> toys<00:02:27.620> for<00:02:28.070> a<00:02:28.100> while<00:02:28.310> but<00:02:29.150> you

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
these little toys for a while but you

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.640 
these little toys for a while but you
can<00:02:29.360> never<00:02:29.450> really<00:02:29.690> capture<00:02:30.170> anything<00:02:30.350> you<00:02:30.500> do

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
can never really capture anything you do

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.380 
can never really capture anything you do
if<00:02:30.830> you<00:02:30.920> have<00:02:31.070> some<00:02:31.250> sort<00:02:31.400> of<00:02:31.520> great<00:02:31.820> moment<00:02:32.330> of
