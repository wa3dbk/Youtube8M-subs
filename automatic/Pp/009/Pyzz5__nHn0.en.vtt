00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:12.280
 It was an approximate of 12 to 15 thousand pesos 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:15.559
 of one that I have 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.260
 it goes a lot now like some and like the 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:21.440
 country in a single with everything from 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:26.650
 inscriptions and expenses of useful shoes 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.650
 and all like five thousand and study 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.279
 hainan 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.480
 that in each much to them 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:50.050
 3 and I'm with the 50 150 thousand between 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.890
 pets books 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.530
 the shoe 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.440
 conchi the all the gentiles this with 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.480
 the 50 miles then at least me 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.059
 I buy you the minimum pants 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.479
 we will attend the 4 to have one so 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.360
 less than doing a game between days 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:13.810
 of the week but what are the pitchers 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.810
 that are 450 to almost 500 pesos 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.860
 the seven sports also the 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.320
 sports positions that also have 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.270
 another hard or is I am I am 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.229
 estimating now approximately 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:30.080
 with the used books like 25 thousand pesos 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.060
 deeply that without counting the 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.610
 instruction that this intuition is another 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.009
 story for me right now it's going to 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.310
 spend a lot of money the least that 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:43.550
 spend a boy where 56 is minimal 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:48.080
 camelot and calculate all global uniforms 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:51.170
 shoes for the black in all this 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.840
 well roughly imagine that 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.320
 some 15 thousand pesos for a child of 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.270
 six years I understand you know that 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.430
 depends on the pulse that they are because that 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.159
 Sometimes there is with the biography of the bad book 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.119
 worst 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.119
 the numbers 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.539
 put your fingers 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:19.730
 carefully to part of the uniforms of the 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.730
 new plan as 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:32.549
 a lot of money does not spend because 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:36.420
 imagine uniform shoe backpack 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:40.049
 all of all that is a problem every 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.730
 year and that as I tell you that's a 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.849
 investment with a trusting base but 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.959
 too much money he spends everything everything is 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:50.060
 expensive kann every day 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.890
 good 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.420
 good only in it more than six thousand 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.410
 times 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.540
 in uniform shoes and books and you 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.370
 you know you do not have to be looking 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:07.770
 changing the average of five thousand pesos 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.470
 three thousand five hundred three or four 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.660
 thousand pesos of new coloma shares 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.010
 minima 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:19.140
 at the level of old shirt pants 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.760
 something else can be spent more sustenance 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.319
 that he will have q give larios 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.319
 let's go out in the five suns 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.540
 backpack 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.209
 5 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.220
 some 2500 pesos because the thing is 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.680
 too big the car was 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.250
 too much for images and you that 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.250
 we can be
