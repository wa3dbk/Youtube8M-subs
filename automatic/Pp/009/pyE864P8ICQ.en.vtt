00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.849
 the first sentence we now here ourselves 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:22.859
 to remind you again 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:30.539
 is write to the central bureau 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:31.439
 for i angle set albeit the german one 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.950
 expert 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.700
 because now others are sure 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:42.420
 centers on rehwinkel set so cheeky 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.230
 once again on our sketch 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.230
 concentrated 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.129
 I already said conditions is that 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.289
 The most important condition is that both 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.149
 the center we as well as the 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.210
 corresponding premium over one 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.609
 interesting tendon is built 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.080
 So now I have one of my own 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.119
 seen singled out that has 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.119
 course designed that again at 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.880
 may have a different situation playing 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.590
 So really no role is important 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:19.280
 that the centro angle is over this long 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.439
 league and also bring the corresponding 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:27.720
 where completely indifferent where the 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:30.659
 focus is on a point of this 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.640
 circle line and the special thing about it is 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.829
 that one sees a beautiful sums up visually 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:40.140
 in this sketch that this on it 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.439
 usually only half as big as that 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.020
 associated centro angle or 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.560
 reversed this center angle is 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.149
 twice as big as that of the friedinger 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.399
 over the same scene 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:57.570
 So that's some already came 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:00.060
 Rate this Rehwinkel to set one 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.810
 could that be correct in a sentence now 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.810
 formulation 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:09.290
 lecturer rehwinkel over a tendon of a 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:13.160
 Circle is twice as big as one 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:17.090
 robot same tendon or similar 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.950
 So the formulation is now by itself 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.050
 yourself depending on how you do that with yours 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.720
 bringing out moths does not matter 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.630
 as a simple equation that formulates 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:33.980
 I would now times still write 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:37.610
 could one formulate it so alpha 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:41.120
 my goal for angle is twice as 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:44.090
 big as my peter 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.660
 So double size means two so 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.220
 great that we are so simple 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.350
 Presentation in the form of a simple 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.260
 of course I could do that as well 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:57.470
 show in reverse that I say I 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.870
 press peter as beta down on it 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.410
 Of course, Rehwinkel is half the size of 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.380
 the corresponding center or the same 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.350
 gene so that Peter would be the same 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.950
 home mathematically as same wins 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:16.430
 is one the same statement usual 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.070
 this formulation you need that 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.320
 So just so easy to remember the 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.970
 same scene center left always the 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.340
 scene is twice as big as that 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:33.290
 all that satisfies everything is in 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:36.920
 order we come now to the second 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:41.270
 sentence that I would like to hint for a moment 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.640
 the second sentence about angles at one 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.840
 circle and this sentence never my thing 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.840
 seasoned forever 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.440
 the order of these sentences has 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:00.560
 no meaning that much 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.400
 polite world so it could be completely 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.260
 be mixed 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.660
 which plays no role of 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.780
 nimble set here again we have 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.900
 a little sketch you at the blackboard 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:15.230
 is projected 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:17.450
 Now please excuse us so please 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.840
 look at a really x-arbitrary 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.700
 Circle correctly, you would have here 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.040
 always the center and denote 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.970
 have to be okay that's not the biggest 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.600
 problem 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:32.240
 Now there are two points on this circle 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.490
 line marked a and b is really 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.130
 chosen arbitrarily and I have now 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.290
 Just put the circle in between 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.440
 These two score a bit 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:45.170
 Reinforced simply outlines something 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.580
 highlighted and show 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:52.040
 a little bit and now comes on 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:05:00.380
 We call it by this arc 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:05:03.950
 times b are two angles drawn 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.990
 became white from the previous sentence 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.840
 already that I am here for sure 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.090
 traded berra frieling I have 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.790
 This time with caa1 designation at that time 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:17.120
 26 chosen arbitrarily 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:20.300
 the sparkling points are somewhere 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.840
 on the circle line if you are yourself 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.010
 understand there could be that 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.030
 very easy with your protractor 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.000
 check 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.820
 if you now purely optical said the 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.220
 board of excitement law is yet 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.560
 no simple the angles see 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:40.280
 right the same as if she always 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:43.190
 all tasting drawing here means one 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.950
 point a and 1 points on the circle line 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.540
 firmly by saarburg 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.220
 clearly marked in the certificate 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.700
 about two really arbitrary 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:55.580
 Backwinkel creates the protractor and 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:58.010
 Measure this luck gamma 1 and this 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:02.030
 campus 2 or call them different alpha 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:04.040
 and beta or how you then want to have 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:09.830
 you realize it is true 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:13.430
 gamma 1 is equal to 2 and if you 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:16.430
 that as formulated then you needed 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:19.390
 since some would be so hard 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:22.850
 just say two on the left 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:25.550
 over one seldom bow are the same 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.710
 big and kids that shape others too 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.920
 sometime all peripheral minke one 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.280
 circle over the bow b are the same 

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.330
 large 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:37.490
 So that means all I can do here 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:43.190
 could set any number of points 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:46.370
 okay he say with this point and call 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:49.070
 the memorial 3 also you can travel the 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:54.850
 same size if you you say yes as 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:54.850
 Looks like it's out of here 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:02.500
 if i have this angle 9.4 also this one 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:07.580
 left would be exactly the same size 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:11.270
 important to everyone is the riml over 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:13.430
 the same arch are located 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:17.170
 the same size that is the so-called 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.170
 murphy angle set
