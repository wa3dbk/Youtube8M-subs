lead up with anything but uh you know I

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.960 
lead up with anything but uh you know I
thought<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.830> could<00:00:29.039> live<00:00:29.189> with<00:00:29.279> my<00:00:29.519> Landorus

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
thought I could live with my Landorus

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.609 
thought I could live with my Landorus
and<00:00:30.210> really<00:00:30.660> anything<00:00:30.900> he<00:00:31.170> leads<00:00:31.410> off<00:00:31.590> with

and really anything he leads off with

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.060 
and really anything he leads off with
with<00:00:32.520> would<00:00:33.000> be<00:00:33.210> okay<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:34.110> was<00:00:34.559> thinking<00:00:34.710> he'll

with would be okay I was thinking he'll

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.920

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
probably leave with Rotom wash and if he

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.709 
probably leave with Rotom wash and if he
does<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.559> will<00:00:38.030> you<00:00:39.030> know<00:00:39.090> if<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.390> lead<00:00:39.600> off

hitmontop<00:01:36.930> now<00:01:37.259> i<00:01:37.290> don't<00:01:37.409> know<00:01:37.619> why<00:01:37.890> he<00:01:38.220> went

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
hitmontop now i don't know why he went

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.429 
hitmontop now i don't know why he went
him<00:01:38.610> on<00:01:38.759> top<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.180> was<00:01:39.420> thinking<00:01:39.600> he'll<00:01:40.170> probably

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
him on top I was thinking he'll probably

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.230 
him on top I was thinking he'll probably
go<00:01:40.710> into<00:01:40.920> Rotom<00:01:41.310> which<00:01:41.670> would<00:01:41.820> be<00:01:42.000> probably

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
go into Rotom which would be probably

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.969 
go into Rotom which would be probably
the<00:01:42.420> most<00:01:42.600> logical<00:01:42.810> thing<00:01:43.170> he<00:01:43.500> would<00:01:43.590> go<00:01:43.649> into

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
the most logical thing he would go into

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.609 
the most logical thing he would go into
but<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.610> don't<00:01:44.850> know<00:01:45.090> what<00:01:45.540> he<00:01:45.600> was<00:01:45.689> thinking<00:01:45.750> so

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
but I don't know what he was thinking so

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.920 
but I don't know what he was thinking so
you<00:01:47.130> know<00:01:47.250> sem<00:01:47.490> on<00:01:47.640> top<00:01:47.790> pretty<00:01:48.149> much<00:01:48.390> dies<00:01:48.630> in

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
you know sem on top pretty much dies in

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.490 
you know sem on top pretty much dies in
two<00:01:49.740> hits<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.700> yeah<00:01:51.390> did<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> hitmontop<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.290> dead

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
two hits so yeah did a hitmontop is dead

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.740 
two hits so yeah did a hitmontop is dead
and<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:53.340> get<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.000> make<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.329> out<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.600> here

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
and that get that make that out of here

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.740 
and that get that make that out of here
so<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.890> know<00:01:56.009> it's<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.610> know<00:01:56.700> turn<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.329> it's

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
the point and you know whatever so he

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.679 
the point and you know whatever so he
goes<00:02:03.450> into<00:02:03.659> gengar<00:02:04.020> gengar<00:02:05.329> he<00:02:06.329> switches<00:02:06.570> a

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
goes into gengar gengar he switches a

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.210 
goes into gengar gengar he switches a
double<00:02:07.140> switches<00:02:07.469> into<00:02:07.619> his<00:02:07.799> own

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
double switches into his own

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.160 
double switches into his own
as<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:09.210> go<00:02:09.390> into<00:02:09.540> my<00:02:09.690> Rotom<00:02:10.050> wash<00:02:11.330> and<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:13.050> know

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
as I go into my Rotom wash and you know

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.830 
as I go into my Rotom wash and you know
it's<00:02:13.320> that's<00:02:14.100> pretty<00:02:14.280> much<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.640> now<00:02:15.150> landers

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
it's that's pretty much that now landers

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.410 
it's that's pretty much that now landers
really<00:02:16.110> can't<00:02:16.290> touch<00:02:16.500> Rotom<00:02:17.070> that<00:02:17.490> much

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
really can't touch Rotom that much

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.480 
really can't touch Rotom that much
especially<00:02:18.780> if<00:02:19.200> he's<00:02:19.350> a<00:02:19.380> scarfed<00:02:19.830> one<00:02:20.070> which<00:02:20.340> i

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
especially if he's a scarfed one which i

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.070 
especially if he's a scarfed one which i
am<00:02:20.610> going<00:02:20.850> to<00:02:21.030> think<00:02:21.270> he<00:02:21.390> is<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.510> scarfed<00:02:21.930> one

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
am going to think he is a scarfed one

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.840 
am going to think he is a scarfed one
because<00:02:22.440> there's<00:02:22.770> nothing<00:02:22.920> else<00:02:23.190> really<00:02:23.520> much

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
because there's nothing else really much

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.120 
because there's nothing else really much
on<00:02:24.030> his<00:02:24.180> team<00:02:24.420> that<00:02:24.630> would<00:02:24.750> be<00:02:24.960> scarf<00:02:25.320> other

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
on his team that would be scarf other

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.340 
on his team that would be scarf other
than<00:02:26.430> his<00:02:26.550> wrote<00:02:26.700> his<00:02:27.060> own<00:02:27.090> Rotom<00:02:27.600> wash<00:02:27.780> so<00:02:28.110> I

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350

I think I just stay in and go for
another<00:03:30.209> hydro<00:03:30.720> pump<00:03:30.900> he<00:03:31.830> ends<00:03:32.010> up<00:03:32.070> going<00:03:32.190> for

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
another hydro pump he ends up going for

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.540 
another hydro pump he ends up going for
volts<00:03:32.670> which<00:03:32.850> goes<00:03:33.120> into<00:03:33.150> his<00:03:33.480> tyranitar<00:03:34.080> and

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
volts which goes into his tyranitar and

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.860 
volts which goes into his tyranitar and
yeah<00:03:35.550> I<00:03:35.580> think<00:03:35.760> yeah<00:03:36.180> I<00:03:36.209> just<00:03:36.480> kill<00:03:36.630> it<00:03:36.660> off

the waterfall I was fairly certain I

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.480 
the waterfall I was fairly certain I
live<00:04:26.990> a<00:04:27.020> waterfall<00:04:27.590> especially<00:04:28.220> since<00:04:28.340> he

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
live a waterfall especially since he

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.220 
live a waterfall especially since he
doesn't<00:04:28.640> have<00:04:28.760> life<00:04:29.060> orb<00:04:29.360> does<00:04:29.600> he<00:04:29.900> you<00:04:30.140> know

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.600 
doesn't have life orb does he you know
chose<00:04:30.620> later<00:04:31.190> but<00:04:31.880> um<00:04:32.030> he<00:04:32.570> gets<00:04:32.720> a<00:04:32.780> crit<00:04:32.990> and<00:04:33.110> uh

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
chose later but um he gets a crit and uh

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.390 
chose later but um he gets a crit and uh
yeah<00:04:34.900> sucks<00:04:35.900> and<00:04:36.170> you<00:04:36.830> know<00:04:36.920> as<00:04:37.040> you<00:04:37.100> can<00:04:37.250> see

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
yeah sucks and you know as you can see

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.100 
yeah sucks and you know as you can see
he<00:04:37.550> has<00:04:37.580> left<00:04:37.850> he's<00:04:38.030> not<00:04:38.210> live<00:04:38.390> for<00:04:38.600> so<00:04:39.080> I

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
he has left he's not live for so I

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.860 
he has left he's not live for so I
definitely<00:04:39.410> would<00:04:39.800> have<00:04:39.830> lived<00:04:40.100> that<00:04:40.870> but

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
definitely would have lived that but

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.260 
definitely would have lived that but
yeah<00:04:42.020> whatever<00:04:42.530> so<00:04:42.920> I<00:04:43.220> go<00:04:43.430> into<00:04:43.580> pincher<00:04:44.030> tit

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
yeah whatever so I go into pincher tit

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.690 
yeah whatever so I go into pincher tit
because<00:04:44.720> a<00:04:44.750> scissor<00:04:45.470> can<00:04:45.800> easily<00:04:46.280> live<00:04:46.490> a

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
because a scissor can easily live a

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.460 
because a scissor can easily live a
crunch<00:04:46.940> a<00:04:47.060> waterfall<00:04:47.450> or<00:04:47.480> an<00:04:47.960> earthquake<00:04:48.110> or

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
crunch a waterfall or an earthquake or

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.790 
crunch a waterfall or an earthquake or
anything<00:04:48.980> really<00:04:49.100> a<00:04:49.250> sharp<00:04:49.490> you<00:04:49.610> can<00:04:49.850> use<00:04:50.120> and

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
anything really a sharp you can use and

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.200 
anything really a sharp you can use and
kill<00:04:51.800> it<00:04:51.920> off<00:04:51.980> with<00:04:52.130> the<00:04:52.190> u-turn<00:04:52.490> or<00:04:52.790> he<00:04:53.060> you

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
kill it off with the u-turn or he you

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.090 
kill it off with the u-turn or he you
know<00:04:53.360> switches<00:04:53.900> and<00:04:54.200> I<00:04:54.320> get<00:04:54.470> switch<00:04:54.650> advantage

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
know switches and I get switch advantage

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.560 
know switches and I get switch advantage
but<00:04:55.310> he<00:04:55.400> decides<00:04:55.730> just<00:04:55.970> to<00:04:56.090> stain<00:04:56.300> and<00:04:56.540> water

Magnezone is going to be really that
useful<00:05:11.630> I<00:05:12.080> think<00:05:12.410> all<00:05:12.530> he<00:05:12.650> has<00:05:12.740> left<00:05:12.980> right<00:05:13.250> now

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
useful I think all he has left right now

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.600 
useful I think all he has left right now
is<00:05:13.610> a<00:05:13.640> lander<00:05:14.120> Isetta<00:05:14.450> and<00:05:14.810> a<00:05:15.350> Rotom<00:05:15.740> so<00:05:16.130> I

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
is a lander Isetta and a Rotom so I

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:17.980 
is a lander Isetta and a Rotom so I
really<00:05:16.940> don't<00:05:17.030> care<00:05:17.180> about<00:05:17.390> this<00:05:17.600> I<00:05:17.780> can

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
really don't care about this I can

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.660 
really don't care about this I can
really<00:05:18.230> much<00:05:18.440> just<00:05:18.710> use<00:05:18.830> his<00:05:19.010> death<00:05:19.220> far<00:05:19.400> just

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:19.670 
really much just use his death far just

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.790 
really much just use his death far just
to<00:05:19.820> see<00:05:19.970> what<00:05:20.150> he<00:05:20.210> locks<00:05:20.450> himself<00:05:20.600> into<00:05:21.200> which

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
to see what he locks himself into which

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.410 
to see what he locks himself into which
he<00:05:21.830> goes<00:05:22.100> for<00:05:22.280> earthquake<00:05:22.700> which<00:05:22.970> is<00:05:23.120> all<00:05:23.240> nice

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:23.420 
he goes for earthquake which is all nice

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.570 
he goes for earthquake which is all nice
now<00:05:23.450> i<00:05:24.250> go<00:05:25.250> into<00:05:25.340> wrote<00:05:25.550> him<00:05:25.720> um<00:05:27.400> again<00:05:28.400> I'm

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
now i go into wrote him um again I'm

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.490 
now i go into wrote him um again I'm
technically<00:05:29.000> not<00:05:29.060> sure<00:05:29.630> if<00:05:29.900> he<00:05:30.020> scarfed<00:05:30.320> or

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
technically not sure if he scarfed or

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.350 
technically not sure if he scarfed or
not<00:05:30.620> I'm<00:05:30.740> assuming<00:05:31.250> he<00:05:31.430> is<00:05:31.460> but<00:05:31.820> so<00:05:32.030> could<00:05:32.210> is

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
not I'm assuming he is but so could is

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.000 
not I'm assuming he is but so could is
Rotem<00:05:32.600> wash<00:05:32.900> pick<00:05:33.200> silencing<00:05:33.560> an<00:05:33.650> item<00:05:33.890> on

Rotem wash pick silencing an item on

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.770 
Rotem wash pick silencing an item on
that<00:05:34.040> either<00:05:34.370> so<00:05:34.700> I<00:05:34.730> just<00:05:35.150> go<00:05:35.300> for<00:05:35.450> a<00:05:35.510> hydro

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
that either so I just go for a hydro

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.140 
that either so I just go for a hydro
pump<00:05:35.930> I<00:05:36.080> know<00:05:36.140> it<00:05:36.320> could<00:05:36.410> hit<00:05:36.590> both<00:05:37.030> but<00:05:38.030> you

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
pump I know it could hit both but you

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.110 
pump I know it could hit both but you
know<00:05:38.240> I<00:05:38.270> don't<00:05:38.420> want<00:05:38.600> a<00:05:38.630> volt<00:05:38.930> switch<00:05:39.280> on<00:05:40.280> a<00:05:40.340> you

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
know I don't want a volt switch on a you

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.000 
know I don't want a volt switch on a you
know<00:05:41.210> landris<00:05:41.660> as<00:05:41.810> he<00:05:41.960> like<00:05:42.200> smack<00:05:42.470> down<00:05:42.710> so

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
know landris as he like smack down so

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.360 
know landris as he like smack down so
that<00:05:43.040> would<00:05:43.280> suck<00:05:43.490> so<00:05:43.760> I<00:05:44.200> just<00:05:45.200> go<00:05:45.290> for<00:05:45.440> a<00:05:45.830> hydro

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
that would suck so I just go for a hydro

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.110 
that would suck so I just go for a hydro
pump<00:05:46.520> and<00:05:47.290> you<00:05:48.290> know<00:05:48.380> Rotom<00:05:48.740> gets<00:05:49.400> hit<00:05:49.550> now<00:05:49.820> I

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
pump and you know Rotom gets hit now I

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.640 
pump and you know Rotom gets hit now I
know<00:05:50.210> he's<00:05:50.510> probably<00:05:50.780> going<00:05:51.050> to<00:05:51.200> go<00:05:51.350> for<00:05:51.620> the

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
know he's probably going to go for the

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.710 
know he's probably going to go for the
hydro<00:05:52.040> pump<00:05:52.220> over<00:05:52.880> and<00:05:53.000> over<00:05:53.090> again<00:05:53.240> and<00:05:53.540> I

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
hydro pump over and over again and I

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.430 
hydro pump over and over again and I
need<00:05:53.900> my<00:05:54.050> Rotom<00:05:54.380> for<00:05:54.680> his<00:05:54.860> Landorus<00:05:55.370> cuz

hurt<00:05:59.200> Rotom<00:05:59.710> at<00:05:59.830> all<00:05:59.950> so<00:06:00.130> I<00:06:00.160> just<00:06:00.310> going<00:06:00.490> to<00:06:00.550> my

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:00.670 
hurt Rotom at all so I just going to my

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.940 
hurt Rotom at all so I just going to my
own<00:06:00.820> Landorus<00:06:01.210> thinking<00:06:01.690> that<00:06:02.440> he<00:06:02.560> has<00:06:02.650> scarf

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:02.950 
own Landorus thinking that he has scarf

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.590 
own Landorus thinking that he has scarf
didn't<00:06:03.280> whatever<00:06:03.430> and<00:06:03.850> just<00:06:04.030> death<00:06:04.270> fought<00:06:04.450> it

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
didn't whatever and just death fought it

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.440 
didn't whatever and just death fought it
pretty<00:06:04.840> much<00:06:05.610> now<00:06:06.610> I<00:06:06.640> was<00:06:06.850> thinking<00:06:07.150> at<00:06:07.270> this

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450 
pretty much now I was thinking at this

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.330 
pretty much now I was thinking at this
range<00:06:07.810> no<00:06:08.080> that's<00:06:08.290> just<00:06:08.500> really<00:06:08.920> low<00:06:09.130> that's

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 
range no that's just really low that's

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.070 
range no that's just really low that's
like<00:06:09.460> under<00:06:09.790> ten<00:06:10.030> percent<00:06:10.420> or<00:06:10.600> maybe<00:06:10.810> ten

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
like under ten percent or maybe ten

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.540 
like under ten percent or maybe ten
percent<00:06:11.440> that<00:06:11.710> a<00:06:11.770> bullet<00:06:12.040> punch<00:06:12.280> from<00:06:12.460> ass

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
percent that a bullet punch from ass

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.980 
percent that a bullet punch from ass
bandit<00:06:13.060> scissor<00:06:13.360> would<00:06:13.480> actually<00:06:13.780> kill<00:06:13.930> a

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
bandit scissor would actually kill a

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.310 
bandit scissor would actually kill a
Rotom<00:06:14.520> but<00:06:15.520> it<00:06:15.640> doesn't<00:06:15.840> this<00:06:16.840> was<00:06:17.020> like<00:06:17.110> two

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
Rotom but it doesn't this was like two

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.260 
Rotom but it doesn't this was like two
HP<00:06:17.620> he<00:06:17.980> said<00:06:18.190> I<00:06:18.220> think<00:06:18.520> but<00:06:18.790> he<00:06:18.880> misses<00:06:19.060> the

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
HP he said I think but he misses the

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.930 
HP he said I think but he misses the
hydro<00:06:19.510> pump<00:06:19.660> now<00:06:19.770> hydro<00:06:20.770> mattered<00:06:21.190> that<00:06:21.400> sucks

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
hydro pump now hydro mattered that sucks

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.200 
hydro pump now hydro mattered that sucks
but<00:06:22.780> uh<00:06:22.810> we<00:06:23.230> end<00:06:23.380> up<00:06:23.730> agreeing<00:06:24.730> that<00:06:25.180> it

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
but uh we end up agreeing that it

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.150 
but uh we end up agreeing that it
wouldn't<00:06:25.810> matter<00:06:25.930> because<00:06:26.260> i<00:06:26.860> have<00:06:27.130> a

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160 
wouldn't matter because i have a

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.580 
wouldn't matter because i have a
terrakion<00:06:27.730> and<00:06:28.060> a<00:06:28.120> Rotom<00:06:28.450> left<00:06:28.660> and<00:06:28.900> if<00:06:29.350> he

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
terrakion and a Rotom left and if he

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.280 
terrakion and a Rotom left and if he
went<00:06:29.800> for<00:06:29.890> earthquake<00:06:30.690> Rotom<00:06:31.690> would<00:06:31.900> you<00:06:32.170> know

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:32.290 
went for earthquake Rotom would you know

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.060 
went for earthquake Rotom would you know
run<00:06:32.650> him<00:06:32.740> would<00:06:32.980> a<00:06:34.350> Rotom<00:06:35.350> obviously<00:06:35.890> wouldn't

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.070 
run him would a Rotom obviously wouldn't

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.160 
run him would a Rotom obviously wouldn't
get<00:06:36.250> hit<00:06:36.430> and<00:06:36.730> he<00:06:37.000> did<00:06:37.150> say<00:06:37.420> he<00:06:37.570> had<00:06:37.600> hammer<00:06:37.900> arm

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.170 
get hit and he did say he had hammer arm

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:39.840 
get hit and he did say he had hammer arm
but<00:06:38.380> hammer<00:06:38.530> arm<00:06:38.770> will<00:06:38.890> obviously<00:06:39.250> not<00:06:39.640> kill

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.850
