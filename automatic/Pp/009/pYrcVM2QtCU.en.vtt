00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 there is one in our organism 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.750
 kind of fuel order carbohydrates 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.690
 the potatoes are burning rice noodles 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.690
 fast as paper and fat also body 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:19.920
 Fat burn slowly like briquettes and 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:22.289
 then there is the kerosene in one 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.109
 seven alcohol are hidden 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.109
 calories in half a liter of beer 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.269
 thus over 200 calories and in the 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.019
 equal amount of wine about twice as 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.260
 a lot of 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:38.070
 Stupid is alcohol is the kerosene of ours 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.320
 body and always always burns first 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.969
 and as long as alcohol burns 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.160
 not a bit nothing and nothing 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.390
 it can burn long night is 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.300
 usually the longest fat burning 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.070
 phase because there is nothing to do for a long time 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.829
 there is food and then the body starts 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.610
 sometime at its reserves 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.160
 nibble 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.870
 yes , you also need energy at night 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:07.170
 for example, for body heat 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.760
 production or for sports and then 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.729
 we usually drink alcohol 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.130
 right in the evening so before the 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.040
 go to sleep and that is exactly what slows you down 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.049
 Burning fat for many many hours 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.650
 I do not want to go now 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.330
 motivate 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.939
 In the morning to drink the crowd makes it 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.880
 beer or champagne from the evening 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.220
 navel yes it has to be a big one 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.520
 bellybutton be otherwise makes it not a 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.520
 fun 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.630
 you also like to drink a glass 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.490
 That's good and good 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.370
 healthy lives are drinking 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.130
 We also like a bottle of it 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:51.250
 unfortunately far too much in the bowl red 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.770
 grape nitrogen resveratrol and 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.990
 exactly should our vessels before 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.090
 Wilting protects and that makes red wine 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.550
 a very healthy handful 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.260
 red grapes would be healthier 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:07.170
 Do you know what wine really drinks like that? 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:09.790
 makes healthy wine drinkers are delighted 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.550
 Wine just does not fit so well 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:16.030
 Currywurst with chips and if then rather 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.620
 out of the tetrapack and who does that? 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.660
 also definitely cuts the bag 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.660
 so you can breathe on one before 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.390
 How do you like it then 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.350
 1 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.820
 castrated it beer so alcohol-free a lot 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.250
 less calories 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.040
 so that the beer repository is not so 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.650
 swells and you stay fresh in the head 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.980
 in this sense, a glass of honor 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.130
 nobody can deny cheers and always 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.990
 stay healthy 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.820
