away so that's awesome absence of all

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.310 
away so that's awesome absence of all
the<00:05:09.040> plates<00:05:09.370> what<00:05:09.850> I<00:05:09.880> can<00:05:10.360> say<00:05:10.389> is<00:05:10.750> I<00:05:10.990> also

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
the plates what I can say is I also

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.370 
the plates what I can say is I also
prevent<00:05:12.010> dry<00:05:12.340> scalp<00:05:12.820> that<00:05:13.690> was<00:05:13.990> one<00:05:14.139> of<00:05:14.290> the

prevent dry scalp that was one of the

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.650 
prevent dry scalp that was one of the
