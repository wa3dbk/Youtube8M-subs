00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 Pavel note mailbox with 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:09.660
 what times of course but I donâ€™t see them 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.080
 in the city so our task is this 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.680
 so we are now at the curb 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.119
 let's not go to make the exit 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.630
 slow down just hang the wheels 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.609
 on the edge slow down and here's a little bit 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.410
 let go and roll over 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.880
 see how it turned out 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.790
 motor carriage so we have to 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:36.090
 go down from the curb very, very 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.960
 slowing down now turn on 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.360
 right turn does not brake and 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.120
 start moving with you by the way your 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.469
 new car without rugs we leave 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:53.250
 on your lane and do not go out 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.170
 on the counter it is very important 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.370
 so let us be you again 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:04.680
 consider how to move well with 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.080
 curbs as soon as the wheels go on 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.070
 edge 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:13.500
 you hold the brakes and slowly 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.830
 slowly letting go 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.490
 start to push her as if 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.490
 curb 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.390
 you know why the fact is that if 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.200
 high curb 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.360
 go ahead then we get the following 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.229
 there will be a jock help remember we 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.140
 you talked about spring springs 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.229
 swing and the car body goes down 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:43.100
 and hit the curb that's why 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:46.520
 you need to eliminate the car's carriage means 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.980
 lest we go with you on 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.550
 main road 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.050
 and don't be scared because either you are gone 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.700
 equal I have no fear 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.920
 well, great and most importantly not to 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.620
 fear by the way everyone wants to say 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.200
 novice drivers that you drive 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.690
 somehow faster fear because he 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.940
 and is danger mean now 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.119
 turn on the right turn foot on 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.370
 brake bring and gradually 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:17.470
 slow down will produce right 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:19.600
 turn signs we are allowed to griller 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:25.080
 we will go to the square of courage now 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:28.570
 she's pretty serious there. 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:32.950
 so we must study because 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:36.610
 what do you drive to work place through 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:41.890
 the square is manly north 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:44.170
 avenue and north avenue and 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.190
 square courage there let's pass by 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:52.000
 two routes will know then 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:54.610
 two serious roundabouts in 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.470
 your neighborhood by the way we are on 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.350
 to the citizen and here we will be 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.800
 to drive a car 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.800
 here is our home 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:13.440
 now he doesn't always stop 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.720
 before the crossroads frenzy what 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.030
 will output the traffic light itself 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.400
 modern time is very important 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.080
 remember and do not accelerate the car as 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.640
 only you will turn remember 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.700
 that pedestrians stop 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.480
 never go around pedestrians learn 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:34.580
 immediately to pedestrians were always in 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:38.710
 safety collar 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:42.860
 we are going straight with you 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:46.060
 performed parallel parking then he 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:49.100
 learning time performed remember how we 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.660
 made training stopping 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.110
 parallel cars 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.780
 Well, here we are on some of 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.700

 on speedy sleep in modern 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.640
 the time is already like this 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.570
 obstacles they created very cool 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.880
 knock on the wheels of our car 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.040
 the suspension pretty quickly comes out of 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:20.620
 building 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.620
 especially small cars 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.540
 jeep yet 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.300
 they feel this 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.599
 they are calculated 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.599
 if a
