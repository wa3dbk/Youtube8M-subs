 I leave a piece when you come back cisac 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.260

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.260
 from the ten ears 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.100

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.170
 always the same story because we lived 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.840
 also pastoralism 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.689
 when crafts came instead 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.320
 in full I think the valley strona in 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.760
 wood we were 100 vat lots all in the 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.299
 wood was sent all over the world 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.220
 of every kind 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.659

 there is an oven do you did 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.880
 the upper valley if we turn 20,000 spoons 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.450
 per day 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:40.040
 all family owned there were 24 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:44.070
 laboratories without an employee 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.450
 but this spoon which I then give myself 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.829
 one I show 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:53.490
 those parts of them and here for example 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:56.909
 the high valley that is a barolo a stamp or 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:00.179
 between making the spoons this the 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.720
