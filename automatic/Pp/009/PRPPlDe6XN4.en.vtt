another source and the other sources
providing<00:01:30.570> fakes<00:01:31.250> now<00:01:32.250> they're<00:01:32.400> not<00:01:32.490> just

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
providing fakes now they're not just

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.880 
providing fakes now they're not just
fakes<00:01:33.030> insofar<00:01:33.869> as<00:01:34.110> they<00:01:34.470> are<00:01:34.530> not<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
fakes insofar as they are not the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.010 
fakes insofar as they are not the
genuine<00:01:35.220> article<00:01:35.430> but<00:01:35.939> they're<00:01:36.119> fakes<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.840> so

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
genuine article but they're fakes and so

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.249 
genuine article but they're fakes and so
far<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.560> electronically<00:01:38.460> they<00:01:39.299> do<00:01:39.360> not<00:01:39.810> work

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
far is electronically they do not work

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.749 
far is electronically they do not work
properly<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:41.869> suspect<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.280> true<00:01:44.280> memory

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
properly I suspect the true memory

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.710 
properly I suspect the true memory
capacity<00:01:45.329> on<00:01:45.509> them<00:01:45.659> as<00:01:45.780> about<00:01:46.020> 2<00:01:46.290> gigabytes

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
capacity on them as about 2 gigabytes

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.649 
capacity on them as about 2 gigabytes
what<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.840> can<00:01:49.110> do<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:50.329> load<00:01:51.329> them<00:01:51.509> up<00:01:51.600> with

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
what you can do is load them up with

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.330 
what you can do is load them up with
stuff<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.470> they'll<00:01:54.259> appear<00:01:55.259> as<00:01:55.590> you're

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
stuff and they'll appear as you're

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.780 
stuff and they'll appear as you're
transferring<00:01:56.880> files<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.630> them<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:58.490> take<00:01:59.490> all

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
transferring files to them to take all

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.910 
transferring files to them to take all
the<00:01:59.939> data<00:02:00.180> on<00:02:00.329> board<00:02:00.750> but<00:02:01.140> an<00:02:01.320> actual<00:02:01.469> fact

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
the data on board but an actual fact

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.410 
the data on board but an actual fact
they<00:02:02.130> only<00:02:02.250> take<00:02:02.520> about<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.969> first<00:02:03.210> two

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
they only take about the first two

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.440 
they only take about the first two
gigabytes<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.170> data<00:02:04.380> valid<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.369> then<00:02:06.240> they

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
gigabytes of data valid and then they

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.080 
gigabytes of data valid and then they
just<00:02:06.710> throw<00:02:07.710> check<00:02:08.039> sums<00:02:08.310> back<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.879> the

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
just throw check sums back to the

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.059 
just throw check sums back to the
computer<00:02:09.300> that's<00:02:09.780> sending<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.289> data<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.860> them

computer that's sending the data to them

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.800 
computer that's sending the data to them
to<00:02:11.760> make<00:02:11.879> it<00:02:12.060> think<00:02:12.330> that

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
to make it think that

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.540 
to make it think that
rest<00:02:12.989> of<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.200> data<00:02:13.380> is<00:02:13.590> going<00:02:13.800> along<00:02:14.040> fine

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
rest of the data is going along fine

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.839 
rest of the data is going along fine
when<00:02:14.880> it's<00:02:15.030> not<00:02:15.650> all<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:16.980> they<00:02:17.220> can<00:02:17.430> damage

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
when it's not all so they can damage

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.839

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
appears to be good and then suddenly

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.520 
appears to be good and then suddenly
this<00:02:44.069> your<00:02:44.819> your<00:02:45.269> host<00:02:45.510> devices<00:02:46.049> can<00:02:46.260> stop

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
this your your host devices can stop

this your your host devices can stop
working<00:02:48.350> they've<00:02:49.350> affected<00:02:49.920> both<00:02:50.069> of<00:02:50.280> those

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
working they've affected both of those

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.289 
working they've affected both of those
iPads<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.239> so<00:02:51.480> far<00:02:51.750> is<00:02:52.080> they<00:02:53.040> work<00:02:53.280> fine<00:02:53.819> apart

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
iPads and so far is they work fine apart

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.759 
iPads and so far is they work fine apart
from<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.630> fact<00:02:54.660> that<00:02:54.959> you<00:02:55.110> can't<00:02:55.290> plug<00:02:55.590> them

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
from the fact that you can't plug them

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.490 
from the fact that you can't plug them
into<00:02:55.920> a<00:02:56.069> USB<00:02:56.459> port<00:02:56.730> anymore<00:02:57.860> as<00:02:58.860> far<00:02:59.190> as

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
working in conjunction with a pc I'm

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.640 
working in conjunction with a pc I'm
still<00:03:03.360> working<00:03:03.780> on<00:03:03.840> that<00:03:03.900> one<00:03:04.080> I<00:03:04.260> might<00:03:04.530> be

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
still working on that one I might be

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.850 
still working on that one I might be
able<00:03:04.769> to<00:03:05.010> sort<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:05.970> out<00:03:06.440> but<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.530> bottom

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
able to sort that out but the bottom

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.559 
able to sort that out but the bottom
line<00:03:07.890> is<00:03:08.099> that<00:03:08.580> you<00:03:09.510> don't<00:03:09.690> get<00:03:09.989> anything<00:03:10.470> for

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
line is that you don't get anything for

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.199 
line is that you don't get anything for
very<00:03:12.569> low<00:03:12.810> price<00:03:13.730> because<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.880> actual

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
very low price because the actual

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.910 
very low price because the actual
manufacturing<00:03:15.930> costs<00:03:16.380> of<00:03:16.500> these<00:03:16.650> things

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
manufacturing costs of these things

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.970 
manufacturing costs of these things
anyway<00:03:17.359> 32<00:03:18.359> gigabyte<00:03:18.870> cards<00:03:19.290> took<00:03:19.650> just<00:03:19.859> to

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
anyway 32 gigabyte cards took just to

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.050 
anyway 32 gigabyte cards took just to
make<00:03:20.190> them<00:03:20.340> cost<00:03:20.640> about<00:03:20.940> 50<00:03:22.010> US<00:03:23.010> dollars<00:03:23.489> so

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
make them cost about 50 US dollars so

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.660 
make them cost about 50 US dollars so
there's<00:03:24.299> no<00:03:24.359> way<00:03:24.870> that<00:03:25.260> you're<00:03:25.470> going<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:26.070> get

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
there's no way that you're going to get

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.140 
there's no way that you're going to get
those<00:03:26.910> for<00:03:27.299> about<00:03:27.540> eight<00:03:27.780> or<00:03:27.810> nine<00:03:27.989> dollars

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
those for about eight or nine dollars

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.380 
those for about eight or nine dollars
that<00:03:30.150> what<00:03:31.280> would<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:32.459> first<00:03:32.790> got<00:03:33.030> them<00:03:33.239> I

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
that what would I first got them I

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.720 
that what would I first got them I

it's unbelievable and then when I
actually<00:03:37.470> did<00:03:37.829> some<00:03:38.040> real<00:03:38.250> testing<00:03:39.170> got<00:03:40.170> into

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
actually did some real testing got into

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.120 
actually did some real testing got into
the<00:03:40.560> heart<00:03:40.829> of<00:03:40.950> it<00:03:42.350> then<00:03:43.350> they<00:03:43.530> proved<00:03:43.859> to<00:03:44.010> be

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
the heart of it then they proved to be

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.220 
the heart of it then they proved to be
absolute<00:03:44.760> rubbish<00:03:45.000> so<00:03:45.510> these<00:03:45.660> are<00:03:45.870> all<00:03:45.930> going

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
absolute rubbish so these are all going
