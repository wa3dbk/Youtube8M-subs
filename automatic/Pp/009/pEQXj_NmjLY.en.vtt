00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
hour 515 we're into about the mid 80s

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.690 
hour 515 we're into about the mid 80s
across<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.690> area<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.739> average<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.460> time<00:01:05.520> of

across the area the average this time of
the<00:01:05.910> year<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.119> 81<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.840> little<00:01:07.080> bit<00:01:07.200> above

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
the year is 81 so a little bit above

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.770 
the year is 81 so a little bit above
that<00:01:07.649> but<00:01:07.800> O'Hare<00:01:08.160> at<00:01:08.280> 85<00:01:08.759> degrees<00:01:09.180> Waukegan

it's<00:01:10.619> those<00:01:11.009> dew<00:01:11.280> points<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.790> have<00:01:11.940> lowered

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
it's those dew points that have lowered

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.480 
it's those dew points that have lowered
making<00:01:12.750> all<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.320> difference<00:01:13.830> hopefully

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490

you<00:01:14.580> enjoyed<00:01:14.910> the<00:01:15.119> afternoon<00:01:15.630> today<00:01:15.960> because

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
you enjoyed the afternoon today because

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.499 
you enjoyed the afternoon today because
that<00:01:16.470> heat<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.160> going<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.460> be<00:01:17.670> building<00:01:17.940> back

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
that heat is going to be building back

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.600 
that heat is going to be building back
in<00:01:18.539> here's<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.259> look<00:01:19.470> at<00:01:19.649> where<00:01:19.830> our<00:01:19.860> highs<00:01:20.280> are

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
in here's a look at where our highs are

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.120 
in here's a look at where our highs are
expected<00:01:20.729> over<00:01:21.300> the<00:01:21.450> next<00:01:21.539> three<00:01:22.110> days<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.680> the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
expected over the next three days in the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.760 
expected over the next three days in the
lower<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.700> mid<00:01:23.940> 90s<00:01:23.970> but<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.899> humidity<00:01:25.590> will

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
lower to mid 90s but the humidity will

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.040 
lower to mid 90s but the humidity will
be<00:01:25.800> climbing<00:01:26.429> as<00:01:26.550> well<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.509> that's<00:01:27.630> going<00:01:27.840> to

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
be climbing as well and that's going to

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.710 
be climbing as well and that's going to
make<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.229> feel<00:01:28.619> like<00:01:28.950> it's<00:01:29.550> going<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.569> get

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
make it feel like it's going to get

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.580 
make it feel like it's going to get
close<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.250> 100<00:01:32.250> degrees<00:01:32.420> by<00:01:33.420> Tuesday<00:01:33.929> when<00:01:34.470> we

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
close to 100 degrees by Tuesday when we

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.650 
close to 100 degrees by Tuesday when we
take<00:01:34.800> into<00:01:34.950> consideration<00:01:35.069> those<00:01:35.910> heat<00:01:36.149> index

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
take into consideration those heat index

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.109 
take into consideration those heat index
values<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.349> the<00:01:37.470> heat<00:01:37.679> and<00:01:37.830> the<00:01:37.950> humidity<00:01:38.119> will

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
values so the heat and the humidity will

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.839 
values so the heat and the humidity will
continue<00:01:39.959> to<00:01:40.440> pump<00:01:40.679> in<00:01:40.950> here<00:01:41.220> as<00:01:41.369> we<00:01:41.550> go<00:01:41.670> into

00:01:41.839 --> 00:01:41.849 
continue to pump in here as we go into

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:43.699 
continue to pump in here as we go into
the<00:01:42.030> next<00:01:42.300> couple<00:01:42.569> of<00:01:42.660> days<00:01:42.899> like<00:01:43.349> I<00:01:43.500> mentioned

00:01:43.699 --> 00:01:43.709 
the next couple of days like I mentioned

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:45.529 
the next couple of days like I mentioned
high<00:01:44.039> pressure<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.610> with<00:01:44.880> us<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.270> going<00:01:45.479> to

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
high pressure is with us is going to

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.080 
high pressure is with us is going to
take<00:01:45.780> over<00:01:46.009> literally<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.310> eastern<00:01:47.729> half<00:01:47.970> of

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
take over literally the eastern half of
