00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:10.230
 hello welcome in my new video 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.150
 today I will show you the purchases I have 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.450
 made from essence with the new 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.550
 supply spring summer 2015 and that 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.369
 therefore they will remain in permanent line 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.310
 he didn't take so many things because I from 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.380
 essence doesn't have this much to this 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.830
 mainly nail products or 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.890
 mascara because I feel good for instead 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.579
 regarding eye shadows or products 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.190
 face I tend not to take them because of 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.950
 as for the eye shadows I tried 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.960
 to various eyeshadows of maybe others 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.610
 collections like this and never have 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.670
 found one hundred percent good and so 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.940
 there is not always a little fear a 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.879
 take them because they are cheap and they are cheap 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:00.410
 but to take them and then find myself well 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.899
 they are always badly spent money and therefore 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.380
 tend not to take them instead for 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.240
 so what about face products then 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.710
 concealer foundation just not there 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.479
 calculation because precisely for mine 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.810
 type of leather I don't think they go 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.119
 good and I tend to buy a little more 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.119
 blush because I always found myself well 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.729
 but precisely in this new new one 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.360
 edition I did not leave brush 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.200
 who are interested and therefore do not have them 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.340
 however, I took a little something 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.250
 I 'll show you very quickly 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.259
 because there are very few products 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:41.640
 then he took the new lash mascara 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:45.090
 princess this here with the on 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:49.500
 this part of the milk had it 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.570
 already done with writing on pink though 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.619
 precisely now they have brought it out like this 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.770
 and I wanted to try this one here it costs 4 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.530
 euro and 19 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.360
 then I got 2 lipsticks 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.340
 I've already tried essence lipsticks 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.810
 always of this with this 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.520
 package I found myself well 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:15.459
 i'm at pupa omac levels either 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.599
 kiko however place they are they are anyway 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:21.190
 pretty good lipsticks of this 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.670
 pack because then there is another 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.860
 package but those are horrible 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.660
 transparent and I don't like that 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:33.910
 instead these are part of the line 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:37.900
 the news or something like that anyway 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.819
 they are all lipsticks in nude shades 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.370
 in addition to these two colors I have 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:46.000
 taken I there are other cracks one that 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:50.709
 just in color corrector then another 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.459
 than more on beige and another up higher 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:57.400
 pink but still very clear 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:59.530
 semi corrector effect follow for a while 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.880
 you know that these are not colors 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.830
 use and who I put and then then I have not 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.420
 I didn't take them 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:13.660
 then the lipsticks cost 2 euros and 89 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.970
 I took color number 3 and 5 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.790
 that would be those with a little more than 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:26.410
 color 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:28.900
 I wear color number 5 which 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.799
 I'll show you this later then 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.799
 is the 3 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.590
 and what I wear is the number 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.590
 5 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.639
 then 3 and 5 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.780
 and precisely these are news but 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.340
 however it is that you see a little bit of color 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.640
 so I decided to take these 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.530
 two colors and then I took some 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.590
 enamels the enamels are also made 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:46.010
 part of the news line as you read 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:46.010
 here and I have taken four the number 0 3 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:05:06.690
 that this guy is this one color 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:14.880
 I would say very nice hazelnut biscuit 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:17.420
 this then learned the 06 baby doll who 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.420
 this one 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:24.699
 this is rosino here with some fors 

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:28.869
 however, as you can see, golden sciences do not 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:32.809
 writes there is not a lot of color 

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:35.839
 it's almost transparent but I could guess 

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:38.360
 also from the consistency that ring in 

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:40.969
 bottle because you could see it wasn't 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.969
 a glaze includes from the first 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:46.099
 past those there are three 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:49.429
 however it must also be tried on the nails 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:06:03.469
 but I don't think it covers that much later 

00:05:49.429 --> 00:06:05.569
 I took the number 0 7 that this is here and 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:12.169
 from this rose here and this is mine 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:17.199
 favorite is very nice and last 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:17.199
 got the 080 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:29.070
 that to this very light mud color 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.070
 nice too 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:47.260
 and these are the colors and indeed 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:49.570
 took these colors because they were those 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.210
 which I liked more even though 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:55.300
 the others, however, interested me 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:58.930
 they had the same consistency as these 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:01.090
 of this rosin then that from the 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:04.419
 little bottle you see that anyway it's a lot 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:06.970
 liquid so I could also guess 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:09.700
 that he would not have covered from the first 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:13.810
 passed instead these do not have for the 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:16.960
 sciences are are opaque and therefore yes 

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:21.100
 could also understand cost 2 euros and 29 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:30.669
 and i'm the applier i like 

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:36.700
 very much because it is flat is not of 

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:38.800
 I like the big ones though and 

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.539
 so these were the enamels 

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:44.500
 I will definitely try them and I'll let you know 

00:07:40.539 --> 00:07:47.110
 also the lipsticks of other products 

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.850
 this is all I have 

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.160
 purchased from the essence with this 

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:52.720
 new supply 

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:56.110
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:59.220
 there has been useful even if not exactly 

00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:01.990
 I took so many things but they were 

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:04.479
 those that interested me most 

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:07.120
 try and so I didn't want to overdo it 

00:08:04.479 --> 00:08:13.450
 also to then perhaps have products 

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:16.600
 which I would not have used and therefore and therefore 

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:19.830
 nothing I greet you and see you at 

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.830
 next video hello
