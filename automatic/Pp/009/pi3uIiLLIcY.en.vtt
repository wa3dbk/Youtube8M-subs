00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
 Red towards Kappeln desire zone as the points were distributed Stockton 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.390
 Thorsten Winter 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.510
 because many would like to lick their fingers in the second division coach 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.400
 Player material in all forms of the finest and not just cheap 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.590
 Heiko Brunner only had to do one for the investigator 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.199
 Million marks to be transferred as the duo 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.369
 A budget of 7 million shows the financial paradise states here 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.820
 Car World Fr-interview shy president and patrons probably spicker too 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.759
 only a seasoned coach but do not commit any name 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.510
 as Magath is shocked he made the round in Hagen that wants the spark 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.590
 Offer got 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.810
 it is a rumor though 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.580
 if two teams with promotion ambitions in midfield around 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.550
 Of course, later the question arises 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.840
 those who keep their nerves the first chance had missed the Oberhausener 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.569
 by Editha was 

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:54.589
 a Nigerian on the rwo coach Gerd vom Bruch 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:56.020
 holds big pieces 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.330
 the game from the beginning with a lot of speed and came from both sides led the 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.429
 playful class 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:03.850
 but mostly on the track 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.850
 The first possibility of the Ahlener were stricken Roland 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.670
 the game balanced in the first half hour without big highlights 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.200
 Tension made the attraction of the meeting from the Oberhausener but with 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.689
 playful advantages the silver and then it is Dietmar Pieper 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.850
 As this is not a Reiner feels responsible 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.850
 with the opening goal for the guests 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.500
 again the fine individual performance of the Brazilian and Biberach uses the 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.359
 Disorder played in the Aalener cover were 33 minutes 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.509
 Five minutes later, finally a fine combination so good 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.160
 Bollmann 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.720
 and then he talks wants to prevail and scores the balance 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.540
 the 38 minute 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.970
 first goal of the season for the acquisition of 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.980
 Last year dad much better this season, the rain already has one 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.360
 serve a five-week red card 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.670
 Highest marks on 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.670
 for the artistic expression after the gate 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.240
 the answer of shamrocks in a varied regional league game 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.349
 through the wall Konjevic 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.849
 this conclusion already showed that the Oberhausener after their self-confidence 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.620
 had not lost the balance 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.709
 on the contrary 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.459
 again Edi the courier 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.459
 The Ahlener never got a grip on the Silvain 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.109
 then Achim Weber looks completely alone 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:34.099
 and the one with the eye for the better-positioned man and that was WD's fable 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:39.029
 the renewed leadership for RWO by the Nigerian only 21 internationals 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:44.549
 the smallest 2 again in the 45 minute Achim Weber unselfish 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:50.389
 Edit Puglia that was of course the halftime and as an interim coach 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:53.599
 Joachim Krug colorful in front of 2800 spectators 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.599
 anything but happy with his boys 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:03:01.569
 none presented themselves so nearly refuses the referee Steinborn 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.360
 while the impartial overlooked 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.510
 However, this occurrence of JÃ¶rg Schwanke that would have to be red 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.510
 Good luck for the poor 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:14.959
 but even that did not help RWO 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.989
 was the better team with more order in the game setup 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:20.810
 and for better chance utilization 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.530
 after Webber he is not attacked and took advantage of such opportunities 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.890
 Oberhausen scorer for the 3 2 1-final completely deserved at the end 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.560
 this looks for red-white Oberhausen numbers presented in the second 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.850
 Half in a desolate state this concept becomes it for the 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.739
 President Spicker does not simplify coaching at all 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.090
 Reals lure the second league forward 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.760
 already bursting when his home loses against Oberhausen 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.849
 Lost shimmers then did not come 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.219
 but it could have been worse if the Oberhausener their 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:54.169
 advantage in the second half 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:57.569
 However, they shot down and belonged to five or six to one home 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.469
 you have to see that clearly 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:03.399
 Personally, I know the reasons 

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:06.259
 why the solo album is going better, but I'll do the hell 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:08.219
 that you do not get better 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:09.179
 why not 

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:12.939
 No, that these we will clarify internally and where other culprits 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:16.399
 we are no longer today anyway and percent there is no dirty laundry 

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:17.449
 to wash 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:21.340
 In addition to visits they are interim trainers who had sought successors as percentages 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.680
 It's important that it happen quickly. "I'm not interested in that at all 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.480
 if she had the task to lead the team again 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.080
 5% I have to say it's not a job you can do in three weeks 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.960
 Think where I have three years to get out of these teams football team 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.539
 playing disaster Ossiach at home 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:38.979
 what does that mean the players too 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.580
 that is very clear that they have been brought the bottle of players 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.779
 should all times keep shape we all have one percent 

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:48.189
 they learn more effort made animal to strengthen us but me 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:51.339
 I do not know exactly how Linde Group has gotten as for those players I have 

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:54.519
 can only sour are catastrophic they also games are three classes worse 

00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:58.339
 his last song and when a crew only move 45 minutes 

00:04:58.339 --> 00:05:01.319
 can also have a football field there but so took the reasons lie elsewhere 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:04.150
 I do not want to call her here 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.740
 already this week there should be consequences for the players too 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.930
 mind you maybe last chance 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.930
 to end the Ahlen dive 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:15.789
 here
