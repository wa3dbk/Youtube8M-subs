00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:21.080
 I have the most car ever in 1994 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.190
 bought it and that became a 305 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.010
 and I actually always had a little bit 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.050
 a weakness for the gtx 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.840
 that there is and still a bit of one 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.460
 other 305 than the normal 305 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.680
 with a somewhat stronger engine luxury 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.660
 performed you name it 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.340
 and that appealed to me and he can do one 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.510
 have bought against 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.180
 and yes if you do at a given time 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.829
 If you have an innovative , you sometimes want to 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.109
 I don't think it's just bad 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.059
 nice car and I already have a lot of fun 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:50.300
 had it and still because I have 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.730
 it still comes and from the one then 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.370
 the other I never have anyone 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.250
 spoken who has had 3 mois and and 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.929
 everyone has no louis van gaal 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.670
 is then positive about his car that and 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:03.289
 has been feyenoord or awesomes 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.190
 December 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.190
 common denominator of these 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.470
 I did not really choose HDI engine 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.530
 I got the idea on Grammont 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.880
 actually every 305 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.550
 equipped with a modern one 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:24.770
 diesel engine I have several 3053 engine 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.010
 lpg but I still had no diesel 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.920
 and that was actually the approach 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.360
 just buy a diesel that's that 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.950
 yes , I actually didn't find that exciting 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.869
 enough 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.729
 point two is that I have a weakness for the 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.290
 gtx and the gt gis only with 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.729
 gasoline engine built 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.490
 so if I wanted a GTX diesel 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.660
 I had to build myself and if you did 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.430
 going to the building anyway 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.369
 why makkum not a something something 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.210
 stronger engine 100 all occurred 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.210
 what to do 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.310
 and my first idea was to get a 2.1 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.780
 turbo diesel with an automatic 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.970
 gear box 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.830
 only there I could not really have a good one 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.410
 so do or or think they have that idea 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.539
 a certain moment is there from the bank 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.780
 hit then I ran into a final 6 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.190
 with an a3 engine and car with bodywork 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.100
 scales but technically completely intact 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.450
 and few kilometers he was perfect 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.790
 for my project 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.440
 bought youtube and there I have all 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.750
 technology removed and then I had 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.790
 only no car so the search 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.310
 started in france to one 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.420
 gtx station because I also had none 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.310
 station wagon 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.750
 student only and they are never 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.730
 sold in the Netherlands so that had to be one 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.920
 foreign car and specified with 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.900
 found a car in france 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.880
 and yes then the ball started to roll 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.610
 so I had a car and I can do the 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.100
 technology and that still had to go in and then 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.160
 the craftwork started a real one 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.160
 challenge 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.109
 didn't go home for me because of that 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.030
 I may not have just a few 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:03.319
 friends of mine who have an old one 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.109
 have mushroom farms there 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:09.230
 enough space to do such a thing 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.430
 I put the car there in the corner 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.870
 just a cubes in bubble wallpaper 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.189
 gone because I have engine to operate 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.049
 taken out 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:17.030
 we are going to try to put the diesel engine in it 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.969
 turn and then come naturally to 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.409
 against problems because the 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:23.689
 diesel engine in the 406 is under one 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.980
 other angle than in the 305 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:27.019
 and then passion motor mounts don't you 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.299
 gearbox that is not right 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.739
 the turbo comes in wheelhouse from snow 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:34.069
 handy so things like that should 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.200
 be changed and well after a lot 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.969
 puzzle work on internet search between 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.859
 parts part numbers 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:41.719
 compare with other models where 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:43.700
 something similar is in 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:47.870
 eventually come up with one 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.980
 a configuration that fits into one 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.080
 time then 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.870
 yes, then fit your exhaust on the turbo 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.340
 and then the engine hangs neatly in and 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.260
 everything comes in its place 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.670
 only the gearbox that was one 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.120
 another problem that I did not get 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.120
 fitting 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.720
 the sandbox friends video of the final 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.060
 6 never in five located 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.319
 so i took sns bank from him 306 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.330
 hdi 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.900
 and those were found in terms of transmissions 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.850
 proportions to beat and and much better 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.280
 to fit in the car so an anti 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.430
 gearbox and that really there 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.430
 good 

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:26.819
 so no vending machine has become one 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.090
 manual six-speed gearbox 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:32.490
 but a new generation of terrific containers 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.740
 so it was actually in 105 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.180
 operate the clutch that was not 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.919
 very difficult to adjust the 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.530
 transfer of the sender haunted that 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.789
 that 's actually right so that's it 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.990
 it absorbed a lot of difficulties 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:44.310
 take away 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.590
 I am in the end I am one and a half 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.180
 been busy for years everything everything 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.789
 to get in such a way that car roadway 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.259
 was therefore next to the mechanical part 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.639
 of the engine I also have a full one 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:57.599
 electrical part is off the floor 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:58.979
 copied in the 305 so that also controls 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:00.629
 all functions of central 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:04.620
 locking the lighting 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:06.569
 Windshield wipers calm all attached so 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.909
 that it takes time and puzzle work 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:10.319
 and only one after one and a half years 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:11.699
 little then the car comes in and out 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:13.169
 drive and 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:15.210
 after a visit to the rdw it is too 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.430
 legally on the road and now use to 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.729
 everyday i get daily from 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.110
 Gorinchem to Amsterdam up and down and 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.270
 a bit one in two and a half years 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.550
 85,000 kilometers 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.779
 actually without its own problems so it 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.779
 doing fine
