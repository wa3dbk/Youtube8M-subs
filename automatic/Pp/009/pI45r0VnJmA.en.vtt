00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.929 
some of the back end of the club which

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.470 
end of this season I think we just want
to<00:02:39.180> have<00:02:39.240> fun

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
to have fun

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.480 
to have fun
yeah<00:02:40.230> we've<00:02:40.440> not<00:02:40.650> really<00:02:40.830> had<00:02:40.950> that<00:02:41.280> much<00:02:41.460> fun

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.370 
yeah we've not really had that much fun
on<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.060> pitch<00:02:42.240> this<00:02:42.450> season<00:02:42.810> so<00:02:42.960> I<00:02:43.020> think<00:02:43.110> if

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
on the pitch this season so I think if

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.720 
on the pitch this season so I think if
everyone<00:02:43.650> gets<00:02:43.800> performances<00:02:44.400> like<00:02:44.580> that

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
everyone gets performances like that

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:45.980 
everyone gets performances like that
from<00:02:44.880> now<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.240> end<00:02:45.270> of<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.480> season<00:02:45.840> I

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
from now to the end of the season I

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.300
