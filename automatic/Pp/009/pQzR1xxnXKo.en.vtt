00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
might be a better way to do this or I

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.440 
might be a better way to do this or I
was<00:03:50.190> missing<00:03:50.370> this<00:03:50.550> component<00:03:51.120> you<00:03:51.300> know

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
was missing this component you know

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.180 
was missing this component you know
maybe<00:03:51.870> i<00:03:51.989> should<00:03:52.170> add<00:03:52.320> it<00:03:52.440> in<00:03:52.530> what<00:03:52.739> I'm<00:03:52.830> doing

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
maybe i should add it in what I'm doing

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.720 
maybe i should add it in what I'm doing
so<00:03:53.340> then<00:03:53.489> it's<00:03:53.610> me<00:03:53.730> no<00:03:54.060> more<00:03:54.269> complete
