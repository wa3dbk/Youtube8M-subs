00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
that we haven't covers de yeah so if I

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.420 
that we haven't covers de yeah so if I
just<00:01:54.840> start<00:01:55.170> with<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.500> note<00:01:55.830> right<00:01:55.860> here<00:01:56.100> and

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
just start with this note right here and

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.770 
just start with this note right here and
go<00:01:56.490> all<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.700> way<00:01:56.729> through<00:01:56.910> the<00:01:57.000> alphabets<00:01:57.539> it

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
go all the way through the alphabets it

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.840 
go all the way through the alphabets it
will<00:01:58.050> look<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.500> seem<00:01:59.460> really<00:01:59.670> simple

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
will look and seem really simple

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:09.529 
will look and seem really simple
hopefully<00:02:00.360> it's<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.440> FG<00:02:03.170> ABCD<00:02:04.399> ABCD<00:02:08.000> ok<00:02:09.000> it's

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
hopefully it's the FG ABCD ABCD ok it's

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.699 
hopefully it's the FG ABCD ABCD ok it's
going<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.780> take<00:02:09.869> some<00:02:10.020> time<00:02:10.350> to<00:02:10.530> memorize

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
going to take some time to memorize

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.699 
going to take some time to memorize
