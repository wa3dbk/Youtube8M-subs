00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:16.570
 Hello dear friends today 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:21.390
 us Wednesday plus 24 to 4 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:24.490
 on the street by dust I suspect that 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.699
 soon our utilities grid 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:32.369
 will proceed to the street cleaning because it 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.369
 were she largely connected with those 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:43.030
 with those elements of salt and crumb which 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.640
 sprinkled outdoors in the winter when was 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.620
 open snow and actually now so 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.530
 I understand that they are on schedule when they 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:55.300
 The motives are sure that the snow is no longer 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:58.329
 will fall out they will proceed to the question of cleansing 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:02.010
 car wash street we will have here sukhenka 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:04.979
 clean and beautiful is just the answer to 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.200
 remarks of one of the subscribers who 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.280
 says what dirty roads you have on 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.799
 in fact they are dirty 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.380
 precisely because the street is not yet 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.100
 washed after winter street 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.299
 covered 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:22.790
 anti blame define unifying 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:25.380
 liquids salt and 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.969
 smash the cat 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.240
 yes, I actually wanted to today 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:35.100
 tell about such a thing as a declaration about 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:38.240
 intent to live in quebec just in people 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.579
 there is a question about what 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.039
 document is why someone pruning is not 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.119
 is signing 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.429
 if a person goes to the provincial 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.939
 Quebec program turning PDA I do not 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.170
 I know how it is if you go by 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.439
 provincial program 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.329
 another province although it seems to me that 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.119
 such an idea the same document should be 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.259
 and other provinces you sign 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.159
 such was no papers in plo longer his 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.939
 the first set of documents that 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.939
 are sent 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.960
 spill the general migration so 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.810
 she spelled out so grace 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.710
 there is here is necessary in the document in this 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.050
 package of documents 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.740
 if the declaration of rights is the declaration 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.350
 intentions 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.580
 she least you will not live 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.610
 to check yourself 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:31.090
 and actually this document gives 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:34.840
 you become from what you go to 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.360
 immigration program words 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.210
 across the province because you 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.210
 going from one side of the province 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.010
 and the other side you check talking about 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.860
 your intention that you overclock that 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.860
 Well, do not smoke to send a goal 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.840
 accordingly this actor declaration 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.270
 said she spelled subscribes and 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.860
 sent the first batch of documents 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.370
 provincial immigration and proper 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:04.420
 it's all about that 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:07.650
 any statement that you will 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.650
 live exactly in this province 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.739
 everything seems to end yes because in 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.790
 This declaration itself is not hit about 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.650
 what 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.620
 how long will you keep it up 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.079
 provinces that is you gonna live 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.810
 living well wonderful that's what you're in 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:27.659
 you will live there I do not know one day 20 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.109
 seconds I do not know there half an hour griga between 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:33.120
 how between flights about not a word 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:35.700
 however, I am on this occasion dinner 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.450
 once upon a time did a video i was talking about 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:42.000
 that I repeat once more that 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:45.709
 there is a legal risk for those 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.090
 people who go to Canada 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.829
 a provincial program that they can 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.069
 be problems with immigration officer 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:55.130
 if he lets water rides 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.070
 provincial lunch program 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.410
 but let's say his first flight is upon arrival at 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.010
 Canada he arrives and not register 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.440
 on 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.580
 in the enclave conditionally says 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.900
 understand what the problem is 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.460
 why why problems arise because 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.590
 what's in this very 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.830
 sheets that you get in 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:18.459
 the embassy in canadian have clear 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:21.400
 directions to which province you are flying and 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.820
 let's say if you fly in a province 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.910
 Quebec 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.680
 you just don't have to. raven 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.030
 software 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.300
 accordingly if you fly sagging 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.890
 throw calanda then immigration officers 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.870
 on the border of the question and any 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.270
 one asks a man flies 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.760
 british columbia when he should be in 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.230
 cockpit 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.270
 to the question just about what I did yesterday 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.520
 told the video about what is landing 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.130
 just all questions arise from 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.190
 an immigration official at the border before 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.500
 moment until you get your hands on 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.620
 gates on the flag 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.460
 you essentially are rightless and 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.169
 immigration officer can with you 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.690
 do anything 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.640
 he can just wrap you up at the border 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.900
 as soon as you get your hands on 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.240
 conformations offline 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:11.050
 you can fly anywhere and do everything 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:14.130
 anything i talked about this in yesterday 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:18.130
 its kind therefore 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:23.430
 going back to the story with intent a 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:26.470

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.030
 obliges in my opinion legally yes and 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.520
