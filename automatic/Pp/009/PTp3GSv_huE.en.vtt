kind<00:03:48.930> of<00:03:49.019> long<00:03:49.530> wait<00:03:50.040> just<00:03:50.970> like<00:03:51.090> kind<00:03:51.239> of<00:03:51.329> the

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:51.479 
kind of long wait just like kind of the

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:52.699 
kind of long wait just like kind of the
games<00:03:51.690> but<00:03:52.019> maybe<00:03:52.260> they're<00:03:52.349> gonna<00:03:52.470> make<00:03:52.620> the

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
games but maybe they're gonna make the

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.860

way<00:03:52.799> even<00:03:53.099> shorter<00:03:53.549> i'm<00:03:54.090> really<00:03:54.209> not<00:03:54.419> sure<00:03:54.479> i

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
way even shorter i'm really not sure i

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.509 
way even shorter i'm really not sure i
really<00:03:55.319> hope<00:03:55.470> they're<00:03:55.769> making<00:03:56.099> the<00:03:56.189> way<00:03:56.280> short

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
really hope they're making the way short

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:57.740 
really hope they're making the way short
and<00:03:56.669> they're<00:03:56.760> just<00:03:56.849> waiting<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.329> announce<00:03:57.540> it

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.210 
and they're just waiting to announce it
maybe<00:03:58.349> they<00:03:58.500> don't<00:03:58.620> even<00:03:58.769> have<00:03:58.889> a<00:03:59.010> game

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
maybe they don't even have a game

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.670 
maybe they don't even have a game
planned<00:03:59.519> out<00:03:59.699> maybe<00:04:00.540> they<00:04:00.720> have<00:04:00.810> no<00:04:01.139> idea<00:04:01.290> i

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:18.659 
maybe what they could do is because it's

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:20.120 
maybe what they could do is because it's
nintendo<00:04:19.049> nintendo<00:04:19.200> is<00:04:19.500> crazy<00:04:19.769> maybe<00:04:20.010> they
