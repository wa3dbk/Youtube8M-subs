 that it makes one more point for the 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.850
 congratulate if I come to the trap and all 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:23.420
 it's nice to be in darkness 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:25.090
 I like strangely when we do a 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:34.070
 capture with the darkness we see better 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:39.410

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:40.760
 once and twice and 3 had to go 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.670

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:50.930
 capture them as to miss that but 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.320
 it's not very bad it's not that much 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.450
 here 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.130
 and so here we are at four minutes from 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.110
 video and so it comes a little relax and 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.150
 so I'm going to take a picture of the decs 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.680
 I do not see that I can keep 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.650
 of a ton and condition but but that's the 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.910
 mine so I'll take it is no 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.380
 So that's one more point for 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.180
 congratulate them if now I save 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.180
