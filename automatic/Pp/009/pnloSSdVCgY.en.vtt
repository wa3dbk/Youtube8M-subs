of<00:02:25.930> Puccini<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:26.560> Verdi<00:02:27.490> etc<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.390> way<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.660> have

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
of Puccini and Verdi etc the way to have

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.470 
of Puccini and Verdi etc the way to have

an<00:02:35.320> experience<00:02:35.830> here<00:02:36.640> but<00:02:37.180> I<00:02:37.209> think<00:02:37.480> they<00:02:37.600> all

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
an experience here but I think they all

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.130 
an experience here but I think they all
enjoyed<00:02:38.440> it<00:02:38.470> because<00:02:39.190> we<00:02:39.910> actually<00:02:40.450> managed

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
enjoyed it because we actually managed

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.040 
enjoyed it because we actually managed
in<00:02:41.950> three<00:02:42.340> or<00:02:42.430> four<00:02:42.459> rehearsals<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.360> really

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
in three or four rehearsals to really

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.040 
in three or four rehearsals to really
change<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:45.100> whole<00:02:45.130> format<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:46.630> format<00:02:46.989> of

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
change the whole format the format of

change the whole format the format of
sound<00:02:47.440> here<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.060> it<00:02:49.060> gives<00:02:49.390> a<00:02:49.660> real<00:02:49.930> special

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
sound here and it gives a real special

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.350
