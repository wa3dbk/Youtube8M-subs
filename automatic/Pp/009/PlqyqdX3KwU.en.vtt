in<00:00:01.050> the<00:00:01.230> past<00:00:01.469> I've<00:00:02.159> been<00:00:02.460> busy<00:00:03.560> with<00:00:04.560> small

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
in the past I've been busy with small

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.470 
in the past I've been busy with small
scale<00:00:05.790> solar<00:00:06.270> energy<00:00:06.779> systems<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:08.330> this<00:00:09.330> is

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
scale solar energy systems and this is

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.959 
scale solar energy systems and this is
for<00:00:09.690> instance<00:00:09.929> regulator<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:11.280> voltage

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.040 
battery
I've<00:00:19.289> built<00:00:19.680> three<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:20.279> them<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:21.020> they<00:00:22.020> all

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
I've built three of them and they all

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.900 
I've built three of them and they all
work<00:00:22.410> properly<00:00:24.650> but<00:00:25.650> when<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.099> want<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.369> do

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
work properly but when you want to do

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.870 
work properly but when you want to do
something<00:00:27.510> with<00:00:27.689> solar<00:00:27.900> energy<00:00:28.519> you<00:00:29.519> will

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
something with solar energy you will

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.749 
something with solar energy you will
always<00:00:30.090> find<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.960> problem<00:00:31.470> from<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.949> cable

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
always find the problem from the cable

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.720 
always find the problem from the cable
loss<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.469> that's<00:00:34.469> also<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.860> problem<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.579> I

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
loss and that's also a problem that I

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.869 
loss and that's also a problem that I
encountered<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.660> all<00:00:36.899> my<00:00:37.050> experiments<00:00:37.879> so

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
encountered in all my experiments so

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.150 
encountered in all my experiments so
this<00:00:39.120> video<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.989> little<00:00:40.290> bit<00:00:40.530> about<00:00:40.829> cable

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
this video is a little bit about cable

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.299 
this video is a little bit about cable
walls<00:00:42.350> and<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.500> made<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> small<00:00:44.070> demonstration

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309

of<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.100> video<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:04.070> now<00:01:05.070> we<00:01:05.280> can<00:01:05.729> see<00:01:06.000> what<00:01:06.299> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
of the video and now we can see what the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.350 
of the video and now we can see what the
effect<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.930> from<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.409> cable<00:01:08.030> so<00:01:09.030> when<00:01:09.270> you

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
effect is from the cable so when you

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.130 
effect is from the cable so when you
have<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.750> lamp<00:01:11.060> 50<00:01:12.060> meters<00:01:12.390> away<00:01:12.570> from<00:01:13.020> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
the current 3 points:2 or so and now you

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
the current 3 points:2 or so and now you
see<00:02:07.619> how<00:02:08.270> bright<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.599> lamp<00:02:09.810> lights<00:02:10.110> up<00:02:10.340> and

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
see how bright the lamp lights up and

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.400 
see how bright the lamp lights up and
now<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.120> can<00:02:12.680> take<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.950> case

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
now I can take the case

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.550 
now I can take the case
ouch<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:18.190> you<00:02:18.310> can<00:02:18.460> see<00:02:18.670> that<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.780> lab<00:02:19.990> the

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
ouch and you can see that the lab the

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.310 
ouch and you can see that the lab the
lamp<00:02:20.800> lights<00:02:21.130> up<00:02:21.510> more<00:02:22.510> fiercely<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:25.170> this<00:02:26.170> is

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
lamp lights up more fiercely and this is

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.570 
lamp lights up more fiercely and this is
all<00:02:26.470> loss<00:02:27.300> this<00:02:28.300> energy<00:02:28.810> is<00:02:29.170> dissipated<00:02:29.950> in

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
all loss this energy is dissipated in

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:39.660 
all loss this energy is dissipated in
the<00:02:30.670> cable<00:02:33.510> so<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:38.830> effect<00:02:39.100> from<00:02:39.280> this<00:02:39.490> is

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
the cable so the effect from this is

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.390 
the cable so the effect from this is
that<00:02:39.880> when<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.180> want<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.540> make<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:41.220> circuit<00:02:42.220> set

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
that when you want to make a circuit set

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.330 
that when you want to make a circuit set
have<00:02:42.910> to<00:02:43.570> handle<00:02:43.960> a<00:02:44.020> high<00:02:44.200> current<00:02:44.260> on<00:02:44.800> 24

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
have to handle a high current on 24

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.960 
have to handle a high current on 24
volts<00:02:45.700> or<00:02:46.170> 12<00:02:47.170> volts<00:02:47.500> you<00:02:47.710> need<00:02:48.370> thick<00:02:48.670> copper

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
volts or 12 volts you need thick copper

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.760 
volts or 12 volts you need thick copper
cables<00:02:51.030> that's<00:02:52.030> of<00:02:52.270> course<00:02:52.480> clear<00:02:52.930> I<00:02:53.200> think

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
cables that's of course clear I think

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.450

and<00:02:54.240> a<00:02:55.240> much<00:02:55.450> better<00:02:55.630> way<00:02:55.900> to<00:02:55.960> do<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.410> all<00:02:56.590> is<00:02:57.220> to

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
and a much better way to do it all is to

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.100 
and a much better way to do it all is to
use<00:02:57.670> an<00:02:57.880> inverter<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:59.700> use<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:00.730> battery<00:03:01.060> 12<00:03:01.870> or

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
use an inverter and use a battery 12 or

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.220 
use an inverter and use a battery 12 or
24<00:03:02.470> volts<00:03:02.980> here<00:03:03.400> an<00:03:03.580> inverter<00:03:04.050> here<00:03:05.050> the

for<00:04:56.770> this<00:04:57.030> inverter<00:04:59.610> so<00:05:01.320> that<00:05:02.320> makes<00:05:02.560> that<00:05:03.120> you

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
for this inverter so that makes that you

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.020 
for this inverter so that makes that you
have<00:05:04.330> to<00:05:04.450> find<00:05:04.720> some<00:05:05.260> circuit<00:05:05.710> by<00:05:06.550> which<00:05:06.790> the

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
the low voltage is reached and I solved

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:27.510 
the low voltage is reached and I solved
that<00:05:20.680> problem<00:05:20.860> in<00:05:21.310> a<00:05:21.430> low<00:05:21.640> death<00:05:22.180> manner<00:05:26.520> so

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
that problem in a low death manner so

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.090 
that problem in a low death manner so
after<00:05:28.120> all<00:05:28.150> my<00:05:28.419> experiments<00:05:28.810> I<00:05:29.260> found<00:05:29.530> it<00:05:29.740> this

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
after all my experiments I found it this

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.659 
after all my experiments I found it this
way<00:05:30.370> is<00:05:30.669> the<00:05:30.820> best<00:05:31.030> way<00:05:31.210> to<00:05:31.979> get<00:05:32.979> a<00:05:33.010> solar

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
way is the best way to get a solar
