00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.640
 had a problem with it then we did not 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.580

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.940
 part of the plans 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.500
 different from the Northeastern colleague is the 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.720

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.760
 dance in who got used to the exchange 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.690
 modern 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.120
 We keep looking for a change of pace. 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.400
 nowadays it is no longer so improved 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.010
 much but the old cars had 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.230
 qualities that are no longer seen in these causes 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.130
 I had 11 inversion with the genius that this 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.810
 here o 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:18.480

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.000
 none stayed 30 years on the road left 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.790
 to be produced in 94 to give rise to 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.110
 modern pickup trucks if it finds me it turns and 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.470
 Let's see what we see. 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:34.849
 in tune with someone who was only mine until 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.849
 and with much ground ahead
