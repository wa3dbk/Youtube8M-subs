00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.060
 I recommend 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.070

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.960
 and masks that the paw pon1 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.270
 I like this game but it is a bit repetitive so I put it in 10 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.740
 let's keep going 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.580
 at number 9 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.770
 dante's inferno this game is good and is created with the novel 'la divina 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:42.580
 comedy' 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.700
 the story itself is good and the weapons equal but the game is very short 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.700
 you start to take flavor and finish xd xd xd 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.470

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.090
 monster hunter freedom unite 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.180
 I like this game a lot but like in all the other games in the series, 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.559
 they repeat maps although in this one we can also play with a cat as an assistant 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.800

 This game is very similar to the monster hunter but with a different story 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.710
 the game itself is very good but it lacks a bit more history 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.229
