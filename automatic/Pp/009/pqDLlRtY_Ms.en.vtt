00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello to you behind your screen and 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:08.420
 studies already asked the question of knowing 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.420
 how did a graphics card work? 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.310
 grafika processing unit and component 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.470
 paramount in our current computers 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.990
 without him no image indeed his role 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.910
 and sending pixels a screen so that 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.170
 some pretty graphic manipulations 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.520
 simple do you understand his 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.170
 importance it is thanks to him that you 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.210
 have an image on your screen think 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.129
 by the summary composition of a gp him 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.219
 this one will have a processor 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.530
 specialized in graphic design and in 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.539
 ranks of the image 2d or 3d and the second 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.960
 essential thing and memory 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.969
 called to soul or ram video think that 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.280
 this stage you already start noticed 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.600
 similarities between gpu and cpu is 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.699
 actually both have a 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.340
 very similar operation that's 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.379
 just that the gpu is specialized in 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.890
 the display and in the ranks of the 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.210
 graphic 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.250
 all the components are passed on one 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.090
 web card the pcb for premium the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.159
 circuits the bard 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.780
 we no longer have the ram and we will add a 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.040
 cooling system above is 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.390
 just passed very quickly reviewed the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.110
 composition of a graphics card but 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.270
 what are its characteristics 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.470
 main is a bit like a 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.920
 processor or have a frequency 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.570
 clock 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.520
 we will also have a finesse of 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.710
 engraving the chip that will match 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.229
 the minimum interval between two 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.630
 transistors usually only to 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.200
 around 22 nanometers or 25 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.670
 nanometers 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.290
 at the moment the amount of 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.570
 memory that will be used for calculations 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.220
 for storage and textures for 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.470
 the application of anti aliasing filters 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.820
 wales in the tropics and for the frame 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.470
 buffer that will make fun of the images 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.450
 calculate one also has a memory bus 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.340
 which corresponds to the interface of 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.640
 communication between the graphics chip and 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.530
 the video memory that weighed a tape 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.030
 pass-through and primary in bits so more 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.990
 the bandwidth is high plus the 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.610
 two can communicate 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.340
 information quickly we find then 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.200
 like on a motherboard a video play 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.939
 logically the fixed interior will come to 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.649
 connect to a port on the motherboard 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.530
 it's more serious than I thought 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.119
 that from bacon would miss more 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.340
 they talk about cats soon but no 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.000
 no it's nothing to do with the fears finally 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.890
 but if ibm breach in the first 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.660
 ports were pleased ports unread 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.640
 then the ports to gp and one is 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.849
 now at the pci express port 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.530
 currently the 3.0 standard and its ports 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.160
 actually offered time the band 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.370
 communication passerby between the card 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.690
 graphic and the motherboard has increased 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.549
 to continue to allow to exchange 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.959
 more information and of course for 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.080
 snatch images on the screen you go 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.750
 need video output hdmi dvi 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.549
 vga or 10 sport we will come back on it 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.489
 on a next video it's fine 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.720
 everything is fine and how it works we have 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.569
 a simple example when you play a 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.750
 game the CPU supports management 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.650
 keyboard management mouse intelligence 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.349
 artificial 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.230
 the pnj and all things of that style 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:00.000
 and he goes lines and to capsules all 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.070
 the ranks of rap the necessary data 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.380
 transit of the ram until repaired 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.329
 graphic via the express pci port where 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.519
 they will be stored in the video 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.650
 before the gpu is then the artist of 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.410
 your pc is a symbol more than a 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:19.400
 angel role currency the van gogh machine 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:22.400
 it's mama mia basterds macarrao but 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.400
 good 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:30.010
 in short the calculation of a 3d scene is 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.750
 breaks down into four big stages ya 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.340
 firstly the script that will put in 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.730
 place to position the different 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.560
 items 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.860
 secondly there I will explain will create 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.770
 these elements happily the set up which 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.440
 will cut out or objects in triangle 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.360
 polygon and finally the big of the web the 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.060
 wise dish and exclude the pearly cvu and 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.680
 frame by frame all that is displayed 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.840
 on your screen and over the resolution 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.740
 you ask is high the more the harm is 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.230
 done and big 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.310
 the gpu processes each pixel 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.170
 independently see it a bit like a 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.090
 grid of small squares and the gpu must 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.070
 go by a parent over the resolution 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.750
 you are high the more you need to 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.880
 video memory to store images 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.620
 but as you probably know ya not 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.510
 the size that counts indeed ski 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.250
 and anti aliasing filtering where the effects 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.900
 of light and shade generally be 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.220
 also quite greedy in memory once 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.780
 the image is finished calculated that the 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.940
 bargain hunters are placed as textures 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.400
 are applied the image must be stored 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.140
 in the frame buffer or a memory so much 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.540
 will make you the buffer includes by yvonne 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.910
 two slots 1 for the picture yet 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.500
 of rendering and the second for the image of 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.940
 well defined calculate you can 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.950
 also pass in triple ferries 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.210
 which allows decanter to take from 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.200
 the advanced on images calculated by 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.680
 compared to those they send them 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.000
 front 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.770
 the last point that I would like to address 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.410
 in this video and the different types 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.790
 cards or a dedicated dedicated card 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.280
 and all the information I have 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.230
 data before are more specific 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.700
 to dedicated cards the dedicated card this and 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.530
 the traditional one the one that will come 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.370
 connect to the motherboard and the 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.810
 interested map 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.030
 the one that is already there , ie 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.320
 on the chipset of the motherboard or on 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.550
 the processor chipset was 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.919
 to correct what I said 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.479
 on the video introduction to the pc indeed 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.880
 motherboards incorporating a chipset 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.290
 graphics are becoming increasingly rare 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.060
 for the simple reason that 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.850
 more and more CPU includes a chipset 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:13.540
 integrated graphics like intel hd 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:15.190
 graphics touched the elder the radeon hd 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.630
 something with a tr being 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.030
 usually the main difference 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.080
 is the lack of video memory for 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.820
 an integrated graphics card 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.370
 that is, in fact, the memory 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:27.430
 used will be the ram memory of your pc 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.940
 which will then be shared between the calculations 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.010
 graphics 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.210
 it is calculating for the processor is 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.590
 obviously this map solution 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.260
 integrated graphics and a lot a lot 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.960
 but much less powerful than carbo 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.220
 dedicated graphic peace is suddenly 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.570
 a lot cheaper is a lot more 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.669
 economic because you will not have to 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.289
 to spend 150 200 euros in a card 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:45.639
 additional and for all pc low 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:48.160
 budget that will be used in the office 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:48.729
 when playing videos or things 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.710
 Similar 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.570
 the integrated graphics will be 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.220
 largely sufficient by waves and you 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.440
 want to play you clearly need the 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.389
 dedicated graphic and an intersideral guy 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.270
 performance between an intel hd 3000 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:02.710
 and a gtx 570 is like going from one 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.910
 smart to a lamborghini 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.530
 that's all for this video 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.210
 I hope you have enjoyed it sorry 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.830
 it was a bit long do not worry 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.690
 not certain points will be addressed more 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.400
 in detail in future video in all 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.340
 case I hope this video will have you 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.350
 more salads if you had 10 to 10 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.180
 leave a comment if you have a 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.949
 question if your impressions are more 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.290
 complicated than that and do not forget to 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:26.790
 subscribe for more content is 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.790
