00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:08.850 
about not knowing how he's going to get
all<00:06:07.089> this<00:06:07.269> done<00:06:07.330> he's<00:06:08.199> one<00:06:08.379> that<00:06:08.409> won't<00:06:08.649> talk

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
all this done he's one that won't talk

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
much about it he won't say it's hard for

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:12.959 
much about it he won't say it's hard for
him<00:06:11.979> to<00:06:12.099> ask<00:06:12.249> for<00:06:12.399> help

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:12.969 
him to ask for help

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:15.119 
him to ask for help
that's<00:06:13.779> why<00:06:13.929> me<00:06:14.110> helping<00:06:14.499> him<00:06:14.679> out<00:06:14.769> more<00:06:15.009> is

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:15.129 
that's why me helping him out more is

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:16.589 
that's why me helping him out more is
probably<00:06:15.519> easier<00:06:15.969> because<00:06:16.149> they<00:06:16.269> can<00:06:16.419> tell<00:06:16.569> me

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:16.599 
probably easier because they can tell me

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:19.499 
probably easier because they can tell me
what<00:06:16.869> to<00:06:16.899> do<00:06:17.489> rather<00:06:18.489> than<00:06:18.610> you<00:06:19.029> know<00:06:19.089> it's

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:19.509 
what to do rather than you know it's

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:21.419 
what to do rather than you know it's
just<00:06:19.689> hard<00:06:19.899> to<00:06:19.959> ask<00:06:20.199> for<00:06:20.439> help<00:06:20.619> no<00:06:21.039> matter<00:06:21.069> who

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:21.429 
just hard to ask for help no matter who
