00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.369
 it's not uncommon to see things that touch you 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.890
 because it is here in the commune of scaër 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.890
 that veronique and jack have settled for a wicket door 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.270
 at their installation in 1997 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.500
 the firm had about twenty hectares 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.950
 for a herd of 35 companies 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.730
 too little surface 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.740
 to grow all the grains and protein crops necessary to 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.740
 feeding pigs 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.450
 then in 2002 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.490
 Véronique takes over the neighboring farm and thus doubles the surface of 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.750
 operations 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.859
 the same year the farm also voted arrive newcomers 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.520
 at Lorient 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.020
 currently it is about 30 8 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.660
 a lot of efforts are fattened it is often very simple fresh it smells 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.360
 strong in the year 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.940
 and there is the product 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.940
 sup 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.340
 for veronique 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.340
 the choice of organic farming but it is from its installation 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.270
 in fact I do not hunt born in 97 at the time of the mad cow 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.520
 and suddenly he really had a real desire for me to manufacture 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.900
 all the animals 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.990
 good I inquired about the brand label 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.310
 and the label had to be integrated into a big moment you had to buy 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.380
 I was not interested in food 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.050
 and I found that the 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.580
 manufacturing to close it an artisanal way of 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.580
 new features booked by year earlier 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.260
 the day's work to be done 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
 begins first here by making pigs food 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.400
 he will have started manufacturing 

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:09.579
 today 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.060
 almost all the power of ebooks is produced on the busy 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.089
 those who ask the veronique and jacques 

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:19.099
 rigorous monitoring of crops 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.670
 for me this combined with the sesquiers is the most difficult to control its 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.009
 readings what 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:27.289
 because in fact we have very little faeces on the farm up to 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:30.889
 now been fast at 30 units of nitrogen per hectare and it's not 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:31.989
 sufficient 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.989
 to be entitled to good returns 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:40.949
 it 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:48.540
 despite some big animals but in fact it was the generics 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:53.869
 there are stupid 

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:57.089
 usually these beasts furrow all Jewish friends 

00:03:57.089 --> 00:04:00.089
 this period is at least April 20 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.479
 not really 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:06.529
 they are born all follow each other December and January 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:16.969
 direct selling for us it was a bit like 

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:19.969
 of mediation because between 2002 and we suffered a crisis 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:24.180
 and although the ports do not go to be able to drink without port-bou starting 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.180
 king going up who did not find any commercialization 

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:32.979
 at the beginning it was a contribution a week good that's not what thought of our 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.080
 our we had to a strong field of peace in Hebrew including mayor the 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.229
 same pressure to do something to market our doors 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.120
 it's been two or three years since 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.580
 in fact I am really cruising speed on 100 on direct selling 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.240
 by making% to 5 markets a week 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:56.830
 indeed the exploitation currently 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.639
 the capital 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.689
 two thirds that are sold in Brittany in the bios 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:04.569
 have a third of doors 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:08.249
 we know who are marketed by black live 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:10.349
 bulls for direct sale 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:14.029
 are slaughtered and cut on Tuesday by a professional butcher of the madman 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:19.389
 delmas starts actually we worked at the ump we would like that fellatio 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.249
 on a dynamic with three producers 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:24.050
 every three years of union 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.460
 finished working in europe did not try to poultry 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.909
 and valérie 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:32.749
 who work in on dairy production 

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:35.819
 and suddenly we had a market dynamic that made us walk together 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:38.900
 at the farm and dynamic at the level of communication also their whole 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:44.279
 Why 

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:47.279
 it turns into a walk 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:49.919
 by then organic producers 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:52.919
 there are six points but the market 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.669
 we need this sum 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:04.669
 besides they need to sell themselves 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:07.589
 not happy to rise 

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:10.589
 it is therefore normal that one can arise 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.599
 we are far from the farm market by a competent court 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:18.500
 and all the others 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.600
 16 'is that when we made a verse our various customers we do not find them 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.999
 necessarily electric 

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:27.080
 see that the press tries or orange 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.540
 and when at the end of the year we are young dynamic 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.710
 the proof is that the total number 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.059
 all cases not so much 

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:35.630
 a pack after that repart did not classify the period 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.050
 my first mac os x 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.500
 so when we learn the trade we try the asptt apakan found a 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.500
 compromise that is 

00:07:47.559 --> 00:07:48.589
