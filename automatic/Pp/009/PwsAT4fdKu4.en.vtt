00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.859
 the clashes and compass and welcome to another 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.770
 new video as they saw it in the title 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.920
 big cars 6 departure date 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:13.349
 map location and gay family and this was 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.299
 a topic that I wanted to talk about on the day 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.130
 today since you can stay 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.410
 remember that some time ago I had 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.119
 talked something similar to this but the day 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.580
 today I started to investigate a little more 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.250
 I found a page in which 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.199
 they talk about this whole subject first of all 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.820
 If you like the video do not forget 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.579
 to leave your like and see if we can 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.280
 reach the amount of 500 likes as 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.500
 quickly as possible in any way we 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.899
 to start if any of you wants 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.480
 read this article I leave you just in 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.100
 the description so they can see it the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.649
 true that is quite interesting already 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.120
 I got a lot of attention 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.700
 first of all let's take the first 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.000
 topic that they saw in the title that is not 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.550
 first the departure date the rumors 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.100
 They are very strong and indicate that is 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.309
 said title the big car 6 can come 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.799
 in 2018 since it has been taken in 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.510
 account what was the exit time of 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.120
 the first titles as 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.060
 in the grand theft auto 4 at the time 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.580
 that came out the great point 5 if you 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.650
 they can remember the big fauto 3 came out 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.720
 and just a year later came the vice 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.850
 city and two years later the great defect 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.980
 san andreas but it must be the great 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.530
 defect san andreas others left 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.650
 titles that are spin-off type like the 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.840
 stories of the liberty city ​​and also 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.120
 the stories of bay city what 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.460
 we could say that only one was created 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.860
 story mode for these two titles and 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.220
 five years after the grand came out 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.260
 theft auto san andreas came out the big 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.080
 fauto 4 that the truth when it was in his 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.479
 time was a game that broke records 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.190
 since it was amazing not because of their 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.050
 graphics and in addition to the size of the 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.820
 city that was pretty big to 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.010
 comparison of the titles that 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.170
 they had left just before right after 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.200
 came out the big car 4 of the episodes 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.619
 of liberty city and later came the 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.660
 big point 5 in the year 2013 but if 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.459
 we see only the departure date of 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.610
 big car 4 and grand theft car 5 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.930
 were five years of development which 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.200
 they had to do 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.599
 this one entitled now another thing this 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.459
 video game can be done in 2018 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.620
 since many people who are asking 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.480
 some things first of all you guys 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.700
 they will know that rockstar is a company that 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.890
 he likes to listen to people and the 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.079
 Location or the map as you want 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.569
 saying that he wants people is no longer a 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.930
 map of just the one of just one 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.310
 city ​​but to have an america 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.639
 universal for those who do not understand me 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.069
 very good to have the whole country of the USA with 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:46.379
 the different cities so good that 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.689
 has in the saga of great author not 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:51.120
 as the city of liberty city as it is 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:53.189
 the city ​​of good the state of san 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.530
 andreas and also what is going to be the 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:57.900
 state of vice and pine that would be the 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.549
 interpretation to Miami these are the 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.379
 three cities and the truth that they are 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.299
 quite good good are states that 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.329
 would be california new york and florida 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:08.879
 but people want to have a map in the 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.169
 which we touch all these cities and that 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.109
 it's something that consoles new 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:15.299
 generation could support but that yes 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.639
 that the work would be very arduous and if 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.960
 It would take a lot of time for that reason 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:22.050
 note that the year 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.850
 stream of the big car 5 in the year 2013 and 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.610
 for the new generations only 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.830
 they did an optimization of graphics and 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.110
 also a slight remastering not 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.150
 but there really was not another 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.640
 change more to that title only be 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.010
 They added some cars and it is but 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.070
 that's what you think the game is 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.110
 is developing and if we take what 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.480
 It looks great car time four 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.760
 big five points were only five 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.650
 years but people now want everything 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.320
 this another thing that more called me the 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.390
 attention is the theme of the family no longer 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.430
 that now you want the characters 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.890
 Have your family not yet known if you are going to 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.720
 be a character two characters or three 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.030
 characters but you want each 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.400
 character have your family since that 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.950
 he was quite successful in the big car 5 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.780
 jazz and that if you can remember in 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.700
 the grand theft auto 5 we had the 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.920
 character of michael no and the character 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.540
 from michael had his family and had to 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.550
 live with them and also at the same 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.580
 time protect them but not now 

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:22.950
 wants to be able to put this more of the 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.990
 family giving it a more living environment 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.860
 real game and that the character does not 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.110
 always be alone 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.000
 because if we go to the previous titles 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.340
 the character was a lonely character 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.199
 who barely had a girlfriend but 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.280
 never knew that if he had children that 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.439
 If I had more things 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.449
 the character always looked lonely and that 

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:40.919
 it's something that the truth hit a lot in 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.409
 grand theft auto 5 and it was something that the 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.330
 A lot of people liked it so, guys 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:47.250
 as they see it, it's something I wanted to tell you 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.199
 today I would like the truth 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.939
 see all this more than anything the year of 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:53.099
 development that I think is something that 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:56.280
 It is good because it is already said that if it is 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:59.250
 for 2020 and to date is very far and 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.960
 2018 would be like the perfect year in 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.819
 that you take out the game already taking in 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.250
 account what the other titles were 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:06.750
 of time that there was waiting for a 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.279
 title to another because they will know that of the 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.740
 first titles was very little time 

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:12.659
 waiting and the big ones, it was already 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.490
 one more time because the work was 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:15.930
 much more brutal but this is what it 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.879
 says today remember that if 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.979
 you want to make this forum what you 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:22.319
 he said right in the description to me the 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:24.539
 truth that has called me quite the 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:26.129
 attention to this topic of the family and I do not 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:27.960
 I know if referring to this is that the 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:30.509
 character can have children and I the truth 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.910
 I do not know why in any great author 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:34.860
 has seen a child except the great author 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.020
 city ​​stories that the divorce mission 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.730
 a baby appears but this may be of 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.260
 that I know that children are 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.790
 immortal and that only your 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.010
 children and not appear in any other in the 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.870
 city and that would give a touch more of 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.420
 realism not that you can not kill or be 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.460
 just be your children and no longer this is something 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.050
 that the truth would look pretty good 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.270
 that kids follow their opinion in the 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.340
 comments also this from the map of 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.770
 USA covering all cities 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.870
 it would look pretty good since we can 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.300
 pass all the cities that we so much 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.970
 they like either like liberty city the 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.740
 of bay city and at the same time that of the 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.120
 state of san andreas so kids 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.650
 leave is your pin in the comments that 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.080
 everyone's opinion about it do not forget 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:16.730
 leave your like and without more to say 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.730
 goodbye goodbye
