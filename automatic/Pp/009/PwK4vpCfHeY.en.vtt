you

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:18.760 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.780 

so<00:00:19.480> the<00:00:19.600> soft<00:00:19.780> drinks<00:00:20.020> industry<00:00:20.520> took<00:00:21.520> a<00:00:21.580> bit

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:21.790 
so the soft drinks industry took a bit

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.540 
so the soft drinks industry took a bit
of<00:00:21.880> a<00:00:21.970> hit<00:00:22.180> during<00:00:22.690> the<00:00:23.140> recession<00:00:23.500> of<00:00:23.830> 2008

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
of a hit during the recession of 2008

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.420 
of a hit during the recession of 2008
and<00:00:24.580> 2009<00:00:25.150> in<00:00:25.420> particular<00:00:26.070> value<00:00:27.070> sales<00:00:27.310> were

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
and 2009 in particular value sales were

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.080 
and 2009 in particular value sales were
down<00:00:28.439> volume<00:00:29.439> sales<00:00:29.770> were<00:00:30.220> mostly<00:00:30.520> flat<00:00:30.760> four

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
down volume sales were mostly flat four

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.299 
down volume sales were mostly flat four
categories<00:00:31.360> that<00:00:31.600> have<00:00:31.960> been<00:00:32.500> doing<00:00:32.739> okay<00:00:33.040> and

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
categories that have been doing okay and

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.240 
categories that have been doing okay and
you<00:00:33.580> saw<00:00:33.730> a<00:00:33.760> real<00:00:34.030> slowdown<00:00:34.450> in<00:00:34.630> growth<00:00:35.250> but

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
you saw a real slowdown in growth but

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.220 
you saw a real slowdown in growth but
this<00:00:36.370> was<00:00:36.550> not<00:00:36.700> really<00:00:36.970> uniformly<00:00:37.960> spread

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
this was not really uniformly spread

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.380 
this was not really uniformly spread
across<00:00:38.470> the<00:00:38.710> world<00:00:38.910> mostly<00:00:39.910> developed

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
across the world mostly developed

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.290 
across the world mostly developed
markets<00:00:40.720> such<00:00:40.900> as<00:00:40.960> Western<00:00:41.559> Europe<00:00:41.800> us<00:00:42.300> saw

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
markets such as Western Europe us saw

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.200 
markets such as Western Europe us saw
decline<00:00:43.750> whereas<00:00:44.320> developing<00:00:45.040> markets<00:00:45.460> you

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
decline whereas developing markets you

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.090 
decline whereas developing markets you
actually<00:00:46.480> had<00:00:46.629> pretty<00:00:46.870> healthy<00:00:47.199> growth<00:00:47.770> still

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
actually had pretty healthy growth still

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.610 
actually had pretty healthy growth still
and<00:00:49.059> these<00:00:49.210> are<00:00:49.360> areas<00:00:49.480> that<00:00:49.690> offer<00:00:49.989> a<00:00:50.290> lot<00:00:50.470> of

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
and these are areas that offer a lot of

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.500 
and these are areas that offer a lot of
opportunity<00:00:51.159> moving<00:00:51.430> forward<00:00:51.820> one<00:00:52.300> of<00:00:52.449> the

opportunity moving forward one of the

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.460 
opportunity moving forward one of the
things<00:00:52.750> people<00:00:53.680> often<00:00:54.489> say<00:00:54.760> about<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:56.260> soft

drinks industry is how carbonates is on
its<00:00:58.390> way<00:00:58.420> out<00:00:58.510> but<00:00:59.290> in<00:00:59.409> fact<00:00:59.559> carbonates<00:01:00.489> still

its way out but in fact carbonates still

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.729 
its way out but in fact carbonates still
comprises<00:01:01.210> forty<00:01:01.540> percent<00:01:01.809> of<00:01:02.110> all<00:01:02.260> soft

true<00:01:05.080> that<00:01:05.110> it's<00:01:05.409> in<00:01:05.530> decline<00:01:05.830> in<00:01:06.070> places<00:01:06.520> like

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
true that it's in decline in places like

the US and parts of Western Europe but

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.110 
the US and parts of Western Europe but
actually<00:01:09.100> it's<00:01:09.250> still<00:01:09.460> growing<00:01:09.790> pretty

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
actually it's still growing pretty

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.060 
actually it's still growing pretty
strongly<00:01:10.420> in<00:01:10.780> other<00:01:11.200> parts<00:01:11.409> of<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:11.560> world<00:01:11.710> the

strongly in other parts of the world the

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.399 
strongly in other parts of the world the
population<00:01:12.610> that's<00:01:12.729> drinking<00:01:13.210> carbonates<00:01:13.659> is

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
population that's drinking carbonates is

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.530 
population that's drinking carbonates is
very<00:01:14.710> very<00:01:14.830> small<00:01:15.220> compared<00:01:15.909> to<00:01:15.940> other<00:01:16.240> parts

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540

of<00:01:16.570> the<00:01:16.659> world<00:01:16.780> and<00:01:17.140> there's<00:01:17.290> a<00:01:17.350> lot<00:01:17.470> of<00:01:17.530> room

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
of the world and there's a lot of room

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.500 
of the world and there's a lot of room
for<00:01:17.740> growth<00:01:17.890> there<00:01:18.340> in<00:01:18.520> addition<00:01:19.240> you<00:01:19.420> have

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
for growth there in addition you have

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.020 
for growth there in addition you have
growing<00:01:20.500> consumer<00:01:20.860> expenditure<00:01:21.490> that's

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
growing consumer expenditure that's

growing consumer expenditure that's
going<00:01:22.240> to<00:01:22.330> come<00:01:22.510> from<00:01:22.840> places<00:01:23.170> like<00:01:23.380> Middle

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
going to come from places like Middle

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.340 
going to come from places like Middle
East<00:01:23.830> Africa<00:01:24.310> Eastern<00:01:25.060> Europe<00:01:25.330> in<00:01:26.140> those

East Africa Eastern Europe in those

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.550 
East Africa Eastern Europe in those
areas<00:01:26.740> carbonates<00:01:27.250> is<00:01:27.370> still<00:01:27.610> a<00:01:27.640> pretty<00:01:27.910> novel

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
areas carbonates is still a pretty novel

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.720 
areas carbonates is still a pretty novel
drink<00:01:29.560> category<00:01:29.740> and<00:01:30.190> still<00:01:30.430> has<00:01:30.550> a<00:01:30.580> lot<00:01:30.700> of

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
drink category and still has a lot of

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.240 
drink category and still has a lot of
potential<00:01:31.060> there<00:01:31.200> bottle<00:01:32.200> water<00:01:32.250> actually

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
potential there bottle water actually

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.590 
potential there bottle water actually
surpassed<00:01:33.640> carbonates<00:01:34.180> and<00:01:34.270> is<00:01:34.420> now<00:01:34.540> the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
surpassed carbonates and is now the

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.340 
surpassed carbonates and is now the
largest<00:01:35.340> category<00:01:36.340> by<00:01:36.670> volume<00:01:37.150> sales<00:01:37.720> as<00:01:38.080> of

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
largest category by volume sales as of

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.820 
largest category by volume sales as of
2008<00:01:38.950> but<00:01:39.670> once<00:01:40.000> again<00:01:40.120> in<00:01:40.390> 2009<00:01:41.020> there<00:01:41.710> was<00:01:41.800> a

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
2008 but once again in 2009 there was a

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.590 
2008 but once again in 2009 there was a
real<00:01:42.040> big<00:01:42.190> slowdown<00:01:42.490> in<00:01:42.910> part<00:01:43.210> that<00:01:43.360> was<00:01:43.480> due

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
real big slowdown in part that was due

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.900 
real big slowdown in part that was due
to<00:01:43.720> the<00:01:43.840> economy<00:01:44.160> but<00:01:45.160> also<00:01:45.220> there's<00:01:45.670> a<00:01:45.730> big

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
to the economy but also there's a big

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.460 
to the economy but also there's a big
backlash<00:01:46.330> going<00:01:46.660> on<00:01:46.810> in<00:01:47.080> developed<00:01:47.440> markets

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
backlash going on in developed markets

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.130 
backlash going on in developed markets
in<00:01:47.860> particular<00:01:48.340> about<00:01:48.730> packaging<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.900> idea

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
in particular about packaging the idea

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.490 
in particular about packaging the idea
that<00:01:50.230> bottled<00:01:51.070> water<00:01:51.220> is<00:01:51.490> a<00:01:52.260> excessive<00:01:53.260> kind

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
that bottled water is a excessive kind

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.990 
that bottled water is a excessive kind
of<00:01:53.590> purchase<00:01:53.920> that<00:01:54.100> harms<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.460> environment

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
of purchase that harms the environment

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.940 
of purchase that harms the environment
so<00:01:55.450> that's<00:01:55.660> this<00:01:55.870> has<00:01:56.050> actually<00:01:56.170> led<00:01:56.500> to<00:01:56.710> a

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
so that's this has actually led to a

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.210 
so that's this has actually led to a
pretty<00:01:57.190> big<00:01:57.490> slowdown<00:01:57.850> in<00:01:58.330> the<00:01:58.390> 2009<00:01:59.200> year<00:01:59.530> for

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
pretty big slowdown in the 2009 year for

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.160 
pretty big slowdown in the 2009 year for
many<00:02:00.460> of<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.670> major<00:02:01.090> bottled<00:02:01.780> water<00:02:01.900> brands

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
many of the major bottled water brands

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.140 
many of the major bottled water brands
in<00:02:02.800> the<00:02:02.950> developed<00:02:03.310> markets<00:02:03.430> but<00:02:03.820> what<00:02:04.030> you

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
in the developed markets but what you

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.210 
in the developed markets but what you
see<00:02:04.330> is<00:02:04.480> there's<00:02:04.810> still<00:02:04.990> pretty<00:02:05.350> strong

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
see is there's still pretty strong

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.219 
see is there's still pretty strong
growth<00:02:06.520> and<00:02:06.790> not<00:02:07.420> a<00:02:07.450> lot<00:02:07.659> of<00:02:07.720> penetration

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
growth and not a lot of penetration
