00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.380
 hello everyone would teach you to make a 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:09.190
 paper gun with castle 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:13.150
 we need three chickens 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:15.010
 with zeal or tape scissors and a 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.690
 Elastic can 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:21.940
 or small 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.940
 and we will start 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.430
 doing this 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.390
 we have to make three and churros from 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.390
 paper 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.340
 and put you 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.840
 maybe it costs us a little but 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.840
 I put nothing 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.490
 once it is in half an hour what 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.810
 We can try to call me 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.810
 and against 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.340
 and we put 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.410
 yes 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.680
 i 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:55.190
 here we have the first one and we have to 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.190
 do three how are you 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:07.010
 here we already have the three and we have them 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.399
 to do is take one and put one 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.129
 here 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.329
 what we have to do this is 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.329
 much much 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:24.569
 this may take time but with 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.569
 rusty patience 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.960
 when a lot 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:43.060
 now as you can see we have already stuck 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.060
 everything and what are we going to do this 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.599
 the scissors cut 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.299
 here 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.180
 I am in an asylum 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:04.040
 What we have to do now is 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.040
 terms remember pretty 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.670
 you always have to try to catch the 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.240
 thicker part because this can be 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.240
 break and we have to catch here 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.420
 and because we have in front 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.590
 yes 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.590
 we put them like that 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.140
 we squeeze 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.260
 and we double it 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.109
 so that it stays that way and tighten 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.860
 what we are going to do now this what 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.810
 we put like this 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.810
 and like jealousy 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.920
 and thus putting more zeal 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.519
 ah 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.300
 200 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:34.480
 I would like 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.480
 [Music] 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.560
 a great favor 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.540
 are to ensure that not only 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:49.080
 elastic composition can 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.080
 break it 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:07.370
 live day 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.370
 who now announces work
