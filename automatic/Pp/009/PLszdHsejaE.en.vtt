00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:10.550
 Hello, I understand that this is going to be a god today 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:14.290
 There was a sense of shadow between the paper and the paper, 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:18.939
 I will express it as passing by. 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:22.320
 There can be expressed in this way is not difficult to create harmony points to 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.320
 I'll be able to make something like that. 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:37.120
 Please run PowerPoint and insert a rectangle in the shape. 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.050
 Because it is an auxiliary device for giving shadows, it would be nice to make it bigger. 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.949
 It's the same. 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:47.170
 Dangyang Yonggaksan No Brothers Please make the rainy white. 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:52.479
 With the shape selected, select the right mouse shape style 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:54.789
 Please select a pentagon icon and choose a shadow 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:01:00.460
 Will on the outside of the setting 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:04.539
 Please select one and then let's shadow, adjust the opacity again 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:08.830
 I changed it to about 80%. 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:12.369
 The size of the shadows came and went away. And I also adjusted to one flow 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:16.149
 You can see the shadows spread a bit. 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:20.140
 If you make a gap, you can change the position of the shadow. 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:22.780
 I think this is pretty satisfying. 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:29.560
 You copy one more behind the control . 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:33.220
 Please increase the size. When you increase the size, it is bigger than the slide. 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.409
 It is the point that you make 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.700
 I 'll try the whole Sala Medical School. 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:44.709
 I do not feel like this. 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.300
 I'll get back to even change the transparency effect in another, or even as um 

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:49.569
 I think it's okay. 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.989
 A little more shade of blur 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:57.009
 I'm going to bounce. 

00:01:52.989 --> 00:02:01.420
 I'm trying to make it bigger and smaller . 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:04.179
 Once you're done, I'll take you to the AutoFormat window. 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.780
 And let's look at the whole slide again. 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:11.140
 Now, I think it's a little more natural now. 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.769
 Now you're going to write the text of what you want to say. 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.980
 In the Insert text box, uncheck 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:22.360
 I'll take a message that I want to do. 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:25.780
 I once called it a special gift for you. 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:29.560
 I'll choose the right font is again divided into Gothic 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:36.440
 The size of the font is good, please grow the geek. 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:39.440
 Please make the special fatigue to make special gifts more special. 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.380
 I called the folder where the icon was pulled . 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:47.030
 Let me find a little gift. 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:50.390
 Well, I guess the letter looks a bit like a slide through a drag 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:56.210
 Please adjust the size after you bring it. 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:03:00.080
 If the batch is completed, please select all and set the group with the control paper. 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.370
 If you do not like the layout, 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.140
 I have. 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.740
 Now, place a text and a picture in a place where a special gift for you will start . 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.090
 please 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.930
 Let 's try animation once. 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.540
 Add 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:22.190
 Please select a line on the path. Now it's falling down. 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:26.540
 Please adjust your position from right to left 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.470
 Now reselect the object and then send it to the rightmost mouse . 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.880
 Let's see 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:36.350
 Now it's all done. Let's try the whole slide again. 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.860
 Forced PowerPoint animation over this feeling comes from a paper written myself 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.860
 not
