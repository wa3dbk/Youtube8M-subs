this<00:00:23.560> is<00:00:23.740> the<00:00:23.860> blood<00:00:24.099> of<00:00:24.130> one<00:00:24.340> of<00:00:24.460> my<00:00:24.550> patients

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
this is the blood of one of my patients

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.030 
this is the blood of one of my patients
right<00:00:25.599> at<00:00:25.750> the<00:00:25.840> time<00:00:26.020> when<00:00:26.230> he<00:00:26.349> came<00:00:26.529> to<00:00:26.740> see<00:00:26.919> me

right at the time when he came to see me

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.130 
right at the time when he came to see me
at<00:00:27.130> the<00:00:27.160> clinic<00:00:27.540> it<00:00:28.540> looks<00:00:28.779> like<00:00:28.960> there's

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
at the clinic it looks like there's

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.980 
at the clinic it looks like there's
stacks<00:00:29.439> of<00:00:29.680> coins<00:00:30.029> pile<00:00:31.029> against<00:00:31.660> each<00:00:31.750> other

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
it looks very unhealthy this is what

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.980 
it looks very unhealthy this is what
happened<00:01:44.409> 24<00:01:45.009> to<00:01:45.549> 36<00:01:46.119> hours<00:01:46.270> after<00:01:46.719> taking

the cells have separated meaning the

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.270 
the cells have separated meaning the

supposed<00:04:54.660> to<00:04:54.780> be<00:04:54.990> there<00:04:55.229> this<00:04:55.740> is<00:04:55.949> another

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
supposed to be there this is another

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.730 
supposed to be there this is another
fungus<00:04:56.880> cell<00:04:58.160> there<00:04:59.160> there<00:04:59.729> rather<00:05:00.210> large

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
fungus cell there there rather large

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.050 
fungus cell there there rather large
compared<00:05:01.740> to<00:05:01.800> the<00:05:01.919> bacteria<00:05:02.820> that<00:05:02.850> are

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
compared to the bacteria that are

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.279 
compared to the bacteria that are
floating<00:05:03.539> in<00:05:03.660> the<00:05:03.840> background<00:05:05.630> so<00:05:06.630> he<00:05:06.720> senses

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
floating in the background so he senses

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:10.550 
floating in the background so he senses
that<00:05:07.560> and<00:05:07.830> he<00:05:07.979> goes<00:05:08.190> after<00:05:08.430> it<00:05:08.780> he<00:05:09.780> sees<00:05:10.169> it<00:05:10.410> at

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
that and he goes after it he sees it at

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:17.150 
that and he goes after it he sees it at
a<00:05:10.620> distance<00:05:11.220> it<00:05:11.580> smells<00:05:12.120> it<00:05:15.620> so<00:05:16.620> he<00:05:16.710> leaves<00:05:16.950> a

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
a distance it smells it so he leaves a

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.360 
a distance it smells it so he leaves a
red<00:05:17.340> blood<00:05:17.550> cell<00:05:17.760> alone<00:05:18.030> and<00:05:18.800> he<00:05:19.800> goes<00:05:19.979> after

red blood cell alone and he goes after

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.940 
red blood cell alone and he goes after
this<00:05:21.889> fungus<00:05:22.889> and<00:05:23.930> he<00:05:24.930> starts<00:05:25.260> surrounding<00:05:25.830> it

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
this fungus and he starts surrounding it

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.129 
this fungus and he starts surrounding it
he's<00:05:26.190> checking<00:05:26.580> it<00:05:26.820> out<00:05:26.940> this<00:05:27.599> is<00:05:27.630> what<00:05:27.840> your

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
he's checking it out this is what your

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:30.440 
he's checking it out this is what your
systems<00:05:28.740> are<00:05:28.979> supposed<00:05:29.490> to<00:05:29.639> be<00:05:29.849> doing<00:05:30.180> if

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:32.849 
they're not doing this they're not at

they're not doing this they're not at
optimal<00:05:33.419> health<00:05:34.490> so<00:05:35.490> he's<00:05:35.610> already<00:05:35.789> got<00:05:36.210> ahold

optimal health so he's already got ahold

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.629 
optimal health so he's already got ahold
of<00:05:36.690> it<00:05:36.900> and<00:05:38.300> little<00:05:39.300> by<00:05:39.419> little<00:05:39.450> is<00:05:39.900> gonna

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
of it and little by little is gonna

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:45.020 
of it and little by little is gonna
engulf<00:05:41.639> it<00:05:41.849> and<00:05:42.120> heat<00:05:42.389> it<00:05:43.789> because<00:05:44.789> that's

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
engulf it and heat it because that's

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.570 
engulf it and heat it because that's
what<00:05:45.210> this<00:05:45.360> cell<00:05:45.690> does<00:05:46.039> it<00:05:47.039> already<00:05:47.310> has

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
what this cell does it already has

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.460 
what this cell does it already has
recognized<00:05:48.210> this<00:05:48.449> fungus<00:05:48.960> as<00:05:49.080> something

that's not supposed to be there this

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.920 
that's not supposed to be there this
doesn't<00:05:51.599> happen<00:05:51.930> automatically<00:05:53.570> but<00:05:54.570> little

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
doesn't happen automatically but little

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
by little as you can see he's

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.060 
by little as you can see he's
surrounding<00:05:56.940> it<00:05:57.060> I<00:05:57.150> didn't<00:05:57.570> let<00:05:57.690> it<00:05:57.870> go<00:05:58.070> this

already<00:06:01.919> and<00:06:03.020> this<00:06:04.020> is<00:06:04.229> what<00:06:04.410> we<00:06:04.560> want<00:06:04.770> to<00:06:04.860> see

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:05.099 
already and this is what we want to see

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:21.470 
already and this is what we want to see
in<00:06:05.729> your<00:06:06.000> system<00:06:06.500> okay

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:21.480 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.620 

there's<00:06:22.480> many<00:06:22.750> ways<00:06:23.110> to<00:06:23.530> show<00:06:24.150> that<00:06:25.150> goji

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
there's many ways to show that goji

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.760 
there's many ways to show that goji
juice<00:06:26.520> has<00:06:27.520> a<00:06:27.550> tremendous<00:06:28.270> impact<00:06:28.750> on<00:06:28.960> health

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
juice has a tremendous impact on health

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.360 
juice has a tremendous impact on health
and<00:06:30.540> on<00:06:31.540> the<00:06:31.960> optimal<00:06:32.530> function<00:06:33.010> of<00:06:33.130> the<00:06:33.220> human

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370 
and on the optimal function of the human

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.450 
and on the optimal function of the human
body<00:06:34.080> so<00:06:35.080> now<00:06:35.260> we<00:06:35.320> see<00:06:35.650> a<00:06:35.680> few<00:06:36.010> things<00:06:36.040> that<00:06:36.430> I

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:36.460 
body so now we see a few things that I

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.830 
body so now we see a few things that I
want<00:06:36.670> to<00:06:36.760> summarize<00:06:37.240> for<00:06:37.270> you<00:06:37.630> because

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
want to summarize for you because

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.790 
want to summarize for you because
they're<00:06:38.170> very<00:06:38.530> important<00:06:39.100> to<00:06:40.320> minimize<00:06:41.320> your

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:41.800 
they're very important to minimize your

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.200 
they're very important to minimize your
visits<00:06:42.220> to<00:06:42.280> your<00:06:42.490> doctor<00:06:42.940> and<00:06:43.320> they<00:06:44.320> are

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210 
visits to your doctor and they are

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:50.430 
visits to your doctor and they are
taking<00:06:46.210> your<00:06:46.360> ph<00:06:47.190> temperature<00:06:48.190> and<00:06:49.290> the<00:06:50.290> way

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 
taking your ph temperature and the way

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.690 
taking your ph temperature and the way
you<00:06:50.500> feel<00:06:51.810> those<00:06:52.810> three<00:06:52.990> things<00:06:53.430> because<00:06:54.430> most

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:54.700 
you feel those three things because most

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.760 
you feel those three things because most
of<00:06:54.850> us<00:06:55.030> are<00:06:55.180> not<00:06:55.390> as<00:06:55.600> aware<00:06:56.170> of<00:06:56.500> how<00:06:56.590> we're

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:56.770 
of us are not as aware of how we're

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.350 
of us are not as aware of how we're
feeling<00:06:56.800> that's<00:06:57.670> why<00:06:57.880> there's<00:06:58.090> so<00:06:58.240> much

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360 
feeling that's why there's so much

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.800 
feeling that's why there's so much
stress<00:06:58.780> in<00:06:59.610> modern<00:07:00.610> Western<00:07:00.850> civilization

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:01.810 
stress in modern Western civilization

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.230 
stress in modern Western civilization
these<00:07:02.560> are<00:07:02.800> going<00:07:02.920> to<00:07:03.040> be<00:07:03.160> parameters<00:07:03.820> for<00:07:04.090> you

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 
these are going to be parameters for you

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.410 
these are going to be parameters for you

to measure how you are doing because as

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.410 
to measure how you are doing because as
soon<00:07:07.630> as<00:07:07.810> you<00:07:08.020> start<00:07:08.290> taking<00:07:08.910> goji<00:07:09.910> two<00:07:10.330> to

need to correct your uncle inna T you
will<00:07:15.160> start<00:07:15.460> feeling<00:07:15.730> better<00:07:16.510> and<00:07:16.810> your<00:07:17.740> body

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.010 
will start feeling better and your body

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:21.180 
will start feeling better and your body
will<00:07:18.340> feel<00:07:18.930> so<00:07:19.930> much<00:07:19.960> better<00:07:20.440> because<00:07:20.680> of<00:07:20.860> the

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:21.190 
will feel so much better because of the

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.370 
will feel so much better because of the
detoxification<00:07:21.880> that<00:07:22.570> occurs<00:07:22.900> and<00:07:23.170> the

detoxification that occurs and the
regeneration<00:07:24.180> that<00:07:25.180> you<00:07:25.930> will<00:07:26.080> need<00:07:26.260> to<00:07:26.440> lower

regeneration that you will need to lower
your<00:07:26.800> medications<00:07:27.640> fairly<00:07:28.510> quickly
