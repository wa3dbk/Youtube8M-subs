just want to talk a little bit about the
channel<00:00:17.010> for<00:00:17.250> one<00:00:17.400> second<00:00:17.880> obviously<00:00:18.779> some<00:00:19.529> of

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
channel for one second obviously some of

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.410

you<00:00:19.740> may<00:00:19.890> have<00:00:20.010> noticed<00:00:20.340> we<00:00:20.609> have<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.760> dark<00:00:21.090> grey

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
you may have noticed we have a dark grey

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.960 
you may have noticed we have a dark grey
background<00:00:21.660> now<00:00:22.109> instead<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.710> black<00:00:22.980> that

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
background now instead of the black that

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.150 
background now instead of the black that
you<00:00:24.090> may<00:00:24.240> have<00:00:24.359> been<00:00:24.570> accustomed<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.260> the

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
reason I went with the darker gray is

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.330 
reason I went with the darker gray is
just<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.500> alleviate<00:00:28.949> some<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.250> those

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
just to alleviate some of those

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.359 
just to alleviate some of those
situations<00:00:29.550> where<00:00:30.060> we<00:00:30.330> have<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.650> black<00:00:31.650> blade<00:00:31.980> a

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
situations where we have a black blade a

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
black handle and we're trying to do a

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.010 
black handle and we're trying to do a
review<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.100> black<00:00:35.430> background

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:43.189 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:48.410 

the<00:02:44.189> blade<00:02:44.459> material<00:02:44.939> is<00:02:45.980> s35vn<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:48.150> blade

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
the blade material is s35vn the blade

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
thickness is 0.1 nine inches interesting

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.460 
thickness is 0.1 nine inches interesting
thing<00:02:55.920> about<00:02:56.670> this<00:02:56.819> blade<00:02:57.030> here<00:02:57.629> is<00:02:57.780> the

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
thing about this blade here is the

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.309 
thing about this blade here is the
swedge<00:02:58.769> on<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.099> goes<00:02:59.250> all<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.549> way<00:02:59.780> up<00:03:00.780> the

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
swedge on it goes all the way up the

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.140 
swedge on it goes all the way up the
knife<00:03:01.500> generally<00:03:02.489> you<00:03:02.579> kind<00:03:02.760> of<00:03:02.849> see<00:03:02.970> this

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
knife generally you kind of see this

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.520 
knife generally you kind of see this
wedge<00:03:03.359> towards<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.810> tip<00:03:03.989> and<00:03:04.170> it<00:03:04.290> kind<00:03:04.470> of

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
wedge towards the tip and it kind of

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.580 
wedge towards the tip and it kind of
flattens<00:03:04.890> out<00:03:05.040> towards<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.150> back<00:03:06.329> end<00:03:06.599> but

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
flattens out towards the back end but

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.990 
flattens out towards the back end but
this<00:03:07.739> wedge<00:03:08.069> goes<00:03:08.310> all<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.970> way<00:03:09.239> up<00:03:09.569> up<00:03:11.000> the

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
this wedge goes all the way up up the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.780 
this wedge goes all the way up up the
blade<00:03:12.180> there<00:03:12.709> you<00:03:13.709> also<00:03:13.980> notice<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.430> jimping

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
blade there you also notice the jimping

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.580 
blade there you also notice the jimping
on<00:03:14.909> the<00:03:15.000> top<00:03:15.209> so<00:03:15.510> you<00:03:15.569> can<00:03:15.750> choke<00:03:15.930> up<00:03:16.139> on<00:03:16.260> your

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
on the top so you can choke up on your

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.589 
on the top so you can choke up on your
blade<00:03:18.260> but<00:03:19.260> also<00:03:19.709> take<00:03:20.549> a<00:03:20.579> look<00:03:20.760> right<00:03:21.000> there

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
blade but also take a look right there

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.080 
blade but also take a look right there
the<00:03:22.349> jimping<00:03:22.769> kind<00:03:23.040> of<00:03:23.129> extends<00:03:23.700> down<00:03:23.879> the

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
the jimping kind of extends down the

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.110 
the jimping kind of extends down the
side<00:03:24.359> of<00:03:24.569> this<00:03:24.720> blade<00:03:25.700> which<00:03:26.700> is<00:03:26.849> interesting

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
side of this blade which is interesting

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.960 
side of this blade which is interesting
I<00:03:27.420> don't<00:03:27.599> see<00:03:27.750> that<00:03:27.870> too<00:03:28.079> often<00:03:28.290> on<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.620> knife

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
I don't see that too often on a knife

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.890 
I don't see that too often on a knife
but<00:03:30.799> some<00:03:31.799> careful<00:03:32.069> thought<00:03:32.250> in<00:03:32.849> that<00:03:33.480> design

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
but some careful thought in that design

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.660 
but some careful thought in that design
there<00:03:35.030> now<00:03:36.530> even<00:03:37.530> when<00:03:37.739> you<00:03:37.889> are<00:03:38.069> choking<00:03:38.519> up

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
there now even when you are choking up

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.869 
there now even when you are choking up
on<00:03:38.819> the<00:03:38.939> knife<00:03:39.090> in<00:03:39.359> and<00:03:39.540> using<00:03:40.760> kind<00:03:41.760> of

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
on the knife in and using kind of

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:47.780 
on the knife in and using kind of
gripping<00:03:42.209> it<00:03:42.480> on<00:03:42.659> the<00:03:42.870> side<00:03:43.549> side<00:03:44.549> jimping<00:03:46.790> it

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
gripping it on the side side jimping it

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.780 
gripping it on the side side jimping it
even<00:03:48.090> feels<00:03:48.269> comfortable<00:03:48.750> in<00:03:48.989> hand<00:03:49.379> there

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.000 

it's<00:03:53.790> kind<00:03:54.000> of<00:03:54.030> an<00:03:54.180> awkward<00:03:54.359> angle<00:03:54.989> but<00:03:55.139> even

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
it's kind of an awkward angle but even

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.759 
it's kind of an awkward angle but even
there<00:03:56.220> it<00:03:56.459> feels<00:03:56.790> comfortable<00:03:57.269> these<00:03:57.769> little

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
there it feels comfortable these little

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.180 
there it feels comfortable these little
grooves<00:03:59.099> are<00:03:59.790> quite<00:04:00.329> robust<00:04:00.870> so<00:04:01.500> they<00:04:01.949> really

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
grooves are quite robust so they really

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.210 
grooves are quite robust so they really
do<00:04:02.340> give<00:04:02.549> you<00:04:02.669> a<00:04:02.699> lot<00:04:03.000> of<00:04:03.030> thumb<00:04:03.900> grip<00:04:04.220> when

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
do give you a lot of thumb grip when

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.430 
do give you a lot of thumb grip when
you're<00:04:05.489> you're<00:04:05.790> choking<00:04:06.120> up<00:04:06.239> on<00:04:06.389> the<00:04:06.480> knife<00:04:06.659> so

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
you're you're choking up on the knife so

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.430 
you're you're choking up on the knife so
awesome<00:04:08.370> feature<00:04:08.609> a<00:04:09.540> little<00:04:10.019> bit<00:04:10.139> different

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
awesome feature a little bit different

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.659 
awesome feature a little bit different
you<00:04:10.500> don't<00:04:10.680> see<00:04:10.799> it<00:04:10.889> too<00:04:11.040> often<00:04:11.250> that<00:04:11.549> the

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:11.669 
you don't see it too often that the

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:13.670 
you don't see it too often that the
jimping<00:04:11.970> goes<00:04:12.120> down<00:04:12.269> the<00:04:12.359> side<00:04:12.510> like<00:04:12.720> that<00:04:12.900> but

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
jimping goes down the side like that but
