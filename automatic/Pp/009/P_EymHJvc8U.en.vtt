temperature<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.520> shown<00:01:48.240> right<00:01:48.270> here<00:01:48.950> you

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
temperature is shown right here you

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.539 
temperature is shown right here you
better<00:01:50.250> viewing<00:01:50.610> angle<00:01:51.000> with<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:52.170> then

is very nice so you got that fan right

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.800 
is very nice so you got that fan right
there<00:02:22.459> which<00:02:23.459> is<00:02:23.489> obvious<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.629> then<00:02:24.720> you've

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
got a ventilation port right here so

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.930 
got a ventilation port right here so
let's<00:02:28.050> set<00:02:28.260> this<00:02:28.500> off<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.980> side<00:02:29.069> and<00:02:31.940> there

let's set this off to the side and there
you<00:02:33.030> go<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.480> got<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.840> fans<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.410> got<00:02:34.590> one<00:02:34.769> at

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
you go you got to fans you got one at

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.850 
you go you got to fans you got one at
the<00:02:34.980> top<00:02:35.099> right<00:02:35.340> here<00:02:35.670> with<00:02:36.090> another<00:02:36.860> fort

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860
