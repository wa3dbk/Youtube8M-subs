00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.530
 help from 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.870
 this means that we do not do business from consumption 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.530
 irresponsible 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.100

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.450

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.450
 I am not speaking this year to further increase this participation 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.630

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.030

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.480
 even the budget is from family websites 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.860

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.440
 to our consumers 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.060
 last year we have made a huge breakthrough in relation to environmental initiatives 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.670
 establishing global targets for the improvement of these indicators 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.070
 this year, following the same line, we fear that we will set goals to 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.070
 responsible consumption in the markets where 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.790
 to reach our goals together by the end of 2014 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.439

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:23.899

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:27.869

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:30.679
 that helps parents talk to their children 

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:33.849
 regarding consumption for minors 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.319
 an example of this the family talk program 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.489

 on the origin of age talk about the consequences of drinking and driving 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.400
 these are just some of the goals that are announced in the gomorrah book 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:07.499
 so the answer is only the symbolic date of our struggle for consumption 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:08.019
 responsible
