00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:06.220
 Is it an Indian day? 

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.220
 Hmm 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:17.360
 Hi everyone this time of jitter structure is I before its return and is Mnemonic of the scale 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:22.100
 Do Kedomo I went for the Mnemonic of position 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:24.060
 I also I'm all full half full all the first half came out of Tteyuu law in the 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.760
 That 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:31.680
 Well, let's apply that 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:34.650
 The key is going to remember the scale of how the case is the Toka Do Young of good Toka is the case of the d 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:40.590
 Kedomo I want to talk about nice to do that it Once 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:44.640
 What happened to that in the form of not having seen before about the law of the whole half first half 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.390
 I also would like to talk with great recap a little it to be of those who are thought 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.750
 But 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.260
 Match in 8 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:53.850
 I will continue to talk about it Nde Nida of Gya' 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:59.339
 It is 3 fret action of 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.510
 It will happen in 2 fret color if you want to move to a fit in before that of the 2 fret movement 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:06.390
 Remember true 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:09.890
 The Dew lane because this is also a place 1 fret movement of ne your Karafa is the previous Hantamashi 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.220
 Please remember that this one fret way 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.220
 f 4 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:19.030
 It seems that this is also a rumbling 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.960
 This is also a pre-product US magazine which is also all the questions 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.960
 Why not 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:29.479
 This is h fret movement ie version 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:33.800
 As you can see from these things, every one of them is a scale of Doremifasoraid 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:39.200
 Is the movement of all and all and all and all and half 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:45.730
 Ie 2 frets 1 fret 1 fret 1 fret 1 fret 1 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:50.380
 We know that this time in the movement is made up This is the same even in any matter 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:56.890
 I'm older brother is Yes doing Gawa of what I described is the case of the example d 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:02:00.160
 That sure-to-one C major, that is, t does not necessarily just play in the scene. 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:05.750
 Or there may be more things other than that 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:11.720
 No, it is by applying the law of the whole first half 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:17.120
 If there is a key of d, it means that it will be the sound of the whistle 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.130
 There are also many saying to give a key from c to d. 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.090
 Things 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:27.820
 It means that one sound is raised up 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:30.440
 It is dialect power attractive deep to remember in so guitar It is, for example, 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:34.620
 Because it is the sound of notry 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.280
 From here eb 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.690
 Emmy fan 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:46.910
 At this point Retina 's fanot is already sharp 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.600
 Remember that the sound of this pha will first become sharp if you enter it according to the rule of the first half before that 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.830
 Please give me 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.830
 White collar 3 layers 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:03:01.310
 But it is not crusher Patsui the first half before this tax increase will be because it is the law and its 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.590
 Hey 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:08.130
 new 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.650
 This time the note has become so sharp 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.310
 In a 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:18.170
 That means it's going to sound 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:24.319
 Oh my god 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:28.520
 In that all the whole and half the whole first half apply the law and the sound of Fa's brother's road 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:31.510
 Come it found that if referred to in the Masukore see that Tteyuu such will become sharp 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:35.319
 I will say that 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:40.420
 When I saw the score, that is the score 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:44.079
 I Nde In this way a little ne Well not draw in so much good 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.829
 That Chris is that around here is available I do Mase Kamowakari to come in even better YYY 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.260
 please 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:55.280
 If the key is d then as 1 which one 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:04:00.409
 Even in some of this is er tone symbol but is not made to one pixel of the second child from the bottom of here 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:04.040
 In this position there is a swing of the road position and 12 companies of fans 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:06.500
 I think I have seen such a ship, but if the key is d, write as such 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.250
 If there is a problem then what to do 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.840
 What will happen ? 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:15.140
 If we apply to the rule of the previous 8 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:21.139
 Do and Re and Fa and So 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:22.930
 This part will be sharp, so just looking at 5 players like this will have that key 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:27.789
 Can be determined 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:32.229
 It will be like that, so even in the sense of remembering that scale 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:36.610
 I think that there are many things that the code is shaken when I cut the two sides 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:41.889
 In it, it's a quick look, that's why that key is d 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.920
 That's why it's because Lee said that code was used. 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:43.400
 I have a copy 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.930
 I will 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:52.729
 Take that action and make a copy to 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:58.039
 How to remember the scale that I said in the sense that I will try to the cover song 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:05:03.390
 I think it's going to be very important, and I think it also seems that the details 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:04.490
 Where positions in other keys are flat or sharp that this 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:09.080
 Is it 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:13.610
 But please try to reference so I write to people of this video when it comes Tteyuu 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:18.080
 I to Chinami um cdefgab 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:22.430
 a If you learn with that key, only in the case of that f 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.480
 The flat is swung in the position of this 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:29.150
 There is no penetration when you go 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.150
 Please remember this once 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.100
 Hmm
