September fifth until further notice
until<00:04:53.020> we<00:04:53.290> can<00:04:53.470> get<00:04:53.590> an<00:04:53.710> ultrasound

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:54.409 
until we can get an ultrasound

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:58.540 
until we can get an ultrasound
um<00:04:55.239> I<00:04:56.239> will<00:04:57.199> be<00:04:57.289> getting<00:04:57.439> results<00:04:58.129> in<00:04:58.339> the<00:04:58.519> next

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
um I will be getting results in the next

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.129 
um I will be getting results in the next
three<00:04:59.029> hours<00:04:59.059> on<00:05:00.789> what<00:05:01.789> my<00:05:01.999> HCG<00:05:02.479> levels<00:05:02.929> are

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
three hours on what my HCG levels are

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:05.709 
three hours on what my HCG levels are
right<00:05:03.349> now<00:05:03.559> and<00:05:03.949> i'll<00:05:04.610> probably<00:05:04.939> post<00:05:05.300> those

00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:05.719 
right now and i'll probably post those

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:08.889 
right now and i'll probably post those

I get them so go ahead and follow those
if<00:05:14.149> you're<00:05:14.300> interested<00:05:15.789> and<00:05:16.789> we<00:05:17.689> should<00:05:17.869> be

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:17.929 
if you're interested and we should be

00:05:17.929 --> 00:05:19.479 
if you're interested and we should be
able<00:05:17.959> to<00:05:18.199> tell<00:05:18.409> when<00:05:18.739> I<00:05:18.769> will<00:05:19.069> get<00:05:19.249> two

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:19.489 
able to tell when I will get two

00:05:19.489 --> 00:05:24.820 
able to tell when I will get two
thousand<00:05:20.139> but<00:05:23.080> that's<00:05:24.080> what's<00:05:24.259> going<00:05:24.559> on<00:05:24.709> with

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
thousand but that's what's going on with

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.279 
thousand but that's what's going on with
me<00:05:25.039> and<00:05:25.069> it<00:05:25.819> is<00:05:25.849> very<00:05:26.089> very<00:05:26.449> very<00:05:27.139> very

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:27.289 
me and it is very very very very

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:29.859 
me and it is very very very very
confusing<00:05:28.219> and<00:05:28.669> I<00:05:29.089> don't<00:05:29.360> know<00:05:29.479> how<00:05:29.629> far<00:05:29.809> along

00:05:29.859 --> 00:05:29.869 
confusing and I don't know how far along

00:05:29.869 --> 00:05:32.040 
confusing and I don't know how far along
I<00:05:30.139> am<00:05:30.169> nobody<00:05:30.829> knows<00:05:31.039> how<00:05:31.249> far<00:05:31.429> along<00:05:31.550> are<00:05:31.819> you

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
I am nobody knows how far along are you

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.379 
I am nobody knows how far along are you
nobody<00:05:33.050> knows<00:05:33.199> what<00:05:33.559> the<00:05:33.589> heck<00:05:33.829> is<00:05:33.979> going<00:05:34.249> on

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
nobody knows what the heck is going on

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:41.799 
nobody knows what the heck is going on
but<00:05:35.389> she<00:05:35.959> was<00:05:37.149> she<00:05:38.919> did<00:05:39.919> say<00:05:40.329> that<00:05:41.329> there<00:05:41.659> is

00:05:41.799 --> 00:05:41.809 
but she was she did say that there is

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:45.059 
but she was she did say that there is
the<00:05:41.929> possibility<00:05:41.959> of<00:05:42.709> twins<00:05:43.159> just<00:05:43.579> because<00:05:43.999> of

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:45.069 
the possibility of twins just because of

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:50.079 
the possibility of twins just because of
how<00:05:46.069> fast<00:05:46.459> my<00:05:46.669> HCG<00:05:47.449> has<00:05:47.989> a<00:05:48.019> prison<00:05:48.819> had<00:05:49.819> risen

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:50.089 
how fast my HCG has a prison had risen

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:53.409 
how fast my HCG has a prison had risen
um<00:05:51.309> you<00:05:52.309> know<00:05:52.399> when<00:05:52.610> I<00:05:52.669> was<00:05:52.759> taking<00:05:53.059> the<00:05:53.149> test

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.419 
um you know when I was taking the test

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.379 
um you know when I was taking the test
that<00:05:54.409> I<00:05:54.469> got<00:05:54.769> a<00:05:54.800> positive<00:05:55.189> so<00:05:55.669> early<00:05:56.029> in<00:05:56.149> a

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
that I got a positive so early in a

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:00.149 
that I got a positive so early in a
really<00:05:56.899> good<00:05:57.139> positive<00:05:57.379> so<00:05:57.919> she<00:05:57.979> was<00:05:58.279> like<00:05:58.309> um

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:00.159 
really good positive so she was like um

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:03.980 
really good positive so she was like um
do<00:06:01.159> twins<00:06:01.429> in<00:06:01.579> your<00:06:01.610> family

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.810 

all<00:06:04.920> that<00:06:05.100> stuff<00:06:05.370> and<00:06:05.610> I<00:06:05.970> do<00:06:06.030> i<00:06:06.450> do<00:06:06.630> have<00:06:07.020> a

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820 
all that stuff and I do i do have a

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.320 
all that stuff and I do i do have a
twins<00:06:08.820> I<00:06:09.150> have<00:06:09.420> I<00:06:09.780> usually<00:06:10.500> ovulate<00:06:11.160> more<00:06:12.120> than

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
twins I have I usually ovulate more than

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.510 
twins I have I usually ovulate more than
one<00:06:12.570> egg<00:06:12.810> per<00:06:13.080> cycle<00:06:13.440> so<00:06:15.110> it's<00:06:16.110> a<00:06:16.200> possibility

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
one egg per cycle so it's a possibility

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.450 
one egg per cycle so it's a possibility
but<00:06:17.520> we'll<00:06:17.760> just<00:06:18.000> wait<00:06:18.120> and<00:06:18.180> see<00:06:18.360> because<00:06:18.600> i

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
but we'll just wait and see because i

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:25.040 
but we'll just wait and see because i
would<00:06:20.460> guess<00:06:21.050> another<00:06:22.790> two<00:06:23.790> weeks<00:06:24.300> one<00:06:24.870> week

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
would guess another two weeks one week

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.380 
would guess another two weeks one week
to<00:06:25.290> week<00:06:25.440> something<00:06:25.890> like<00:06:26.070> that<00:06:26.280> until<00:06:27.210> i<00:06:27.270> get

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:27.390 
to week something like that until i get

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:32.380 
to week something like that until i get
two<00:06:27.630> thousand<00:06:27.960> HTG<00:06:28.560> because<00:06:28.890> i<00:06:30.050> got<00:06:31.050> a<00:06:31.110> digital

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:32.390 
two thousand HTG because i got a digital

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:38.790 
two thousand HTG because i got a digital
to<00:06:33.390> say<00:06:33.540> positive<00:06:33.810> about

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.890 

for<00:06:39.430> 34<00:06:40.150> days<00:06:40.180> ago

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.490 

it<00:06:43.320> was<00:06:43.440> like<00:06:43.560> five<00:06:43.800> days<00:06:44.009> ago<00:06:44.960> and<00:06:45.960> I<00:06:46.350> don't

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 
it was like five days ago and I don't

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.080 
it was like five days ago and I don't
remember<00:06:46.830> how<00:06:47.220> much<00:06:47.370> does<00:06:47.580> take<00:06:47.759> but<00:06:47.910> I<00:06:47.970> got

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.090 
remember how much does take but I got

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:49.460 
remember how much does take but I got
three<00:06:48.330> different<00:06:48.479> digital's<00:06:49.050> to<00:06:49.290> say

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470 
three different digital's to say

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.620 
three different digital's to say
positive<00:06:50.340> and<00:06:50.759> I<00:06:50.790> think<00:06:51.000> those<00:06:51.150> take<00:06:51.389> quite<00:06:51.570> a

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:51.630 
positive and I think those take quite a

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:56.540 
positive and I think those take quite a
bit<00:06:51.780> of<00:06:51.840> HCG<00:06:52.259> and<00:06:52.800> your<00:06:53.550> HCG<00:06:53.940> doubles<00:06:54.710> every<00:06:55.710> 48

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.550 
bit of HCG and your HCG doubles every 48

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:01.730 
bit of HCG and your HCG doubles every 48
to<00:06:56.970> 72<00:06:57.330> hours<00:06:57.539> so<00:06:59.870> it<00:07:00.870> might<00:07:01.050> not<00:07:01.080> take<00:07:01.380> too

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:01.740 
to 72 hours so it might not take too

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.610 
to 72 hours so it might not take too
terribly<00:07:02.400> long<00:07:02.520> but<00:07:03.060> we<00:07:03.150> will<00:07:03.300> see<00:07:03.620> anyways

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:04.620 
terribly long but we will see anyways

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.250 
terribly long but we will see anyways
back<00:07:05.070> I
