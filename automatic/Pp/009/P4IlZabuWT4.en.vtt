00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
process here so now the hard part starts

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.750 
process here so now the hard part starts
you're<00:01:13.500> going<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.680> take<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> little<00:01:13.950> end<00:01:14.189> you're

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
you're going to take a little end you're

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.499 
you're going to take a little end you're
going<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.970> rotate<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:16.080> be<00:01:16.229> seam<00:01:16.680> side<00:01:16.920> up

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
going to rotate it to be seam side up

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.190 
going to rotate it to be seam side up
this<00:01:18.509> way<00:01:18.750> for<00:01:19.320> my<00:01:19.409> right<00:01:19.650> side<00:01:19.920> over<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.909> way

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
this way for my right side over this way

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.149 
this way for my right side over this way
counterclockwise<00:01:22.200> has<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.860> be<00:01:22.950> kind<00:01:23.070> of

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
counterclockwise has to be kind of

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.230 
counterclockwise has to be kind of
clockwise<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.670> do<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.880> other<00:01:23.909> way<00:01:24.030> it's

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
clockwise you do it the other way it's

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.420 
clockwise you do it the other way it's
not<00:01:24.360> going<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.540> work<00:01:25.189> then<00:01:26.189> you're<00:01:26.280> going<00:01:26.369> to
