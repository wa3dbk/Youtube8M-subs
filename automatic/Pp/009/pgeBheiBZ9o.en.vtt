00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.949 
so you'll need to have the developer
tools<00:02:33.459> installed<00:02:34.860> if<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:36.040> don't<00:02:36.250> I<00:02:36.959> recommend

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959

you<00:02:38.110> get<00:02:38.320> them<00:02:38.620> or<00:02:39.489> you<00:02:39.730> can<00:02:39.760> just<00:02:39.940> download

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
you get them or you can just download

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.460 
you get them or you can just download
the<00:02:41.050> modified<00:02:41.709> file<00:02:42.540> there<00:02:43.540> is<00:02:43.570> a<00:02:43.720> Dropbox

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
the modified file there is a Dropbox

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.540 
the modified file there is a Dropbox
link<00:02:44.620> in<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.430> description<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:47.560> what<00:02:48.100> we<00:02:48.250> want

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
link in the description so what we want

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:56.600 
link in the description so what we want
to<00:02:48.670> do<00:02:48.820> is<00:02:49.320> change<00:02:50.940> JVM<00:02:51.940> version<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.860> 1.6<00:02:54.959> plus

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
to do is change JVM version to 1.6 plus

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.370 
to do is change JVM version to 1.6 plus
then<00:02:57.610> we're<00:02:57.790> going<00:02:57.940> to<00:02:58.000> copy<00:02:58.269> this<00:02:58.690> string<00:02:59.140> and

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
then we're going to copy this string and

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.110 
then we're going to copy this string and
paste<00:02:59.860> it<00:03:00.100> and<00:03:00.549> modify<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.750> first<00:03:02.200> one<00:03:02.440> to<00:03:03.120> x86

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
paste it and modify the first one to x86

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.980 
paste it and modify the first one to x86
underscore<00:03:05.459> 64

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
underscore 64

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.690 
underscore 64
so<00:03:08.470> this<00:03:09.040> will<00:03:09.880> work<00:03:10.270> and<00:03:11.400> while<00:03:12.400> we're<00:03:12.670> here

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
so this will work and while we're here

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.020 
so this will work and while we're here
we<00:03:13.330> can<00:03:13.510> change<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:14.170> RAM<00:03:14.440> amount<00:03:15.030> minecraft

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
we can change the RAM amount minecraft

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.180 
we can change the RAM amount minecraft
gets<00:03:16.690> so<00:03:17.620> -<00:03:17.980> XMS<00:03:18.940> is<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.900> allocated<00:03:20.620> RAM

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
gets so - XMS is the allocated RAM

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.000 
gets so - XMS is the allocated RAM
amount<00:03:21.580> which<00:03:22.300> is<00:03:22.570> the<00:03:22.870> gram<00:03:23.110> amount<00:03:23.260> it<00:03:23.740> gets

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
amount which is the gram amount it gets

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.970 
amount which is the gram amount it gets
one<00:03:24.460> minecraft<00:03:24.910> starts<00:03:25.810> and<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.940> will<00:03:28.180> get

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
one minecraft starts and it will get

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.030 
one minecraft starts and it will get
while<00:03:29.980> it<00:03:30.370> is<00:03:30.700> running<00:03:31.660> so<00:03:32.050> all<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.470> free<00:03:32.740> Ram

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
while it is running so all the free Ram

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.090 
while it is running so all the free Ram
deck<00:03:33.340> will<00:03:33.670> be<00:03:33.930> dedicated<00:03:34.930> to<00:03:34.960> Minecraft<00:03:35.770> and

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
deck will be dedicated to Minecraft and

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.720 
deck will be dedicated to Minecraft and
then<00:03:36.730> we've<00:03:36.970> got<00:03:37.180> X<00:03:37.570> M<00:03:37.900> X<00:03:38.470> which<00:03:39.370> is<00:03:39.580> the

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
then we've got X M X which is the

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.050 
then we've got X M X which is the
maximum<00:03:40.150> RAM<00:03:40.600> amount<00:03:41.400> so<00:03:42.400> of<00:03:42.610> course<00:03:42.790> you

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
maximum RAM amount so of course you

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.090 
maximum RAM amount so of course you
don't<00:03:43.240> want<00:03:43.510> to<00:03:43.660> give<00:03:43.930> it<00:03:44.140> more<00:03:44.380> RAM<00:03:44.710> than<00:03:44.740> you

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
don't want to give it more RAM than you

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.970 
don't want to give it more RAM than you
actually<00:03:45.310> have<00:03:45.820> so<00:03:46.090> go<00:03:46.330> again<00:03:46.660> to<00:03:46.840> Apple<00:03:47.710> about

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
actually have so go again to Apple about

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.210 
actually have so go again to Apple about
this<00:03:48.370> Mac<00:03:48.610> and<00:03:49.000> check<00:03:49.330> memory<00:03:49.960> I've<00:03:50.710> got<00:03:51.040> 8

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
this Mac and check memory I've got 8

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.600 
this Mac and check memory I've got 8
gigs<00:03:51.690> so<00:03:52.690> I<00:03:53.110> can<00:03:53.560> modify<00:03:54.010> this

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.660 

so<00:03:57.880> this<00:03:58.120> is<00:03:58.300> one<00:03:58.600> gig<00:03:58.900> in<00:03:59.140> megabytes<00:03:59.770> so<00:04:00.130> we

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
so this is one gig in megabytes so we

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.620 
so this is one gig in megabytes so we
can<00:04:00.850> either<00:04:01.090> multiply<00:04:01.450> this<00:04:01.900> by<00:04:02.230> eight<00:04:02.560> or

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
can either multiply this by eight or

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.750 
can either multiply this by eight or
just<00:04:04.630> delete<00:04:05.020> it<00:04:05.050> and<00:04:05.320> delete<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.160> M<00:04:06.370> which

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
just delete it and delete the M which

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.070 
just delete it and delete the M which
stands<00:04:07.360> for<00:04:07.510> megabytes<00:04:08.290> and<00:04:08.650> put<00:04:09.630> 8g<00:04:10.630> what

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
stands for megabytes and put 8g what

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.910 
stands for megabytes and put 8g what
will<00:04:11.350> be<00:04:11.500> eight<00:04:12.090> gigs<00:04:13.090> and<00:04:13.870> then<00:04:15.180> I'll<00:04:16.180> put<00:04:16.450> two

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
will be eight gigs and then I'll put two

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.150 
will be eight gigs and then I'll put two
gigs<00:04:17.920> for<00:04:18.609> the<00:04:18.880> startup<00:04:19.590> there<00:04:20.590> we<00:04:20.650> go<00:04:20.830> then<00:04:21.130> we

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
gigs for the startup there we go then we

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.040 
gigs for the startup there we go then we
can<00:04:21.430> quit<00:04:21.730> Xcode<00:04:22.500> close<00:04:23.500> this<00:04:23.740> window<00:04:24.190> and

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
can quit Xcode close this window and

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.500 
can quit Xcode close this window and
launch<00:04:26.050> minecraft

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.190 

so<00:04:31.230> there<00:04:31.530> we<00:04:31.650> go<00:04:31.800> now<00:04:32.040> we<00:04:32.100> have<00:04:32.370> Minecraft<00:04:33.200> and

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
so there we go now we have Minecraft and

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.850 
so there we go now we have Minecraft and
I'll<00:04:34.620> go<00:04:34.830> back<00:04:34.980> to<00:04:35.190> Activity<00:04:35.790> Monitor<00:04:36.210> and<00:04:36.860> as

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
I'll go back to Activity Monitor and as

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.040 
I'll go back to Activity Monitor and as
you<00:04:38.040> can<00:04:38.160> see<00:04:38.430> it<00:04:38.640> is<00:04:38.910> now<00:04:39.210> an<00:04:39.510> Intel<00:04:40.580> 64-bit

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
you can see it is now an Intel 64-bit

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:50.590 
you can see it is now an Intel 64-bit
application<00:04:43.050> and<00:04:44.090> if<00:04:45.090> we<00:04:45.300> actually<00:04:45.510> login

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.740 

so<00:04:51.230> go<00:04:51.770> to<00:04:51.830> fullscreen<00:04:54.700> single-player<00:04:55.750> okay

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
so go to fullscreen single-player okay

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.930 
so go to fullscreen single-player okay
world

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.340 

and<00:05:02.510> let's<00:05:02.870> check<00:05:03.320> this<00:05:03.500> out<00:05:03.800> as<00:05:04.700> you<00:05:04.940> can<00:05:05.090> see

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
and let's check this out as you can see

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.030 
and let's check this out as you can see
I<00:05:06.350> actually<00:05:06.860> have<00:05:07.600> 8<00:05:08.600> gigs<00:05:08.990> right<00:05:09.260> there<00:05:09.530> in

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
I actually have 8 gigs right there in

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.560 
I actually have 8 gigs right there in
megabytes<00:05:10.490> and<00:05:11.740> allocated<00:05:12.740> memory<00:05:13.240> see<00:05:14.240> it's

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
megabytes and allocated memory see it's

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.910 
megabytes and allocated memory see it's
2<00:05:14.960> gigs<00:05:15.230> so<00:05:15.770> that<00:05:16.330> the<00:05:17.330> modified<00:05:17.840> Rama<00:05:18.500> thing

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920 
2 gigs so that the modified Rama thing

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.740 
2 gigs so that the modified Rama thing
did<00:05:19.460> work<00:05:19.850> too<00:05:21.370> so<00:05:22.370> I<00:05:22.790> hope<00:05:23.120> this<00:05:23.330> helped<00:05:23.690> you
