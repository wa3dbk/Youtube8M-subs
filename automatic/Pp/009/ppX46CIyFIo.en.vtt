00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:11.130
 yes you people this behind me this 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.690
 are the skullcandy scratches and these 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.009
 I found headphones on the ifa 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.139
 and they got me that way 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.600
 impressed that they are an incredible 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.580
 bass people know me and 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.890
 know how my taste in music and mine 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.630
 head tastes know that they are 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.340
 rather more balanced headphones 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.779
 marketing not somehow bass-heavy 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.340
 or not let anyone listen to you 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.610
 but that is relatively balanced like 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.200
 for example, are relatively balanced 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.290
 for example the cash register and pro of 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.730
 I count the headphones here 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.910
 not to have one 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.120
 specialty namely in the bass and that you 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.170
 really bring that specialty 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.450
 you could see that the bass 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.210
 could hear though one beside the beats 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.680
 stood on the ifa and wants to 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.050
 what does the goal of this mean? 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.329
 headphone is really something into it 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.379
 to call life and really bass-heavy 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.969
 to be and still a good one 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.050
 to have sound and if they are just that 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.670
 we want to fulfill in this video 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.199
 find out first we have an extra 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.970
 Battery we start in one at the beginning 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.040
 this mission must submit her 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.860
 from a certain volume switches 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.500
 then the sensation 55 drivers a 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.020
 and with it we have vibration and end 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.990
 I think this is a fake something 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.130
 but with a vibration motor 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.720
 that's why the batteries come but the 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.990
 Effect works and you really have it 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.670
 one sounded very bass heavy 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.560
 is now the krÃ¤tscher consist of 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.820
 plastic and a kind of imitation leather that 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.520
 making first a relatively good 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.590
 impression are comfortable they do not press 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.119
 that's important the earpieces are one 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.670
 very little bit small but it is 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.079
 still acceptable so the limit of that 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.700
 it should not be smaller 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.259
 I think they are good overall 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.570
 but not overly good 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.310
 but a plus point gives it up 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.680
 every case for the pluggable cable 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.659
 with control functions so with a 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.890
 button but that the cable completely off too 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.509
 is definitely a point 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.950
 you should note it should have 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.659
 not many head for today and I think 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.399
 It's an extremely important point to deal with 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.110
 cable breaks can prevent what 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.860
 skullcandy but definitely works 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.810
 this weirdly horny bass really 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.770
 still exists one summer summer 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.539
 have a good sound 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.430
 I personally have to say the bass 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.230
 Sounds a bit dull so it 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.840
 a little stupid 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.459
 as you might expect and the 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.450
 sound is not so, as I said, he 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.680
 can not be balanced 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.879
 we have a little bit too much 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.930
 Increase the rent could be a bit 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:23.330
 come out more then of course the 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.640
 apache expelled bass who there with 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.379
 but comes out for a total of people 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.750
 really stand on bass for the bass 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.629
 one and all is actually music 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.010
 could only hear from bass consisting 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.599
 I think the headphones are on everyone 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.190
 case we also have a 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.510
 regulator with which we can adjust how 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.000
 strong should be the bass 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.980
 and he is so strong that you can not 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.450
 can only feel which no moves 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.620
 but you can even see him if 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.510
 it puts on the table, the whole 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.700
 you can see how the headphones are 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.019
 sometimes a bit agitated when you are 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.340
 There really the bass completely on 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.709
 the abo is not even full volume 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.599
 is and you have to be clear 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.930
 I make mine when I get a headphone 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.280
 moved then maybe he is just loud 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.780
 set but if the whole 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.359
 moved and he is still on one 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.709
 soft on one of a soft 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:07.670
 underlay such as a piece of 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.140
 the upholstery 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.480
 then that should mean something like that 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.099
 thing properly vibrates so again 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.470
 the sound is definitely not balanced 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.370
 we have extremely high bass levels 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.030
 are very little bit 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.069
 overdriven and the middle of it is 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.720
 no balanced sound but again 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.790
 that really stand out for people on bass 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.440
 it will be a dream for them and more 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.560
 as a dream i know people were the 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.859
 Listen to a lot of hip hop or people who are very 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.389
 Listen to a lot of classical electronics music 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:39.380
 but that is not perfect anymore 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:40.639
 it will be something for everyone 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.739
 You can do that with the regulator as well 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.120
 subordinate and it is quite interesting 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.950
 So overall, I think the idea is 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.160
 really cool but the implementation 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.720
 It's just a bit like that 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.220
 because if I am normal now 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.650
 I would like to get some musicians for me 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.419
 less money sounded better but who 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.650
 Watch out for that will be the one 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.450
 to be an absolute dream and I can 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.829
 just simply recommend it 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.480
 Let's take a look below in the video 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.220
 Usually you can say yes 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.840
 things electronics products within 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.790
 30 days without stating reasons easy 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.919
 send back so just give it a try 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.840
 and if you like it, keep it 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:13.459
 if I send her back to it 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.959
 are the 14 days since you find the link 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.720
 In any case as mentioned below in the 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.340
 video description and tell me something 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.979
 is important to you headphones 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.479
 what do you value and why have you 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.650
 you which heads or which headphones 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.180
 absolutely have booty 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.710
 and there's a small one left 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.699
 sorry for the few videos 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.840
 I'm in the 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:32.120
 examination phase examination 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.620
 Preparatory phase for the study and 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.870
 well it's not quite that much time though 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.280
 I always try something again 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.539
 I do not produce either 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.580
 make low end production but 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:42.440
 Somehow a little bit of what 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.639
 That's why you'll see thanks 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.860
 I hope to see you in the next one 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:48.400
 video is doing well again 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.400
 Zschau
