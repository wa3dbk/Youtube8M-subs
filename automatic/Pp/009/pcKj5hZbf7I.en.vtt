about the ports that come with the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.790 
about the ports that come with the
laptop<00:00:50.160> because<00:00:51.199> most<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.320> guys<00:00:52.500> have

laptop because most you guys have

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.979 
laptop because most you guys have
already<00:00:53.039> seen<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> review<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.879> has<00:00:54.660> tell<00:00:54.870> you

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
already seen a review that has tell you

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.590 
already seen a review that has tell you
ton't<00:00:55.379> told<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.070> about<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.399> reports<00:00:56.760> are<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
ton't told you about the reports are the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.160 
ton't told you about the reports are the
ports<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.820> I<00:00:59.820> always<00:01:00.719> think<00:01:00.809> it's<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:01.109> a

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
ports and I always think it's just a

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.049 
ports and I always think it's just a
waste<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.440> time<00:01:01.500> because<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.940> would

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
waste of time because you you would

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:03.860 
waste of time because you you would
already<00:01:03.149> know<00:01:03.300> about<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.629> if<00:01:03.780> you're

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
already know about it if you're

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.140 
already know about it if you're
