00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:08.639
 welcome you to my channel today 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:11.969
 we will consider cracked frame repair without 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.820
 welding applications and installation 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.880
 preventive amps mean on 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.890
 this car on the left on the top shelf 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.920
 frames 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.570
 cracked occurred crack 8 mounting 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.580
 shock absorber we have already fallen 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:32.690
 attachments now show you where this 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:34.290
 crack is heavenly pillow mount 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.100
 cabin cushions 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.780
 here's the beginning of the crack this si seen 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.480
 small rusty strip is a crack 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.940
 coming from the hole with further she 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.890
 will diverge to 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.320
 tube shock absorbers as well go on 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.930
 horizontals but this stuff more 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.460
 essentially can be viewed from the inside 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.500
 get down here look look here 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.840
 see little strip 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.989
 from the mounting bolt and goes to the edge and 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.750
 same from this bracket brought crack 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.170
 here it is small and here you can see ryazan 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.830
 secret crack inside 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:17.119
 lest she cook no cracks go 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.009
 next we put the amplifier go out 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.439
 inside there will be two such 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:27.409
 prefabricated amplifier 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.409
 but for on flax from corner 75 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:35.740
 edge sharpened at the winepress of drills on 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.729
 old is important old frame to drill 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:43.619
 Now all we are all asked you put 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:48.460
 know so here we see screwed 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:52.030
 bolted amplifier except it tight 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.950
 lays down in the morning and and is screwed by all 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.630
 technological holes in all 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.470
 technological holes were inserted 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.259
 the bolts 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:03.149
 what you see loose is bolts for 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.149
 clamps and for 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.080
 this was done in pairs of a new throw 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.710
 injection 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.110
 assembly facility felling fixed i 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.520
 injection on the frame such that no hole 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.120
 and will be clamps 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.340
 brake tubes clamped and so here 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.160
 on this machine, too, started small 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.310
 crack of a water is a cross 2 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.680
 the crossbar here too will be in the future 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:35.190
 set crescent screed and stop 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.190
 lengthen this crack 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.269
 now we set the amplifier on the right 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.920
 same side 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.980
 identical as on the left here you can 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.920
 all tubes have fixed it to look 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.840
 tightened all the bolts 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.410
 now he will not give the opportunity 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:03:01.599
 This is what the shock absorber bracket do 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:04.230
 Here cracks and enhance swirling cushion 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.880
 cabins 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.940
 all tubes had to be fixed 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:15.430
 make an extra bracket all 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:19.060
 amplifiers lays down tightly her day and no 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:22.379
 no sampling gap made under rub 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.379
 brake pipes 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.000
 take care 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:33.129
 no welding done all done 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.129
 screwed 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:42.610
 Thank you for your attention if something is not clear 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:46.450
 ask answer 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.450
 until next meetings
