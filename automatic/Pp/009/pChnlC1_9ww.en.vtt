00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
hello youtube and welcome to a remake of

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.150 
hello youtube and welcome to a remake of
an<00:00:02.700> altered<00:00:03.000> tutorial<00:00:03.570> i<00:00:03.720> did<00:00:03.929> on<00:00:04.080> how<00:00:04.290> to<00:00:04.350> make

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
an altered tutorial i did on how to make

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.540 
an altered tutorial i did on how to make
a<00:00:05.190> gun<00:00:05.520> that<00:00:05.970> shoots<00:00:06.210> in<00:00:06.480> unity<00:00:06.990> and<00:00:07.560> i<00:00:08.220> decided

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
a gun that shoots in unity and i decided

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.190 
a gun that shoots in unity and i decided
to<00:00:08.670> remake<00:00:08.970> this<00:00:09.179> because<00:00:09.570> it<00:00:09.780> was<00:00:09.900> kind<00:00:10.139> of

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
to remake this because it was kind of

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.080 
to remake this because it was kind of
old<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.590> i<00:00:10.740> had<00:00:10.889> in<00:00:11.040> two<00:00:11.219> parts<00:00:11.610> but<00:00:11.849> i<00:00:11.880> don't

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
old and i had in two parts but i don't

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.730 
old and i had in two parts but i don't
think<00:00:12.300> you<00:00:12.389> really<00:00:12.540> need<00:00:12.750> two<00:00:12.960> parts<00:00:13.290> do<00:00:13.530> this

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
think you really need two parts do this

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.720 
think you really need two parts do this
so<00:00:14.570> here<00:00:15.570> we<00:00:15.630> go<00:00:15.839> so<00:00:16.500> first<00:00:16.920> i<00:00:17.130> have<00:00:17.279> these<00:00:17.490> two

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
so here we go so first i have these two

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.470 
so here we go so first i have these two
scripts<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.869> three<00:00:19.199> scripts<00:00:19.590> actually<00:00:20.480> i'm

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
scripts and three scripts actually i'm

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.750 
scripts and three scripts actually i'm
not<00:00:21.660> going<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.810> go<00:00:21.960> over<00:00:21.990> how<00:00:22.590> they<00:00:23.460> work

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
not going to go over how they work

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.060 
not going to go over how they work
because<00:00:24.449> this<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.230> really<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.619> scripting

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
because this is a really a scripting

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.980 
because this is a really a scripting
tutorial<00:00:26.250> i<00:00:26.849> kind<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.330> went<00:00:27.480> over<00:00:27.720> how<00:00:27.840> they

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
tutorial i kind of went over how they

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.320 
tutorial i kind of went over how they
worked<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.529> my<00:00:28.740> older<00:00:29.730> one<00:00:29.849> now<00:00:30.029> we<00:00:30.179> get

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
worked in my older one now we get

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.400 
worked in my older one now we get

if<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.040> really<00:00:32.340> want<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.579> know<00:00:32.669> how<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.000> works

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
if you really want to know how it works

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.470 
if you really want to know how it works
but<00:00:34.370> let's<00:00:35.370> just<00:00:35.550> make<00:00:35.700> things<00:00:35.880> simple<00:00:36.329> and

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
but let's just make things simple and

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.110 
but let's just make things simple and
i'll<00:00:36.809> show<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.079> how<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.320> use<00:00:37.770> them<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.820> first

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
i'll show you how to use them so first

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.970 
i'll show you how to use them so first
you<00:00:39.690> can<00:00:39.840> delete<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.230> main<00:00:40.440> camera<00:00:40.710> right

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
you can delete this main camera right

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.639 
you can delete this main camera right
here<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.430> make<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> game<00:00:42.480> object<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.320> go<00:00:43.590> to

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
here and make a game object and go to

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.010 
here and make a game object and go to
cube<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.719> let's<00:00:45.719> Center<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.320> at<00:00:46.590> 0<00:00:47.629> on<00:00:48.629> all

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
cube and let's Center this at 0 on all

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.529 
cube and let's Center this at 0 on all
the<00:00:49.230> accesses<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.070> let's<00:00:50.430> just<00:00:50.489> zoom<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:51.390> on

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
the accesses and let's just zoom in on

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.529 
the accesses and let's just zoom in on
it<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:52.520> we<00:00:53.520> can<00:00:53.730> call<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.090> ground<00:00:56.270> and<00:00:57.270> I'm

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
it and we can call this ground and I'm

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.110 
it and we can call this ground and I'm
going<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.750> make<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.260> height<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:59.039> Oh<00:00:59.250> point

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
going to make the height of it Oh point

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.130 
going to make the height of it Oh point
zero<00:01:00.480> one<00:01:01.520> and<00:01:02.520> then<00:01:03.120> we<00:01:03.239> can<00:01:03.420> zoom<00:01:03.660> out<00:01:03.870> and

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
zero one and then we can zoom out and

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:12.820 
zero one and then we can zoom out and
i'll<00:01:04.799> make<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.189> 100<00:01:10.310> yep<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.640> let's<00:01:12.360> make<00:01:12.570> a

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
i'll make this 100 yep and let's make a

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.539 
i'll make this 100 yep and let's make a
directional<00:01:13.830> light<00:01:14.330> so<00:01:15.330> then<00:01:15.509> we<00:01:15.630> can<00:01:15.780> see<00:01:16.549> and

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
directional light so then we can see and

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.820 
directional light so then we can see and
right<00:01:18.330> here<00:01:18.479> i<00:01:18.509> have<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> character<00:01:19.409> controller

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
right here i have a character controller

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.730 
right here i have a character controller
thing<00:01:20.520> if<00:01:21.479> you're<00:01:21.900> using<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.350> latest<00:01:22.500> version

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
thing if you're using the latest version

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.620 
thing if you're using the latest version
of<00:01:23.040> unity<00:01:23.460> then<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.759> look<00:01:23.909> different<00:01:24.090> i<00:01:24.420> just

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
of unity then it look different i just

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.600 
of unity then it look different i just
know<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.020> new<00:01:25.140> one<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.530> i<00:01:25.560> stick<00:01:26.490> with

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
know like the new one so i stick with

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.140 
know like the new one so i stick with
the<00:01:26.729> old<00:01:27.259> character<00:01:28.259> controller<00:01:28.650> thing<00:01:29.150> but

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
the old character controller thing but

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.270 
the old character controller thing but
it'll<00:01:30.630> look<00:01:30.869> different<00:01:31.110> for<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.650> just<00:01:32.009> don't

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
it'll look different for you just don't

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.060 
it'll look different for you just don't
worry<00:01:32.430> does<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.850> same<00:01:33.060> thing<00:01:33.619> just<00:01:34.619> as<00:01:34.770> things

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
worry does the same thing just as things

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.700 
worry does the same thing just as things
like<00:01:35.220> footprints<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.180> stuff<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:37.619> will

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
like footprints and stuff that it will

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.080 
like footprints and stuff that it will
probably<00:01:37.890> say<00:01:38.100> something<00:01:38.130> like<00:01:38.430> one<00:01:38.820> with

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
probably say something like one with

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.730 
probably say something like one with
rigid<00:01:39.540> body<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.990> one<00:01:40.110> with<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.409> with<00:01:40.619> your

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
rigid body and one with that with your

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.340 
rigid body and one with that with your
body<00:01:40.979> just<00:01:41.610> do<00:01:41.790> whichever<00:01:42.540> one<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:42.930> want<00:01:43.079> they

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
both do the same thing and just raise it

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.109 
both do the same thing and just raise it
up<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.869> bit<00:01:45.899> son<00:01:46.229> it's<00:01:46.470> not<00:01:46.790> inside<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.820> ground

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
up a bit son it's not inside the ground

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.679 
up a bit son it's not inside the ground
you<00:01:48.329> don't<00:01:48.479> fall<00:01:48.689> through<00:01:49.640> so<00:01:50.640> I'm<00:01:51.240> sorry<00:01:51.509> for

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
the lag to my screen recorder sometimes

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.999 
the lag to my screen recorder sometimes
does<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.750> but<00:01:55.020> let's<00:01:55.350> just<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:57.680> now<00:01:58.680> it's<00:01:58.890> a

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
does that but let's just so now it's a

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.280 
does that but let's just so now it's a
model<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.700> gun<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.420> zoom<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:00.930> on<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.110> main

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
model of the gun so zoom in on the main

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.820 
model of the gun so zoom in on the main
camera<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.920> then<00:02:02.009> let's<00:02:02.219> create<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.549> cube

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
camera and then let's create a cube

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.370 
camera and then let's create a cube
and<00:02:04.460> we'll<00:02:04.670> call<00:02:04.910> this<00:02:04.940> gun<00:02:05.570> if<00:02:05.960> you<00:02:06.230> have<00:02:06.350> a

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
and we'll call this gun if you have a

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.120 
and we'll call this gun if you have a
model<00:02:06.710> of<00:02:06.740> the<00:02:06.830> gun<00:02:07.070> you<00:02:07.220> can<00:02:07.370> do<00:02:07.550> that<00:02:07.730> too<00:02:07.970> I

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
model of the gun you can do that too I

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.610 
model of the gun you can do that too I
just<00:02:10.130> like<00:02:10.369> to<00:02:10.580> do<00:02:10.670> this<00:02:10.880> so<00:02:11.330> let's<00:02:12.260> change

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
just like to do this so let's change

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.580 
just like to do this so let's change
this<00:02:13.100> to<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:14.500> point<00:02:15.500> do<00:02:16.340> ya<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.780> then<00:02:18.260> this<00:02:18.380> can

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
this to a point do ya and then this can

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.330 
this to a point do ya and then this can
be<00:02:18.710> point<00:02:20.350> 14.2<00:02:21.350> let's<00:02:21.770> just<00:02:21.950> make<00:02:22.070> it<00:02:22.130> like

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
be point 14.2 let's just make it like

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.700 
be point 14.2 let's just make it like
box<00:02:23.240> and<00:02:23.860> if<00:02:24.860> we<00:02:24.890> look<00:02:25.280> through<00:02:25.640> it<00:02:25.970> looks

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
box and if we look through it looks

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.730 
box and if we look through it looks
looks<00:02:27.710> fine<00:02:28.250> but<00:02:28.750> we<00:02:29.750> can<00:02:29.900> change<00:02:30.080> it<00:02:30.260> up<00:02:30.380> yeah

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
looks fine but we can change it up yeah

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.190 
looks fine but we can change it up yeah
right<00:02:31.340> that<00:02:31.520> looks<00:02:31.610> good<00:02:31.790> and<00:02:32.120> make<00:02:32.990> it<00:02:33.110> a

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
right that looks good and make it a

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.880 
right that looks good and make it a
child<00:02:33.470> of<00:02:33.710> the<00:02:33.830> main<00:02:34.010> camera<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:35.590> let's<00:02:36.590> zoom

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
child of the main camera and let's zoom

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.980 
child of the main camera and let's zoom
in<00:02:37.040> on<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.550> then<00:02:37.640> do<00:02:37.880> make<00:02:38.630> sure<00:02:38.660> that<00:02:38.930> you

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
in on it and then do make sure that you

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.840 
in on it and then do make sure that you
have<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.170> gun<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:39.770> selected<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:40.430> do<00:02:40.520> create

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
have the gun and selected and do create

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.010 
have the gun and selected and do create
empty<00:02:41.150> child<00:02:41.480> and<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:44.060> can<00:02:44.209> just<00:02:44.390> make<00:02:44.720> it<00:02:44.750> a

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
empty child and you can just make it a

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.520 
empty child and you can just make it a
bit<00:02:45.590> in<00:02:45.709> front<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:46.820> we'll<00:02:47.750> change<00:02:47.959> this<00:02:48.260> to

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
bit in front and we'll change this to

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.930 
bit in front and we'll change this to
bullet<00:02:49.340> spawn<00:02:50.920> now<00:02:51.920> basically<00:02:52.340> this<00:02:52.580> is<00:02:52.640> just

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
bullet spawn now basically this is just

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.970 
bullet spawn now basically this is just
a<00:02:53.030> model<00:02:53.209> for<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.540> gun<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:53.990> it's<00:02:54.770> going<00:02:54.920> to

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
a model for the gun and it's going to

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.710 
a model for the gun and it's going to
follow<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.400> camera<00:02:55.760> when<00:02:55.910> we<00:02:56.030> look<00:02:56.180> around<00:02:56.330> so

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
follow the camera when we look around so

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.750 
follow the camera when we look around so
if<00:02:57.170> I<00:02:57.290> do<00:02:57.350> this<00:02:59.740> it<00:03:00.740> just<00:03:00.770> follows<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.370> camera

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
if I do this it just follows the camera

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.810 
if I do this it just follows the camera
and<00:03:01.970> then<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:02.840> bullets<00:03:03.170> pond<00:03:03.470> also<00:03:04.400> does<00:03:04.580> and

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
and then the bullets pond also does and

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.520 
and then the bullets pond also does and
I<00:03:04.910> don't<00:03:05.090> know<00:03:05.180> why<00:03:05.330> it<00:03:05.390> keeps<00:03:05.720> going<00:03:05.900> to<00:03:06.080> 2d

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
I don't know why it keeps going to 2d

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.449 
I don't know why it keeps going to 2d
but<00:03:06.950> anyway<00:03:07.880> so<00:03:08.260> yeah<00:03:09.260> and<00:03:09.560> then<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:10.160> bullet

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
but anyway so yeah and then the bullet

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.340 
but anyway so yeah and then the bullet
spawned<00:03:10.760> just<00:03:11.300> follows<00:03:11.540> it<00:03:11.660> are<00:03:11.780> on<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:12.050> just

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
spawned just follows it are on to just

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.660 
spawned just follows it are on to just
you<00:03:12.440> can't<00:03:12.650> see<00:03:12.830> it<00:03:12.920> because<00:03:13.070> there's<00:03:13.340> nothing

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
you can't see it because there's nothing

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.000 
you can't see it because there's nothing
attached<00:03:13.910> to<00:03:14.150> it<00:03:14.269> but<00:03:15.140> now<00:03:15.680> we're<00:03:15.830> going<00:03:15.950> to

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
attached to it but now we're going to

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.040 
attached to it but now we're going to
touch<00:03:16.190> something<00:03:16.459> to<00:03:16.730> it<00:03:16.850> so<00:03:17.180> let's<00:03:17.720> drag<00:03:18.019> this

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
touch something to it so let's drag this

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.400 
touch something to it so let's drag this
script<00:03:18.560> right<00:03:18.739> here<00:03:18.950> called<00:03:19.310> shoot<00:03:19.730> and

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
script right here called shoot and

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.540 
script right here called shoot and
that's<00:03:21.410> the<00:03:21.560> key<00:03:21.680> you<00:03:21.709> want<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.070> press<00:03:22.280> since

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
that's the key you want to press since

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.220 
that's the key you want to press since
that<00:03:22.760> mouth<00:03:22.940> 0<00:03:23.300> which<00:03:23.570> is<00:03:23.720> just<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.050> left

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
that mouth 0 which is just the left

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.160 
that mouth 0 which is just the left
mouse<00:03:24.440> button<00:03:24.860> that's<00:03:25.430> a<00:03:25.640> speed<00:03:25.970> we<00:03:26.180> can<00:03:26.360> make

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
mouse button that's a speed we can make

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.740 
mouse button that's a speed we can make
this<00:03:27.290> a<00:03:27.350> bit<00:03:27.590> higher<00:03:27.769> and<00:03:28.610> then<00:03:29.390> that's<00:03:29.570> the

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
this a bit higher and then that's the

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.690 
this a bit higher and then that's the
bullet<00:03:30.080> and<00:03:30.200> I<00:03:30.800> already<00:03:30.950> have<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.340> ball<00:03:31.489> or

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
bullet and I already have the ball or

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.130 
bullet and I already have the ball or
here<00:03:32.000> but<00:03:32.209> i'm<00:03:32.360> just<00:03:32.510> going<00:03:32.780> to<00:03:32.810> show<00:03:32.959> you<00:03:33.050> how

here but i'm just going to show you how
to<00:03:33.200> do<00:03:33.380> it<00:03:33.410> just<00:03:33.890> go<00:03:34.070> to<00:03:34.130> game<00:03:34.430> object<00:03:34.850> create

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
to do it just go to game object create

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.870 
to do it just go to game object create
other<00:03:35.360> let's<00:03:36.350> fear<00:03:36.830> and<00:03:37.040> then<00:03:37.340> change<00:03:37.640> it<00:03:37.760> to

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
other let's fear and then change it to

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.580 
other let's fear and then change it to
whatever<00:03:38.030> your<00:03:38.269> size<00:03:38.390> you<00:03:38.630> want<00:03:38.840> you<00:03:39.350> want<00:03:39.530> to

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
make it small and just do a point one

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.020 
make it small and just do a point one
for<00:03:42.680> everything<00:03:43.040> maybe<00:03:43.280> even<00:03:43.550> smaller<00:03:43.910> than

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
you want and go to add a rigid body like

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.910 
you want and go to add a rigid body like
that<00:03:52.850> you<00:03:53.239> can<00:03:53.390> make<00:03:53.510> it<00:03:53.630> use<00:03:53.750> gravity<00:03:54.200> or<00:03:54.410> not

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
that you can make it use gravity or not

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.220 
that you can make it use gravity or not
if<00:03:55.130> you<00:03:55.250> want<00:03:55.430> then<00:03:55.700> just<00:03:55.910> drag<00:03:56.570> it<00:03:56.600> like<00:03:57.019> that

here it's not the same size it's a lot
bigger<00:04:02.660> so<00:04:03.250> but<00:04:04.250> just<00:04:04.670> so<00:04:04.790> you<00:04:04.970> can<00:04:05.090> see<00:04:05.150> it<00:04:05.420> and

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
bigger so but just so you can see it and

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.900 
bigger so but just so you can see it and

and now if we click
the<00:04:15.050> gun<00:04:15.230> shoots<00:04:16.420> and<00:04:17.420> actually<00:04:18.080> I<00:04:18.110> think<00:04:18.260> I

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
the gun shoots and actually I think I

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.040 
the gun shoots and actually I think I
made<00:04:18.950> a<00:04:18.980> mistake<00:04:19.070> no<00:04:19.970> but<00:04:20.209> it<00:04:20.390> is<00:04:20.720> steak

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:21.050 
made a mistake no but it is steak

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.660 
made a mistake no but it is steak
nevermind<00:04:21.709> so<00:04:23.650> yep<00:04:24.650> that's<00:04:24.680> just<00:04:25.340> all<00:04:25.520> that

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
nevermind so yep that's just all that

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.560 
nevermind so yep that's just all that
does<00:04:26.230> now<00:04:27.230> you<00:04:27.320> can<00:04:27.440> shoot<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:27.710> gun<00:04:28.570> but

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
does now you can shoot the gun but

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.000 
does now you can shoot the gun but
there's<00:04:30.050> a<00:04:30.140> bit<00:04:30.320> more<00:04:30.350> than<00:04:30.650> that<00:04:30.680> that<00:04:30.980> we

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
there's a bit more than that that we

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.300 
there's a bit more than that that we
want<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.310> do<00:04:31.520> like<00:04:32.380> the<00:04:33.380> bullet<00:04:33.710> right<00:04:33.920> now<00:04:34.100> if

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
want to do like the bullet right now if

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.590 
want to do like the bullet right now if
you<00:04:34.460> just<00:04:34.670> keep<00:04:34.790> shooting<00:04:35.000> is<00:04:35.270> just<00:04:35.420> going<00:04:35.510> to

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
you just keep shooting is just going to

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.970 
you just keep shooting is just going to
stay<00:04:35.720> there<00:04:35.870> forever<00:04:36.050> that's<00:04:36.590> not<00:04:36.740> what<00:04:36.860> we

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
stay there forever that's not what we

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.970 
stay there forever that's not what we
want<00:04:37.220> so<00:04:38.060> to<00:04:38.120> fix<00:04:38.600> that<00:04:38.870> take<00:04:39.230> this<00:04:39.380> script

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
want so to fix that take this script

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.280 
want so to fix that take this script
right<00:04:40.130> here<00:04:40.340> self-destruct<00:04:41.150> and<00:04:41.720> just<00:04:42.110> drag

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
right here self-destruct and just drag

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.470 
right here self-destruct and just drag
it<00:04:42.350> onto<00:04:42.590> the<00:04:42.710> bullet<00:04:43.040> prefab<00:04:43.460> and<00:04:44.210> now<00:04:44.300> if<00:04:44.390> we

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
it onto the bullet prefab and now if we

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.690 
it onto the bullet prefab and now if we
go<00:04:44.510> here<00:04:44.900> there's<00:04:45.530> a<00:04:45.650> self-destruct<00:04:46.310> script

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
go here there's a self-destruct script

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.600 
go here there's a self-destruct script
so<00:04:47.360> now<00:04:47.600> this<00:04:47.810> just<00:04:48.220> disappears<00:04:49.220> after<00:04:49.430> a

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
so now this just disappears after a

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.040 
so now this just disappears after a
while<00:04:49.820> because<00:04:50.060> you<00:04:50.360> really<00:04:50.720> don't<00:04:50.810> need<00:04:50.990> it

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
while because you really don't need it

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.320 
while because you really don't need it
after<00:04:51.290> you<00:04:51.530> shoot<00:04:51.680> at<00:04:51.800> once<00:04:52.010> I<00:04:52.280> just<00:04:53.060> set<00:04:53.240> the

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
after you shoot at once I just set the

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.760 
after you shoot at once I just set the
timer<00:04:53.510> to<00:04:53.630> five<00:04:53.900> but<00:04:54.230> you<00:04:54.350> can<00:04:54.500> set<00:04:54.680> it<00:04:54.710> to

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
timer to five but you can set it to

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.110 
timer to five but you can set it to
whatever<00:04:54.980> you<00:04:55.220> want<00:04:55.430> and<00:04:55.580> then<00:04:55.640> after<00:04:56.000> that

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
whatever you want and then after that

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.720 
whatever you want and then after that
time's<00:04:56.420> up<00:04:56.630> in<00:04:56.810> seconds<00:04:57.230> and<00:04:57.530> the<00:04:58.160> bullet<00:04:58.580> will

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
time's up in seconds and the bullet will

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.770 
time's up in seconds and the bullet will
be<00:04:58.910> destroyed<00:04:59.480> so<00:05:00.140> that's<00:05:00.320> how<00:05:00.440> that<00:05:00.500> works

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
be destroyed so that's how that works

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.120 
be destroyed so that's how that works
now<00:05:02.780> the<00:05:02.840> last<00:05:03.380> thing<00:05:03.590> I'm<00:05:03.770> going<00:05:03.890> to<00:05:03.950> go<00:05:04.070> over

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
now the last thing I'm going to go over

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.670 
now the last thing I'm going to go over
is<00:05:04.520> the<00:05:04.550> care<00:05:05.150> package<00:05:05.600> so<00:05:05.840> say<00:05:06.320> you<00:05:06.380> want<00:05:06.590> to

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
is the care package so say you want to

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.130 
is the care package so say you want to
get<00:05:06.770> more<00:05:06.920> ammo<00:05:07.130> so<00:05:08.090> just<00:05:08.390> go<00:05:08.570> over<00:05:08.660> here<00:05:09.080> and

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
get more ammo so just go over here and

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.240 
get more ammo so just go over here and
then<00:05:09.380> create<00:05:09.740> cube<00:05:11.020> we<00:05:12.020> can<00:05:12.230> make<00:05:12.740> it<00:05:12.920> right

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
then create cube we can make it right

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.350 
then create cube we can make it right
here<00:05:14.200> and<00:05:15.200> let's<00:05:15.920> zoom<00:05:16.220> in<00:05:16.400> on<00:05:16.610> it<00:05:16.640> and<00:05:16.970> set

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
here and let's zoom in on it and set

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.650 
here and let's zoom in on it and set
this<00:05:17.570> as<00:05:17.840> is<00:05:18.110> trigger<00:05:18.710> and<00:05:19.030> then<00:05:20.030> we'll<00:05:20.330> drag

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
this as is trigger and then we'll drag

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.220 
this as is trigger and then we'll drag
on<00:05:21.080> the<00:05:21.110> care<00:05:21.560> package<00:05:22.010> script<00:05:22.400> and<00:05:23.230> that's

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
on the care package script and that's

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.050 
on the care package script and that's
just<00:05:24.410> a<00:05:24.530> tag<00:05:24.740> for<00:05:24.950> the<00:05:25.070> player<00:05:25.310> and<00:05:25.670> right<00:05:25.940> now

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
just a tag for the player and right now

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.850 
just a tag for the player and right now
this<00:05:26.180> player<00:05:26.450> doesn't<00:05:26.930> have<00:05:27.050> a<00:05:27.080> tag<00:05:27.350> to<00:05:27.590> it<00:05:27.710> so

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
this player doesn't have a tag to it so

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.640 
this player doesn't have a tag to it so
just<00:05:27.890> go<00:05:28.100> up<00:05:28.310> here<00:05:28.610> to<00:05:28.640> tag<00:05:29.000> and<00:05:29.300> then<00:05:30.170> select

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
just go up here to tag and then select

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.080 
just go up here to tag and then select
player<00:05:31.010> and<00:05:32.350> now<00:05:33.350> when<00:05:34.100> we<00:05:34.280> go<00:05:34.310> and<00:05:34.730> load<00:05:34.910> the
