00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.690
 with slightly higher performance 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.550
 compared to the basic version 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.570

 here it is contained inside an envelope 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.390
 to avoid damage caused by 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.100
 life mentions static let us put a still 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.470
 moment the video card first 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.680
 focus on the accessories that 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:07.040
 we are supplied with it inside 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.350
 of this ballet we find for 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.370
 the note of the power cables 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:16.160
 of the card as it needs 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:19.370
 a limitation of one of 8 and one of 6 pins 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:25.880
 here they are, we also find a 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:27.740
 to wight to vga adapter 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.530
 here is a mini displayport adapter 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.750
 hdmi and we also find a 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.550
 jumper for falcos fire with another 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.040
 same card 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.170
 inside this package tram also a 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.810
 small booklet 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.280
 of advertising a quick guide of 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.720
 installation for the user 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.580
 we also had to 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.200
 a leaflet that gives us this possibility 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:56.070
 to have hybrid bios and trams also a 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.660
 dvd containing the drivers to be installed 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.480
 however, I always advise you to 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.210
 install the drivers you find on the site 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.630
 manufacturer as they are increasingly 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:09.630
 updated with respect to what you will find 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.300
 inside the package 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.010
 here now we can make the 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.209
 Video Card 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:21.720
 let's take it and extract it from the dal 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.420
 heart from its container is before 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.620
 we can already see the generous 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.750
 dimensions of this card 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:35.670
 and let's start right away with listing her 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:38.880
 its weight is approximately 850 grams 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.830
 so it's not really very light 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.070
 this is also due to the big one 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.740
 custom heat sink that is composed of two 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:50.070
 fans that I am able to maintain 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:54.090
 the temperature of the GPU is very low 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:57.030
 even under stress and under overclocking 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:06.360
 here they are the dimensions of the card 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:09.480
 I'm 128 x 269 for 37 mm here 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.340
 what the home sink looks like 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.620
 via mass in here we can see the 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.380
 side view with also the attacks 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.150
 to make the fire costs very nice to the 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.640
 logo m sai may also be increased 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:24.150
 heat pipes and connections for 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:28.880
 the power supply here is the part 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.390
