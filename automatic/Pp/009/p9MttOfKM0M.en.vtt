you<00:00:21.689> would<00:00:21.810> think<00:00:21.930> magicJack<00:00:23.150> controls<00:00:24.150> its

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:24.329 
you would think magicJack controls its

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:26.479 
you would think magicJack controls its
volume<00:00:24.660> hits<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.020> control<00:00:25.349> using<00:00:26.070> this<00:00:26.250> I

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:26.489 
volume hits that control using this I

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:29.150 
volume hits that control using this I
mean<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.820> software<00:00:27.029> does<00:00:27.480> have<00:00:28.160> these

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
mean the software does have these

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.549 
mean the software does have these
toggles<00:00:29.730> built-in<00:00:30.660> but<00:00:30.899> the<00:00:30.989> only<00:00:31.110> problem<00:00:31.529> is

00:00:31.549 --> 00:00:31.559 
toggles built-in but the only problem is

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:33.229 
toggles built-in but the only problem is
you<00:00:31.860> can<00:00:32.009> just<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.340> can<00:00:32.399> do<00:00:32.669> whatever<00:00:32.879> with

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
you can just you can do whatever with

you can just you can do whatever with
them<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:34.040> nothing<00:00:35.040> seems<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.340> change<00:00:35.430> and
