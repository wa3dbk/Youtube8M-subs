00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.470
 with andrea nicoli the road test of 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.840
 this week takes us on board the 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.389
 subaru brz a traction coupe 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.880
 rear and easy to drive but that 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.630
 guarantees a pleasant experience of 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.609
 guide 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.970
 equipped with a 200 horsepower boxer engine 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.920
 can reach a maximum speed of 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.980
 230 km per hour but we give space to 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.980
 images 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.429
 for the test of the week we will go to 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.940
 drive a sports car and that sport the 

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:44.390
 new subaru brz a 2 2 with an engine 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.640
 typically subaru boxer 2 liters 200 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.260
 horses but the most interesting thing is the 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.869
 novelty in the house subaru the traction 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:56.570
 rear 4 meters 24 wheels 17 

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:57.829
 inch an excellent distribution of the theses 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.619
 because with rear-wheel drive 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.689
 you need to drive with the steering wheel and gas 

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:07.580
 and these measures are the measures that the 

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:10.009
 make the boxer 2 engine exclusive 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.110
 100 liters liter in total therefore 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.720
 200 dan to the turbo with direct injection 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.340
 with a double injector with many horses 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.479
 of course we have to insist a bit with gas 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.479
 because he has them very high 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.940
 the driving position is very low 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.929
 he drives with his legs extended with the 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.940
 straight back 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:31.280
 the very enveloping steering wheel seat in 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.409
 leather and small gear lever also 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.630
 the accelerator lifted down 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.200
 remind the car accelerator 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.970
 racing habitability reduced but 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.590
 let's focus on performance because 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.840
 the performances are definitely of 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.300
 reference weight distribution is 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.310
 almost 50 percent on both 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.750
 aces and then the pleasure of driving one 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.239
 rear-wheel Drive 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.700
 excellent 6-speed manual gearbox 

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:57.470
 with precise grafts a little inscription 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.660
 tough but I repeat it is a downturn that 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.479
 reminiscent of racing cars and for 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.629
 this must be tasted two important numbers 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.420
 the weight of just over 1200 kg e 

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:12.050
 performance from 0 to 100 in 7 seconds 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.120
 six maximum speed that touches 230 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.849
 kilometers per hour and consumption 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.090
 taking advantage of how right it should 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:22.280
 to be made yes but in the order the 9 10 km 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.000
 liter with a bit of attention you can 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.920
 touch the 12 kilometers all with 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.830
 great pleasure especially acoustic 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.260
 this noise is heard and then says 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.330
 military flight a stability that is a 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.440
 Proof of error allows it to be a lot 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.440
 very fast in the corners 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.080
 a nice toy in the good sense of the 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.910
 term a coupe with great performance 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.430
 and accessible to all starting from 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.990
 price just under 30 thousand euros a lot 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.300
 ease of driving and yes you are a bit of 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.920
 foot is a bit of big experience 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.750
 great satisfactions and that against 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.750
 cars with superior performance 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.090
 well
