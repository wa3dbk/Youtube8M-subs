in<00:00:08.179> our<00:00:09.179> last<00:00:09.389> lesson<00:00:09.719> we<00:00:10.080> took<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.500> look<00:00:10.650> at

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
in our last lesson we took a look at

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.430 
in our last lesson we took a look at
enabling<00:00:11.130> basic<00:00:11.790> touch<00:00:12.030> interactivity<00:00:12.840> with

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
enabling basic touch interactivity with

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.039 
enabling basic touch interactivity with
display<00:00:13.860> objects<00:00:14.389> there's<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.480> button<00:00:15.719> on<00:00:15.960> our

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
display objects there's a button on our

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.680 
display objects there's a button on our
stage<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:17.460> when<00:00:17.580> we<00:00:17.699> press<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.119> button<00:00:18.390> we

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
stage and when we press the button we

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.679 
stage and when we press the button we
receive<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.740> began<00:00:20.070> phase<00:00:20.340> for<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.699> touch<00:00:20.910> we

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
receive the began phase for the touch we

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.929 
receive the began phase for the touch we
can<00:00:21.900> move<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.740> touch<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.010> receive<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.730> moved

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
can move the touch and receive the moved

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.230 
can move the touch and receive the moved
phase<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.600> then<00:00:25.340> release<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.519> touch<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:27.090> get

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
phase and then release the touch to get

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.050 
phase and then release the touch to get
the<00:00:27.359> ended<00:00:27.689> phase<00:00:27.930> however<00:00:28.920> if<00:00:29.279> we<00:00:29.640> begin<00:00:29.820> the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
the ended phase however if we begin the

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.410 
the ended phase however if we begin the
touch<00:00:30.650> inside<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.980> button<00:00:32.219> area<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.730> then

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
touch inside of the button area and then

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.930 
touch inside of the button area and then
release<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.719> outside<00:00:34.260> we<00:00:35.130> won't<00:00:35.370> get<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
release it outside we won't get the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.600 
release it outside we won't get the
ended<00:00:36.450> phase<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:37.649> do<00:00:37.770> this<00:00:37.950> we<00:00:38.160> have<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.370> add<00:00:38.579> a

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
ended phase to do this we have to add a

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.869 
ended phase to do this we have to add a
little<00:00:38.730> more<00:00:39.059> code<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.930> our<00:00:40.079> logic<00:00:40.730> we'll<00:00:41.730> head

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
little more code to our logic we'll head

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.270 
little more code to our logic we'll head
back<00:00:41.910> into<00:00:42.360> our<00:00:42.570> code<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.140> under<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.980> began

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.430 
back into our code and under the began
portion<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.969> our<00:00:45.030> logic<00:00:45.480> will<00:00:46.079> type<00:00:46.289> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440

now set focus open and close and within

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.660 
now set focus open and close and within
the<00:01:00.930> brackets<00:01:01.379> or<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.859> parenthesis<00:01:02.370> will

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
type II target comma e dot ID so what

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.929 
type II target comma e dot ID so what
this<00:01:10.380> line<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.799> code<00:01:10.950> does<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.610> gets<00:01:11.760> the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
this line of code does is it gets the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.600 
this line of code does is it gets the
current<00:01:12.270> stage<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.439> sets<00:01:13.710> its<00:01:13.920> focus<00:01:14.340> so

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
current stage and it sets its focus so

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.480 
current stage and it sets its focus so
the<00:01:14.729> current<00:01:14.939> stage<00:01:15.240> here<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.680> referring

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
the current stage here is the referring

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.050 
the current stage here is the referring
to<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.909> button<00:01:18.299> which<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.659> e<00:01:19.020> dot<00:01:19.200> target<00:01:19.650> and

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
to the button which is e dot target and

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.950 
to the button which is e dot target and
then<00:01:21.060> e<00:01:21.420> dot<00:01:21.780> ID<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.470> referring<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.549> touch

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
then e dot ID is referring to the touch

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.190 
then e dot ID is referring to the touch
so<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.140> will<00:01:25.290> allow<00:01:25.500> us<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.740> lock<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:27.200> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
so this will allow us to lock in the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.109 
so this will allow us to lock in the
button<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> target<00:01:29.100> with<00:01:29.250> for<00:01:29.700> our<00:01:29.820> touch

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
button is a target with for our touch

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.710 
button is a target with for our touch
now<00:01:30.979> take<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.189> same<00:01:32.520> code<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.390> we<00:01:33.479> need<00:01:33.630> to

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
now take that same code and we need to

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.190 
now take that same code and we need to
release<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.229> at<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:35.040> ended<00:01:35.369> phase<00:01:35.990> paste<00:01:36.990> it

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
release it at the ended phase paste it

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.870 
release it at the ended phase paste it
and<00:01:38.390> then<00:01:39.390> set<00:01:40.079> nil<00:01:40.740> for<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.549> second

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
and then set nil for the second

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.819 
and then set nil for the second
parameter<00:01:42.710> now<00:01:43.710> when<00:01:43.920> we<00:01:43.950> relaunch<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.909> code

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
parameter now when we relaunch the code

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.030 
parameter now when we relaunch the code
will<00:01:46.829> touch<00:01:47.460> move<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.720> release<00:01:49.229> outside<00:01:49.680> and

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
will touch move and release outside and

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.990 
will touch move and release outside and
then<00:01:50.280> we<00:01:50.399> receive<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.149> ended<00:01:51.540> phase<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:53.000> this

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
then we receive the ended phase and this

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.200 
then we receive the ended phase and this
is<00:01:54.240> easily<00:01:55.200> scalable<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:56.070> multi-touch<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:57.060> we

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
is easily scalable to multi-touch so we

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.910 
is easily scalable to multi-touch so we
can<00:01:57.329> use<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.689> code<00:01:58.469> later<00:01:59.810> okay<00:02:00.810> if<00:02:01.170> we

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
can use this code later okay if we

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.010 
can use this code later okay if we
wanted<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.310> move<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.729> button<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.450> wherever<00:02:03.719> we

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
wanted to move the button to wherever we

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.340 
wanted to move the button to wherever we
release<00:02:04.520> this<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.729> pretty<00:02:05.939> easy<00:02:06.229> we'll<00:02:07.229> go

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
release this is pretty easy we'll go

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.529 
release this is pretty easy we'll go
back<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.710> code<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.280> then<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.149> ended

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
back to the code and then the ended

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.090 
back to the code and then the ended
portion<00:02:10.700> right<00:02:11.700> before<00:02:12.120> we<00:02:12.270> just<00:02:12.540> declared

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
portion right before we just declared

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.340

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
the display that get current stage will

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.810 
the display that get current stage will
do<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.590> following<00:02:17.620> self<00:02:18.620> because<00:02:19.610> we're

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
do the following self because we're

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.750 
do the following self because we're

going<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.640> move<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.880> text<00:02:38.120> so<00:02:38.720> we<00:02:39.320> didn't<00:02:39.530> put

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
going to move the text so we didn't put

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.680 
going to move the text so we didn't put
this<00:02:39.830> in<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.070> display<00:02:40.370> group<00:02:40.730> that<00:02:41.510> would<00:02:41.600> be

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
this in the display group that would be

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.210 
this in the display group that would be
the<00:02:41.780> cleanest<00:02:42.020> way<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.350> group<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.830> objects

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
the cleanest way to group the objects

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.830 
the cleanest way to group the objects
and<00:02:43.340> move<00:02:43.460> them<00:02:43.610> together<00:02:43.940> I'm<00:02:44.450> going<00:02:44.690> to<00:02:44.750> be

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
and move them together I'm going to be

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.270 
and move them together I'm going to be
rather<00:02:45.020> lazy<00:02:45.320> and<00:02:45.680> just<00:02:45.710> move<00:02:46.100> them

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
rather lazy and just move them

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:53.280 
rather lazy and just move them
separately<00:02:46.790> so<00:02:47.630> txt<00:02:48.440> x<00:02:49.430> equals<00:02:49.910> y<00:02:50.660> dot<00:02:51.110> X<00:02:51.410> and

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
separately so txt x equals y dot X and

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:00.580 
separately so txt x equals y dot X and
txt<00:02:54.290> dot<00:02:54.590> y<00:02:54.860> equals<00:02:55.700> e<00:02:55.940> dot<00:02:56.540> y<00:02:58.570> ok<00:02:59.570> so<00:02:59.630> now<00:03:00.050> we'll

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
txt dot y equals e dot y ok so now we'll

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.140 
txt dot y equals e dot y ok so now we'll
relaunch<00:03:01.010> and<00:03:01.810> click<00:03:02.810> hold<00:03:03.230> drag<00:03:04.150> release

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
relaunch and click hold drag release

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.220 
relaunch and click hold drag release
click<00:03:06.110> hold<00:03:06.410> drag<00:03:06.860> release<00:03:07.550> if<00:03:07.880> we<00:03:08.870> wanted<00:03:09.170> to

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
click hold drag release if we wanted to

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.410 
click hold drag release if we wanted to
see<00:03:09.530> this<00:03:09.680> animate<00:03:10.310> it'd<00:03:10.490> be<00:03:10.670> pretty<00:03:10.910> easy<00:03:11.030> to

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
see this animate it'd be pretty easy to

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.690 
see this animate it'd be pretty easy to
do<00:03:12.550> what<00:03:13.550> we'll<00:03:13.700> do<00:03:13.910> is<00:03:15.010> delete<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.190> old<00:03:16.340> code

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.700 
and a half okay copy that line paste it
and<00:03:55.210> instead<00:03:56.210> of<00:03:56.270> self<00:03:56.660> we're<00:03:57.350> going<00:03:57.590> to

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
and instead of self we're going to

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.560 
and instead of self we're going to
animate<00:03:58.570> the<00:03:59.570> text<00:04:00.260> object<00:04:00.740> so<00:04:01.400> that's<00:04:01.610> the<00:04:02.420> UM

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
animate the text object so that's the UM

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.830 
animate the text object so that's the UM
text<00:04:02.960> here<00:04:03.170> and<00:04:03.320> the<00:04:04.160> same<00:04:04.370> properties<00:04:04.880> and<00:04:05.150> I

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
text here and the same properties and I

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.350 
text here and the same properties and I
should<00:04:06.080> actually<00:04:06.230> put<00:04:06.470> the<00:04:06.620> Y<00:04:06.770> in<00:04:07.070> all<00:04:07.430> so<00:04:07.670> y

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
should actually put the Y in all so y

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:16.900 
should actually put the Y in all so y
equals<00:04:08.900> e<00:04:09.110> dot<00:04:09.410> y<00:04:12.340> comma<00:04:13.340> and<00:04:15.160> same<00:04:16.160> thing<00:04:16.190> here

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
equals e dot y comma and same thing here

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.090 
equals e dot y comma and same thing here
y<00:04:17.530> equals<00:04:18.530> e<00:04:18.890> dot<00:04:19.549> y

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
y equals e dot y

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:27.690 
y equals e dot y
save<00:04:21.910> it<00:04:22.090> and<00:04:22.240> re<00:04:22.810> lunch<00:04:23.820> okay<00:04:26.070> touch<00:04:27.070> move

save it and re lunch okay touch move
release<00:04:29.760> touchmove<00:04:30.760> release<00:04:31.830> and<00:04:33.390> it's

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
release touchmove release and it's

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.150 
release touchmove release and it's
pretty<00:04:34.540> apparent<00:04:34.870> how<00:04:35.140> this<00:04:35.560> would<00:04:35.740> be<00:04:35.920> used

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
pretty apparent how this would be used

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.860 
pretty apparent how this would be used
in<00:04:36.280> a<00:04:36.340> lot<00:04:36.460> of<00:04:36.520> different<00:04:36.610> games<00:04:37.540> and

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
in a lot of different games and

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.470 
in a lot of different games and
applications<00:04:37.990> and<00:04:38.710> in<00:04:38.800> fact<00:04:38.950> as<00:04:39.130> we<00:04:39.280> go<00:04:39.430> on

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
applications and in fact as we go on

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.280 
applications and in fact as we go on
we'll<00:04:40.480> find<00:04:40.780> that<00:04:40.900> this<00:04:41.200> basic<00:04:41.800> means<00:04:42.400> of

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
we'll find that this basic means of

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.080 
we'll find that this basic means of
touching<00:04:44.290> an<00:04:44.380> object<00:04:44.470> dragging<00:04:45.160> to<00:04:45.670> a

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
touching an object dragging to a

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.650 
touching an object dragging to a
destination<00:04:46.840> and<00:04:47.410> releasing<00:04:47.970> is<00:04:48.970> going<00:04:49.450> to<00:04:49.540> be

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
destination and releasing is going to be

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.780 
destination and releasing is going to be
a<00:04:49.690> basic<00:04:50.230> building<00:04:50.440> block<00:04:50.830> of<00:04:51.070> a<00:04:51.520> lot<00:04:51.760> of

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
a basic building block of a lot of

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.190 
a basic building block of a lot of
different<00:04:51.970> types<00:04:52.900> of<00:04:53.140> games<00:04:53.920> and<00:04:54.100> activities
