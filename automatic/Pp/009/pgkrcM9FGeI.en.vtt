00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:11.680 

so<00:00:09.889> the<00:00:10.040> first<00:00:10.280> move<00:00:10.549> the<00:00:10.580> mostest<00:00:11.150> simple<00:00:11.539> is

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
so the first move the mostest simple is

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:12.890 
so the first move the mostest simple is
there

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
there

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.650 
there
you're<00:00:13.050> aiming<00:00:13.500> here<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:14.340> on<00:00:14.550> here<00:00:14.969> can<00:00:15.570> you

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
you're aiming here to on here can you

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.109 
you're aiming here to on here can you
see<00:00:15.690> this<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.200> brushing<00:00:16.680> so<00:00:17.520> you're<00:00:17.760> thrust

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
see this is brushing so you're thrust

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.880 
see this is brushing so you're thrust
here<00:00:19.110> punch<00:00:19.680> it's<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.939> way<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:22.050> number<00:00:22.380> two<00:00:22.619> is

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
here punch it's a way so number two is

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.820 
here punch it's a way so number two is
if<00:00:23.490> I'm<00:00:23.970> doing<00:00:24.480> this<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.900> might<00:00:25.020> have<00:00:25.529> missed

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
if I'm doing this I might have missed

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.700 
if I'm doing this I might have missed
you<00:00:26.099> then<00:00:26.460> I'll<00:00:26.550> go<00:00:26.730> like<00:00:26.880> this<00:00:27.410> so<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.650> is

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
you then I'll go like this so this is

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.639 
you then I'll go like this so this is
one<00:00:29.130> scenario<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.210> another<00:00:30.480> scenario<00:00:30.810> so

00:00:31.639 --> 00:00:31.649 
one scenario this is another scenario so

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:33.710 
one scenario this is another scenario so
on<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:32.040> scenario<00:00:32.250> here<00:00:32.940> now<00:00:33.180> you're<00:00:33.420> going

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
on this scenario here now you're going

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.040 
on this scenario here now you're going
that<00:00:33.899> way<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.620> might<00:00:34.860> take<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.130> step<00:00:36.050> here

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
that way so you might take a step here

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.290 
that way so you might take a step here
and<00:00:37.230> if<00:00:37.710> you're<00:00:37.950> doing<00:00:38.130> that<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.640> also<00:00:38.670> take<00:00:39.270> a

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
and if you're doing that I also take a

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.139 
and if you're doing that I also take a
step<00:00:39.450> on<00:00:39.930> here<00:00:40.260> once<00:00:41.010> I'm<00:00:41.250> here<00:00:41.550> then<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.850> want

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
step on here once I'm here then I want

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.900 
step on here once I'm here then I want
to<00:00:42.270> knock<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.660> down<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.110> you're<00:00:43.680> there<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:44.879> I

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
to knock you down and you're there so I

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.479 
to knock you down and you're there so I
have<00:00:45.210> my<00:00:45.449> first<00:00:45.750> move<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.350> do<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:46.649> but<00:00:47.280> you

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
have my first move is to do this but you

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.810 
have my first move is to do this but you
came<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:48.120> with<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.449> so<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.260> go<00:00:49.920> outside<00:00:50.250> and

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
came in with that so I go outside and

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.349 
came in with that so I go outside and
then<00:00:51.749> you<00:00:51.899> further<00:00:52.199> go<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.789> I'll<00:00:53.789> go<00:00:53.969> even

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359 
then you further go and I'll go even

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:57.079 
then you further go and I'll go even
outside<00:00:54.719> at<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:55.949> point<00:00:56.280> here<00:00:56.609> I'm<00:00:56.760> going<00:00:56.969> to

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
outside at this point here I'm going to

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.450 
outside at this point here I'm going to
do<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.390> but<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.780> are<00:00:57.809> strong<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.769> need<00:00:59.280> you

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
do this but you are strong so I need you

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.849 
do this but you are strong so I need you
here<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.510> bend<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.199> then<00:01:01.499> I<00:01:01.620> go<00:01:01.829> down

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
here and you bend and then I go down

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.080 
here and you bend and then I go down
here<00:01:02.420> so<00:01:03.420> that's<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.220> so<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.400> only<00:01:05.700> move<00:01:05.909> you

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
here so that's the so the only move you

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.940 
here so that's the so the only move you
cannot<00:01:06.390> physically<00:01:06.780> do<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.380> put<00:01:07.590> your<00:01:07.710> hand

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
cannot physically do is to put your hand

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.850 
cannot physically do is to put your hand
inside<00:01:08.220> your<00:01:08.580> cup<00:01:08.970> here<00:01:09.380> because<00:01:10.380> when<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.680> do

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
inside your cup here because when you do

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.540 
inside your cup here because when you do
that<00:01:11.040> it's<00:01:11.430> indication<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.510> all<00:01:12.780> broken

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
that it's indication this is all broken

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.240 
that it's indication this is all broken
so<00:01:14.550> you<00:01:14.640> must<00:01:15.060> have<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.420> power<00:01:15.630> here<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.250> when

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
so you must have the power here and when

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.610 
so you must have the power here and when
you're<00:01:17.370> trained<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.850> go<00:01:18.000> here

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
you're trained you go here

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.870 
you're trained you go here
imagine<00:01:19.620> goes<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:20.790> here<00:01:21.060> crush<00:01:21.570> everything<00:01:22.880> so

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
imagine goes in here crush everything so

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.110 
imagine goes in here crush everything so
so<00:01:24.660> now<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:24.990> imagine<00:01:25.380> heretofore<00:01:26.340> imagine

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
so now you imagine heretofore imagine

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.590 
so now you imagine heretofore imagine
here<00:01:27.630> no<00:01:28.200> grab<00:01:28.470> here<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.310> twist<00:01:29.730> it<00:01:29.940> up<00:01:30.120> can

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
here no grab here and twist it up can

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.780 
here no grab here and twist it up can
you<00:01:30.690> see<00:01:30.900> already<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.440> it<00:01:31.500> without<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.190> you

has to be can you feel when it's inside

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.660 
has to be can you feel when it's inside
the<00:02:12.780> line<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:13.530> get<00:02:13.739> a<00:02:13.769> feeling

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
the line so get a feeling

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.330
