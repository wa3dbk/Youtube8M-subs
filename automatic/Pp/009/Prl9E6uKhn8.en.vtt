00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
so for the borough heel flip I recommend

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.830 
so for the borough heel flip I recommend
you<00:01:37.920> guys<00:01:38.069> have<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.490> frontside<00:01:38.940> shove-it<00:01:39.509> and

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
you guys have the frontside shove-it and

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.380 
you guys have the frontside shove-it and
the<00:01:40.710> Gil<00:01:40.860> for<00:01:41.840> what<00:01:42.840> your<00:01:43.080> foot<00:01:43.350> position<00:01:43.860> is

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
the Gil for what your foot position is

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.730 
the Gil for what your foot position is
for<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.479> foot<00:01:45.690> position<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.319> frontside

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
for the foot position on the frontside

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.309 
for the foot position on the frontside
flip<00:01:47.039> your<00:01:47.369> front<00:01:47.700> foot<00:01:47.940> is<00:01:48.240> right<00:01:48.690> there<00:01:48.990> just

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319 
flip your front foot is right there just

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:51.289 
flip your front foot is right there just
down<00:01:49.590> from<00:01:49.770> those<00:01:50.039> front<00:01:50.369> bolts<00:01:50.789> we're<00:01:51.179> going

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
down from those front bolts we're going

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.389 
down from those front bolts we're going
to<00:01:51.360> explain<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.990> flip<00:01:52.319> and<00:01:52.470> catch<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.280> the

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
to explain the flip and catch of the

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.699 
to explain the flip and catch of the
trick<00:01:53.959> flipping<00:01:54.959> the<00:01:55.080> hard<00:01:55.289> flip<00:01:55.500> is

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:55.709 
trick flipping the hard flip is

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:58.550 
trick flipping the hard flip is
definitely<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.549> most<00:01:56.759> difficult<00:01:57.539> part<00:01:57.899> so

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
definitely the most difficult part so

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.039 
definitely the most difficult part so
you<00:01:58.590> have<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.920> frontside<00:01:59.399> shove<00:01:59.759> pop<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.270> flick

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
you have to frontside shove pop it flick

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.020 
you have to frontside shove pop it flick
your<00:02:01.229> front<00:02:01.530> foot<00:02:01.770> out<00:02:01.920> get<00:02:02.490> your<00:02:02.580> front<00:02:02.789> foot

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
your front foot out get your front foot

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.690 
your front foot out get your front foot
super<00:02:03.659> far<00:02:03.930> out<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.409> way<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.950> then<00:02:05.340> get<00:02:05.579> it

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
super far out of the way and then get it

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.910 
super far out of the way and then get it
to<00:02:05.729> rotate<00:02:06.270> around<00:02:06.420> we're<00:02:07.259> going<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.590> explain

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
to rotate around we're going to explain

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.069 
to rotate around we're going to explain
all<00:02:08.130> of<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.519> practice<00:02:09.000> steps<00:02:09.269> necessary<00:02:09.630> to

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:10.079 
all of the practice steps necessary to

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:12.770 
all of the practice steps necessary to
learning<00:02:10.709> this<00:02:10.859> trick<00:02:11.359> what<00:02:12.359> you<00:02:12.450> want<00:02:12.600> to<00:02:12.660> do

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
learning this trick what you want to do

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.180 
learning this trick what you want to do
is<00:02:13.019> you<00:02:13.230> want<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:13.440> step<00:02:13.680> off<00:02:13.829> with<00:02:14.010> one<00:02:14.160> foot

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
is you want to step off with one foot

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.970 
is you want to step off with one foot
and<00:02:14.640> also<00:02:15.180> try<00:02:16.079> to<00:02:16.109> form<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.650> frontside

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
and also try to form the frontside

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.650 
and also try to form the frontside
shove-it<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.549> the<00:02:17.790> heel<00:02:17.940> flip<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.390> varial

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
shove-it and the heel flip the varial

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.949 
shove-it and the heel flip the varial
heelflip<00:02:19.019> and<00:02:19.320> this<00:02:20.100> is<00:02:20.220> important<00:02:20.670> because

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
heelflip and this is important because

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.940 
heelflip and this is important because
for<00:02:21.959> this<00:02:22.079> trick<00:02:22.260> it's<00:02:22.410> really<00:02:22.590> hard<00:02:22.769> to<00:02:22.829> get

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
for this trick it's really hard to get

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.860 
for this trick it's really hard to get
the<00:02:23.040> timing<00:02:23.340> sometimes<00:02:23.940> we're<00:02:24.570> going<00:02:24.720> to

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
the timing sometimes we're going to

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.229 
the timing sometimes we're going to
explain<00:02:25.200> things<00:02:25.560> that<00:02:25.739> go<00:02:26.040> wrong<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:27.000> things

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
explain things that go wrong the things

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.550 
explain things that go wrong the things
that<00:02:27.390> can<00:02:27.480> go<00:02:27.540> wrong<00:02:27.810> with<00:02:28.049> the<00:02:28.170> varial

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
that can go wrong with the varial

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.849 
that can go wrong with the varial
kickflip<00:02:28.980> are<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.940> can<00:02:30.120> pop<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.660> flick<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.650> to

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
kickflip are you can pop it flick it to

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:33.500 
kickflip are you can pop it flick it to
hard<00:02:32.190> which<00:02:32.579> is<00:02:32.609> going<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:32.970> cause<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.299> board

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
hard which is going to cause the board

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.170 
hard which is going to cause the board
to<00:02:33.600> over<00:02:34.019> rotate<00:02:34.230> or<00:02:35.100> you<00:02:35.340> cannot<00:02:35.700> flick<00:02:36.030> it

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
to over rotate or you cannot flick it

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.729 
to over rotate or you cannot flick it
hard<00:02:36.390> enough<00:02:36.510> which<00:02:37.109> will<00:02:37.260> cause<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.440> board

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
hard enough which will cause the board

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.009 
hard enough which will cause the board
to<00:02:37.799> under<00:02:38.220> rotate<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.299> then<00:02:39.450> we're<00:02:39.630> going<00:02:39.780> to

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
to under rotate and then we're going to

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.020 
to under rotate and then we're going to
go<00:02:40.170> over<00:02:40.200> putting<00:02:40.859> all<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.760> steps

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
go over putting all of the steps

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.660 
go over putting all of the steps
together<00:02:42.239> in<00:02:42.750> order<00:02:42.989> to<00:02:43.170> fully<00:02:43.560> land<00:02:44.100> and<00:02:44.400> do

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670
