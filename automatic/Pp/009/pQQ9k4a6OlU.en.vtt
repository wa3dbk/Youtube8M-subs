00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.390
 well these kids today 3 again here 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.210
 in people in itself what seems to be is not 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.670
 A guide is a training video about the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.890
 first white dlc 2 the first 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.560
 possible of the f because I already tell you that this 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.950
 image that is taken from a poster 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.160
 promotional in a game all usa no 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.289
 It does not look fake but we can not say that 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.509
 be 100% true 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.699
 is relative to the first dlc of the target 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.120
 position 2 that would be called revolution and 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.239
 As you can see it included 5 maps and a 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:38.519
 weapon like dlc also a submachine gun that 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.070
 Mary peace make peacekeeper forgiveness kiss 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:43.320
 peacekeeper little miss the soft fossil 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.000
 we will comment later and the five 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.610
 maps would be four maps for the mode 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.019
 multiplayer online as always as 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.229
 almost every dlc is that lately 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:55.979
 with the acquaintances that would be called 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:57.750
 hydro grand downhill and mirage and a 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:01.100
 fifth map that would be for mode 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.449
 zombies that way dire rise vale 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.460
 as a diagnosis is an image not 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.970
 we know more we can not take over the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.200
 information but nevertheless there is a couple 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.770
 of details that I thought was a bit 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.860
 strangers not this poster and what it looks like 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.500
 more true is the section of the map 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.939
 downhill because it's a snowy map up 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.799
 now as you know in white the two do not 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.750
 there are snowy maps it 's a bit strange that 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.299
 happens that in the future in 2025 there is no 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.820
 snow that happens then there we have 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.560
 we would have the first snowy map and how 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.430
 you can see the guy takes a fact 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:39.900
 m 81 in the hands so that's this 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:43.020
 image is the most truthful then another 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.920
 It is a light quarry but I do not know which 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.770
 I do not know how to recognize the image because they look 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.880
 very very little in large is an image that 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.410
 I 'm choosing to go whenever the 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.970
 I see why he's a guy doing skate is 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.220
 a soldier doing skateboarding or is it a 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.900
 skate park as you can see is with 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.680
 graffiti and background in a bit of everything 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.660
 it's not a little weird is this map to 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:10.970
 see to see how it is and what it is 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:13.560
 truth is that it does not make any sense and 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:18.050
 I have less sense because it is a 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:21.310
 map as vietnam not the uncle and superior 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.280
 70's style 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.590
 and with a 4 to 1 or what appears to be a 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.160
 m 14 because we go that does not seem any 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:34.360
 result this black ops 2 but good and 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.610
 I tell you the poster it seems it is 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.459
 a pint is totally true but already 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.810
 I tell you until I get information 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.599
 treyarch official because you will not know 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.400
 nothing about this and what does not know anything 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.349
 really from the peacekeeper's gun 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.530
 this submachine gun they have put there in 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.989
 the image that apparently also 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.010
 include the tlc and it's a submachine gun that I've 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.739
 tried to report on the now 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.799
 there was a prototype something like that 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:02.049
 previous not to be able to guide us a bit 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:05.110
 and not the truth is that there is no 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:09.849
 done there is a web page that peacekeeper 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:12.090
 puntocom is for armament accessories or 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.200
 it does not make much sense but good 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.930
 so good is the little information that 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.680
 we have and nothing to let them tell you 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.980
 what do you think 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.799
 and what do you think of this DLID if it is 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:27.959
 well so we just see each other the 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.959
 next video until lugo chao
