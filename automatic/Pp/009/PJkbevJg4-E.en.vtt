00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
my symbols for with the long press and

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.700 
my symbols for with the long press and
my<00:02:25.610> numbers<00:02:25.880> with<00:02:26.000> our<00:02:26.090> own<00:02:26.180> press<00:02:26.560> just<00:02:27.560> give

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
my numbers with our own press just give

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.240 
my numbers with our own press just give
it<00:02:27.800> a<00:02:27.830> quick

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:40.430 

on<00:02:31.520> my<00:02:31.670> email

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.070 

so<00:02:41.440> there's<00:02:41.620> your<00:02:41.740> on-screen<00:02:42.160> keyboard<00:02:42.610> and

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
so there's your on-screen keyboard and

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.500 
so there's your on-screen keyboard and
here's<00:02:44.080> an<00:02:44.170> example<00:02:44.410> of<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:44.710> web<00:02:44.890> app<00:02:45.040> so<00:02:45.390> one<00:02:46.390> of

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
here's an example of a web app so one of

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.360 
here's an example of a web app so one of
the<00:02:46.660> norms<00:02:47.230> that<00:02:47.320> probably<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:47.950> only<00:02:48.100> non

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
the norms that probably the only non

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.610 
the norms that probably the only non
stop<00:02:48.640> have<00:02:49.180> one<00:02:49.450> here<00:02:49.660> currently<00:02:49.960> is<00:02:50.230> Vimeo

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
stop have one here currently is Vimeo

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.460 
stop have one here currently is Vimeo
for<00:02:50.980> Tizen<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:52.300> this<00:02:52.600> is<00:02:52.720> an<00:02:52.840> example<00:02:53.110> of<00:02:53.350> an

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
for Tizen and this is an example of an

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.840 
for Tizen and this is an example of an
app<00:02:53.590> that<00:02:53.770> is<00:02:53.800> mostly<00:02:54.160> a<00:02:54.250> web<00:02:54.460> app<00:02:54.610> built

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
app that is mostly a web app built

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.080 
app that is mostly a web app built
around<00:02:55.030> html5<00:02:55.780> but<00:02:56.710> when<00:02:57.490> you<00:02:57.580> click<00:02:57.790> onto<00:02:57.970> a

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
around html5 but when you click onto a

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.440 
around html5 but when you click onto a
video<00:02:58.210> and<00:02:58.480> you<00:02:58.540> run<00:02:58.720> a<00:02:58.750> video<00:03:00.030> it'll<00:03:01.030> use<00:03:01.300> the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
video and you run a video it'll use the

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.840 
video and you run a video it'll use the
native<00:03:01.660> video<00:03:02.500> acceleration<00:03:03.040> within<00:03:03.760> the

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
native video acceleration within the

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.610 
native video acceleration within the
chip<00:03:04.090> so<00:03:04.840> that's<00:03:05.020> an<00:03:05.140> example<00:03:05.230> of<00:03:05.530> something

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
chip so that's an example of something

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.260 
chip so that's an example of something
you<00:03:05.950> know<00:03:05.980> Firefox<00:03:06.490> doesn't<00:03:06.700> do<00:03:06.880> so<00:03:07.060> much

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
you know Firefox doesn't do so much

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.880 
you know Firefox doesn't do so much
Firefox<00:03:07.780> doesn't<00:03:08.080> really<00:03:08.200> have<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.440> native

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
Firefox doesn't really have the native

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.160 
Firefox doesn't really have the native
layer<00:03:09.100> whereas<00:03:09.880> apps<00:03:10.270> built<00:03:10.570> for<00:03:10.750> ties<00:03:10.900> and

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
layer whereas apps built for ties and

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.540 
layer whereas apps built for ties and
they<00:03:11.260> can<00:03:11.410> be<00:03:11.530> more<00:03:11.710> fully<00:03:11.890> featured<00:03:12.160> and<00:03:12.490> they

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
they can be more fully featured and they

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.940 
they can be more fully featured and they
can<00:03:12.700> have<00:03:12.850> that<00:03:13.000> native<00:03:13.360> layer<00:03:13.540> I<00:03:13.870> think<00:03:14.860> I've

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
can have that native layer I think I've

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.700 
can have that native layer I think I've
got<00:03:15.070> activity<00:03:15.880> now<00:03:16.030> so<00:03:16.720> this<00:03:17.170> might<00:03:17.380> not<00:03:17.410> load

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
got activity now so this might not load

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.710 
got activity now so this might not load
up<00:03:17.890> but<00:03:18.130> there<00:03:18.760> we<00:03:18.820> go<00:03:18.940> serves<00:03:19.270> the<00:03:19.360> purpose
