00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:06.779
 thank you very much I will speak donatella role that age 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.839
 in our department 

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:11.900
 within this niche little work of this center 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.339
 multidisciplinary as already holy 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:18.140
 mentioned pizzarotti work magically determined from above 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.449
 life of operational endocrinology directed by professor pinchera 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.020
 m within this group as we have seen there are a number of 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.159
 figures insert figures and specifications that an 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:30.899
 motogp sic on TV 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.330
 they are absolutely without limits these are interested 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.859
 in a targeted manner 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:39.480
 hyundai given problem what the plastic surgeon does I did a little 

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:40.620
 so or divided 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.289
 a little bit the 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:45.580
 rt in two big groups our role 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.060
 photo approach to the obese patient and I have the situation more 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.250
 after all patient bariatric surgery someone slimming 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.900
 medications diets and so on that applies to us 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.979
 due to weight loss 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:03.489
 weight selector people but aspect that I will fly over was already widely 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.319
 Treaty emphasizes the importance even if it is a frattini directive 

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:09.480
 colette sometimes called aesthetic 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.160
 it is fundamental to emigrate to make these patients 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.350
 in the meantime, if we get there, we have achieved a balance 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.760
 pd allow. to maintain this this situation has a very unstable face 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.280
 optics the patient lost weight 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.310
 kerouc a high risk risk of falling back into obesity 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.110
 then there is also an aspect is that which arise mhh circuits - this 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.390
 communication 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.290
 in which we are called to intervene in particular so in patients who 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.780
 sound in phase where you are god 28 in the intermediate phase what they are 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.110
 fundamentally d big situations but if you type it is that they prevent you 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.790
 these patients are so unbalanced 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.190
 the polyps discus the last movements of everyday life 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.960
 the condition and movement is absolutely fundamental and must 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.130
 go hand in hand with any breast diet program this is absolutely 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.869
 yes calcium and then I will quickly mention the simple problem of parishes 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.739
 they must be treated without waiting 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.950
 therefore tanning this large fat masses that really hinder sometimes 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.499
 even the slightest movement these madmen 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:22.449
 these are our numbers I did I reported these 4 years 50 4 months leon 

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:24.770
 put them all together I put these in yellow 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.730
 few but fundamental numbers to refer to when we are looking for 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.040
 called accoto operate on patients still with large with large index of 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.580
 body mass are patients who for some reason cannot 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.970
 for what reasons I can not undertake several different cats have to lose weight in 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.000
 some of that time they have to move so they don't move 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:50.259
 we could say we could do a little bit more important though as it is 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:54.039
 updated for subaru of must be satisfied on patients a very high 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:55.950
 risk of complications therefore 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.259
 much caution 

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:01.869
 Intra-weight-loss situations have lost something large masses that do not respond 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:05.399
 no type of floor will respond sometimes there is not even fatty tissue 

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:08.399
 in here there is lymphedema torso tissue 

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:11.379
 but vascular - responds cancels 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:12.770
 resection here too 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.770
 you must be content because it repeats a surgery such as patient counts 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.649
 very high risk of complications 

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:22.829
 these large masses can reach tens and tens of kilos from the point of 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.219
 practical view during the operation uses a very correct method 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:28.439
 danzica sterilized butcher shop 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:30.889
 meanwhile they facilitate the suspension of these 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:32.010
 and candy 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.720
 large bellies but also from the point of view of the emptying for 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.130
 charity get empty 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.110
 and of the great liquidity content is this and that I love you and love you many 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.960
 complications 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.239
 but simple techniques are very simple dermolipectomies 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.200
 the discourse of peace and I mentioned them to you here are great evils that 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.500
 they require urgency here are the subcutaneous loops 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.150
 they have probably published this on 3 in a pan 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.299
 days it exposes the viscera come out 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:00.919
 another case also here 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:02.540
 huge mass 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.739
 with concierge and small so eye we can't wait for this one 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:06.529
 patient 

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:08.150
 slim down over the months 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.260
 and therefore must be treated in a situation of urgency casolimite a 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.590
 patient with psychological problems walking villas 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.389
 decubitus years prone decubitus 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:19.390
 how many here 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.190
 to have an urgent grant among the many laparocele conflicts even here 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.909
 absolutely mini mini about to increase tenfold 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:30.949
 and patient who then abracadabra thousand problems not walking fame 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.160
 could be helped 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.030
 tomorrow the speech of the porsche l for dinner will be a rehabilitation therapy 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.100
 auto san severo has a huge problem from the point of view of 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.780
 respiratory physiopathology 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.450
 these large masses are positioned and therefore large creoles 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.330
 employment problems cd titles gets 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.830
 obviously price 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.629
 something you can recover these the hernial bag weighs 3 kilos and therefore 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:56.430
 I'm at something you recover 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.820
 and something simpa vote recovery that can be recovered by bringing rise but 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.300
 with something you can hold but generally they are increases 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.130
 quite 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.300
 atrophied 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.360
 the problem of these patients is a visceral recessive mesenteric obesity 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.460
 dtt lipu lume of very considerable volume 

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:18.200
 here is cute here you find reconstruction of the wall as the clutter 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.080
 certainly not peritoneum 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.499
 here the problem is the contusion to the muscular wall 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.840
 here I usually tend to use networks of problems anchored to 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.600
 open peritoneum then com. passers-by own hand data in the abdomen 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.960
 in the center fabric, other interventions have pischer adhesions 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.930
 or parietal 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.600
 so you have to be very careful about a network of problems so still town 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.069
 these passing points under tension 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:45.599
 rebuild the wall 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:51.270
 min how to get there is born much risk of complications are still patients. 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.439
 problems with obesity sometimes even severe 

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:57.139
 these complications are we all well present 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:00.990
 a case had to remove the net for no apparent reason 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.319
 antibiogram the bad culture bad six months of evening fever 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:06.879
 removed deleted prolene problem solved 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:10.490
 very difficult because removing spirits is not really a thing 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.169
 hermes very complicated 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:14.169
 because adhesions are created 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:19.199
 now the provider local complications here is also in a big wind. I feel weight bearing 

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:20.680
 one seemed pretty quiet 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.800
 dignified nightmare flap from us to prune these results and that obese patient 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.979
 dangerous patient reset 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:31.939
 from here. seen above all if as you can see from this infinite series this 

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:33.580
 geographic designs 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.100
 I'm crazy about you same year. also other types of intervention of the intervention 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:38.059
 of born home 

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:41.449
 here must take these things very much into consideration 

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:45.469
 Very important general complications if he has not yet lost weight patient has it 

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:49.759
 everything on something also brings with it seventh trite also in the poster 

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:51.699
 reference something remains 

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:55.749
 for this reason as already mentioned a very important one 

00:06:55.749 --> 00:07:00.339
 numb evaluation only of the anesthesiologist in the storm but also of that how 

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:03.639
 left toto 'san stern who will take charge of him in the post intervention 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:06.629
 because we all go to intensive care 

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:07.969
 as prevention 

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:12.379
 as regards the exams as it was said differentiated here is marked 

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:15.560
 in red the vasari are added the yellow the cases 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.210
 where surgery is prayed for slimming 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.980
 a thing that Santini has already dined on that I consider essential that me 

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:25.960
 I apply all the topics in which interest is a simona 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.130
 multidisciplinary 

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.719
 but at the same time these patients must be evaluated 

00:07:30.719 --> 00:07:32.490
 I think categorically 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:37.389
 preoperative mind especially during all tucked together with us with great 

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:38.259
 fatigue 

00:07:38.259 --> 00:07:42.089
 and even the logistics of the garments I know, unfortunately, we can explain this costs us a lot 

00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:47.069
 it is fatigue this distance but we do surgery together and I think that 

00:07:47.069 --> 00:07:47.689
 both 

00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:51.990
 a very important point a very important road to follow in the future vi 

00:07:51.989 --> 00:07:54.229
 thank you I hope I was clean
