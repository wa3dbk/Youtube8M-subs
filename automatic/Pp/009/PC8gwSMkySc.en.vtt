00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.389 
quality all the way around it's a very
solid<00:00:59.879> build<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.660> they<00:01:01.170> use<00:01:01.320> silent<00:01:01.859> cooling

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
solid build and they use silent cooling

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.520 
solid build and they use silent cooling
as<00:01:02.579> well<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.270> see<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.570> cooler<00:01:03.989> cooling

unit right there large heatsink and

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.050 
unit right there large heatsink and
that's<00:01:07.680> not<00:01:07.799> going<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.010> produce<00:01:08.100> any<00:01:08.580> extra

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
that's not going to produce any extra

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.429 
that's not going to produce any extra
noise<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.479> that's<00:01:09.600> especially<00:01:09.810> nice<00:01:10.290> if

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
noise and that's especially nice if

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.750 
noise and that's especially nice if

option now let's talk about the the
gameplay<00:01:23.850> features<00:01:24.150> because<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.450> know<00:01:24.540> at

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
gameplay features because you know at

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.210 
gameplay features because you know at
first<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.140> looked<00:01:25.229> at<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.470> like<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.770> thought<00:01:26.040> well

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
first I looked at it like I thought well

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.410 
first I looked at it like I thought well
you<00:01:26.430> know<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:26.640> probably<00:01:26.729> not<00:01:26.939> gonna<00:01:27.060> do<00:01:27.210> too

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
you know it's probably not gonna do too

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.060 
you know it's probably not gonna do too
good<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:27.689> games<00:01:27.900> but<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.110> was<00:01:28.259> actually<00:01:28.409> quite

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
good in games but I was actually quite

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.670 
good in games but I was actually quite
surprised<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.909> beats<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.360> 8800<00:01:30.990> ultra<00:01:31.409> all

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
surprised it beats the 8800 ultra all

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.539 
surprised it beats the 8800 ultra all
the<00:01:31.920> way<00:01:32.009> around

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
the way around

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.880 
the way around

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
and that's in like CES Randy what do you

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.350 
and that's in like CES Randy what do you
think<00:01:51.689> about<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:52.049> yeah<00:01:52.729> Randy<00:01:53.729> said<00:01:53.909> yeah<00:01:54.090> so

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
think about that yeah Randy said yeah so

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.179 
think about that yeah Randy said yeah so
he<00:01:54.960> knows<00:01:55.259> everything<00:01:55.560> about<00:01:55.770> these<00:01:55.890> now<00:01:56.040> this

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
he knows everything about these now this

tour<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.890> front<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.220> card<00:02:08.429> here<00:02:08.610> we've

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
tour of the front of the card here we've

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.540 
tour of the front of the card here we've
got<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:08.910> few<00:02:09.000> connectivity<00:02:09.840> options<00:02:10.020> here<00:02:10.550> now

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
got a few connectivity options here now

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.360 
got a few connectivity options here now
the<00:02:11.610> first<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:11.970> which<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.120> DVI

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
the first of which is DVI

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.640 
the first of which is DVI
you<00:02:13.459> can<00:02:13.549> get<00:02:13.640> 2560<00:02:14.269> by<00:02:14.450> 1600<00:02:14.930> out<00:02:15.260> of<00:02:15.379> that<00:02:15.500> and

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
you can get 2560 by 1600 out of that and

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.100 
you can get 2560 by 1600 out of that and
then<00:02:15.799> we<00:02:15.890> also<00:02:16.040> have<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.370> VGA<00:02:16.670> over<00:02:17.000> here<00:02:17.180> you

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
then we also have the VGA over here you

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.869 
then we also have the VGA over here you
can<00:02:18.260> always<00:02:18.560> get<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.129> little<00:02:19.310> converter<00:02:19.670> if<00:02:19.790> you

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 
can always get a little converter if you

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.490 
can always get a little converter if you
want<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.060> run<00:02:20.150> dual<00:02:20.420> VGA<00:02:20.840> monitors<00:02:21.379> and

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
want to run dual VGA monitors and

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.309 
want to run dual VGA monitors and
convert<00:02:21.769> the<00:02:21.860> DVI<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.549> VGA<00:02:23.330> also<00:02:24.080> we<00:02:24.200> have

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
convert the DVI to VGA also we have

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.899 
convert the DVI to VGA also we have
s-video<00:02:24.769> as<00:02:25.040> well<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.370> it<00:02:25.430> comes<00:02:25.580> with<00:02:25.700> an

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:25.909 
s-video as well and it comes with an

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:27.970 
s-video as well and it comes with an
s-video<00:02:26.269> cable<00:02:26.780> in<00:02:26.959> the<00:02:27.140> box<00:02:27.349> you<00:02:27.530> can<00:02:27.620> plug<00:02:27.860> it

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
s-video cable in the box you can plug it

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.580 
s-video cable in the box you can plug it
up<00:02:28.069> to<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.280> monitor<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:28.879> they<00:02:29.810> even<00:02:29.959> advertises

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
up to a monitor and they even advertises

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.800 
up to a monitor and they even advertises
it<00:02:30.709> it<00:02:30.829> is<00:02:30.980> capable<00:02:31.220> of<00:02:31.549> viewing<00:02:32.239> resolutions

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
it it is capable of viewing resolutions

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.039 
it it is capable of viewing resolutions
on<00:02:33.319> your<00:02:33.560> monitor<00:02:33.970> HDTV<00:02:34.970> resolutions<00:02:35.629> so

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
on your monitor HDTV resolutions so

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.240 
on your monitor HDTV resolutions so
you'll<00:02:36.409> be<00:02:36.500> able<00:02:36.560> to<00:02:36.709> get<00:02:36.799> some<00:02:36.950> really<00:02:37.069> high

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
you'll be able to get some really high

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.190 
you'll be able to get some really high
quality<00:02:37.310> with<00:02:37.760> that<00:02:37.879> as<00:02:38.000> well<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.329> even<00:02:38.569> think

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
quality with that as well and even think

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.380 
quality with that as well and even think

of<00:02:55.010> application<00:02:55.579> for<00:02:55.790> it<00:02:55.879> I<00:02:55.940> can<00:02:56.120> even<00:02:56.239> see

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
of application for it I can even see

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.849 
of application for it I can even see
some<00:02:56.660> gamers<00:02:56.930> picking<00:02:57.290> these<00:02:57.379> up<00:02:57.440> for<00:02:57.769> the

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
some gamers picking these up for the

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.220 
some gamers picking these up for the
little<00:02:58.069> micro<00:02:58.459> ATX<00:02:58.609> boxes<00:02:59.359> and<00:02:59.510> they're<00:02:59.629> you

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
little micro ATX boxes and they're you

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.690 
little micro ATX boxes and they're you
know<00:03:00.290> they're<00:03:00.379> they're<00:03:01.040> slots<00:03:01.310> that<00:03:01.459> they

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
know they're they're slots that they

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
know they're they're slots that they
need<00:03:01.849> AGP<00:03:02.420> and<00:03:02.599> you<00:03:02.900> need<00:03:03.079> the<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.950> small

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
need AGP and you need the the small

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.569 
need AGP and you need the the small
low-profile<00:03:05.720> form<00:03:06.109> factor<00:03:06.530> so<00:03:07.069> this<00:03:07.400> is<00:03:07.549> a

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
low-profile form factor so this is a

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.149 
low-profile form factor so this is a
