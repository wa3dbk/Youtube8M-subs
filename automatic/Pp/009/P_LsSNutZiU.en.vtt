alright<00:00:00.659> so<00:00:00.870> if<00:00:00.960> they're<00:00:01.110> making<00:00:01.260> sure<00:00:01.560> our

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
alright so if they're making sure our

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.679 
alright so if they're making sure our
timing<00:00:02.190> mark<00:00:02.429> on<00:00:02.580> the<00:00:02.730> camshaft<00:00:03.149> probably

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
timing mark on the camshaft probably

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.470 
timing mark on the camshaft probably
hasn't<00:00:03.810> moved<00:00:04.049> we<00:00:04.859> can<00:00:05.069> now<00:00:05.250> pull<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.000> pen<00:00:06.330> on

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
hasn't moved we can now pull the pen on

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:18.279 
hasn't moved we can now pull the pen on
this<00:00:06.629> grenade<00:00:07.849> or<00:00:08.849> this<00:00:09.150> tensioner<00:00:13.250> that<00:00:15.379> then

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
this grenade or this tensioner that then

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.480 
this grenade or this tensioner that then
you<00:00:19.289> can<00:00:19.470> already<00:00:19.680> feel<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:21.890> but<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.070> books<00:00:23.279> is

feel making sure that this is fully

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.569 
feel making sure that this is fully
engaged<00:00:42.559> alright<00:00:43.559> next<00:00:43.829> we<00:00:44.129> tighten<00:00:44.489> these

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
engaged alright next we tighten these

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.400 
engaged alright next we tighten these
bolts<00:00:44.820> now<00:00:45.120> with<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.539> camshaft<00:00:45.750> holding<00:00:46.289> on

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
bolts now with the camshaft holding on

00:00:46.410 --> 00:01:09.649 
bolts now with the camshaft holding on
to<00:00:47.329> 240<00:00:48.329> one<00:00:48.510> foot<00:00:48.780> per<00:00:48.809> pound

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.170 

next<00:01:10.659> to<00:01:10.750> get<00:01:10.900> the<00:01:11.170> camshaft<00:01:12.070> holder<00:01:12.430> off<00:01:12.610> and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
next to get the camshaft holder off and

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.290 
next to get the camshaft holder off and
we<00:01:13.600> put<00:01:13.840> our<00:01:14.220> 24<00:01:15.220> millimeter<00:01:15.580> tool<00:01:15.910> pointing

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
we put our 24 millimeter tool pointing

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.999 
we put our 24 millimeter tool pointing
the<00:01:16.450> socket<00:01:16.869> on<00:01:16.990> the<00:01:17.110> can't<00:01:17.320> crank<00:01:17.530> shape<00:01:17.740> and

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
the socket on the can't crank shape and

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.430 
the socket on the can't crank shape and
start<00:01:18.190> turning<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:18.700> engine<00:01:18.820> clockwise<00:01:19.440> you

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
start turning the engine clockwise you

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.620 
start turning the engine clockwise you
want<00:01:20.619> to<00:01:20.710> turn<00:01:20.979> it<00:01:21.190> turn<00:01:21.729> the<00:01:21.759> crankshaft<00:01:22.210> to

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
want to turn it turn the crankshaft to

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.109 
want to turn it turn the crankshaft to
full<00:01:22.869> rotations<00:01:23.470> and<00:01:23.740> then<00:01:24.640> check<00:01:24.940> your

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
full rotations and then check your

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.820 
full rotations and then check your
timing<00:01:25.509> on<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.720> crankshaft<00:01:26.020> and<00:01:26.380> also<00:01:26.650> see

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
timing on the crankshaft and also see

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.249 
timing on the crankshaft and also see
that<00:01:26.979> the<00:01:27.250> camshaft<00:01:27.820> holder<00:01:28.479> fits<00:01:28.900> back<00:01:29.080> on

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
that the camshaft holder fits back on

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.370 
that the camshaft holder fits back on
there<00:01:29.409> properly<00:01:30.390> all<00:01:31.390> right<00:01:31.570> so<00:01:31.780> I<00:01:31.840> rotate<00:01:32.170> the

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
there properly all right so I rotate the

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.070 
there properly all right so I rotate the
engine<00:01:32.530> and<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.640> camshaft<00:01:34.210> holder<00:01:34.660> fits<00:01:34.840> on

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
engine and the camshaft holder fits on

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.800 
engine and the camshaft holder fits on
there<00:01:35.259> perfectly<00:01:35.710> and<00:01:35.950> our<00:01:36.070> time<00:01:36.630> timing<00:01:37.630> mark

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
there perfectly and our time timing mark

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.600 
there perfectly and our time timing mark
on<00:01:37.960> the<00:01:38.080> crankshaft<00:01:38.350> pulley<00:01:38.619> also<00:01:39.009> lined<00:01:39.430> up

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
on the crankshaft pulley also lined up

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.440 
on the crankshaft pulley also lined up
just<00:01:39.850> about<00:01:40.450> right<00:01:40.660> so<00:01:41.759> yeah<00:01:42.759> I<00:01:43.000> think<00:01:43.149> that

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
just about right so yeah I think that

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.540 
just about right so yeah I think that
should<00:01:43.600> do<00:01:43.750> it<00:01:43.869> now<00:01:44.080> we<00:01:44.140> just<00:01:44.350> basically<00:01:44.560> put

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
should do it now we just basically put

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.609 
should do it now we just basically put
everything<00:01:45.580> back<00:01:46.000> together<00:01:46.259> I'm<00:01:47.259> going<00:01:47.530> to

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
everything back together I'm going to

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:48.660 
everything back together I'm going to
show<00:01:47.740> you<00:01:47.800> that<00:01:48.009> because<00:01:48.190> it's<00:01:48.340> basically

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
show you that because it's basically

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.889 
show you that because it's basically
just<00:01:48.759> reversal<00:01:49.300> of<00:01:49.420> removal<00:01:50.140> and<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:52.149> think

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
just reversal of removal and I think

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.169 
just reversal of removal and I think
that<00:01:52.990> should<00:01:53.080> all<00:01:53.229> cover<00:01:53.530> it<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:53.920> just<00:01:54.700> so

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
that should all cover it and just so

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:56.730 
that should all cover it and just so
yeah<00:01:55.330> make<00:01:55.509> sure<00:01:55.539> you<00:01:55.720> put<00:01:56.050> the<00:01:56.259> coolant<00:01:56.619> back

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
yeah make sure you put the coolant back

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.070 
yeah make sure you put the coolant back
in<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:57.009> car<00:01:57.190> I'll<00:01:58.090> actually<00:01:58.300> already<00:01:58.780> dead<00:01:58.960> to

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
in the car I'll actually already dead to

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.290 
in the car I'll actually already dead to
check<00:01:59.259> for<00:01:59.440> leaks<00:01:59.590> and<00:01:59.910> just<00:02:00.910> make<00:02:01.060> sure<00:02:01.179> you

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
check for leaks and just make sure you

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.179 
check for leaks and just make sure you
keep<00:02:01.479> adding<00:02:01.840> coolant<00:02:02.560> to<00:02:02.649> it<00:02:02.740> and<00:02:02.920> you<00:02:02.979> bleed

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
keep adding coolant to it and you bleed

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.039 
keep adding coolant to it and you bleed
the<00:02:03.310> system<00:02:03.460> you<00:02:03.939> open<00:02:04.240> your<00:02:04.590> your<00:02:05.590> heater<00:02:05.829> and

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
the system you open your your heater and

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.630 
the system you open your your heater and
all<00:02:08.049> the<00:02:08.200> car<00:02:08.500> is<00:02:08.619> warming<00:02:08.950> up<00:02:09.100> it's<00:02:09.399> going<00:02:09.579> to

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
all the car is warming up it's going to

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.240 
all the car is warming up it's going to
burp<00:02:09.850> and<00:02:10.320> make<00:02:11.320> sure<00:02:11.470> if<00:02:11.620> you<00:02:11.709> can<00:02:11.950> keep<00:02:12.190> your

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
burp and make sure if you can keep your

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.860 
burp and make sure if you can keep your
coolant<00:02:12.670> reservoir<00:02:12.730> at<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.150> high<00:02:13.450> higher

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
coolant reservoir at the high higher

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.630 
coolant reservoir at the high higher
than<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.320> rest<00:02:14.470> of<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.650> car<00:02:14.829> all<00:02:15.280> right<00:02:15.430> rest

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
than the rest of the car all right rest

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.699 
than the rest of the car all right rest
of<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.850> engine<00:02:16.150> so<00:02:16.930> that<00:02:16.959> way<00:02:17.170> it<00:02:17.290> works<00:02:17.470> as<00:02:17.680> a

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
of the engine so that way it works as a

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.630 
of the engine so that way it works as a
easier<00:02:18.579> to<00:02:18.820> believe<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.090> system<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:20.380> then

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
easier to believe the system and then

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.949 
easier to believe the system and then
yeah<00:02:21.640> that<00:02:21.790> should<00:02:22.000> do<00:02:22.120> it<00:02:22.269> you<00:02:22.540> know<00:02:22.660> actually

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
yeah that should do it you know actually

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.900 
yeah that should do it you know actually
it's<00:02:23.049> a<00:02:23.079> good<00:02:23.230> idea<00:02:23.320> to<00:02:23.519> once<00:02:24.519> you<00:02:24.640> put<00:02:24.790> the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
it's a good idea to once you put the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.460 
it's a good idea to once you put the
covers<00:02:25.239> the<00:02:25.390> lower<00:02:25.480> covers<00:02:25.870> back<00:02:26.049> on<00:02:26.230> and

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
covers the lower covers back on and

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.620 
covers the lower covers back on and
stuff<00:02:26.709> go<00:02:26.980> ahead<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:27.280> start<00:02:27.519> your<00:02:27.610> car<00:02:27.910> make

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
stuff go ahead and start your car make

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.720 
stuff go ahead and start your car make
sure<00:02:28.660> nothing<00:02:29.110> is<00:02:29.260> going<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.530> catch<00:02:30.010> no<00:02:30.340> cables

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
sure nothing is going to catch no cables

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.360 
sure nothing is going to catch no cables
or<00:02:30.850> vacuum<00:02:31.180> lines<00:02:31.390> are<00:02:31.540> in<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.660> way<00:02:31.870> and<00:02:32.370> you

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
or vacuum lines are in the way and you

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.660 
or vacuum lines are in the way and you
know<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.519> don't<00:02:33.640> have<00:02:33.730> to<00:02:33.880> hook<00:02:33.970> up<00:02:34.090> that<00:02:34.299> the

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
know you don't have to hook up that the

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.800 
know you don't have to hook up that the
drive<00:02:36.670> shaft<00:02:36.880> for<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.090> alternator<00:02:37.510> you<00:02:37.690> can

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
drive shaft for the alternator you can

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.050 
drive shaft for the alternator you can
just<00:02:37.989> start<00:02:38.470> your<00:02:38.590> car<00:02:38.829> see<00:02:39.730> how<00:02:39.850> it<00:02:39.940> runs

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
just start your car see how it runs

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.979 
just start your car see how it runs
you're<00:02:40.269> going<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.450> get<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.570> check<00:02:40.720> engine<00:02:40.870> light

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
you're going to get a check engine light

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.830 
you're going to get a check engine light
for<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.320> alternator<00:02:41.769> and<00:02:42.040> stuff<00:02:42.489> but<00:02:42.760> uh<00:02:42.840> you

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
for the alternator and stuff but uh you

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.030 
for the alternator and stuff but uh you
know<00:02:43.930> if<00:02:44.019> you<00:02:44.049> can<00:02:44.230> keep<00:02:44.380> it<00:02:44.500> running<00:02:44.769> for<00:02:44.950> at

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
know if you can keep it running for at

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.830 
know if you can keep it running for at
least<00:02:45.130> 30<00:02:45.370> seconds<00:02:45.820> or<00:02:45.940> so<00:02:46.120> you<00:02:46.150> if<00:02:46.570> you<00:02:46.720> have

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
least 30 seconds or so you if you have

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.539 
least 30 seconds or so you if you have
if<00:02:47.350> you<00:02:47.440> have<00:02:47.560> timing<00:02:47.950> wrong<00:02:48.100> you're<00:02:48.340> going<00:02:48.459> to

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
if you have timing wrong you're going to

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:49.830 
if you have timing wrong you're going to
get<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.670> check<00:02:48.820> engine<00:02:48.970> light<00:02:49.090> for<00:02:49.329> a<00:02:49.360> camshaft

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
get a check engine light for a camshaft

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.870 
get a check engine light for a camshaft
sensor<00:02:49.989> of<00:02:50.320> some<00:02:50.500> sort<00:02:50.739> or<00:02:51.519> you<00:02:51.820> know

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
sensor of some sort or you know

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.910 
sensor of some sort or you know
something<00:02:52.239> something<00:02:52.390> along<00:02:52.720> those<00:02:52.840> lines<00:02:53.079> so

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
something something along those lines so

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.250 
something something along those lines so
that<00:02:54.070> way<00:02:54.190> you<00:02:54.250> have<00:02:54.700> to<00:02:54.930> put<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:55.989> whole<00:02:56.109> thing

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
that way you have to put the whole thing

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.420 
that way you have to put the whole thing
back<00:02:56.380> together<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:56.859> then<00:02:57.010> take<00:02:57.160> it<00:02:57.190> out

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
back together and then take it out

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.560 
back together and then take it out
through<00:02:57.609> the<00:02:57.730> timing<00:02:58.060> again<00:02:58.239> if<00:02:58.359> you<00:02:58.450> did

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
through the timing again if you did

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.009 
through the timing again if you did
something<00:02:58.780> wrong<00:02:58.920> all<00:02:59.920> right<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:00.400> uh<00:03:01.019> yeah

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
something wrong all right and uh yeah

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.270 
something wrong all right and uh yeah
you<00:03:02.350> know<00:03:02.440> if<00:03:02.500> you<00:03:02.620> really<00:03:03.070> want<00:03:03.220> to

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
you know if you really want to

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.910 
you know if you really want to
double-check<00:03:03.519> make<00:03:03.880> sure<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:05.560> don't<00:03:05.769> do<00:03:05.829> the

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
double-check make sure you don't do the

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.380 
double-check make sure you don't do the
timing<00:03:06.220> wrong<00:03:06.400> go<00:03:06.820> ahead<00:03:06.970> and<00:03:07.120> crankshaft

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
timing wrong go ahead and crankshaft

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.500 
timing wrong go ahead and crankshaft
drank<00:03:07.989> the<00:03:08.220> turn<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.370> crankshaft<00:03:09.849> multiple

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
drank the turn the crankshaft multiple

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.330 
drank the turn the crankshaft multiple
times<00:03:10.690> make<00:03:10.900> sure<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.140> thing<00:03:11.319> is<00:03:11.470> binding<00:03:11.920> or

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
times make sure the thing is binding or
