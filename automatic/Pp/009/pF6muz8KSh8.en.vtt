yeah mamacitas a few details that could

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.060 
yeah mamacitas a few details that could
can<00:00:13.720> always<00:00:13.960> get<00:00:14.110> better<00:00:14.230> but<00:00:14.560> upping<00:00:14.800> for<00:00:15.040> a

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.070 
can always get better but upping for a

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.590 
can always get better but upping for a
first<00:00:15.340> match<00:00:15.550> you<00:00:16.180> know<00:00:16.270> it's<00:00:16.360> been<00:00:16.480> a<00:00:16.510> while

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:16.600 
first match you know it's been a while

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.269 
first match you know it's been a while
from<00:00:16.900> you<00:00:17.080> as<00:00:17.140> well<00:00:17.200> since<00:00:17.470> Luxor<00:00:17.860> works<00:00:18.040> or

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279 
from you as well since Luxor works or

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:20.190 
from you as well since Luxor works or
was<00:00:18.490> a<00:00:18.520> just<00:00:19.300> a<00:00:19.390> nice<00:00:19.540> feeling<00:00:19.810> to<00:00:19.930> be<00:00:20.020> out

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:20.200 
was a just a nice feeling to be out

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.540 
was a just a nice feeling to be out
there<00:00:20.230> again<00:00:20.650> and<00:00:21.100> I<00:00:21.160> felt<00:00:21.400> like<00:00:21.490> my

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
there again and I felt like my

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.640 
there again and I felt like my
groundstrokes<00:00:22.000> were<00:00:22.450> going<00:00:22.779> good<00:00:22.990> I<00:00:23.230> felt

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
groundstrokes were going good I felt

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.109 
groundstrokes were going good I felt
like<00:00:23.710> I<00:00:23.860> was<00:00:23.980> really<00:00:24.190> standing<00:00:24.670> on<00:00:24.760> top<00:00:24.880> of<00:00:24.939> my

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
like I was really standing on top of my

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:26.700 
like I was really standing on top of my
baseline<00:00:25.570> and<00:00:25.779> and<00:00:25.990> you<00:00:26.590> know<00:00:26.620> really

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
baseline and and you know really

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.940 
baseline and and you know really
changing<00:00:27.580> up<00:00:27.700> the<00:00:28.360> direction<00:00:28.690> of<00:00:28.870> the<00:00:29.650> rallies

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:29.950 
changing up the direction of the rallies

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.750 
changing up the direction of the rallies
and<00:00:30.130> I<00:00:30.340> think<00:00:30.760> that<00:00:30.850> was<00:00:30.970> a<00:00:31.000> good<00:00:31.060> feeling<00:00:32.760> the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
and I think that was a good feeling the

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.170 
and I think that was a good feeling the
smashes<00:00:34.239> could<00:00:34.480> have<00:00:34.570> been<00:00:34.720> a<00:00:34.750> little<00:00:34.840> done

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
smashes could have been a little done

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.390 
smashes could have been a little done
but<00:00:37.180> you<00:00:37.660> know<00:00:38.050> it's<00:00:38.199> a<00:00:38.440> I<00:00:38.680> think<00:00:39.040> it's<00:00:39.160> really

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
but you know it's a I think it's really

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.920 
but you know it's a I think it's really
good<00:00:39.580> I<00:00:39.730> mean<00:00:39.940> I'm<00:00:40.030> really<00:00:40.480> happy<00:00:40.600> that<00:00:40.809> I'm

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
good I mean I'm really happy that I'm

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.770 
good I mean I'm really happy that I'm
here<00:00:41.080> because<00:00:41.320> it<00:00:42.159> really<00:00:42.400> makes<00:00:43.180> the<00:00:43.330> transit

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
here because it really makes the transit

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.509 
here because it really makes the transit
transition<00:00:44.470> I<00:00:44.559> think<00:00:44.769> to<00:00:44.920> Melbourne<00:00:45.309> a<00:00:45.339> little

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
transition I think to Melbourne a little

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:47.280 
transition I think to Melbourne a little
bit<00:00:45.610> easier<00:00:45.699> at<00:00:46.330> least<00:00:46.540> now<00:00:46.690> we<00:00:46.750> have<00:00:46.870> the<00:00:47.050> roof

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
bit easier at least now we have the roof

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.740 
bit easier at least now we have the roof
a<00:00:47.530> little<00:00:47.739> bit<00:00:47.890> and<00:00:48.159> you<00:00:48.580> get<00:00:48.729> a<00:00:48.760> feel<00:00:49.360> for<00:00:49.629> the

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
a little bit and you get a feel for the

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.840 
a little bit and you get a feel for the
humidity<00:00:50.320> and<00:00:50.559> you<00:00:50.860> don't<00:00:51.070> always<00:00:51.280> autumn

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
humidity and you don't always autumn

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.930 
humidity and you don't always autumn
come<00:00:52.089> from<00:00:52.360> you<00:00:52.629> know<00:00:52.750> you<00:00:53.050> know<00:00:53.170> to<00:00:53.949> to

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
come from you know you know to to

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.640 
come from you know you know to to
extreme<00:00:55.360> heat<00:00:55.390> and<00:00:55.720> I<00:00:55.930> think<00:00:56.140> this<00:00:56.229> is<00:00:56.409> an

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
extreme heat and I think this is an

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.939 
extreme heat and I think this is an
that's<00:00:57.339> a<00:00:57.519> very<00:00:58.150> happy<00:00:58.300> that<00:00:58.540> I<00:00:58.570> chose<00:00:59.470> to<00:00:59.800> her

that's a very happy that I chose to her

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.380 
that's a very happy that I chose to her
to<00:01:00.159> be<00:01:00.309> here<00:01:00.479> yeah<00:01:01.479> and<00:01:01.839> the<00:01:02.290> usual<00:01:03.390> there's

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
you know nothing to it it's not that I'm

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.179 
times before her mats or anything I'm
not<00:01:11.380> just<00:01:11.770> very<00:01:12.420> yeah<00:01:13.420> looking<00:01:14.140> forward<00:01:14.350> to<00:01:14.590> to

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
not just very yeah looking forward to to

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:16.649 
not just very yeah looking forward to to
being<00:01:15.430> out<00:01:15.549> there<00:01:15.700> motivated<00:01:16.299> I'm<00:01:16.420> saying

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
being out there motivated I'm saying

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.959 
being out there motivated I'm saying
you're<00:01:17.469> not<00:01:17.560> worked<00:01:17.860> hard<00:01:18.100> on<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.430> offseason

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:18.969 
you're not worked hard on the offseason

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:21.840 
you're not worked hard on the offseason
and<00:01:19.119> had<00:01:19.299> some<00:01:19.539> you<00:01:19.990> know<00:01:20.020> tough<00:01:20.950> doing<00:01:21.729> a

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
and had some you know tough doing a

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.670 
and had some you know tough doing a
workout<00:01:22.180> sessions<00:01:22.659> and<00:01:22.869> I<00:01:23.289> think<00:01:23.500> that's

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
workout sessions and I think that's

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.560 
workout sessions and I think that's
obviously<00:01:24.520> a<00:01:24.579> match<00:01:24.850> is<00:01:25.090> different<00:01:25.450> because

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
obviously a match is different because

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.300 
obviously a match is different because
you<00:01:25.780> have<00:01:25.869> the<00:01:25.990> mental<00:01:26.289> aspect<00:01:26.710> that<00:01:26.829> that

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
you have the mental aspect that that

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.789 
you have the mental aspect that that
gets<00:01:27.640> added<00:01:27.939> to<00:01:28.210> in<00:01:28.479> which<00:01:29.140> can<00:01:29.350> definitely

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
gets added to in which can definitely

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.069 
gets added to in which can definitely
cause<00:01:29.950> for<00:01:29.979> your<00:01:30.880> body<00:01:31.060> to<00:01:31.359> react<00:01:31.659> differently

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
cause for your body to react differently

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.899 
cause for your body to react differently
than<00:01:32.590> when<00:01:32.740> you're<00:01:32.890> just<00:01:33.070> working<00:01:33.250> on<00:01:33.490> normal

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
than when you're just working on normal

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.170 
than when you're just working on normal
but<00:01:34.649> physically<00:01:35.649> wise<00:01:35.890> you<00:01:36.430> know<00:01:36.490> this<00:01:36.880> is<00:01:37.060> not

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
but physically wise you know this is not

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.870 
but physically wise you know this is not
a<00:01:37.240> match<00:01:37.479> that<00:01:37.689> it's<00:01:37.899> going<00:01:38.049> to<00:01:38.429> make<00:01:39.429> me<00:01:39.490> wake

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
a match that it's going to make me wake

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.810 
a match that it's going to make me wake
up<00:01:40.060> sore<00:01:40.329> too<00:01:40.570> long<00:01:40.780> today<00:01:41.020> yeah<00:01:41.890> I'm<00:01:42.070> really
