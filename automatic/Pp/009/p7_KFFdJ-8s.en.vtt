not<00:01:51.410> really<00:01:51.679> as<00:01:51.770> cool<00:01:52.009> as<00:01:52.070> I<00:01:52.160> thought<00:01:52.190> it<00:01:52.460> would

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
not really as cool as I thought it would

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.790 
not really as cool as I thought it would
be<00:01:52.670> I<00:01:52.850> like<00:01:53.179> slicing<00:01:53.600> people<00:01:53.869> up<00:01:54.020> I<00:01:54.229> think<00:01:54.710> the

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
be I like slicing people up I think the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.100 
be I like slicing people up I think the
new<00:01:54.950> moves<00:01:55.220> though<00:01:55.460> like<00:01:55.729> sliding<00:01:56.119> slashing

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
new moves though like sliding slashing

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.260 
new moves though like sliding slashing
down<00:01:57.289> and<00:01:57.619> so<00:01:57.800> on<00:01:58.009> really<00:01:58.640> helped<00:01:58.850> become

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
down and so on really helped become

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.870 
down and so on really helped become
strider<00:01:59.600> make<00:02:00.229> strada<00:02:00.560> faster<00:02:01.190> stronger<00:02:01.729> and

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
strider make strada faster stronger and

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.490 
strider make strada faster stronger and
better<00:02:02.300> and<00:02:02.630> none<00:02:02.810> of<00:02:02.840> them<00:02:03.050> feel<00:02:03.319> like<00:02:03.440> a

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
better and none of them feel like a

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.169 
better and none of them feel like a
