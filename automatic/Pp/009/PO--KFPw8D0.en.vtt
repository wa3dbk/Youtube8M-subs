00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.980
 hello pure champion friends as they are 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:29.870
 Juan Carlos Grau and we are here in my 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:32.930
 I come home from the gym to work 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:35.390
 and well I've already had two meals like 10 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.700
 in the morning right now we are going to make a 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.190
 third meal and we 're going to go to 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.900
 gym to train 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.820
 and well I want to take this capsule 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:50.800
 to tell you a little bit about what is it 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:56.900
 he took before doing cardio on an empty stomach 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:59.390
 to burn more fat yes then what 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.000
 I use are three supplements that go 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:06.340
 focused on burning more fat 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.840
 the first one is l-carnitine 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.840
 what is an amino acid 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:17.180
 what occurs naturally in the body 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:20.800
 in what will help us good is going to 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:24.590
 help them to be more in which is greater 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.370
 the transportation of fats to 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:31.430
 cells to be used as energy 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:33.530
 then the biggest one is the carnitine 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.050
 older we will transport fat or by 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:40.460
 greater ease to be used as 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:43.400
 energy comes out between the l-carnitine I 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.600
 I recommend a minimum of 500 milligrams or 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.770
 1,000 grams 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:52.550
 before the change and it can be three 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:55.160
 times a day if I take it before the 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.490
 cardio thousand milligrams that are two 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:01.340
 pure champion vitamin capsules and 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:07.420
 with my dinner on the night when we are going to 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:11.620
 help be good the celia is going to be 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:17.069
 that our metabolism accelerates if it goes 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:20.319
 to block the fat from leaving and 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:24.790
 deposit in 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:27.879
 in the adipose tissue if they go 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:33.819
 block it to be saved as 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:36.260
 adipose tissue and it will also be that 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:42.879
 that burn more 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.879
 what's left cellular burn more energy 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.690
 in the mitochondria then it goes block 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.080
 is going to burn more 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:56.320
 also to reduce the appetite we will 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:03:00.400
 remove hunger or that sometimes they give us 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.730
 attacks like anxiety and want to eat 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.980
 well we will also help in this 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.489
 I mean read it 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.840
 and good is going to tone the body 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:15.129
 this obviously coupled with a diet 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.409
 hypocaloric and exercise not nothing 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:19.690
 more we are going to take the supplements and 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:22.660
 we are going to put a cap on all that is 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.870
 very important the cereal to burn more 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:30.360
 energy and to block it from being saved 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.360
 more I have saved the l-carnitine 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:38.150
 and finally the lie burn 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.020
 this supplement is already a burner 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.480
 grease 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.760
 for example the zelai the good carnitine 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.580
 because they are still foods are not 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.280
 supplements that are extracted from the 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:55.020
 food and good 7 are amino acids and 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:57.890
 thank you allow to try it is already a 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:02.470
 and this 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:06.340
 a thermogenic fat burner 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:10.849
 and who has caffeine 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:14.329
 and some herbs that accelerate the 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.710
 heart rate then this is going to 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:19.070
 be 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.660
 burn more calories because the 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.050
 heart will be eating more blood 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:28.970
 if it does affect the nervous system 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:31.310
 central accelerating it then good already 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.130
 they know in the heart rate also 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:37.880
 It is very important to know where you are in 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:41.060
 cardio I always recommend 65% 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:45.200
 they are over burn calories from 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:48.380
 fat and less protein if more or less 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.170
 60 percent of the calories that are 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:55.880
 they're going to burn they 're going to be fat 30 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:58.130
 percent of carbohydrates and 10% 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.160
 of proteins then I forgot 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:04.820
 mention of celia took 4 grams a day 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:07.490
 and two grams before cardio with a 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:11.630
 gram of l carnitine 2 grams of celia 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:16.990
 It can be 12 depends on the weight or type 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:20.210
 of person its capacity its intensity 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.300
 good then and 2 grams at night 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.220
 with dinner 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:28.010
 a gram of the entity today the woman 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:32.330
 the burner of zanetti with this command 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:36.139
 took a pill before the change 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:38.360
 at most 2 a day and one shot at the 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:41.000
 another let go of 4 to 6 hours 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.949
 yes for my taste and my recommendation and not 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.710
 after 3 o'clock in the afternoon he leaves because 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:48.319
