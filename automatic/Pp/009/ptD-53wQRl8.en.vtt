00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
I kind of incorporated some of the

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.210 
I kind of incorporated some of the
techniques<00:00:27.090> from<00:00:27.359> there<00:00:27.599> into<00:00:28.080> my<00:00:28.109> own<00:00:28.410> start

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
techniques from there into my own start

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.010 
techniques from there into my own start
by<00:00:29.429> preheating<00:00:29.730> your<00:00:30.179> pan<00:00:30.449> on<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.810> stovetop

by preheating your pan on the stovetop
I'm<00:00:34.020> using<00:00:34.350> whole<00:00:34.739> wheat<00:00:34.800> flour<00:00:35.250> here<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.780> can

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
I'm using whole wheat flour here you can

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.139 
I'm using whole wheat flour here you can
also<00:00:37.170> use<00:00:37.559> whole<00:00:38.010> wheat<00:00:38.070> pastry<00:00:38.610> flour<00:00:38.670> if<00:00:39.030> you

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
also use whole wheat pastry flour if you

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.350 
also use whole wheat pastry flour if you
like<00:00:39.329> or<00:00:40.079> spelt<00:00:40.590> flour<00:00:40.680> works<00:00:41.280> great<00:00:41.670> kamut

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
like or spelt flour works great kamut

flour<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.989> another<00:00:43.260> option<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:44.010> some<00:00:44.399> videos

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
flour is another option in some videos

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.450 
flour is another option in some videos
they<00:00:44.940> say<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.239> sift<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.750> flour<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.440> don't<00:00:47.250> think

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
they say to sift the flour I don't think

00:00:47.460 --> 00:01:20.500 
they say to sift the flour I don't think
it's<00:00:47.579> necessary<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.420> just<00:00:48.719> skip<00:00:48.960> that

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.830 

I<00:01:20.570> use<00:01:21.320> a<00:01:21.350> knife<00:01:21.680> to<00:01:21.710> mix<00:01:22.160> the<00:01:22.340> water<00:01:22.580> in<00:01:22.850> I<00:01:23.060> just

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
I use a knife to mix the water in I just

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.480 
I use a knife to mix the water in I just
like<00:01:24.050> that<00:01:24.290> because<00:01:24.590> I<00:01:24.680> can<00:01:24.860> kind<00:01:25.100> of<00:01:25.160> scrape

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
like that because I can kind of scrape

00:01:25.490 --> 00:02:18.160 
like that because I can kind of scrape
the<00:01:25.670> sides<00:01:25.910> as<00:01:26.150> I'm<00:01:26.270> mixing

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.930 

most<00:02:19.170> recipes<00:02:19.709> say<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.010> set<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.550> dough<00:02:20.760> aside

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
most recipes say to set the dough aside

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.600 
most recipes say to set the dough aside
for<00:02:21.209> 15<00:02:22.020> minutes<00:02:22.319> even<00:02:22.590> up<00:02:22.709> to<00:02:22.890> an<00:02:23.010> hour<00:02:23.190> I

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
for 15 minutes even up to an hour I

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.940 
for 15 minutes even up to an hour I
really<00:02:24.599> don't<00:02:24.780> think<00:02:24.870> that's<00:02:25.170> necessary<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:25.739> I

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
really don't think that's necessary so I

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.770 
really don't think that's necessary so I
skip<00:02:26.370> that<00:02:26.550> all<00:02:26.790> together<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:27.480> just<00:02:27.599> go

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
skip that all together and just go

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.170 
skip that all together and just go
straight<00:02:27.810> into<00:02:28.370> rolling<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.580> out<00:02:29.700> in<00:02:29.910> and

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
straight into rolling it out in and

00:02:30.180 --> 00:03:09.559 
straight into rolling it out in and
cutting<00:02:30.660> it<00:02:30.780> into<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.200> pieces

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.259 

one<00:03:10.290> tip<00:03:10.530> I<00:03:10.769> learn<00:03:10.980> is<00:03:11.219> to<00:03:11.430> keep<00:03:11.640> lifting<00:03:12.030> the

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
one tip I learn is to keep lifting the

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.970 
one tip I learn is to keep lifting the
dough<00:03:12.569> up<00:03:12.750> off<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.170> surface<00:03:13.379> that<00:03:13.799> you're

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
dough up off the surface that you're

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.280 
dough up off the surface that you're
rolling<00:03:14.099> it<00:03:14.430> on<00:03:14.579> this<00:03:15.359> will<00:03:15.599> allow<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:16.170> get

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
rolling it on this will allow you to get

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.800 
rolling it on this will allow you to get
a<00:03:16.349> really<00:03:16.680> thin<00:03:16.829> tortilla<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:21.239> problem<00:03:21.689> I

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
a really thin tortilla the problem I

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.319 
a really thin tortilla the problem I
used<00:03:22.019> to<00:03:22.200> have<00:03:22.379> I<00:03:22.409> never<00:03:22.620> did<00:03:23.069> this<00:03:23.310> so<00:03:23.609> my<00:03:24.269> two

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
used to have I never did this so my two

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.869 
used to have I never did this so my two
trios<00:03:24.689> would<00:03:25.079> be<00:03:25.230> too<00:03:25.530> thick<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:26.129> they'd<00:03:26.700> be

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
trios would be too thick and they'd be

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.270 
trios would be too thick and they'd be
rather<00:03:27.180> small<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:28.019> that<00:03:28.620> when<00:03:28.890> I<00:03:28.920> tried<00:03:29.250> to

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
rather small and that when I tried to

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.729 
rather small and that when I tried to
fold<00:03:29.640> them<00:03:29.849> up<00:03:30.000> they<00:03:30.239> would<00:03:30.390> just<00:03:30.569> break<00:03:30.840> so

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
fold them up they would just break so

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.099 
fold them up they would just break so
having<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.220> nice<00:03:32.430> thin<00:03:32.849> tortilla<00:03:33.329> is<00:03:33.569> the<00:03:33.750> key

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
having a nice thin tortilla is the key

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.710 
having a nice thin tortilla is the key
so<00:03:34.829> that<00:03:34.859> it'll<00:03:35.280> stay<00:03:35.579> nice<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:36.150> flexible

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
so that it'll stay nice and flexible

00:03:36.720 --> 00:04:00.270 
so that it'll stay nice and flexible
when<00:03:37.019> you<00:03:37.139> roll<00:03:37.349> it<00:03:37.500> up

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.430 

so<00:04:00.910> you<00:04:01.000> want<00:04:01.210> to<00:04:01.270> flip<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:01.630> tortilla<00:04:02.080> as<00:04:02.230> soon

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
so you want to flip the tortilla as soon

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.800 
so you want to flip the tortilla as soon
as<00:04:02.560> you<00:04:02.710> see<00:04:02.920> bubbles<00:04:03.250> form<00:04:03.670> on<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:03.880> top<00:04:03.910> this

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
as you see bubbles form on the top this

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.790 
as you see bubbles form on the top this
shouldn't<00:04:05.170> take<00:04:05.260> long<00:04:05.410> at<00:04:05.860> all<00:04:07.590> then<00:04:08.590> just

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
shouldn't take long at all then just

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.410 
shouldn't take long at all then just
cook<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.250> other<00:04:09.280> side<00:04:09.490> for<00:04:09.970> probably<00:04:10.330> about

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
cook the other side for probably about

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.960 
cook the other side for probably about
half<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:11.020> time<00:04:11.260> it<00:04:11.410> took<00:04:11.590> for<00:04:11.860> the<00:04:11.980> first<00:04:12.700> side

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
half the time it took for the first side

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.480 
half the time it took for the first side
to<00:04:13.120> cook<00:04:13.390> and<00:04:13.660> just<00:04:13.770> repeat<00:04:14.770> this<00:04:14.950> process<00:04:15.220> for

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
to cook and just repeat this process for

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:23.100 
to cook and just repeat this process for
the<00:04:15.790> rest<00:04:16.060> of<00:04:16.239> the<00:04:16.329> tortillas<00:04:21.660> so<00:04:22.660> here<00:04:22.990> I'm
