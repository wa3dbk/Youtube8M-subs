00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.990
 You've probably already had the word 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:32.230
 light year belongs in astronomy and 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.060
 cosmology now this light year is one 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.800
 stretch the light in a year 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:40.360
 travels about 95 million kilometers 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.640
 So you could say that now 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.590
 light year the distance is the light in 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.530
 one year in one particular 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.480
 time period covers one calculates that 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.360
 down one can say that the light in 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.470
 one second of light around 300,000 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.930
 kilometer travels the 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.560
 Light speed is therefore a light 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.809
 second 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:06.450
 ergo 300 thousand kilometers per second 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.490
 Here we have two spaceships 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.860
 one of them stands still, the other is 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.170
 in motion when the moving 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.259
 ship the standing happens shoot 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.700
 Both emit a laser beam, according to Einstein 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.930
 depends on the speed of the 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.300
 not from the 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.950
 speed of spaceships from both 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:28.899
 So rays are the same 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.850
 speed in parallel on the way 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.619
 crew of the standing ship sees that 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.890
 Your laser beam in twelve seconds 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:38.380
 12 light seconds far moved and reported 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.869
 Accordingly, that light with a light 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.869
 second per second moves correctly 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.750
 But what about the laser beam? 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.490
 By moving ship he moves 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.510
 only six in twelve seconds 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.400
 seconds far 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.260
 if so, the crew of the 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.910
 moving ship notice that 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.310
 their light only half 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.880
 moving at the speed of light but that does 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.240
 the crew is not 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.610
 but why question now, according to a stone 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.720
 does not always move with a light 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.250
 second per second 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.710
 regardless of the movement of the 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.960
 observers how do we get this 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.330
 Disagree with ours 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.730
 observations is part of the solution 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.320
 the fact that the clocks on board the 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.860
 moving ship slower 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.350
 to run 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.420
 so if we assume that light is always 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.120
 he must travel at the speed of light 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.770
 errors would lie in the time measurement 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.450
 the clocks on board the flying 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.460
 spaceship exactly half as fast 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.830
 running like on board ship 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.240
 our problem would be completely solved 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.130
 the beam of the moving 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.860
 ship was still six seconds 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.960
 traveling far through the slower clocks 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.240
 but six more seconds for that 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.730
 need the observations of the crew 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.160
 would therefore give the light in 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.200
 one second exactly one light second 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.940
 However far he travels turned out 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.280
 that the clocks are not slow enough 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.209
 run for the sole solution of the 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.220
 to be problems 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.500
 and of course it's not about 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.470
 watch it is the time itself 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.180
 slows down countless experiments of the 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.020
 last 100 years have just that 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.489
 but why does that happen? 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.380
 before we take the second part of the laser 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.910
 We devote ourselves to solve problems 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.910
 best first of all this question 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.040
 A watch is a device that regularly 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.959
 events that occur count this 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.250
 event which drives the clock can 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.950
 actually be everything 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.109
 the movement of a pendulum that 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.209
 bouncing a ball that unwind 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:35.890
 a driving spring or the changing one 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.890
 Charge in an electrical circuit 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.109
 let's imagine we build a clock 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:48.909
 in the one beam between two 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:48.909
 reflecting back and forth 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:03.680
 always when the light is the bottom plate 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:05.569
 The clock continues to reach the advantage 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.370
 This watch design is that we 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.709
 can be sure that every observer 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.239
 time always give a mechanism 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.650
 with the same speed and 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.620
 See reflected street light 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.750
 if both ears are unmoved so 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.669
 stationary we are expecting you 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.669
 show both exactly the same time 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.620
 but what if one of these watches 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.150
 moves though the two watches are identical 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.120
 are the moving clock 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.220
 slower than the stationary around that 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.200
 you have to understand only the path of the 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.110
 light beam reflected view 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:54.000
 the ray wanders in the dormant clock 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:55.590
 vertically up and down the beam 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.030
 in the moving clock has one 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.530
 further a diagonal away if now 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.150
 So both beams with the 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.100
 same speed are traveling 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.990
 and the upper beam a longer one 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.700
 has to cover the distance that runs 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.680
 moving clock for the stationary 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.800
 watchers slower than his own 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.800
 Clock 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.720
 this phenomenon will become the nation time 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.890
 called 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.870
 However, it must be emphasized that one 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.120
 Observer moving with the clock 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.710
 nothing notices the clock and the 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.640
 Time course behave for him 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.320
 completely normal 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.450
 he is in his view 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.880
 stationary and the other observer 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.430
 moves for him , the other clock is running 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:39.180
 slower in Einstein's universe is the 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:41.220
 flow of time throughout the relatively 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.290
 next video we solve the apparent 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.300
 contradiction of the laser problem on and 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:48.830
 not only experience that time relative 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.830
 but is also the room 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.400
