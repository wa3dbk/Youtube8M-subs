 Hello readers hotel was here the 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.810
 blog everyone spend online dot with them 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.460
 bringing another technology tutorial 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.880
 For you today I'll show you how 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.190
 customize the colors of windows 10 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.710
 well actually this is not even the tutorial 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.980
 quickie team shows customization 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.580
 that of the colors of the bardot begin here 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.230
 bat tasks and the notification bar and 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.359
 to give central notifications is a 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.670
 which I found very interesting and 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.949
 I wanted to share with you and 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.170
 Someone even apologized, I did not 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.170
 I remember who was asked this in 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.790
 comments and videos, and after I 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.370
 I saw this feature in the wanted 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.710
 to share with you is as follows 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.600
 you come here to customize the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.610
 likely to see colors and that 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.430
 you are probably already using the 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.820
 windows you know you can change and the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.410
 system colors but the following 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.989
 you do not apply this option here 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.739
 low color does not apply 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.480
 then this option here is an attempt to 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.200
 let the menu start the taskbar 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.600
 and the central actions work and sorry 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.090
 show coren start in bar 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.700
 tasks and in the central of actions and you 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.890
 see color the one thing you should 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.229
 to be aware that this color does not have 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.240
 nothing to do with the background that 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.630
 I am using for example a color 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.049
 pink that uses me and my background 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.150
 which is kind of blue right, and a feature that I 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.159
 I found this interesting 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.920
 automatically selected a color of 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.200
 highlighted in my background screen and there that 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.520
 happens or select and sykes and will see 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.340
 the taskbar or start the 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.110
 notification center but everything is 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.890
 similar to the background color in it 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.740
 leg to color more than more predominant 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.880
 in my background or one of the things 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.159
 that he chooses that I'll show you 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.259
 others but you will see that it will change 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.229
 for example I will change my plan 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.899
 background for that image here and there you see 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.290
 that he took the green and turned green 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.360
 Now, in these, these are these colors. 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.790
 here even if I change it again I'm going 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.880
 get anyone here from the system and 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.360
 which for example 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:20.590
 and he put the color of that little hut 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.630
 here in case here is a green will also 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.780
 change again just so you can see I will 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.510
 Well, yeah, that's where he put that brown 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.210
 here in this case I think it seems 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.070
 Marrone I think this is interesting 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.930
 very interesting resource that he I 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.790
 I do not have to keep changing the color they 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.700
 automatically selects a color that 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.580
 home here with my background and well 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.560
 cool I know if you have color 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.710
 which I explained in the tutorial 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.940
 will fall on the cards and give 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.680
 if you have color in the 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.350
 titles here from the windows it also goes 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.750
 change color when you change to your 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.450
 background and then if you notice 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.960
 the title bar that is also 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.780
 changing color and this is was a zink rack 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.090

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.950
