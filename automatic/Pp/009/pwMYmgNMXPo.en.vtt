that a lot you got that green cable
there<00:02:52.580> that<00:02:53.580> plugs<00:02:54.030> into<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:54.450> piggyback<00:02:55.110> so<00:02:55.470> I

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
there that plugs into the piggyback so I

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.380 
there that plugs into the piggyback so I
was<00:02:55.620> talking<00:02:55.830> about<00:02:55.920> earlier<00:02:56.900> so<00:02:57.900> like<00:02:58.440> I<00:02:58.620> said

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.900 
was talking about earlier so like I said
it's<00:03:00.390> definitely<00:03:01.080> worth<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.950> 90<00:03:02.340> bucks<00:03:02.580> or

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910
