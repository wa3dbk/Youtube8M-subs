00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.460
 a salute to all and all its forms to 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.660
 fourth video in which 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.359
 today I will try to you 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.119
 learn improved from your details about 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.189
 pc video games while call of duty 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.160
 or counter strike for example both 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.840
 Thursday the games if the two best known 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.130
 and how am I going to make eating used 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.199
 three games available on net 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.399
 free which aim 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.840
 improve your accuracy 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.040
 so we leave right away with the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.399
 first of those games called m 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.399
 booster 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.360
 and so here is my booster 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.800
 free available on the net so I 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.630
 should you give the link in the 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.430
 description you can even click on 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.960
 the notation that will make it appear that I 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.820
 you would put there to access 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.080
 directly to the players this game so 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.420
 improve your accuracy 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.699
 thanks to a very simple system of 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.830
 targets will appear on your screen at 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.050
 about 3 per second in at least 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.580
 at the beginning you are seeing them remove them 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.750
 before she disappears she stays at 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.360
 about three seconds also on your 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.610
 screen does not like we will see being super 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.229
 fast and it does not seem like that 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.210
 difficult but it's good my record 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.820
 as soon as that 29 seconds on a 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.399
 minute to hold then took a second 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.310
 mode on this game it's the training mode 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:26.170
 I laughed dragging in which you go 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.210
 choose the number of targets that 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.890
 will appear per second 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.940
 their size and the time they 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.550
 will put forward to disappear 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.970
 and that's maybe a solution too 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.410
 not bad to start so I when we 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.670
 sees that by improving a lot to 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.289
 games because at first I was in 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.430
 the 10 seconds and but the same the 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.530
 best time it was 10 seconds 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.560
 no i'm in my twenties pretty 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.899
 often down after you will see that in 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.560
 games like counter strike plus 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.679
 especially since I play it 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.869
 not bad 16 go especially he has 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:59.440
 open that your accuracy is really going 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:02.140
 increase since and at your speed 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.209
 to put your cursor where you 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.560
 so this is the first of 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:06.759
 games that I introduced to you now 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.630
 we will go on our game called 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.630
 void hour mousseau 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.440
 and so we end up on my way 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.659
 ryder disavowed by action if I 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.519
 pronounced bad so this game also comes 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:25.459
 will be in the description of course then 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.569
 it's a game you have a little ball 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.090
 red 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.950
 as you can see on the video that 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.900
 who goes behind a little ball 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.790
 red to pass in different obstacles 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.819
 without touching the walls nice without being 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.950
 touched by the walls because 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.470
 some walls is moving on you so 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.730
 this game we will allow to put 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.450
 to improve your left movements 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.870
 right up down paying attention a 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.390
 little to every obstacle that happens on 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.150
 me on your cursor and I find 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.859
 that they played that day rather nice 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.410
 to improve ourselves now we're going 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:02.150
 end up on the last game that is 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.519
 another precision game called 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.349
 monochrome and that I find in syrup 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.849
 interesting you'll see why 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.120
 so we find ourselves immediately on 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.120
 my screen 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.470
 is true so this is the third and 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.270
 last game called monochrome or 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.000
 the goal is to break pentagons 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.520
 like that white color avoiding 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.170
 those of another color of course the 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.180
 difficulty will increase as there you 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.980
 you can see the background color 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.090
 will change so that's brutal we get 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.010
 does not account when watching the video 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.870
 but when he plays and that makes enough 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.690
 weird no of course now you of 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.950
 drill those black and you 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.150
 can see he's moving from left to 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.880
 right from where the difficulty comes from 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.580
 actually to increase after it is enough 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.070
 to keep up the pace and that seems to me 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.140
 accelerate and it's really not 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.850
 easily bro code and 260 points or there 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.980
 this is the video still lucky I 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.470
 films them and I was very lucky 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.630
 because I had managed to go beyond 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.340
 100 points I do not know why but 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.900
 I really worry about it 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.030
 the one I find the hardest and 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.220
 yet it seems not complex like that 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.390
 to watch a video our hearts I 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.400
 would like to say it so that you can 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.290
 go and test and blast to an opinion you 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.720
 even you can see that really where 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.970
 the speed has really increased 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.979
 in passing I will try to do 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.750
 implode this video on two channels 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.710
 community who are the white the good 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.630
 plan of the geek and call him guilty 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.870
 so if I'm accepted ben I ask 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.490
 to subscribers of these of these two channels 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:36.360
 to go see my work on me on 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.620
 my chain that seals flourish so she 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.410
 will be in their description normally 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.520
 and I'll see you soon for a 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.720
 next video 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.720
 go ciao everyone
