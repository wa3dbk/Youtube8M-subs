this is going to happen or not I really
don't<00:00:49.530> think<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.250> that's<00:00:50.340> they<00:00:50.520> can

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
don't think it is and that's they can

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.549 
don't think it is and that's they can
offer<00:00:50.850> him<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.149> substantial<00:00:51.989> amount<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.379> money

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559

and<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.789> know<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.149> some<00:00:54.329> sort<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.570> maybe

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
and you know and some sort of maybe

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.840

movie<00:00:55.230> appearance<00:00:55.710> down<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.070> road<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.489> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
movie appearance down the road and the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.130 
movie appearance down the road and the
reason<00:00:57.059> I'm<00:00:57.149> saying<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.660> he's<00:00:57.930> been

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
reason I'm saying this is he's been

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.740 
reason I'm saying this is he's been
pretty<00:00:58.379> vocal<00:00:58.649> about<00:00:59.010> superhero<00:00:59.969> movies<00:01:00.449> and

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
pretty vocal about superhero movies and

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.660 
pretty vocal about superhero movies and
you<00:01:00.840> know<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:01.350> knock<00:01:01.649> down<00:01:01.949> capes<00:01:02.489> and

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
you know just knock down capes and

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.700 
you know just knock down capes and
things<00:01:02.850> like<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.480> unless<00:01:04.320> they're<00:01:04.500> going

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
things like that so unless they're going

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.140 
things like that so unless they're going
to<00:01:04.799> do<00:01:04.920> something<00:01:05.339> where<00:01:05.489> bull's<00:01:05.760> eye<00:01:05.850> doesn't

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
to do something where bull's eye doesn't

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.880 
to do something where bull's eye doesn't
really<00:01:06.450> suit<00:01:06.810> up<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.110> upset<00:01:07.439> bull's<00:01:07.740> eye

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
really suit up and upset bull's eye

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.679 
really suit up and upset bull's eye
which<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.280> think<00:01:08.490> would<00:01:08.580> be<00:01:08.729> disappointing<00:01:09.570> to

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.300 
thing I could see is that Mysterio
probably<00:01:37.110> would<00:01:37.380> be<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:37.890> honestly<00:01:38.220> this

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
probably would be in this honestly this

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.130 
probably would be in this honestly this
is<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.579> thing<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.119> can<00:01:39.299> most<00:01:39.540> likely<00:01:39.900> see<00:01:40.110> you

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
is the thing I can most likely see you

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.100 
is the thing I can most likely see you
know<00:01:40.350> as<00:01:40.650> part<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:41.490> deal<00:01:41.820> happening<00:01:42.390> with

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
know as part of this deal happening with

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.319 
know as part of this deal happening with
Sony<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.250> Marvel<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.850> would<00:01:45.060> be<00:01:45.210> the

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
Sony and Marvel this would be the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.240 
Sony and Marvel this would be the
easiest<00:01:45.810> thing<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.110> really<00:01:46.590> get<00:01:46.799> out<00:01:46.950> there

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
easiest thing to really get out there

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.310 
easiest thing to really get out there
and<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:48.000> see<00:01:48.180> this<00:01:48.299> one<00:01:48.450> more<00:01:48.659> plausible<00:01:49.170> than

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
and I see this one more plausible than

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.679 
and I see this one more plausible than
getting<00:01:49.619> Jason<00:01:49.860> Statham<00:01:50.399> onboard<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.970> me<00:01:51.060> you

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
getting Jason Statham onboard to me you

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.109 
getting Jason Statham onboard to me you
know<00:01:51.810> bullseye<00:01:52.259> but<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:53.579> guys<00:01:53.759> let<00:01:53.970> me<00:01:54.000> know

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
know bullseye but you guys let me know

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.850 
know bullseye but you guys let me know
