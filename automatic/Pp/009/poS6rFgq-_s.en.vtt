00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.100 
start weaving in and out of cars because
that's<00:02:09.090> just<00:02:09.179> what<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.390> gotta<00:02:09.450> do<00:02:09.780> my<00:02:09.929> curse

smaller<00:02:10.470> than<00:02:10.679> his<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:11.310> our<00:02:11.400> agile<00:02:11.940> he<00:02:12.480> has

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
smaller than his to our agile he has

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.900 
smaller than his to our agile he has
more<00:02:12.750> top<00:02:12.990> speed<00:02:13.350> but<00:02:13.650> there's<00:02:14.280> cars<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.850> can

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
more top speed but there's cars I can

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.430 
more top speed but there's cars I can
maybe<00:02:15.180> squeeze<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:15.840> probably<00:02:15.990> got<00:02:16.140> honked

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
maybe squeeze and I probably got honked

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.930 
maybe squeeze and I probably got honked
at<00:02:16.530> like<00:02:16.680> three<00:02:16.890> or<00:02:16.980> four<00:02:17.010> times<00:02:17.160> squeezing<00:02:17.850> in

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
at like three or four times squeezing in

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.790 
at like three or four times squeezing in
the<00:02:18.000> lanes<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.270> probably<00:02:18.480> shouldn't<00:02:18.840> have<00:02:18.900> bad

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
the lanes I probably shouldn't have bad

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.790 
the lanes I probably shouldn't have bad
driving<00:02:20.160> probs<00:02:20.640> but<00:02:21.270> I<00:02:21.540> know<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.560> was<00:02:22.709> pretty
