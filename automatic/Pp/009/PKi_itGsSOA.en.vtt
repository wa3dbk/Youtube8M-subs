00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.080
 chess board structures 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.299
 In this position we can analyze many 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.990
 structures of different opinions 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:16.690
 pedestrians d2 and d3 of white are 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.710
 duplicates which makes them weak and 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.529
 ineffective 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.359
 they are also isolated because they 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:26.949
 have no supporting opinions on the columns 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:29.859
 next to them the pawns to and from the black 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:33.040
 are also isolated and this is 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:35.230
 especially bad for the pawn and because 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.989
 it is also in an open column 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.010
 where it could theoretically be attacked 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:44.140
 by a tower 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:47.320
 the pedestrians eeh of white and black 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.570
 are in closed columns and it is difficult 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.770
 attack them but they have very little 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.559
 mobility 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:58.120
 the truly good pedestrian structure 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:01:01.660
 is the group of pedestrians to 2 and b2 of white 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.850
 also known as spy 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.799
 Let's see how white can 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.799
 enjoy this island had good 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.420
 the amazing movement 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.490
 White wants to play 3 gb 4 for 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.470
 creation of a past top 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.890
 so why are they going to play at once? 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:27.880
 13 the reason is that then the black 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:31.030
 could play at 4 by preventing the pawn 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.329
 b and move without being captured 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.700
 if pawn b2 was moved to b3 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:39.640
 that he would be captured and if he were 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:45.549
 moved to b4 would be caught in 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:49.689
 black operation defend your pawn g 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:51.840
 but now he can not advance the 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:56.590
 white pedestrians continue to advance 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.810
 correctly the pawn and the black holds 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.680
 both white pawns of the column of 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.750
 these three pawns are very weak 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.680
 finally the white ones that broke 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.289
 past 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.399
 even though the black pawn catches 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.790
 b 4 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.960
 white can counterattack 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.260
 capturing a and b 4 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.689
 in short 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.099
 how important it is to observe the structure 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:21.439
 of pedestrians 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.560
 you must learn to recognize pedestrians 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:27.159
 isolated from the opponent in order to 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.159
 attack the
