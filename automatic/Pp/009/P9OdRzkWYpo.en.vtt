00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:09.370
 licorice same principle of small cubes 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:12.090

 licorice people roll the pigeon on 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.410
 himself as a snail 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.740

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.250
 and the third sweet licorice I 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:11.030

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:14.360
 he steals the platinum returns us again 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:19.310

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.720
 second bowl after you washed them 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.760
 hands I take the modeling clay 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.989
 white to make forage from 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:32.060
 third sweet licorice 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:37.370
 I make a ball I do not crush and I'm going 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:39.560
 superimpose on my first pass 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.530
 the theine black I enclose a frame 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.220

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.220
 a square 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.840
 and here is another good tone for ellis before 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.760
 to bake each candy there 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.140
 do not forget to drill 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.140
 to make the pearl hole 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:14.209
 I widen a little bit the hole but 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:17.150
 this is the operation for each of the 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:22.959
 sweets now bake each of 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.959
 fake sweets 35 minutes to 110 degrees 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.750
 but hey we run away I'll be able to 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.780
 the assemblies I take the fishing line 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:35.690
 on which I will attach the clasp 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:40.730
 I put a pair crashed in the 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:44.000
 fishing line and then the clasp and I 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:49.700
 return the end of the fishing line 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:52.160
 the opera crushed and then I bring peace 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:56.859
 at the stop crashed towards the loop of the 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.859
 clasp and crush it with the pliers 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:06.880
 now I cut the thread to length 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.880
 desired and I put pearls 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.940
 in essence 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:34.539
 I attach the ring to the second 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:37.830
 ends of the necklace again with 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.830
 rabbits the pearl to iron 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.849
 I crush 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.470
 and here you have learned to achieve a 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.930
 candy necklace this is an activity 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.110
 very easy to reproduce with your 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.110
