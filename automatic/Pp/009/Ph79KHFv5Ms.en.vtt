00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
new concept header can you explain to us

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.820 
new concept header can you explain to us
why<00:00:23.310> this<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.779> step<00:00:24.779> forward<00:00:25.080> in<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.529> future

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
why this is a step forward in the future

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.300 
why this is a step forward in the future
of<00:00:26.130> corn<00:00:26.400> harvest<00:00:26.730> yes<00:00:27.599> this<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.320> as<00:00:28.949> you

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
of corn harvest yes this is a as you

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.479 
of corn harvest yes this is a as you
said<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.609> concept<00:00:30.529> corn<00:00:31.529> head<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:32.040> will<00:00:32.219> run

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
said a concept corn head that will run

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.720 
said a concept corn head that will run
any<00:00:32.880> row<00:00:33.750> widths<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.770> will<00:00:34.950> also<00:00:35.070> run<00:00:35.489> any

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
any row widths and it will also run any

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.069 
any row widths and it will also run any
direction<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.510> will<00:00:36.630> run<00:00:36.809> gross<00:00:37.110> waves<00:00:37.760> angle

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
direction it will run gross waves angle

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.790 
direction it will run gross waves angle
it's<00:00:40.079> number<00:00:40.559> seven<00:00:41.780> version<00:00:42.780> we<00:00:43.260> think<00:00:43.590> will

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
it's number seven version we think will

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.310 
it's number seven version we think will
probably<00:00:43.980> be<00:00:44.430> on<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.940> number<00:00:45.360> ten<00:00:45.719> before

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
probably be on the number ten before

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.430 
probably be on the number ten before
it's<00:00:46.469> actually<00:00:46.950> released<00:00:47.460> which<00:00:47.820> right<00:00:48.090> now

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
it's actually released which right now

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.209 
it's actually released which right now
we're<00:00:49.440> expecting<00:00:49.770> maybe<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.460> Year<00:00:50.579> 2015<00:00:52.219> but

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
we're expecting maybe the Year 2015 but

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.240 
we're expecting maybe the Year 2015 but
the<00:00:53.250> advantages<00:00:54.000> are<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.590> it<00:00:55.590> will<00:00:55.710> run<00:00:55.890> any

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
the advantages are that it will run any

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.760 
the advantages are that it will run any
row<00:00:57.239> width<00:00:57.510> eliminating<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.530> need<00:00:58.710> for

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
row width eliminating the need for

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.799 
row width eliminating the need for
custom<00:00:59.219> guys<00:00:59.640> for<00:01:00.090> various<00:01:01.129> heads<00:01:02.629> if<00:01:03.629> a

accomplish that and what's
how<00:01:21.759> does<00:01:21.939> it<00:01:22.090> accomplish<00:01:22.360> that

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
how does it accomplish that

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.770 
how does it accomplish that
the<00:01:24.100> way<00:01:24.280> it's<00:01:24.520> designed<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:28.420> way<00:01:28.570> the

rotating<00:01:32.920> knives<00:01:33.280> down<00:01:33.730> here<00:01:34.150> that<00:01:34.780> will

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
rotating knives down here that will

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.200 
rotating knives down here that will
actually<00:01:35.170> pull<00:01:35.830> the<00:01:36.010> stalks<00:01:36.340> in<00:01:36.670> and<00:01:36.880> cut<00:01:37.060> them

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
actually pull the stalks in and cut them

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.600 
actually pull the stalks in and cut them
off<00:01:37.390> when<00:01:37.840> it<00:01:37.960> goes<00:01:38.110> into<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:38.470> chopping<00:01:39.070> unit

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
off when it goes into the chopping unit

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.470 
off when it goes into the chopping unit
it<00:01:40.150> also<00:01:40.360> has<00:01:40.870> gathering<00:01:41.680> wheels<00:01:42.520> up<00:01:43.060> here

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
it also has gathering wheels up here

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.800 
it also has gathering wheels up here
that<00:01:44.290> help<00:01:44.590> grab<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.370> corn<00:01:45.670> and<00:01:45.910> gently<00:01:46.300> bring

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
that help grab the corn and gently bring

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.380 
that help grab the corn and gently bring
it<00:01:46.840> in<00:01:47.230> and<00:01:47.500> stabilize<00:01:48.040> the<00:01:48.070> core<00:01:48.640> so<00:01:49.360> that

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
it in and stabilize the core so that

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.630 
it in and stabilize the core so that
we're<00:01:49.630> not<00:01:49.660> rattling<00:01:50.320> the<00:01:50.500> stalk<00:01:51.780> we're<00:01:52.780> using

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
we're not rattling the stalk we're using

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.280 
we're not rattling the stalk we're using
approximately<00:01:54.640> a<00:01:54.700> 30<00:01:55.090> inch<00:01:55.360> Center<00:01:55.780> right<00:01:56.050> now

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
approximately a 30 inch Center right now

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.340 
approximately a 30 inch Center right now
but<00:01:57.070> we're<00:01:57.220> able<00:01:57.370> to<00:01:57.610> bring<00:01:57.730> the<00:01:58.000> corn<00:01:58.350> right

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
but we're able to bring the corn right

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.230 
but we're able to bring the corn right
into<00:01:59.710> that<00:01:59.830> 30-inch<00:02:00.370> Center<00:02:00.760> so<00:02:01.000> we're<00:02:01.150> only

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
into that 30-inch Center so we're only

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.680 
into that 30-inch Center so we're only
having<00:02:01.690> to<00:02:01.780> use<00:02:01.990> 8<00:02:02.610> units<00:02:03.610> on<00:02:03.850> this<00:02:04.150> head<00:02:04.450> to

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
having to use 8 units on this head to

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.120 
having to use 8 units on this head to
accomplish<00:02:05.229> our<00:02:05.500> goal

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
accomplish our goal

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.219 
accomplish our goal
