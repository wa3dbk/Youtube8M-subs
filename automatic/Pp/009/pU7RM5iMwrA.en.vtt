00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.590
 phase freezes is not as dangerous as 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.060

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.560

 extraordinary talent that 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.960
 differentiates us from the others 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.510

 distinguishes the other students and 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.270
 ideal for the main role I do not have 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.770

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.790
