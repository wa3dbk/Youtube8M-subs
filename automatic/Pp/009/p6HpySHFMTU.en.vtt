00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.230
 the superior technical school of 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.110
 agronomists of the university 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.419
 Polytechnic of Madrid counts from the 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.490
 year 2006 with an ecological port 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:27.610
 promoted by the innovation group 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.160
 educational ecological agriculture east 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.930
 occupies a plot of about 800 meters 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.180
 squares located in the fields of 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.280
 practices in an area sheltered by 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.370
 greenhouse slopes that isolate it from 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.040
 external climatic factors 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.320
 now 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.360
 for the start- up were made 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.040
 various test pits of which 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.900
 they took samples of the soil that 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.900
 analyzed in the laboratory for 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.970
 know its composition in the spring 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.370
 the following year a 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.440
 deep tillage 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.110
 and after leveling the terrain , proceeded to 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.390
 his stake out the plot was divided into 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.089
 five zones of four terraces each 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.530
 then the 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.640
 infrastructure necessary for the 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.640
 drip irrigation system 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.899
 in organic farming the 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.280
 fertilization is a key aspect with the 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.770
 which is intended by feeding 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.740
 of soil indirectly feed the 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.780
 plants in the orchard was added 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.000
 initially a high amount of 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.939
 very mature sheep manure from 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.469
 of extensive ranching was completed 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.360
 with a small amount of humus 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:36.420
 certified worm to be able to be 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.920
 used in organic farming 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.960
 compost is currently being used 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.370
 that complies with the regulations for use in the 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.560
 ecological agriculture 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.030
 with organic fertilization you are 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.620
 getting the 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.200
 biodiversity of soil organisms 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.210
 as worms bacteria and fungi that 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.610
 contribute to the prevention of pests and 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.780
 diseases and also a remarkable 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.780
 improvement of its structure 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.130
 In the garden, the 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.870
 drip irrigation although in the case of 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.750
 some crops are resorted to the micro 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.930
 sprinkling these types of risks assume 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.730
 a significant water saving 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.189
 the tillage is carried out through 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.620
 light gardening machinery like 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:22.160
 motocultores to prepare the land or 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.280
 manually in the case of downloads 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.319
 i 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.020
 the amount of species grown in the 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.880
 vegetable garden is very broad there are vegetables 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.959
 lettuce leaf lettuce lettuce 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.560
 spinach cabbage garlic root vegetables 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:41.040
 onions turnips fruit vegetables 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.600
 tomato aubergine pepper zucchini 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.880
 tubers like potato species 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.060
 aromatic and condimentary thyme 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.440
 basil parsley chamomile that create a 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.440
 pleasant environment in the garden 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.560
 The seeds used can be 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.630
 Own acquisition or acquisition 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.480
 commercial with certification for 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.310
 ecological agriculture in terms of 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.989
 seedlings that are replicated come from a 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.940
 nursery authorized by the committee 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.239
 ecological agriculture of the community of 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.239
 Madrid' 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.200
 in the protection of crops it charges great 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.120
 importance the prevention for it it 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.460
 looks for good biodiversity both in 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.170
 time and space for 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.630
 achieve it a rotation is made 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.190
 four-year period in addition to the association of 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.100
 cultures that produce interactions 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.830
 positive to avoid proliferation 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.050
 of non-cultivated species other than 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.940
 Manual loading uses techniques 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.490
 ground cover as the layout 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.320
 of straw or other materials that together with 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.870
 the foliar mass of the crops 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.390
 hinder the penetration of light flush 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.280
 of soil and prevents germination and 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.620
 development of non-cultivated plants 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.720
 to fight pests and diseases in 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.240
 an ecological garden we can use 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.920
 several procedures prepared 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.630
 natural from extracts of 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.940
 plants like garlic that repels 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.850
 aphids treatments of mineral origin 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.190
 as the potash soap solution and 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.290
 the biological fight where they are introduced 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.790
 natural enemies that thrive on 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.830
 those that threaten crops 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.250
 like the crisis or so that it feeds on 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.250
 aphids 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.570
 the organic garden receives visits with 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.360
 educational purposes from schools 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.250
 institutes different associations in the 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.690
 that activities like 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.510
 Tool and tool shops 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.160
 used in organic farming 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.560
 compost manufacturing recognition and 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.760
 pest and disease control 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.030
 preparation of seedlings and replicates 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.340
 of plants among others 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.170
 on the other hand the orchard is employed 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.480
 also in different practices 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.070
 subjects where the students of the 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.350
 Higher technical school of engineers 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.330
 agronomists can collaborate in jobs 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.520
 tillage soil analysis 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.890
 crop planning application 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.930
 treatments management and supervision of 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.479
 irrigation system 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.490
 in conclusion in the garden you can see 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:06.259
 the different alternatives to manage 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.830
 and produce vegetables so 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:08.830
 ecological
