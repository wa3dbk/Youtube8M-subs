00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
just kind of bend it so it gives you a

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.450 
just kind of bend it so it gives you a
little<00:00:37.649> loop<00:00:37.920> like<00:00:38.930> that's<00:00:40.160> a<00:00:43.100> little<00:00:44.100> bit<00:00:44.340> of

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
little loop like that's a little bit of

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.110 
little loop like that's a little bit of
a<00:00:44.579> curve<00:00:45.120> on<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:46.430> push<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.700> your<00:00:47.850> panel<00:00:49.550> and<00:00:50.550> see
