the oil
do<00:00:08.410> you<00:00:08.469> have<00:00:08.559> trash<00:00:08.860> bars<00:00:09.160> more<00:00:09.610> than<00:00:09.820> likely

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.000 
do you have trash bars more than likely

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.339 
do you have trash bars more than likely
you're<00:00:10.210> gonna<00:00:10.300> have<00:00:10.450> to<00:00:10.540> take<00:00:10.719> those<00:00:10.900> off<00:00:11.080> or

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:11.349 
you're gonna have to take those off or

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.789 
you're gonna have to take those off or
at<00:00:11.410> least<00:00:11.940> off<00:00:12.940> enough<00:00:13.509> to<00:00:13.719> get<00:00:13.960> the<00:00:14.290> box<00:00:14.500> pan

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:14.799 
at least off enough to get the box pan

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.060 
at least off enough to get the box pan
on<00:00:15.450> I'm<00:00:16.450> gonna<00:00:16.630> go<00:00:16.720> here<00:00:16.900> real<00:00:17.109> fast<00:00:17.140> we'll

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
on I'm gonna go here real fast we'll

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.939 
on I'm gonna go here real fast we'll
take<00:00:18.250> a<00:00:18.279> look

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
take a look

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.500 
take a look
basically<00:00:20.949> you<00:00:21.670> typically<00:00:22.060> have<00:00:22.180> the<00:00:22.270> skid

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510 
basically you typically have the skid

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.640 
basically you typically have the skid
plate<00:00:22.859> this<00:00:23.859> sits<00:00:24.100> right<00:00:24.279> under<00:00:24.550> here<00:00:24.910> and

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
plate this sits right under here and

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.839 
plate this sits right under here and
you're<00:00:26.650> going<00:00:26.769> to<00:00:26.800> have<00:00:26.949> to<00:00:27.039> take<00:00:27.189> that<00:00:27.250> off<00:00:27.430> in

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849 
you're going to have to take that off in

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.710 
you're going to have to take that off in
order<00:00:28.660> to<00:00:28.869> get<00:00:29.140> to<00:00:29.410> the<00:00:30.279> oil<00:00:31.150> filter<00:00:31.449> that's

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
order to get to the oil filter that's

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.660 
order to get to the oil filter that's
right<00:00:31.929> here<00:00:32.169> then<00:00:33.040> you're<00:00:33.160> changing<00:00:33.489> the<00:00:33.550> oil

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
right here then you're changing the oil

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.229 
right here then you're changing the oil
you<00:00:34.059> always<00:00:34.390> want<00:00:34.630> to<00:00:34.750> change<00:00:35.410> hot<00:00:35.739> oil<00:00:36.010> so<00:00:36.700> run

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
you always want to change hot oil so run

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.590 
you always want to change hot oil so run
the<00:00:37.270> engine<00:00:37.660> for<00:00:38.070> 10<00:00:39.070> minutes<00:00:39.430> or<00:00:39.550> so<00:00:39.600> make

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
the engine for 10 minutes or so make

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.819 
the engine for 10 minutes or so make
sure<00:00:40.629> it's<00:00:40.840> nice<00:00:40.899> and<00:00:41.140> warm<00:00:41.260> you<00:00:41.559> probably

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
sure it's nice and warm you probably

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.110 
sure it's nice and warm you probably
want<00:00:42.010> to<00:00:42.070> drive<00:00:42.309> it<00:00:42.460> around<00:00:42.550> as<00:00:42.790> your<00:00:42.910> better

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
want to drive it around as your better

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.430 
want to drive it around as your better
bet<00:00:43.239> on<00:00:43.510> that<00:00:43.690> too<00:00:43.870> because<00:00:43.989> if<00:00:44.170> you<00:00:44.260> let<00:00:44.379> it

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
bet on that too because if you let it

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.139 
bet on that too because if you let it
sit<00:00:44.559> you<00:00:44.890> run<00:00:45.040> the<00:00:45.160> risk<00:00:45.370> of<00:00:45.520> melting<00:00:45.910> one<00:00:46.059> of

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
sit you run the risk of melting one of

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:47.400 
sit you run the risk of melting one of
the<00:00:46.239> spot<00:00:46.510> windows<00:00:46.870> on<00:00:46.989> the<00:00:47.079> side<00:00:47.230> of<00:00:47.320> the

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
the spot windows on the side of the

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.889 
the spot windows on the side of the
engine<00:00:47.649> and<00:00:47.770> then<00:00:48.610> that<00:00:49.329> sucks

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899 
engine and then that sucks

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:55.410 
engine and then that sucks
don't<00:00:50.170> do<00:00:50.289> that<00:00:50.440> yeah<00:00:51.309> so<00:00:54.059> if<00:00:55.059> you<00:00:55.180> could<00:00:55.300> get

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
don't do that yeah so if you could get

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.209 
don't do that yeah so if you could get
that<00:00:55.600> oil<00:00:55.930> warm<00:00:56.559> because<00:00:56.739> what<00:00:56.949> that's<00:00:57.100> going

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
that oil warm because what that's going

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:58.439 
that oil warm because what that's going
to<00:00:57.280> do<00:00:57.430> is<00:00:57.520> that's<00:00:57.579> going<00:00:57.789> to<00:00:57.850> cycle<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:58.300> oil

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
to do is that's going to cycle the oil

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.599 
to do is that's going to cycle the oil
up<00:00:58.870> and<00:00:59.079> around<00:00:59.260> through<00:00:59.620> the<00:00:59.739> engine<00:01:00.010> so<00:01:00.489> that

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609 
up and around through the engine so that

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:03.000 
up and around through the engine so that
when<00:01:00.730> you<00:01:00.820> change<00:01:01.059> the<00:01:01.390> oil<00:01:01.649> you're<00:01:02.649> not<00:01:02.770> just

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
when you change the oil you're not just

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.619 
when you change the oil you're not just
changing<00:01:03.070> the<00:01:03.460> liquid<00:01:03.820> oil<00:01:04.000> but<00:01:04.449> you're<00:01:04.539> also

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
changing the liquid oil but you're also

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.780 
changing the liquid oil but you're also
changing<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.199> sludge<00:01:05.530> it<00:01:06.189> tends<00:01:06.460> to<00:01:06.520> settle

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
changing the sludge it tends to settle

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.370 
changing the sludge it tends to settle
at<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.000> bottom<00:01:07.090> if<00:01:07.510> it's<00:01:07.689> been<00:01:07.900> sitting<00:01:08.170> for<00:01:08.200> a

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
at the bottom if it's been sitting for a

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.560 
at the bottom if it's been sitting for a
while<00:01:08.760> what<00:01:09.760> josh<00:01:09.939> is<00:01:10.090> doing<00:01:10.180> right<00:01:10.330> here<00:01:10.510> is

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
while what josh is doing right here is

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.260 
while what josh is doing right here is
taking<00:01:10.750> out<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.320> drain<00:01:11.619> plug<00:01:12.180> sometimes<00:01:13.180> I

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
taking out the drain plug sometimes I

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.990 
taking out the drain plug sometimes I
can<00:01:13.390> be<00:01:13.420> in<00:01:13.600> pretty<00:01:14.170> tight<00:01:14.560> so<00:01:15.400> just<00:01:15.760> be<00:01:15.850> real

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
can be in pretty tight so just be real

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.100 
can be in pretty tight so just be real
gentle<00:01:16.299> with<00:01:16.330> it<00:01:16.509> of<00:01:16.659> course<00:01:16.750> you<00:01:16.869> don't<00:01:16.990> want

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
gentle with it of course you don't want

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.800 
gentle with it of course you don't want
to<00:01:17.170> strip<00:01:17.320> it<00:01:17.500> but<00:01:18.390> sometimes<00:01:19.390> it<00:01:19.450> may<00:01:19.570> help<00:01:19.659> to

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
to strip it but sometimes it may help to

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.840 
to strip it but sometimes it may help to
have<00:01:19.840> a<00:01:19.930> breaker<00:01:20.170> bar<00:01:20.470> which<00:01:21.460> is<00:01:21.580> what<00:01:21.759> we're

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
have a breaker bar which is what we're

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.620 
have a breaker bar which is what we're
going<00:01:21.970> to<00:01:22.000> need<00:01:22.150> so<00:01:22.450> remember<00:01:23.290> that<00:01:23.470> is<00:01:24.090> oil<00:01:25.090> so

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
going to need so remember that is oil so

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.840 
going to need so remember that is oil so
attempt<00:01:26.619> as<00:01:26.740> little<00:01:27.009> as<00:01:27.130> possible<00:01:27.310> to<00:01:27.640> get<00:01:27.729> on

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
attempt as little as possible to get on

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.749 
attempt as little as possible to get on
your<00:01:28.000> skin<00:01:28.180> plus<00:01:28.450> oils<00:01:29.380> corrosive<00:01:29.979> another<00:01:30.220> of

the<00:01:30.820> chemicals<00:01:31.329> and<00:01:31.479> what<00:01:32.310> just<00:01:33.310> don't<00:01:33.400> screw

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
the chemicals and what just don't screw

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.960 
the chemicals and what just don't screw
that<00:01:33.790> bolt<00:01:34.060> and<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.860> oil<00:01:36.130> should<00:01:36.369> come<00:01:36.640> floor

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
that bolt and the oil should come floor

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:45.880 
that bolt and the oil should come floor
down<00:01:37.240> there<00:01:40.680> once<00:01:41.680> I<00:01:41.829> get<00:01:41.979> that<00:01:42.130> I'm<00:01:42.280> screwed

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.780 

let's<00:01:46.670> let<00:01:46.850> it<00:01:46.970> drain<00:01:47.150> out<00:01:48.460> again<00:01:49.460> that<00:01:49.580> one

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
let's let it drain out again that one

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.320 
let's let it drain out again that one
should<00:01:50.120> be<00:01:50.270> pretty<00:01:50.570> scalding<00:01:51.170> hot<00:01:51.200> so<00:01:52.330> little

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
should be pretty scalding hot so little

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.760 
should be pretty scalding hot so little

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
it drain you can't take the filler cap

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.590 
it drain you can't take the filler cap
off<00:02:01.040> the<00:02:01.190> top<00:02:01.400> of<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:01.730> left<00:02:01.910> cylinder<00:02:02.420> head

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
off the top of the left cylinder head

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.990 
off the top of the left cylinder head
off<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:03.080> that<00:02:03.200> will<00:02:03.290> help<00:02:03.440> a<00:02:03.620> little<00:02:03.740> bit<00:02:04.010> so

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
off and that will help a little bit so

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.750 
off and that will help a little bit so
that's<00:02:05.120> right<00:02:05.330> here<00:02:05.390> that<00:02:06.190> can<00:02:07.190> take<00:02:07.400> that<00:02:07.430> off

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
that's right here that can take that off

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.060 
that's right here that can take that off
and<00:02:08.570> in<00:02:08.899> fact<00:02:09.080> we're<00:02:09.259> going<00:02:09.380> to<00:02:09.500> want<00:02:09.800> to<00:02:09.950> do

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
and in fact we're going to want to do

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.310 
and in fact we're going to want to do
that<00:02:10.190> anyways<00:02:10.520> just<00:02:10.550> because<00:02:11.060> we<00:02:11.270> in<00:02:11.690> this

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
that anyways just because we in this

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.480 
that anyways just because we in this
case<00:02:12.500> have<00:02:12.770> a<00:02:13.420> replacement<00:02:14.680> gasket<00:02:15.680> for<00:02:16.340> that

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
case have a replacement gasket for that

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.910 
case have a replacement gasket for that
so<00:02:16.910> we<00:02:17.870> take<00:02:18.020> that<00:02:18.140> off<00:02:18.320> it's<00:02:18.530> gonna<00:02:18.650> love<00:02:18.830> the

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
so we take that off it's gonna love the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.040 
so we take that off it's gonna love the
suction<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.370> kind<00:02:19.550> of<00:02:19.580> feed<00:02:19.760> through<00:02:20.060> so<00:02:21.020> that

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
suction to kind of feed through so that

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.930 
suction to kind of feed through so that
the<00:02:21.530> oil<00:02:22.040> can<00:02:22.190> flow<00:02:22.220> out<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.490> little<00:02:22.640> better

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
the oil can flow out a little better

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.290 
the oil can flow out a little better
okay<00:02:23.570> so<00:02:23.630> this<00:02:23.959> this<00:02:24.410> is<00:02:24.680> your<00:02:24.920> oil<00:02:25.040> wrench<00:02:25.400> vmm

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
okay so this this is your oil wrench vmm

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.120 
okay so this this is your oil wrench vmm
makes<00:02:26.600> it<00:02:26.780> specifically<00:02:27.320> because<00:02:27.680> their<00:02:27.830> oil

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
makes it specifically because their oil

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.420 
makes it specifically because their oil
filters<00:02:28.610> are<00:02:28.820> recessed<00:02:29.270> up<00:02:29.450> into<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.870> engine

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
filters are recessed up into the engine

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.699 
filters are recessed up into the engine
your<00:02:31.430> oil<00:02:31.790> plays<00:02:32.120> in<00:02:32.300> there<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:32.660> it<00:02:33.410> goes<00:02:33.500> up

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
your oil plays in there and it goes up

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.650 
your oil plays in there and it goes up
in<00:02:33.860> there<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:34.250> it<00:02:34.370> will<00:02:34.459> screw<00:02:34.730> off<00:02:34.880> it<00:02:35.209> uses<00:02:35.570> a

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
in there and it will screw off it uses a

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.050 
in there and it will screw off it uses a
three-quarter<00:02:36.110> bit<00:02:36.670> we're<00:02:37.670> going<00:02:37.820> to<00:02:37.880> use<00:02:37.970> an

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
three-quarter bit we're going to use an

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.520 
three-quarter bit we're going to use an
extender<00:02:38.420> bit<00:02:38.540> so<00:02:38.660> you<00:02:38.750> come<00:02:38.959> out<00:02:39.050> now<00:02:39.110> below

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
extender bit so you come out now below

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.770 
extender bit so you come out now below
especially<00:02:40.160> if<00:02:40.220> your<00:02:40.340> crash<00:02:40.550> barge<00:02:40.790> so<00:02:41.000> go

one<00:03:06.080> piece<00:03:06.590> of<00:03:06.620> advice<00:03:06.860> this<00:03:07.400> wrench<00:03:07.940> is<00:03:08.230> very

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.400

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
very normal for it to get stuck on that

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.990 
very normal for it to get stuck on that
I<00:03:18.530> kind<00:03:19.100> of<00:03:19.130> pay<00:03:19.280> attention<00:03:19.310> to<00:03:19.730> because

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000

I kind of pay attention to because
you'll<00:03:20.990> be<00:03:21.020> dealing<00:03:21.380> with<00:03:21.410> that<00:03:21.710> once<00:03:22.400> it

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
you'll be dealing with that once it

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.310 
you'll be dealing with that once it
comes<00:03:22.760> off<00:03:22.970> so<00:03:23.270> yeah<00:03:23.570> especially<00:03:23.780> which<00:03:24.110> put

comes off so yeah especially which put
the<00:03:24.410> filter<00:03:24.710> back<00:03:24.740> on<00:03:25.190> you<00:03:25.460> can<00:03:25.490> find<00:03:25.820> that

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
the filter back on you can find that

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.270 
the filter back on you can find that
that<00:03:26.120> filter<00:03:26.540> wrench<00:03:26.780> will<00:03:27.530> get<00:03:27.680> stuck<00:03:27.950> up<00:03:28.160> in

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
that filter wrench will get stuck up in

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.220 
that filter wrench will get stuck up in
there<00:03:28.430> you<00:03:28.700> can<00:03:28.820> easily<00:03:29.060> pull<00:03:29.210> the<00:03:29.360> the

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
there you can easily pull the the

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.920 
there you can easily pull the the
ratchet<00:03:31.070> off<00:03:31.190> but<00:03:31.820> the<00:03:32.060> filter<00:03:32.540> wrench<00:03:32.750> will

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
ratchet off but the filter wrench will

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.980 
ratchet off but the filter wrench will
stay<00:03:33.080> on<00:03:33.230> there<00:03:33.410> so<00:03:33.650> I<00:03:33.890> just<00:03:34.220> kind<00:03:34.550> of<00:03:34.580> have<00:03:34.700> to

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
stay on there so I just kind of have to

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.750 
stay on there so I just kind of have to
jiggle<00:03:35.990> the<00:03:36.230> ratchet<00:03:36.980> back<00:03:37.130> and<00:03:37.340> forth<00:03:37.550> a

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
jiggle the ratchet back and forth a

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.160 
jiggle the ratchet back and forth a
little<00:03:37.970> bit<00:03:38.060> until<00:03:38.390> that<00:03:38.570> wrench<00:03:38.780> comes<00:03:39.020> off

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
little bit until that wrench comes off

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.140 
little bit until that wrench comes off
