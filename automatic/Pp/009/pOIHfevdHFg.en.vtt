00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.320
 because it's a collaboration with tati 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.000
 regulated fashion video the limit of 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.829
 your channel is we just in the quality of 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.020
 information and together with tablet and 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.360
 We decided to bring you some tips so that 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.850
 Take advantage of your vacation time like this 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.590
 that if we are going to start with this video and 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.840
 the first type is that you devote time 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.210
 yourself so you can practice your 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.979
 favorite sport to do exercises and not 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.020
 you have time to go to the gym you can 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.729
 in your own home exercise or 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.060
 just go out to a park without 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.159
 breathe fresh air and another way to 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.860
 dedicate time to yourself is 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.289
 disconnect from the cell phone and like that 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.450
 start chatting with friends and that 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.789
 meet with them to share time with 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.130
 your family and what I was saying has no 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.380
 to be as if such a super expensive plan 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.030
 but with going to the park kings in a while and 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.130
 all this will make you spend a while 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.679
 super nice and take advantage of their 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.289
 time on vacation another way to 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.869
 connect with yourself is practicing 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.580
 yoga or good at least trying and so 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.530
 do not be good at this, nothing more 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.530

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.579
 You can also take advantage of the time 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.100
 doing things for what you're good at 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.709
 like crafts or cooking something 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.890
 delicious you sell this and you get a little 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.890
 money
