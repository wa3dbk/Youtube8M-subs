00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
time you use a brush you have much more

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.109 
time you use a brush you have much more
control<00:01:36.750> over<00:01:37.409> your<00:01:37.650> makeup<00:01:37.950> if<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.909> have<00:01:39.090> a

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
control over your makeup if you have a

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.690 
control over your makeup if you have a
big<00:01:39.450> pencil<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.409> you're<00:01:40.890> trying<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.310> apply<00:01:41.549> it

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
big pencil and you're trying to apply it

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.480 
big pencil and you're trying to apply it
now<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.990> really<00:01:43.290> depends<00:01:43.740> how<00:01:43.890> sharp<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.460> is

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
now it really depends how sharp it is

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.240 
now it really depends how sharp it is
how<00:01:45.180> how<00:01:45.720> close<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.380> can<00:01:46.470> get<00:01:46.619> into<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.220> eye

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
how how close you can get into the eye

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.899 
how how close you can get into the eye
and<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:48.299> find<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.750> with<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> brush<00:01:49.549> you<00:01:50.549> really

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
and I find that with a brush you really

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.380 
and I find that with a brush you really
have<00:01:51.060> more<00:01:51.329> control<00:01:52.070> you<00:01:53.070> can<00:01:53.250> apply<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.090> as

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
have more control you can apply it as

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.600 
have more control you can apply it as
light<00:01:54.689> or<00:01:54.960> as<00:01:55.110> dark<00:01:55.380> as<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.590> want<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.189> I'm
