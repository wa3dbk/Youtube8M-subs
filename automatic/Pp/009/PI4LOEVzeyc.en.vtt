when<00:00:00.750> we<00:00:00.870> play<00:00:01.020> harmonics<00:00:01.589> we<00:00:01.920> use<00:00:02.070> the

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
when we play harmonics we use the

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.949 
when we play harmonics we use the
beginning<00:00:02.639> of<00:00:02.730> the<00:00:02.820> overtone<00:00:03.300> series<00:00:03.510> by

beginning of the overtone series by

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:05.960 
beginning of the overtone series by

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
subdividing the vibrating string into

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.110 
subdividing the vibrating string into
equal<00:00:06.359> parts<00:00:07.040> we<00:00:08.040> do<00:00:08.220> this<00:00:08.400> by<00:00:08.610> touching<00:00:09.000> the

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
equal parts we do this by touching the

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.000
