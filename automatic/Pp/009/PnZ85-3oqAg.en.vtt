00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.900
Geoff, and Gavin, and Michael,

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.000
and Ray, and Jack.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:04.820
[Woo!]

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:05.460
Uh, and we are doing

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.640
a Things to Do, uh

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.540
kinda Let's Play style.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.180
This is called Kerplunk.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.760
This is something that somebody and I made –

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.260
Michael: Gavin

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.140
Geoff: – a long, long – Gavin  and I made

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.640
Michael: There you go.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.380
Geoff: – a long, long time ago.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.220
Ray: I made the stairs.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.440
Geoff: I was– he did– I was

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:16.940
trying to make–

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.700
Gavin: I'll take, uh, I had nothing nothing to do with this, but sure I'll take [trails off].

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.200
[Jack laughs.]

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.140
Geoff: What we're doing is, ah

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.080
I– ins– I, while trying to

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.060
make Jenga, I accidentally made Kerplunk.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.080
Do you guys know what Kerplunk is?

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.580
Jack: Yes.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.620
Geoff: It's that Russian game, right.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.820
Michael: No. Geoff, what is it?
Geoff: With the, where you pull the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.320
[Geoff giggles]

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.040
Jack: It's a Russian game?

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.540
Geoff: Yeah, I think so.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.020
Geoff: You pull the sticks out, and then all

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.440
the marbles fall.
Ray: Ah, yeah, Tetris.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.760
Jack: Yeah.
Geoff: So, we've, yeah, Tetris.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.360
Gavin: Kerplunk?

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.280
Geoff: So, we've [laugh] we've made that here.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.600
Everybody come inside

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.600
the playing field.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.440
Okay, so as you can see the floor is soul sand.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.880
Jack: It's so slo-ow.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.740
Geoff: And the top is dirt blocks, right?
Jack: Run!

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.120
Geoff: So what we're gonna do is– on everybody's turn

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.160
we'll go clockwise, starting with Ray. Uh,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.640
everybody gets one turn and they have to

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.520
stand directly under a block and hit it.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.880
And what's either gonna happen is

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.900
sand is gonna fall on you,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.960
gravel is gonna fall on you,

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.920
uh, or there will be a gold block

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.340
of the Tower of Pimps, so

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.660
Ray: I'm guessing sand and gravel are bad.
Michael: Is it good or bad?

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.360
Geoff: Right, it's– it's, if well,

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.260
if the, uh

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.680
if you find the Tower of Pimps, nothing falls, so

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.180
Michael: Oh.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.620
Geoff: When the shit falls on you, you'll

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.180
you'll take a little bit of damage

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.080
And we go in turn, until the

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.420
last person is left alive, and that person wins.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.440
There are, uh, I think

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.500
there's one Tower of Pimps

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.920
and there are two, uh

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.760
rows of sand.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.080
If the sand falls on you, you're out automatically.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.940
Gavin is filming it, he is invisible.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:22.440
Gavin: Yup.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.880
Geoff: Those are our new Minecraft tools

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.540
from the update.
Gavin: You can't see me.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.880
Geoff: Now we're finally doing this, we made this

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.320
we must have made this one two months ago.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.800
Gavin: This was actually featured in a Let's Play

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.200
that happened a long time ago.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.320
Geoff: Yeah.
Jack: Yeah, I remember seeing the thing.
Gavin: We ran

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.900
past it.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.460
Jack: Yeah.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.800
Geoff: Alright, so, Ray goes first.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.080
Ray, pick a block,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.800
stand directly under it.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.300
Michael: And go to hell.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.880
Ray: Uhh...
Geoff: A-and, stand there, take it,

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.900
Ray: This one
Geoff: take it,

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.720
take the fuckin' gubbins.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.420
Ray: Ugh!

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.060
[groans]

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.060
Geoff: Yeah, you got gravel. How much

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.160
health did you take?

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.660
Ray: Half a heart.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.060
Geoff: Half a heart, okay,
Gavin: Ohh, Ray.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.220
Geoff: Now it's Michael's turn.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.480
Gavin: Ray's on his deathbed already.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.020
[Geoff laughs]

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.800
Ray: Do I, uh

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.440
Can I move around? Do I

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.940
have to stand right next to the...
Geoff: Yeah, you can move.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:52.440
Ray: Okay.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.560
Geoff: 'Kay, I'm gonna go with this one.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.660
And, by the way, I did this so long ago,

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.860
Ray: Yeah, Geoff made this, like, months ago.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.900
Geoff: No memory.
Ray: I'm surprised you

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.020
remember what this thing is called.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.700
[snicker]

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.680
Geoff: Oh, I got dirt!

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.000
I forgot: there's dirt sometimes too.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.480
[laughter]
Ray: Wow.
Michael: Oh, yeah, he didn't

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.680
remember at all.
Jack: Alright.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.320
Geoff: Alright.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.820
[Gavin laughs]

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.440
Ray: So, do you like, get a 1-up–

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.280
[groans]
Jack: What did I get–!

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.040
Geoff: Jack got hit with some

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.940
gravel.
Gavin: How much health d'you lose, Jack?

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.160
Jack: Uh, I'm slowly dying.
Michael: Ooo– 
Gavin: Ah!

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.160
Michael: –ohhhhh!
[Gavin laughs]

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.200
Ray: Jack is...
Michael: Jack took heavy damage.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.020
Gavin: Jack forgot to get out.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.780
Jack: I didn't know we were supposed to get out.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.040
Geoff: You– no, you just have to let it bounce you off.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.580
Ray: Uhh...
Jack: [mumbles incoherently] Well, ok.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.960
Geoff: Alright.
Jack: I guess I would've died.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.600
Ray: This one!

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.520
[Ray makes sounds of pain]

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.120
[Gavin laughs again]
Geoff: Alright.
Michael: Ow!

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.720
[Michael ???]

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.720
Michael: Oh, dirt.
Geoff: Oh!

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.580
Michael got dirt.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.200
Michael: Yes.
Geoff: Alright.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.380
Geoff: Geoff's turn.
Ray: So, uh, whoever

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.880
finds the Tower of Pimps, whoever dies

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.360
right? Or whoever wins, right?
Geoff: Oh, I got dirt again!

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.040
Geoff: Nice.
Michael: Whoever is left.
Ray: Yeah.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.820
Jack: Hacks.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.860
Geoff: This is going way too, uh, well for me.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.080
Jack: Ah!
Ray: Yeah, it's like

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.220
made it or something.
[Gavin snickers]

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.720
Geoff: Jack.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.300
Ray: I'm gonna go for the corner here.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.020
Gavin: Haha, what an idiot!

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.540
Ray: –going for the corner...

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.200
Thanks, Gavin.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.360
Gavin: As if it would be in a corner.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.360
Geoff: Michael's turn.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.200
Michael: Ugh!
Geoff: Uh!

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.080
[Michael makes sounds of agony]

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.680
Ray: Uh-oh.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.620
I'll take that out.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.040
Geoff: 'Kay, I'm gonna go.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.000
Jack: I've got, like, half my health.
Michael: No, Geoff, don't!

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.900
Ray: Okay, here comes dirt again.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.020
Jack: Do it.
Geoff: Oh, I got dirt!

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.760
Michael: Geoff!
[everyone laughs]
Michael: You fucking fuck!

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.840
Jack: You hacking bastard.
Michael: Goddamnit.
Geoff: Seriously,

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.780
seriously luck of the try, guys.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:03.560
Jack: Hey, I got dirt!

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.940
Geoff: Hey, Jack got dirt!
Jack: Yaaayy!

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.440
Geoff: Ray's turn.
Ray: Right... over...

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.860
Gavin: I love that it's getting really cramped–
Ray: ...here.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.940
Gavin: –in here.
[Ray makes more noises of pain]

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.640
Geoff: Yeah, it's supposed to.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.780
It's gonna get harder to move around.
Jack: Can you throw

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.040
some more torches or something?

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.600
Gavin: Uh, sure Jack.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.100
Ray: Gavin can you see the top? Like, is it–
Jack: Oh my god!

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.160
Ray: –exposed?
Jack: Ah!

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.460
Geoff: Oh, I took some,
Gavin: Oh, wow!

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.280
Geoff: I took damage off Jack!

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.600
Gavin: Splash damage.
What did you say, uh,

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.440
Ray?
Ray: Do you see, like

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.340
what's above us?

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.220
Gavin: Nah, I'm in the room with you.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.800
Ray: Oh, okay.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.620
[Michael groans]
Gavin: Oh, Michael!
[Geoff groans]

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.000
Geoff: Michael took it hard.
Gavin: Hard in the mouth.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.720
Michael: I took it hard.
Geoff: Alright, I'm gonna go right here.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.320
Geoff: Agh!

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.740
Geoff: Damn.
Michael: Who's got the most health right now?

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.580
Geoff: I'm at two and a half hearts.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.080
Ray: You're at two and a half hearts left?

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.580
Geoff: Yeah.
Ray: I only–

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.100
I only took two and a half hearts of damage.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.600
Goeff: Fuck off.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.280
Michael: Wow, Ray. How many, how many dirt blocks did you get?
Ray: Nine.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.660
Jack: I've got one and a half hearts.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.600
Jack: I'm dead, I'm dead.
Ray: So the sand is just, uh...

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.280
Jack: Here we go.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.960
Jack: Agh, I'm dead.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.720
Ray: Christ.
[everyone groans]
Geoff: That's it for Jack...

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.860
Ray: "Suffocated in a wall."
Michael: His guts, his guts are out.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.240
Geoff: Jack "suffocated in a wall."

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.400
Ray: So, uh.
Michael: Ray, you are next.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.120
Ray: So if you get hit by sand, it's just insta-out.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.040
Geoff: You're just out. Michael: Yeah.
Ray: Okay, cool.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.420
Geoff: [to Jack] Get the fuck out. We'll kill you with shovels. Gavin: Jack's going to build a house.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.560
Michael: Where the fuck is Ray?

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.720
I'm trying to follow him!

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.880
Ray: Oh, sorry, I'm just...

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.760
Ray: This block looks good.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.380
Oh, yeah, very good.
