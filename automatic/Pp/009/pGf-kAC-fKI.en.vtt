 to bag 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.410
 you do this exercise in your 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:50.059
 let's go wardrobe you go

 Aquino better life already must have repaired

 that the accessories have been growing ever 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.980

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.320
 maxi necklace max earrings and the same 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.550
 happened with the bags we have two 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.040
 different sizes 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.650
 the big good and a little good I'm going 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.440
 showing off the big bags or is 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.810
 The idea of ​​this bag is that you take 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.549
 once with only one opening and place 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.159
 all your belongings here in a 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.259
 Practical bag you do not need a 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.729
 complement an auxiliary bag for 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.689
 carry everything you need into your 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:26.479
 working day over colors 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:29.420
 that tone is big or good and old 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.880
 wine is also high, it comes from the 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.950
 autumn winter continues this summer 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.540
 still going on another winter 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.549
 So it means a lot of color. 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.560
 interesting for you to actually invest 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.630
 because it will last long in your closet 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.149
 another very striking tone in this 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.130
 collection is the royal blue that already brings a 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.619
 colored very strong 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.270
 already fits the look a lot 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.310
 interesting to talk about 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.530
 colors brought chose a bag for 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.539
 athens the closet they are the facility 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.310
 to make combinations 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.860
 then the tone I showed first 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.920
 that's the wine it if you stop it's a 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.560
 very easy tone it appears for example the 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.430
 enamel and see the example of my appear 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.470
 lipsticks 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.240
 so you can wear a jeans one 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.520
 t-shirt one top 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.560
 anka and play that bag make a link from 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.560
 body with enamel with makeup or 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.870
 very easy to combine since 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.170
 this royal blue for example or a 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.720
 red the very strong green a blue 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.510
 so more oil it will always 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.520
 lead to a combination in which the 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.150
 is the most important point of the 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.010
 look 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.840
 so yes of course you will use the 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.270
 our royal is easy to use so it is 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.640
 easy but surely a neutron that 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.590
 You clean with makeup stays much longer. 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.080
 versatile in your daily life 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.950
 Another important point regarding the 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.800
 size 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.140
 if you look at all your tv's that 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.880
 have bags all are large but not 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.880
 necessarily have the same size 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.500
 for example what a big purse that 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.790
 is compatible with its size not 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.680
 I'm too tall 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.080
 this is an example you can 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.810
 to note that compared to my 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.220
 size it is not overdone then 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.470
 a bag was able to carry all 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.110
 my belongings and does not appear more than 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.610
 I will now show you a bag that 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.610
 she gets too big for me 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.780
 basically take a look at the 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.970
 size of my skirt or half of the 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.580
 my legs the size of the bag 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.500
 The width is also very wide or 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.200
 my height to my structure 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.910
 body is too big for what woman is 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.610
 this bag will work out more 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.620
 a woman one meter and 70 or another 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.390
 woman with a larger structure and will 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.970
 be compatible with this bag as 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.580
 That beige was for me, too. 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.220
 texture the fringes are very strong 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.140
 both in shoes and rock bags 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.780
 With our sweet wine you see that it is 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.940
 trend will appear in all 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.580
 is that you have models with 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.170
 fringe that we can think so good 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.360
 but it's not every place I want with 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.580
 fringe is not always going to work very well 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.590
 for us to be afraid of existing more 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.670
 these models they have a good solution 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:15.030
 that the fringes are in you can use a 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:18.489
 fringe or without you ends up having two 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.470
 bags in one this looks really cool 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.659
 we are thinking of decorating a model of 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.270
 stock exchange censorship are very interesting 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:27.379
 because they are work done in the 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.690
 own leather 

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:32.150
 so you have a different touch on 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.190
 look at the accessory but at the same time is 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.430
 kept the color is an easy thing to 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:40.580
 how to start them here by this 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:44.060
 laser cut effect can not repair 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.310
 that has a drawing from afar we do not 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.970
 necessarily see which drawing is 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.860
 This one comes close to the person's look at 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.840
 We realize that you have this job. 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.539
 another texture that I can highlight that 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.659
 worth investing is very timeless is the 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:01.310
 strap of leather straps that this 3 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:03.919
 that we can see here 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.349
 Look, it's just a caramel purse that 's a 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.240
 neutral tone super easy to match 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:11.479
 she has a bit of a fee but what 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.849
 more shows is what most increase this 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:14.810
 model 3 and that in this case he 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:16.879
 diagonal 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.199
 here is another example that the 13th and 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:19.940
 vertically 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:23.270
 so look how much the possibilities 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.969
 they exist in the same texture here below 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:29.569
 is 13 and that already mix colors then the 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:31.930
 her basic bag is a tone and here comes the 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:34.400
 grow being worked in a way 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.669
 contrasting style that also adorns 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.080
 make it difficult to match the look 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:41.330
 with this accessory 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.310
 another way of exploring textures 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.500
 so in this three and it is precisely 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:49.240
 mixing the materials does not just look 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.539
 example is a leather he is 1 371 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.919
 metallized 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:55.009
 So here we have it as if it were a 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:56.870
 Old silver mixed with black is what 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:59.419
 we do a combination of look with 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:02.629
 a bag of this type for several sports 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:05.479
 black items in our look and the color goes 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:08.740
 I appear in this metallic materials 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:08.740
 do not get too exaggerated 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:16.330
 the last very important texture are 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:21.039
 the animals have no zebra 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:24.039
 snake looks only here is one at 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:26.610
 even goey with more bug cover on 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:29.139
 top mixed with smooth leather 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.330
 I would like to talk a bit more about the 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:34.539
 we see all our 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:36.370
 also great in counterpoint to this we 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:40.089
 we have the very small pockets are the 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:42.400
 wallets bags yesterday versions as well 

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:45.219
 little ones look like an animal mimicking 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.319
 a cow print 

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:49.930
 only it's a very small one that you 

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:53.439
 carry on the hand really here is already a 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:55.479
 another version that is more compact but she 

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:57.969
 still a small bag that you carry 

00:06:55.479 --> 00:07:00.819
 on the hand or on the shoulder that we have 

00:06:57.969 --> 00:07:03.370
 lynx print and finally a 

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:05.529
 and you can play with the 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.699
 Black blend colors with white blend 

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:08.469
 shades of brown 

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:10.599
 we see that despite being a stamp 

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:12.219
 they are always in tones 

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:14.860
 neutrals that make it much easier 

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:17.259
 combination on the look denies not hoping 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.419
 you can take advantage of your closet or 

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:21.959
 already buy now in the promotions that will 

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:25.389
 continue in the next winter collection 

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:28.330
 bags great colors like blue wine 

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:30.399
 royal green and yellow more ocher and 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:33.009
 also small wallet type wallets of 

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:35.229
 hand you can highlight the handle and use 

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:38.069
 both on the shoulder and on the hand is this 

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:38.069
 I hope you enjoy
