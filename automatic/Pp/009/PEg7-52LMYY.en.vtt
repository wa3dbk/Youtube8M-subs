00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.090
 good to all I am art and we are here 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.270
 again in minecraft and in the video of 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:13.050
 Today I'm going to teach you how to build a shovel 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:15.240
 loader and if I searched for it and it's called 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.470
 so I had no idea what his name was 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.570
 in this type of excavator and 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.400
 I just call it the whole excavator and 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.949
 it turns out that yes it's called shovel 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.680
 loaner okay there we go 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.440
 first of all we'll start with the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.779
 wheels is very very simple simply 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.780
 we have to place them on the ground in 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.460
 this case a here and another here with one of 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.309
 separation and then with two separation 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.079
 the front we will place a button on 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.300
 the medium of each of them for 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.579
 simulate the tires in this way and 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.889
 we will have the wheels to do the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.409
 chassis we will use the four hoppers and 

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:51.870
 the two slaps so just 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:53.670
 We put the slaps between each of 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.769
 the front wheel parts or 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.719
 back and for the hoppers we are going to 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.399
 use a help block in my case 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.170
 a block of grass that is here then 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.089
 easy to get and we put with shift 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.100
 in this way it is not necessary the 6 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.470
 but more than anything to catch the practice 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.729
 no and now we remove these blocks and 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.920
 now yes that is necessary 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.530
 using the shift is worth the shift is 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.090
 to crouch we give to the walls of 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.950
 these other hoppers in this way 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.020
 we get them to stay connected 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.180
 in this way appearing as a 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.740
 pipe for a heavy machinery yo 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.640
 I think the truth is a pretty touch 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.250
 important in this construction 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.770
 the body is probably the most 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.440
 simple is worth just place here 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.720
 these play and yellow blocks are worth 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.700
 There are 7 of them in total and we will need 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.800
 two buttons we make it reaches the 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.550
 front and then we will place 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.820
 right here a few buttons one here and another 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.440
 here to decorate a little bit of this and 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.509
 that we do not stay so simple 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.060
 we will place here the motor plate that 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.100
 it will be a steel pressure plate in the 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.399
 back we will place on one side 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.320
 a flower pot and in the other a lever 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.810
 insured that the lever indicates 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.300
 backwards since it refers that is the 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.070
 radio antenna once we have this 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.280
 we can also use the stairs 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.980
 of quartz to place here back like this and 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.590
 then on the sides we will place some 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.540
 anvils like this we make sure that no 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.459
 we put them like this you have to put the well 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.959
 so it looks good and once we have 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.209
 all this we put the final touch 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.910
 what would be the registration of the machinery 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:31.070
 we will simply place it in this way 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.500
 the driver's cabin is also 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.720
 very simple we will use two blocks of 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.630
 black tinted glass to place here 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.720
 our cabin and then on top of these 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.210
 we will place two white folders and now 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.190
 on the sides we will place the four 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:50.290
 glass 20 blacks also in this way 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.050
 and to finish our construction 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.630
 let's put it to the front let's go 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.300
 to place here a stone fence and 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.340
 here another one more then here we will need 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.100
 also again a few blocks of help 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.680
 I will place here because these are these pieces of 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.530
 of grass and now on top of them 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.300
 we will place some strong and berries or as 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.580
 you want to call him and that I call them like that 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.770
 once this is done we are going to place 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.480
 here another help block another block of 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.100
 help and another help block you can 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.050
 do without but it's more complicated worth 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.630
 we will place right in the central part 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.640
 here some stairs and here we go to 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.290
 place others looking towards there to 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.080
 that are placed in this way and here 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.060
 others in reverse once this is done 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.310
 we remove the blocks and we will have the 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.250
 shovel of our heavy machinery well 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.290
 nothing here you have it now I leave you a 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.610
 small mount I'm worth so that what 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.610
 see and come back 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.250
 and 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.500
 a building 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.530
 well nothing this has been all for this 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:14.629
 tutorial I hope you liked the 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.669
 truth is that it is a kind of detail 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.889
 not pretty enough to place in zones 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.600
 under construction as you know I have done 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.000
 and some more vehicles of this style 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.280
 you will have the creator down in the 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.870
 description so nothing remembers that 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.190
 you can give me like to subscribe if 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.610
 still you are and share it with your 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.650
 friends 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:35.139
 this has been graft art and we will become 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.139
 to see before what you think
