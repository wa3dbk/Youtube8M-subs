that<00:05:05.080> kind<00:05:05.290> of<00:05:05.320> stuff<00:05:05.380> you<00:05:05.950> list<00:05:06.190> out<00:05:06.340> your

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
expenses for the bike you find out what

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.380 
expenses for the bike you find out what
proportion<00:05:09.010> of<00:05:09.220> the<00:05:09.370> bike<00:05:09.550> was<00:05:09.730> actually<00:05:10.150> used

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
proportion of the bike was actually used

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.780 
proportion of the bike was actually used
for<00:05:10.990> business<00:05:11.620> and<00:05:11.890> then<00:05:12.190> you<00:05:12.310> can<00:05:12.460> expense

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
that as well so there's a lack of

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.350 
that as well so there's a lack of

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
an example let's say that these are my

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.290 
an example let's say that these are my
monthly<00:05:38.229> bills<00:05:38.440> and<00:05:38.860> I<00:05:39.100> owe<00:05:39.130> twelve<00:05:40.120> hundred

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
monthly bills and I owe twelve hundred

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.000 
monthly bills and I owe twelve hundred
dollars<00:05:40.750> every<00:05:40.900> single<00:05:41.290> month<00:05:41.470> that<00:05:41.770> would<00:05:41.890> be

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
dollars every single month that would be

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.340 
dollars every single month that would be
an<00:05:42.220> annual<00:05:42.790> expense<00:05:43.180> of<00:05:43.390> fourteen<00:05:43.930> thousand

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 
an annual expense of fourteen thousand

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:45.960 
an annual expense of fourteen thousand
four<00:05:44.500> hundred<00:05:44.530> dollars<00:05:44.830> so<00:05:45.460> first<00:05:45.700> of<00:05:45.850> all<00:05:45.910> we

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
four hundred dollars so first of all we

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.270 
four hundred dollars so first of all we
figure<00:05:46.360> out<00:05:46.479> how<00:05:46.660> many<00:05:46.720> hours<00:05:47.050> per<00:05:47.650> day<00:05:47.680> are<00:05:48.160> we

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
figure out how many hours per day are we

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.640 
figure out how many hours per day are we
actually<00:05:48.460> in<00:05:48.880> the<00:05:49.060> home<00:05:49.210> office<00:05:49.390> so<00:05:50.200> for<00:05:50.470> me

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
actually in the home office so for me

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.060 
actually in the home office so for me

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
it's eight hours and i work six days a

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.770 
it's eight hours and i work six days a
week<00:05:54.310> out<00:05:54.700> of<00:05:54.850> the<00:05:54.910> house<00:05:55.060> and<00:05:55.330> lastly<00:05:55.660> we

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
week out of the house and lastly we

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.300 
week out of the house and lastly we
figure<00:05:56.050> out<00:05:56.169> this<00:05:56.320> space<00:05:56.590> and<00:05:56.890> there's<00:05:57.040> two

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
figure out this space and there's two

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.250 
figure out this space and there's two
ways<00:05:57.460> to<00:05:57.520> do<00:05:57.820> this<00:05:57.850> so<00:05:58.390> the<00:05:58.479> first<00:05:58.750> way<00:05:58.930> is<00:05:58.960> to

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
ways to do this so the first way is to

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.290 
ways to do this so the first way is to
actually<00:05:59.410> figure<00:05:59.890> out<00:06:00.010> room<00:06:00.430> by<00:06:00.669> room<00:06:00.700> let's

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
actually figure out room by room let's

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.990 
actually figure out room by room let's
say<00:06:01.450> I<00:06:01.479> have<00:06:01.600> four<00:06:02.200> fairly<00:06:02.890> equally<00:06:03.430> spaced

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
say I have four fairly equally spaced

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.420 
say I have four fairly equally spaced
rooms<00:06:04.510> in<00:06:04.690> the<00:06:04.750> house<00:06:04.930> and<00:06:05.229> my<00:06:05.440> office<00:06:05.950> is<00:06:06.190> one

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
rooms in the house and my office is one

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.060 
rooms in the house and my office is one
of<00:06:06.580> them<00:06:06.729> then<00:06:07.150> it<00:06:07.270> would<00:06:07.390> be<00:06:07.570> one<00:06:08.169> room<00:06:08.500> out<00:06:08.860> of

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
of them then it would be one room out of

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.700 
of them then it would be one room out of
all<00:06:09.250> four<00:06:09.280> rooms<00:06:09.940> in<00:06:10.120> the<00:06:10.210> house<00:06:10.390> or<00:06:10.720> I<00:06:11.260> could

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
all four rooms in the house or I could

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.530 
all four rooms in the house or I could
actually<00:06:11.860> use<00:06:12.070> the<00:06:12.310> square<00:06:12.520> footage<00:06:12.850> so<00:06:13.270> let's

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.540 
actually use the square footage so let's

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.200 
actually use the square footage so let's
say<00:06:13.660> that<00:06:13.840> my<00:06:13.960> room<00:06:14.169> was<00:06:14.280> 200<00:06:15.280> square<00:06:15.490> feet<00:06:15.580> out

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
say that my room was 200 square feet out

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.540 
say that my room was 200 square feet out
of<00:06:16.270> my<00:06:16.780> place<00:06:17.050> which<00:06:17.470> is<00:06:17.680> a<00:06:17.830> thousand<00:06:18.310> square

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
of my place which is a thousand square

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.790 
of my place which is a thousand square
feet<00:06:18.790> then<00:06:19.419> that<00:06:19.630> would<00:06:19.660> mean<00:06:19.990> that<00:06:20.200> I<00:06:20.590> would

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
feet then that would mean that I would

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.360 
feet then that would mean that I would
have<00:06:21.160> 200<00:06:22.120> square<00:06:22.330> feet<00:06:22.419> over<00:06:23.380> a<00:06:23.650> thousand

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
have 200 square feet over a thousand

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.370 
have 200 square feet over a thousand
square<00:06:24.580> feet<00:06:24.820> this<00:06:25.240> is<00:06:25.450> twenty-five<00:06:26.050> percent

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380 
square feet this is twenty-five percent

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.400 
square feet this is twenty-five percent
and<00:06:26.950> this<00:06:27.400> is<00:06:27.729> twenty<00:06:28.180> percent<00:06:28.510> so<00:06:29.020> I'm<00:06:29.260> going

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:29.410 
and this is twenty percent so I'm going

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.110 
and this is twenty percent so I'm going
to<00:06:29.440> choose<00:06:29.710> this<00:06:29.979> method<00:06:30.220> to<00:06:30.669> actually

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 
to choose this method to actually

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.120 
to choose this method to actually
calculate<00:06:31.300> out<00:06:31.690> my<00:06:31.810> home<00:06:32.020> office<00:06:32.169> expense<00:06:32.770> my

annual total housing costs are 14,400 I

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.570 
annual total housing costs are 14,400 I
multiply<00:06:37.180> them<00:06:37.390> by<00:06:37.419> eight<00:06:38.020> over<00:06:38.080> 24<00:06:38.919> I'm<00:06:39.190> also

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
multiply them by eight over 24 I'm also

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.159

fly<00:06:39.669> them<00:06:39.849> by<00:06:39.970> six<00:06:40.270> over<00:06:40.509> seven<00:06:40.870> and<00:06:41.020> then<00:06:41.110> I

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:41.169 
fly them by six over seven and then I

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:43.140 
fly them by six over seven and then I
multiply<00:06:41.379> them<00:06:41.830> by<00:06:41.860> 1<00:06:42.159> over<00:06:42.280> 4<00:06:42.580> which<00:06:42.759> is<00:06:42.939> out

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150 
multiply them by 1 over 4 which is out

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.600 
multiply them by 1 over 4 which is out
of<00:06:43.210> all<00:06:43.479> of<00:06:43.509> that<00:06:43.780> I<00:06:44.020> can<00:06:44.080> expense<00:06:44.680> a<00:06:44.949> thousand

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.610 
of all of that I can expense a thousand

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.209 
of all of that I can expense a thousand
and<00:06:45.699> twenty<00:06:45.909> eight<00:06:46.180> dollars<00:06:46.210> off<00:06:46.990> my<00:06:47.680> tax<00:06:47.949> bill
