 duck-brain cook who can not move the hand 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.150
 can recover more quickly as 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.430
 but you can also stimulate frontal zones for example pay in modify 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.790
 the ability of t &amp; d people make decisions to do what in the 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:18.789
 decisions are more generous more altruistic 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:20.970
 for what 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.840
 sufferers who have personality disorders c with personalities 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.069
 sociopaths 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:31.739
 what they start to have more empathy in the situation 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.190
 I want to extend my prayers and for example the psc has repercussions for

 Alicia Meza Addictions Nicotine to Cocaine Food Addiction 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:47.750
 You can modify the reward circuits so that they can read them 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.470
 excessive activity that in those addicted time circuits is reduced 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.580
 seal the idea is that cesc is a fundamental principle of judges modify joaquin 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.750
 it's a circuit 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.670
 and have an impact 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.830
 behavioral on your normal note with sick then 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.360
 the limit is to identify the circuit at a time when it identifies the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.220
 circuit 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.220
 you can modify in the right direction

 three hundred years 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.200
 the great scientist isaac 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.980
 the next question was asked 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.220
 they said I would like to penetrate the mystery to know 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.310
 as from a bitch

 efe iran 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.159
 visual or the universe of what I have outside 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.080
 it can come to an end 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.400
 in what he called 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.400
 the glory of colors 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.090
 we know something more haha ​​since then 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.090
 of this mystery 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.630
 melma we know percent in recent years we have learned a lot about about 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.570
 the nervous system on general neuroscience 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.249
 and about predicament and perceptions 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:17.119
 I believe that there are a number of things that we have learned that are the ones that are 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:19.829
 remarkable interesting edition 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.749
 for example 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:25.669
 we know that the nervous system generates 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:26.649
 for one hundrerd 

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:28.799
 hypothesis in it 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:34.619
 expectations is a machine after creating a high expectation 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:36.729
 of reality 

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:41.179
 and that expectation is then contrasted with those with external reality 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:44.230
 and can o'brien give place 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.610
 to surprise and alluded to the loyalty that welcomes to pleasure 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:53.519
 can be consistent in this sense with what we found boconó 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.439
 percent depending on what we find and the period 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:02:59.629
 between the 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:03.709
 the expectation and the external reality then it gives rise to an aspect to 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.479
 timely requests 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:06.349
 percent 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.189
 but the idea is of what we see 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.659
 for example that 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.819
 that we know what we look for is that 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.510
 that is not simply that the nervous system is a receiver of information 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.650
 that comes from outside 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.679
 but really reality scout 

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:26.429
 that are then contrasted with the external reality 

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:28.569
 so when 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.699
 when we reproach the brain 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:33.089
 what 

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:35.169
 if he undertakes 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:37.029
 I doubt he believes 

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:39.279
 and not what is really 

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:43.690
 something truly deceased is exactly what they do is extraordinary 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.830
 but thanks to that we will continue to function as they hear it 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:51.359
 pss angel hands 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:56.620
 we can thanks to it is to generate art we can rete to have the 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:04:01.039
 creativity of new ideas we can see that I will be changing our reality 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:05.730
 environment to adapt it to the social needs that are not out there 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:07.499
 it's a fabrication 

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:10.499
 It is a variant of the reguerón
