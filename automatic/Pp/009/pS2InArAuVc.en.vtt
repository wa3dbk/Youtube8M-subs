what<00:00:30.369> is<00:00:30.550> a<00:00:30.579> receiver<00:00:30.999> dryer<00:00:31.439> what<00:00:32.439> does<00:00:32.529> it<00:00:32.650> do

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
what is a receiver dryer what does it do

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.790 
what is a receiver dryer what does it do
how<00:00:33.370> does<00:00:33.579> it<00:00:33.700> function<00:00:34.500> along<00:00:35.500> with

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
how does it function along with

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.660 
how does it function along with
questions<00:00:36.399> from<00:00:36.640> consumers<00:00:37.590> particularly

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
questions from consumers particularly

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.580 
questions from consumers particularly
why<00:00:39.670> do<00:00:39.730> I<00:00:39.910> have<00:00:40.210> to<00:00:40.390> get<00:00:40.600> a<00:00:40.809> receiver<00:00:41.230> dryer

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
why do I have to get a receiver dryer

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.459 
why do I have to get a receiver dryer
replaced<00:00:42.219> when<00:00:42.730> I<00:00:42.789> get<00:00:43.300> service<00:00:43.750> done<00:00:44.140> to<00:00:44.320> my

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
replaced when I get service done to my

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:47.580 
replaced when I get service done to my
AC<00:00:44.680> system<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:46.390> that's<00:00:47.140> what<00:00:47.350> we're<00:00:47.440> going<00:00:47.559> to

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
AC system so that's what we're going to

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.520 
AC system so that's what we're going to
talk<00:00:47.800> about<00:00:47.920> today<00:00:48.280> in<00:00:48.519> this<00:00:48.640> video<00:00:48.820> and<00:00:49.530> here

talk about today in this video and here
I<00:00:50.559> have<00:00:51.100> three<00:00:52.090> different<00:00:52.300> receiver<00:00:52.809> dryers<00:00:53.170> I

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
I have three different receiver dryers I

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.060 
I have three different receiver dryers I
have<00:00:54.129> two<00:00:54.429> standalone<00:00:55.120> dryers<00:00:55.589> over<00:00:56.589> here<00:00:56.890> and

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
have two standalone dryers over here and

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.299 
have two standalone dryers over here and
I<00:00:57.579> have<00:00:57.609> one<00:00:58.269> that's<00:00:58.539> integrated<00:00:59.350> into<00:01:00.280> a

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
I have one that's integrated into a

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.500 
I have one that's integrated into a
condenser<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:02.850> first<00:01:03.850> we'll<00:01:04.089> just<00:01:04.300> take<00:01:04.480> a

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
condenser so first we'll just take a

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.490 
condenser so first we'll just take a
look<00:01:04.809> at<00:01:04.930> one<00:01:05.170> and<00:01:05.490> see<00:01:06.490> what<00:01:06.909> it<00:01:07.030> is<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:08.200> this

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
look at one and see what it is so this

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.380 
look at one and see what it is so this
star<00:01:08.829> I<00:01:09.189> have<00:01:09.280> these<00:01:09.549> two<00:01:09.759> are<00:01:09.909> cutaway

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
star I have these two are cutaway

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.120 
star I have these two are cutaway
receiver<00:01:10.900> dryers<00:01:11.170> and

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.070 

that's<00:01:15.790> it<00:01:16.000> it's<00:01:16.840> an<00:01:16.930> empty<00:01:17.110> can<00:01:18.600> all<00:01:19.600> that<00:01:19.990> the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
that's it it's an empty can all that the

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.160 
that's it it's an empty can all that the
receiver<00:01:20.470> dryer<00:01:20.860> does<00:01:21.250> is<00:01:21.549> two<00:01:21.790> things<00:01:22.170> which

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
receiver dryer does is two things which

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.260 
receiver dryer does is two things which
is<00:01:23.380> what<00:01:23.560> it's<00:01:23.710> named<00:01:23.950> for<00:01:24.310> receiving<00:01:24.850> and

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
is what it's named for receiving and

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.399 
is what it's named for receiving and
drying<00:01:25.600> so<00:01:26.560> how<00:01:26.920> it<00:01:27.130> functions<00:01:27.610> is

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
drying so how it functions is

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.980 
drying so how it functions is
refrigerant<00:01:29.409> flows<00:01:29.860> from<00:01:30.399> the<00:01:30.520> condenser

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
refrigerant flows from the condenser

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.870 
refrigerant flows from the condenser
into<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.170> receiver<00:01:32.560> dryer<00:01:32.979> in<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.549> liquid

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
into the receiver dryer in the liquid

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.639 
into the receiver dryer in the liquid
form<00:01:34.119> so<00:01:35.080> it<00:01:35.350> comes<00:01:35.619> in<00:01:36.009> on<00:01:36.700> one<00:01:37.030> port<00:01:37.390> and<00:01:37.649> it

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
form so it comes in on one port and it

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:41.219 
form so it comes in on one port and it
will<00:01:38.740> go<00:01:38.920> through<00:01:39.310> these<00:01:39.940> filter<00:01:40.570> screens<00:01:40.930> and

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
will go through these filter screens and

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.330 
will go through these filter screens and
it<00:01:41.799> will<00:01:41.979> fill<00:01:42.280> up<00:01:42.490> about<00:01:42.670> half<00:01:43.539> of<00:01:43.720> the<00:01:43.869> can

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
it will fill up about half of the can

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.450 
it will fill up about half of the can
with<00:01:45.340> liquid<00:01:45.729> refrigerant<00:01:46.000> and<00:01:46.570> then<00:01:47.470> it<00:01:48.220> goes

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
with liquid refrigerant and then it goes

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.779 
with liquid refrigerant and then it goes
back<00:01:48.729> up<00:01:49.030> through<00:01:49.479> this<00:01:49.630> filter<00:01:49.990> screen

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
back up through this filter screen

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.590 
back up through this filter screen
through<00:01:51.789> the<00:01:51.850> tube<00:01:52.179> and<00:01:52.539> out<00:01:53.440> this<00:01:53.920> line<00:01:54.280> on<00:01:54.610> to

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
through the tube and out this line on to

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.510 
through the tube and out this line on to
the<00:01:55.960> rest<00:01:56.140> of<00:01:56.259> the<00:01:56.350> system<00:01:56.770> and<00:01:59.100> so<00:02:00.100> that's<00:02:00.340> the

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
the rest of the system and so that's the

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.730 
the rest of the system and so that's the
receiver<00:02:00.909> function<00:02:01.479> of<00:02:01.630> it<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:02.380> dryer

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
receiver function of it the dryer

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:10.109 
receiver function of it the dryer
function<00:02:03.429> comes<00:02:03.789> from

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.020 

you

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.130 

the<00:02:13.600> bag<00:02:13.870> of<00:02:14.080> desiccant<00:02:14.740> that's<00:02:15.520> in<00:02:15.910> here<00:02:16.600> now

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
the bag of desiccant that's in here now

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.290 
the bag of desiccant that's in here now
I've<00:02:17.320> taken<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.830> desiccant<00:02:18.310> out<00:02:18.520> of<00:02:18.820> this<00:02:19.000> one

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
I've taken the desiccant out of this one

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.700 
I've taken the desiccant out of this one
and<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.630> put<00:02:19.810> it<00:02:19.930> in<00:02:20.020> the<00:02:20.110> bag<00:02:20.320> which<00:02:20.500> I'm<00:02:20.620> going

to show you in a second but on this
dryer<00:02:23.220> I've<00:02:24.220> left<00:02:24.460> it<00:02:24.640> intact<00:02:25.030> so<00:02:25.660> this<00:02:26.440> is

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
dryer I've left it intact so this is

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.410 
dryer I've left it intact so this is
what<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:26.890> desiccant<00:02:27.310> bag<00:02:27.550> looks<00:02:27.850> like<00:02:28.090> and

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
what the desiccant bag looks like and

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.750 
what the desiccant bag looks like and
you<00:02:28.900> can<00:02:29.080> see<00:02:29.290> it's<00:02:29.440> a<00:02:29.740> little<00:02:30.370> bit<00:02:30.490> black

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
you can see it's a little bit black

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.790 
you can see it's a little bit black
there<00:02:31.060> from<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.420> refrigerant<00:02:31.990> flowing<00:02:32.530> down

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
there from the refrigerant flowing down

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.730 
there from the refrigerant flowing down
through<00:02:33.210> through<00:02:34.210> the<00:02:34.330> desiccant<00:02:34.780> bag<00:02:35.080> before

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
through through the desiccant bag before

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.570 
through through the desiccant bag before
it<00:02:36.100> sits<00:02:36.550> in<00:02:36.820> the<00:02:37.660> bottom<00:02:37.840> of<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.260> can<00:02:38.580> then

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
it sits in the bottom of the can then

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.240 
it sits in the bottom of the can then
gets<00:02:39.790> sucked<00:02:40.060> up<00:02:40.210> the<00:02:40.270> tube<00:02:40.630> and<00:02:40.870> go<00:02:41.050> on<00:02:41.260> so

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
gets sucked up the tube and go on so

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.060 
gets sucked up the tube and go on so
what<00:02:42.640> does<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.240> desiccant<00:02:43.720> do<00:02:43.990> well<00:02:44.710> this<00:02:44.860> is

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
what does the desiccant do well this is

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.160 
what does the desiccant do well this is
where<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.370> question<00:02:45.520> that<00:02:46.360> consumers<00:02:46.990> ask

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
where the question that consumers ask

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.350 
where the question that consumers ask
about<00:02:47.530> why<00:02:47.830> do<00:02:47.890> I<00:02:48.160> have<00:02:48.460> to<00:02:48.670> have<00:02:48.850> a<00:02:49.120> new

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
about why do I have to have a new

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.330 
about why do I have to have a new
receiver<00:02:49.690> dryer<00:02:50.140> installed<00:02:50.830> when<00:02:51.070> I<00:02:51.130> have

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
receiver dryer installed when I have

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.640 
receiver dryer installed when I have
service<00:02:51.730> done<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.660> reason<00:02:53.050> is<00:02:53.200> because<00:02:53.350> of

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
service done the reason is because of

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.710 
service done the reason is because of
this<00:02:53.740> desiccant<00:02:54.340> and<00:02:54.520> this<00:02:55.120> is<00:02:55.270> the<00:02:55.390> dryer

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
this desiccant and this is the dryer

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.220 
this desiccant and this is the dryer
function<00:02:56.350> of<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.680> receiver<00:02:57.040> dryer<00:02:58.110> what<00:02:59.110> it

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
function of the receiver dryer what it

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.280 
function of the receiver dryer what it
does<00:02:59.440> is<00:02:59.740> when<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:01.000> system<00:03:01.690> is<00:03:01.840> first

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
does is when the system is first

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.420 
does is when the system is first
assembled<00:03:03.070> and<00:03:03.220> first<00:03:03.520> installed<00:03:05.160> you<00:03:06.160> want

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
assembled and first installed you want

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.490 
assembled and first installed you want
to<00:03:06.550> make<00:03:06.730> sure<00:03:06.760> that<00:03:07.210> you<00:03:07.330> have<00:03:07.600> no<00:03:07.900> moisture

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
to make sure that you have no moisture

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.220 
to make sure that you have no moisture
in<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.710> system<00:03:09.000> but<00:03:10.000> there's<00:03:10.600> always<00:03:10.930> going

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
in the system but there's always going

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.280 
in the system but there's always going
to<00:03:11.290> be<00:03:11.380> that<00:03:11.650> tiny<00:03:12.040> tiny<00:03:12.460> little<00:03:12.610> amount<00:03:13.290> the

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
to be that tiny tiny little amount the

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.710 
to be that tiny tiny little amount the
problem<00:03:14.890> is<00:03:15.100> that<00:03:15.460> if<00:03:15.610> any<00:03:15.880> moisture<00:03:16.480> or<00:03:16.690> water

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
problem is that if any moisture or water

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.770 
problem is that if any moisture or water
is<00:03:17.350> in<00:03:18.130> the<00:03:18.250> system<00:03:18.489> it's<00:03:19.300> going<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.570> combine

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
is in the system it's going to combine

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.840 
is in the system it's going to combine
with<00:03:20.050> the<00:03:20.410> refrigerant<00:03:21.070> and<00:03:21.340> it's<00:03:21.640> going<00:03:21.790> to

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
with the refrigerant and it's going to

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.479 
with the refrigerant and it's going to
form<00:03:22.150> a<00:03:22.270> caustic<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:22.989> then<00:03:23.620> as<00:03:23.830> that<00:03:24.100> flows

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
form a caustic and then as that flows

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.340 
form a caustic and then as that flows
through<00:03:24.520> the<00:03:24.880> system<00:03:25.120> it's<00:03:25.570> going<00:03:25.810> to<00:03:25.870> damage

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
through the system it's going to damage

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.620 
through the system it's going to damage
a<00:03:26.500> lot<00:03:26.620> of<00:03:26.770> parts<00:03:27.130> we<00:03:27.820> don't<00:03:28.120> want<00:03:28.300> that<00:03:28.450> to

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
a lot of parts we don't want that to

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.560 
a lot of parts we don't want that to
happen<00:03:28.860> so<00:03:29.860> that's<00:03:30.430> what<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:31.060> job<00:03:31.300> of<00:03:31.510> the

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
happen so that's what the job of the

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.660 
happen so that's what the job of the
desiccant<00:03:32.080> is<00:03:32.260> is<00:03:32.500> to<00:03:32.739> absorb<00:03:33.160> any<00:03:33.459> moisture

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
desiccant is is to absorb any moisture

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.630 
desiccant is is to absorb any moisture
that's<00:03:34.060> in<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.239> system<00:03:34.650> so<00:03:35.650> what's<00:03:36.459> inside

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
that's in the system so what's inside

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.330 
that's in the system so what's inside
this<00:03:37.060> little<00:03:37.390> pouch<00:03:37.690> here<00:03:37.800> is<00:03:38.800> the<00:03:39.040> actual

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
this little pouch here is the actual

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.240 
this little pouch here is the actual
desiccant<00:03:40.120> beads<00:03:40.390> themselves<00:03:41.230> which<00:03:42.040> I've

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
desiccant beads themselves which I've

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.910 
desiccant beads themselves which I've
put<00:03:42.550> in<00:03:42.670> this<00:03:43.170> plastic<00:03:44.170> bag<00:03:44.440> so<00:03:44.769> we<00:03:44.890> can

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
put in this plastic bag so we can

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.640 
put in this plastic bag so we can
actually<00:03:45.400> see<00:03:45.640> them<00:03:45.880> and<00:03:46.140> here<00:03:47.140> are<00:03:47.380> the

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
actually see them and here are the

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.240 
actually see them and here are the
little<00:03:47.860> desiccant<00:03:48.610> beads<00:03:49.650> okay<00:03:50.650> so<00:03:50.709> we<00:03:51.100> have

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
little desiccant beads okay so we have

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.220 
little desiccant beads okay so we have
the<00:03:51.400> three<00:03:51.640> receiver<00:03:52.000> dryers<00:03:52.390> the<00:03:52.989> two

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
the three receiver dryers the two

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.710 
the three receiver dryers the two
stand-alones<00:03:53.890> and<00:03:54.190> this<00:03:54.940> one<00:03:55.120> here<00:03:55.420> is<00:03:55.570> an

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
stand-alones and this one here is an

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.110 
stand-alones and this one here is an
integrated<00:03:56.290> receiver<00:03:56.560> dryer<00:03:56.980> where<00:03:57.910> the

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
integrated receiver dryer where the

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.259 
integrated receiver dryer where the
dryer<00:03:58.480> is<00:03:58.780> actually<00:03:59.350> part<00:03:59.709> of<00:03:59.830> the<00:04:00.519> condenser

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
dryer is actually part of the condenser

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.560 
dryer is actually part of the condenser
assembly<00:04:02.019> so<00:04:02.860> if<00:04:03.640> you<00:04:04.030> were<00:04:04.150> going<00:04:04.300> to<00:04:04.360> have

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
assembly so if you were going to have

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.449 
assembly so if you were going to have
this<00:04:04.840> receiver<00:04:05.230> dryer<00:04:05.560> replaced<00:04:06.040> you<00:04:06.310> would

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
this receiver dryer replaced you would

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:07.650 
this receiver dryer replaced you would
also<00:04:06.610> be<00:04:06.940> having<00:04:07.209> the

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
also be having the

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.150 
also be having the
condenser<00:04:08.080> replaced<00:04:08.440> and<00:04:08.680> vice<00:04:08.830> versa

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
condenser replaced and vice versa

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.630 
condenser replaced and vice versa
because<00:04:09.490> it<00:04:09.880> is<00:04:10.470> an<00:04:11.470> integrated<00:04:12.130> unit<00:04:12.490> and

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
because it is an integrated unit and

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.020 
because it is an integrated unit and
they're<00:04:12.760> not<00:04:12.910> separate<00:04:13.360> items<00:04:14.520> so<00:04:15.520> let's<00:04:15.790> take

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
they're not separate items so let's take

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.080 
they're not separate items so let's take
for<00:04:16.060> example<00:04:16.269> a<00:04:16.870> situation<00:04:17.560> where<00:04:18.280> a<00:04:18.670> vehicle

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
for example a situation where a vehicle

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.810 
for example a situation where a vehicle
is<00:04:19.570> involved<00:04:20.049> in<00:04:20.140> an<00:04:20.230> accident<00:04:20.769> and<00:04:20.980> there's

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
is involved in an accident and there's

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.570 
is involved in an accident and there's
been<00:04:21.970> damage<00:04:22.240> done<00:04:22.690> to<00:04:22.840> the<00:04:23.050> AC<00:04:23.230> system<00:04:23.920> which

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
been damage done to the AC system which

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.290 
been damage done to the AC system which
is<00:04:24.790> very<00:04:24.850> common<00:04:25.510> on<00:04:25.630> front-end<00:04:26.530> collisions

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
is very common on front-end collisions

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.020 
is very common on front-end collisions
you'll<00:04:28.300> have<00:04:28.510> a<00:04:28.540> car<00:04:28.840> accident<00:04:29.110> and<00:04:29.700> the<00:04:30.700> AC

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
you'll have a car accident and the AC

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.510 
you'll have a car accident and the AC
system<00:04:31.660> will<00:04:31.780> be<00:04:31.900> damaged<00:04:32.410> the<00:04:32.890> refrigerant

gone<00:04:54.430> by<00:04:54.640> and<00:04:55.240> in<00:04:56.170> the<00:04:56.260> meantime<00:04:56.470> this

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
gone by and in the meantime this

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.760 
gone by and in the meantime this
desiccant<00:04:58.150> is<00:04:58.330> exposed<00:04:58.870> to<00:04:59.050> the<00:04:59.170> atmosphere

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
desiccant is exposed to the atmosphere

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.650 
desiccant is exposed to the atmosphere
and<00:05:00.040> it's<00:05:00.490> absorbing<00:05:01.060> moisture<00:05:01.240> and

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
and it's absorbing moisture and

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.440 
and it's absorbing moisture and
absorbing<00:05:02.140> moisture<00:05:02.290> and<00:05:03.120> eventually<00:05:04.120> it

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
absorbing moisture and eventually it

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.680 
absorbing moisture and eventually it
gets<00:05:05.170> saturated<00:05:05.830> to<00:05:06.550> the<00:05:06.670> point<00:05:06.970> where<00:05:07.150> it<00:05:07.450> can

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
gets saturated to the point where it can

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.920 
gets saturated to the point where it can
no<00:05:07.720> longer<00:05:07.870> absorb<00:05:08.560> moisture<00:05:09.090> so<00:05:10.090> that's<00:05:10.540> why

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
no longer absorb moisture so that's why

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.740 
no longer absorb moisture so that's why
