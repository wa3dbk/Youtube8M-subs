00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:14.470
 we are going to make a scramble that is like a 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.390
 incoming and then it carries mushrooms 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.280
 three eggs this does not have to be 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.460
 high amounts can be put the 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.890
 amount more or less than one want the 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.289
 oil for frying 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:30.140
 the salt 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:33.860
 tender garlic, peeled and split 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.870
 asparagus also washed chopped and 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.660
 parties and peeled prawns 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.059
 and up and it's all the ingredients that 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.320
 take with this we go to the fire and 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.320
 we put the oil 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.080
 and first we are going to throw the mushrooms 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.720
 which is what more water loose and we go 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.260
 throwing the remains of little ingredients 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.079
 to little 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.580
 we put the oil 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:10.320
 to show the mushrooms the zetas are 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:13.670
 chopped along and small pieces 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.830
 and check and we give you one more 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.939
 and when I'm a little fried 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.939
 we will throw the rest 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.020
 they would be released to enough water 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.530
 yes 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.530
 but 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.320
 commit 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.340
 I do not understand it because it is very fast 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.899
 It's the bed 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.899
 in the store 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.270
 finally to bed 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.229
 oranges 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.329
 what's the same as for tortilla 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.840
 cutting all the water because they are 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.840
 frozen the stick 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.150
 again 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.189
 stirring 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.299
 so that this tortilla is not 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.299
 you have mixed 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.470
 and that's how it has to be 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.470
 but challenge after 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.290
 if he had had that jail was 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.640
 You can remove it before you salt the eggs 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.700
 It is always convenient that you have a little 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.610
 of oil so that the eggs are fried 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.080
 until egg 4 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.080
 He who sees the strong 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.540
 seeing him 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.400
 I said wish the eggs that you can 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.540
 put a little cream this same 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.540
 it's wearing but it's doing well 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:44.100
 this is how the scrambled 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:47.930
 mushrooms and prawns garlic and asparagus 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.930
 I hope you like it
