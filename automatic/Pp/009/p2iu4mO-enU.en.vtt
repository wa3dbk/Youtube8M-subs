00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.780
 Hey~ Hello everyone, I am an elder girl. 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.820
 I want to introduce you to the new features of iOS8 today. 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.780
 There are a few very useful little features that I want to share with you. 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.120
 We together look 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.140
 The first one, the camera series practical new features 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.900
 The first new feature to be introduced is the exposure adjustment when taking a photo. 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.080
 If you want to shoot something in iOS7 before, 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.580
 May point to its four corners to adjust its exposure? 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.300
 But sometimes it’s not always possible to adjust to the level of satisfaction you like. 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.660
 But in iOS8, its photo exposure function 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.720
 Just change to the point where you just click on the focus. 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.220
 Then there is a sun next to it that is going to slide the sun 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.980
 You can adjust it to a degree you like. 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.040
 The second more convenient message reply function 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.480
 When playing games halfway through the game, if someone sends a message, you have to jump out of the app. 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.660
 But if iOS8 has a friend suddenly "Hey!", send a message to you. 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.160
 It's very convenient, you can reply directly to the drop down. 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.000
 In addition, iOS8 also has the function of adding voice messages and video messages. 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.780
 You can click on the voice recording on the right to reply directly. 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.900
 Now I have already recorded it as soon as I press it. After the recording, I slide down to the arrow: Transfer 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.560
 If it’s video, you have to press the left side and then you’ve already recorded it. 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.780
 Then after recording, just slide up and slide to the arrow above. 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.460
 It’s so successful, it’s very convenient. 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.260
 The third smarter siri 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.380
 "嘿siri" 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.180
 Want to wake up siri so quickly, and don't use your hands? 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.540
 We are going to open the option to allow "嘿siri" on the siri side. 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.220
 Well, the point is that you must plug in the power 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.220
 You can just wake up by saying "嘿siri" 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.520
 Siri now has a very clever function 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.760
 Is that it can recognize what songs are 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.920
 And the songs of Chinese upsets can also 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.060
 "What song is this?" 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.620
 "Wait a minute, I will listen." 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.560
 Very powerful~ find the song, and even Chinese can be, super convenient 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.040
 That other small features, like coco, have introduced power saving tips before. 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.980
 That iOS8 further feature is 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.980
 You can see which one is very power-hungry than the one that consumes power. 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.040
 You can also look at its rankings and then choose to turn off the most power-hungry 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.740
 That's in the widget drop notification center. 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.540
 Now you can choose to edit to put in or remove what you want or don't want. 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.640
 If you want to put Dropbox and the stock market up, just click "Add". 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.120
 If you don’t want to put it on the calendar or reminder, just press "Decrease" 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.300
 If you still want to put something different, like the weather, battery usage, etc. 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.780
 Go to the Apple Store's widget center to see 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.100
 There is also a new feature in iOS8 that is the mobile version of the webpage if you are not used to it. 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.200
 You can turn it into a desktop version 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.400
 Ok~ Demonstrate 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.780
 On the Safari website, you can click and pull down. 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.800
 It will show the network switched to the computer "list"... computer version of the website 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.180
 Taiwanese Mandarin~~ Sorry, then click inside. 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.660
 You see it becomes a computer version. 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.020
 So it doesn't matter if you are not used to it, you just need to open something from Safari. 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.820
 You can use this step to change it to a computer version. 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.360
