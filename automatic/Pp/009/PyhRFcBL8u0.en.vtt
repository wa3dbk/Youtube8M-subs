set aside a specific amount of time to
work<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.439> booking<00:01:19.830> parties<00:01:20.119> why<00:01:21.119> not<00:01:21.360> make<00:01:21.570> it

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
work on booking parties why not make it

those customers specific it's fun to

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.399 
those customers specific it's fun to
copy<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.710> paste<00:01:34.920> but<00:01:35.250> make<00:01:35.430> sure<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:35.970> is

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
copy and paste but make sure that it is

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.410 
copy and paste but make sure that it is
individual<00:01:37.409> personal<00:01:37.920> messages<00:01:38.520> including

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
individual personal messages including

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.300 
individual personal messages including
their<00:01:39.600> name<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.650> they<00:01:40.829> know<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.130> you're<00:01:41.250> not

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
their name so they know that you're not

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.450 
their name so they know that you're not
sending<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:42.090> mass<00:01:42.270> text<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:43.159> really<00:01:44.159> do<00:01:44.340> not

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
sending a mass text I really do not

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.670 
sending a mass text I really do not
think<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.880> mouse<00:01:45.270> text<00:01:45.810> or<00:01:45.960> mass<00:01:46.110> message

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
think that a mouse text or mass message

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.249 
think that a mouse text or mass message
would<00:01:46.920> be<00:01:46.979> effective<00:01:47.630> now<00:01:48.630> like<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.990> said<00:01:49.020> I

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
would be effective now like I said I

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.200 
would be effective now like I said I
think<00:01:49.619> calling<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.310> best<00:01:50.549> way<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.820> do<00:01:51.030> this

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
think calling is the best way to do this

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.840 
think calling is the best way to do this
so<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.450> am<00:01:51.750> specifically<00:01:52.409> going<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.340> talk<00:01:53.549> about
