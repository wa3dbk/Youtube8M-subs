00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:08.840
 Yes everyone Good evening is indie Today 's 2 cars here and super t 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.990
 zx I made it so I will introduce it 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:17.990
 Hate-the opportunity is now 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:20.160
 I was preparing to run a grass race limited to 8 normal motors. 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.060
 Yes I will meet you 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.500
 zx is 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:33.820
 8 was done naturally volumes of most it is in the rain the brakes 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:35.079
 The slide damper is matched here by that it would not need stroked normal motor 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:42.079
 Only support 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:43.990
 I compared the time when I transplanted the roller and so on the bumper and after all I compared 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:49.090
 Here a 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:55.480
 Has been adopted here in the was early sprouting not a thread damper 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:01:00.160
 After the gear ratio is compared with No. 10 No. 1 and 3.7 No. 1 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:04.010
 3.5 Since the first of those was faster has adopted there 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:08.180
 Yes next is this ms 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:15.710
 I only ne Well basically gear princess is also a 8 ms 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:17.130
 If there was 3.7 Taiichi and the dark rotation rigid body 1 here too , it was 3 weather vs. 1 now because 3.51 was too fast 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.439
 There is 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:26.350
 That yes Oh, and has very weak here. It is a brake 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:29.979
 Here became so was very much tilted forward 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:35.920
 It is an under guard, and I tried this for the first time 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:36.880
 Yes, it's trapezoidal but I 'm wearing 8 thin one now 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.170
 Yes 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.170
 That's what I've messed up with. The brakes are very low too. 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.150
 Yes 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:55.360
 It is as 8 or look in It is this narrow tire 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:02:03.340
 Yes money to say that here also Tari half what that narrow tire fine tire But even here. 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:06.160
 3.5 went 8 normal motor earlier in Eipa that was rain had wanted to try first 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.140
 It was 8 enzymes that were each other 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.319
 Slope is attached to the 8 Japan Cup Junior Circuit 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:19.670
 I reproduced it because it is yes 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:20.450
 The result is like this. If you are watching the video, it may be in the moving song 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.920
 Not 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:29.250
 tzx used tire with set tire and cover rail 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:33.660
 In 6 seconds 63 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:38.480
 If it is thin correspondence in 6 seconds 84 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:42.020
 8 a little late as a cause of this 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:46.250
 The brother of the tire on the floor was supplemented 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:50.330
 Because I was more likely to be a brother than a barrel or offset 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:57.710
 + Well door Well is it is the larger 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:03:01.130
 Ichitomoe Courtesan is full there it is well slowdowns at strange winter continues around the Kansai region of force 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:10.390
 I thought it wasn't there 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:14.150
 Yes next ms, but when I changed my self-made Pella tire to 8 thin tires 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:17.270
 This is the first thing about registration second 51 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:25.280
 As a result it was early yes 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:30.220
 8 This time, on the contrary, when I was discharged from this small body from my own pella tire my brother became bigger 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.220
 It is in the form of someone speeding up 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:40.020
 Even thin tires are compared with each other 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:41.140
 After all, ms is faster than Mr. Masa 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:46.360
 east 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:48.490
 If you're in ms, you 've put in a round bearing for me and told it from before 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.330
 Even bearing 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:58.710
 It is a feeling that the accuracy is high by all means 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:04:01.910
 8 Well not business contact but I am here 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:06.110
 In 8 ms 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:10.660
 I think I would like to send salt to the enemy a little 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.660
 Today's video is over
