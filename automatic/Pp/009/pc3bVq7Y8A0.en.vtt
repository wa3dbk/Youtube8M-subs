00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:13.529
 a number 2 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:21.939
 subtracting up to second place in this countdown 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:24.939
 maybe the snake 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:29.039
 without any members 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.420
 they move using a complex system of muscle fibers and tendons that 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.700
 they wrap around 300 ribs 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.260
 most accidents move by contracting their muscles to 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
 produce a series of events throughout your body 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.329
 to move forward 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.340
 after the end of doing strength against the ground in the back of each 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:52.339
 course 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.360
 but crawling on your stomach is a very hard job 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.370
 the state of social security 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.049
 an arboreal snake 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:11.049
 found an amazing way to save energy and 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.360
 can climb up vertical surfaces to the return will get the rough edge 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.300
 of the countess 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.060
 according to the church of Scientology and the next 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.530
 when it reaches the end of a branch 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.530
 it's easy to see why it's called flying services 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.110
 go now 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.330
 is released transforms better fucking surface with cava 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.200
 he defined as a parachute 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.940
 You can even maneuver a bit by shaking in the air while you're planning 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:00.939
 up to 90 meters between the arcs 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.019
 after landing with luxury of being a bit rough 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.259
 but plans to improve finances 

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:16.839
 same is an extreme fashion 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:19.839
 and soon it could also be an option for man 

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:24.789
 everything that needs to be done to climb the sprint 6 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:28.349
 still in development according to everything 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.360
 this device could produce a spectacular advance in what we were doing 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.359
 personal forward to equity 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.580
 we will not win 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.969
 a space for maneuver 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:55.709
 with controls for steering and acceleration a sector on the steering wheel and 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.709
 the accelerator of a car 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:10.099
 the purpose is to go from one place to another in an easy and safe way 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.259
 i to achieve this it is necessary to rise to about 150 meters from the ground 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:21.619
 it was a perfect detail 

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:25.709
 the noise elimination technology so after two years it's a lot 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.759
 quieter of other aircraft 

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:29.379
 without expenses or rotors of 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:30.230
 posts 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.309
 much safer 

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:34.180
 That's why I trust him that someday he reiterated 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.119
 really lift flight 

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:40.249
 the federal aviation administration and the nasa 

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:44.779
 they are developing a program called highway in the sky to create over 

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:48.259
 the highway a virtual highway in the air 

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:49.479
 and so 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:52.729
 to be able to use common bridge machines and to go from one place to another 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.829
 it will arrive 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:02.430
 although the arboreal snake has a spring its volleys 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:07.039
 it is not the animal with the most extreme form of locomotion in that account 

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:10.039
 regressive 

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:13.969
 we already saw nine competitors 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:16.069
 they are the best of the best 

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:19.809
 only one animal is a machine to move even more extreme 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.870
 it is the number one 

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:38.029
 number 1 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.169
 falling to first place in this countdown 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.080
 latina party 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.900
 we do not seem to move in a very spectacular way 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.930
 besides most of the time perched on the seabed 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.759
 we experiment in the protocol that protocol 1 

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:04.879
 life is a soft-bodied animal enclosed between all shells of 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:06.009
 euros 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:08.439
 does not have fuzzy 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:10.150
 not even with him 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.150
 so that we could think that they do not move absolute 

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:20.899
 but when a hungry starfish approaches gavira must bring 

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:22.650
 out an evasive maneuver 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.650
 mockus 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.240
 this animal ranks first in this countdown 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.430
 because proper use 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.430
 contracting the muscles that bind both separations 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:47.289
 gustavo on the sides pushing forward 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:51.469
 4 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:58.009
 it would be moving using jet propulsion 

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:05.469
 In the early 1960s the researchers developed a backpack 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:06.069
 to jet 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:09.069
 they hoped that it will cause a revolution in personal transportation 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:12.889
 probably the fuel is only enough for Thursday the smn 

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:15.479
 the decree was already cordoned off 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:17.009
 but there is another way that he 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:19.319
 he did not stop moving like a life 

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:22.359
 everything that this Sunday requires of the environment on the matter 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.189
 a booty of innings without solution tell me 

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:34.189
 but they are about to rise to a higher level 

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:47.159
 just like the villas can move without using arms or legs 

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:52.019
 instead they use levitation to take their minds to a plane 

00:06:52.019 --> 00:06:54.229
 spiritual superior 

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:57.119
 this technique is called judean leather 

00:06:57.119 --> 00:07:00.499
 originated in a developed training method the india for 

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:03.499
 create a mental state of calm and calm 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.289
 but good I discussed three strangers 

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:13.210
 the first to jump to that is traditionally said to jump 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.749
 common 

00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:16.930
 from the world of the self 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:19.930
 my intention is good 

00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:26.560
 for martÃ­n 

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.889
 jumping is a means to reach a higher level of national police 

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:32.449
 through food and continuous practice 

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:35.520
 before moving on to the next stages of the trial he said 

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.400
 the Iraqi way has plenty of time to meditate while Nicaragua in the background 

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.300
 of the frame however 

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.740
 in addition this extraordinary mollusc breathe deep 

00:07:58.369 --> 00:07:59.960
 the flights 

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.469
 this is a good trick 

00:08:01.469 --> 00:08:04.469
 for an animal without limbs 

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.089
 it's about the third 

00:08:13.089 --> 00:08:15.270
 until she really is the most
