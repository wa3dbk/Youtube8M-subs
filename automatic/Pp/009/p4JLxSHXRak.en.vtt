00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
it with these indicators they don't line

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.600 
it with these indicators they don't line
up<00:01:27.659> with<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.200> amount<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:29.070> supposed<00:01:29.460> to

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
up with the amount that it's supposed to

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
amount of water you want to brew is a

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.719 
amount of water you want to brew is a
little<00:01:34.740> tricky<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.220> you're<00:01:35.310> probably<00:01:35.520> gonna

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
little tricky and you're probably gonna

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.280 
little tricky and you're probably gonna
have<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.939> use<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.090> scale<00:01:36.420> which<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.720> definitely

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
have to use a scale which is definitely

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.249 
have to use a scale which is definitely
not<00:01:37.500> very<00:01:37.710> fun<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.520> do<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.630> nutshell<00:01:39.780> this

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
not very fun to do so in a nutshell this

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.429 
not very fun to do so in a nutshell this
device<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.310> extremely<00:01:41.880> expensive<00:01:42.479> if<00:01:43.079> you

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
device is extremely expensive if you

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.170 
device is extremely expensive if you
want<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.710> have<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.070> same<00:01:44.369> luxury<00:01:44.700> coffee
