inside<00:00:42.320> this<00:00:42.829> is<00:00:43.010> a<00:00:43.040> cold<00:00:43.430> liquor<00:00:43.670> tank<00:00:43.879> where

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
inside this is a cold liquor tank where

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.110 
inside this is a cold liquor tank where
we<00:00:44.480> put<00:00:44.660> the<00:00:44.809> water<00:00:45.190> this<00:00:46.190> is<00:00:46.430> the<00:00:46.730> hot<00:00:46.850> liquor

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
we put the water this is the hot liquor

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.180 
we put the water this is the hot liquor
tank<00:00:47.149> where<00:00:48.019> essentially<00:00:48.410> we've<00:00:48.710> taken<00:00:48.949> that

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
tank where essentially we've taken that

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.700 
tank where essentially we've taken that
cold<00:00:49.489> water<00:00:50.059> treated<00:00:50.809> it<00:00:51.050> and<00:00:51.260> warmed<00:00:51.500> it<00:00:51.589> up

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
cold water treated it and warmed it up

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.729 
cold water treated it and warmed it up
this<00:00:52.519> is<00:00:52.730> the<00:00:52.879> mash<00:00:53.059> tun<00:00:53.300> where<00:00:53.780> some<00:00:54.559> of<00:00:54.649> the

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
this is the mash tun where some of the

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.860 
this is the mash tun where some of the
magic<00:00:54.980> happens<00:00:55.339> we<00:00:55.909> take<00:00:56.089> the<00:00:56.269> warm<00:00:56.480> liquor

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
magic happens we take the warm liquor

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.619 
magic happens we take the warm liquor
from<00:00:57.680> the<00:00:57.769> hot<00:00:57.949> liquor<00:00:58.100> tank<00:00:58.190> and<00:00:58.610> blend<00:00:59.329> it<00:00:59.479> in

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
from the hot liquor tank and blend it in

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.960 
from the hot liquor tank and blend it in
with<00:00:59.659> all<00:01:00.079> of<00:01:00.110> these<00:01:00.350> molt's<00:01:00.829> to<00:01:01.100> make<00:01:01.280> the

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
with all of these molt's to make the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.210 
with all of these molt's to make the
backbone<00:01:02.390> of<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:02.629> beer<00:01:02.809> we<00:01:03.710> then<00:01:03.890> cool<00:01:04.190> it

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
backbone of the beer we then cool it

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.370 
backbone of the beer we then cool it
down<00:01:04.550> at<00:01:04.790> this<00:01:04.879> plate<00:01:05.239> heat<00:01:05.449> exchanger<00:01:06.200> and

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
down at this plate heat exchanger and

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.830 
down at this plate heat exchanger and
take<00:01:07.160> it<00:01:07.310> through<00:01:07.550> here<00:01:07.880> to<00:01:08.420> these<00:01:08.539> two

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
take it through here to these two

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.200 
take it through here to these two
fermenting<00:01:09.350> vessels<00:01:09.800> where<00:01:10.490> we<00:01:10.610> essentially

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
fermenting vessels where we essentially

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.440 
fermenting vessels where we essentially
add<00:01:11.690> yeast<00:01:12.020> to<00:01:12.229> it<00:01:12.380> and<00:01:12.729> leave<00:01:13.729> it<00:01:13.910> to<00:01:14.119> ferment

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
add yeast to it and leave it to ferment

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.139 
add yeast to it and leave it to ferment
for<00:01:14.869> about<00:01:14.929> a<00:01:15.140> week<00:01:15.440> we<00:01:16.369> bring<00:01:16.910> it<00:01:17.000> through

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
for about a week we bring it through

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:20.249 
for about a week we bring it through
here<00:01:17.539> to<00:01:18.170> this<00:01:18.320> room<00:01:18.649> we've<00:01:18.950> got<00:01:19.070> two<00:01:19.280> tanks

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
here to this room we've got two tanks

a bright beer tank conditioning tank is

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.010 
a bright beer tank conditioning tank is
where<00:01:25.250> we<00:01:25.369> would<00:01:25.520> leave<00:01:25.759> an<00:01:26.030> ale<00:01:26.179> to<00:01:26.479> condition

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
where we would leave an ale to condition

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.040 
where we would leave an ale to condition
and<00:01:27.320> mature<00:01:27.860> we<00:01:28.399> can<00:01:28.640> call<00:01:28.940> this<00:01:29.090> tank<00:01:29.390> down<00:01:29.659> to

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
and mature we can call this tank down to

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.710 
and mature we can call this tank down to
about<00:01:30.530> 0<00:01:30.830> or<00:01:30.979> 1<00:01:31.190> degrees<00:01:31.550> the<00:01:32.179> temperature<00:01:32.600> we

comes<00:01:38.060> in<00:01:38.210> round<00:01:38.390> the<00:01:38.479> back<00:01:38.659> and<00:01:38.899> then<00:01:39.500> we

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
comes in round the back and then we

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.429 
comes in round the back and then we
simply<00:01:40.040> fill<00:01:40.220> it<00:01:40.340> through<00:01:40.549> the<00:01:40.670> bottling<00:01:41.000> here

this<00:01:56.130> isn't<00:01:56.490> home<00:01:56.640> brewing<00:01:56.970> this<00:01:57.150> is<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> step

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
this isn't home brewing this is a step

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.840 
this isn't home brewing this is a step
up<00:01:57.810> from<00:01:57.840> home<00:01:58.170> brewing<00:01:58.410> the<00:01:58.980> size<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.610> is

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
up from home brewing the size of this is

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.970 
up from home brewing the size of this is
two<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.150> a<00:02:00.240> half<00:02:00.390> barrels<00:02:00.870> it's<00:02:01.500> not<00:02:01.740> big<00:02:01.950> it's

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
two and a half barrels it's not big it's

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.280 
two and a half barrels it's not big it's
about<00:02:02.130> 400<00:02:02.460> litres<00:02:02.970> ago<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.870> would<00:02:04.050> be<00:02:04.140> what

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
about 400 litres ago this would be what

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.750 
about 400 litres ago this would be what
you<00:02:04.380> would<00:02:04.410> call<00:02:04.620> a<00:02:04.680> nano<00:02:04.950> brewery<00:02:05.340> which<00:02:05.580> is<00:02:05.729> a

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
you would call a nano brewery which is a

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.630 
you would call a nano brewery which is a
very<00:02:06.000> small<00:02:06.270> micro<00:02:06.660> brewery<00:02:07.369> so<00:02:08.369> now<00:02:08.490> we've
