just threw that one kind of portal owned
from<00:01:55.259> 360<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.219> one<00:01:56.570> where<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.659> get

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
from 360 to the one where you get

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.780 
from 360 to the one where you get
slightly<00:01:58.469> better<00:01:58.710> load<00:01:58.950> times<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.460> takes<00:01:59.490> a

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
slightly better load times it takes a

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.850 
slightly better load times it takes a
few<00:01:59.969> seconds<00:02:00.299> left<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.719> load<00:02:00.869> things<00:02:01.170> are

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
few seconds left to load things are

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.050 
few seconds left to load things are
actually<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.310> an<00:02:02.399> improvement<00:02:02.700> in<00:02:03.000> the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
actually is an improvement in the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.429 
actually is an improvement in the
framerate<00:02:03.360> yeah<00:02:03.750> she's<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.049> little<00:02:04.259> bit

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
framerate yeah she's a little bit

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.649 
framerate yeah she's a little bit
quicker<00:02:04.680> than<00:02:04.920> what<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.250> on<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.490> 360<00:02:06.000> it's

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
quicker than what is on the 360 it's

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.910 
quicker than what is on the 360 it's
little<00:02:06.899> things<00:02:06.930> like<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.439> there's<00:02:07.799> no

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
little things like that there's no

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.380 
little things like that there's no
graphical<00:02:08.489> improvement

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
graphical improvement

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.300 
graphical improvement
but<00:02:09.630> there<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:09.840> upper<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.560> little<00:02:10.590> improvements

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
but there is upper a little improvements

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.449

and over and over again I can't tell you

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.180 
and over and over again I can't tell you
how<00:02:30.780> many<00:02:30.840> times<00:02:30.990> Meereen<00:02:31.620> will<00:02:31.770> play<00:02:31.950> mass

how many times Meereen will play mass

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.580 
how many times Meereen will play mass
effect<00:02:32.220> 2<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:32.730> 3<00:02:32.940> it's<00:02:33.300> definitely<00:02:34.050> of<00:02:34.470> in

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
effect 2 and 3 it's definitely of in

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.170 
effect 2 and 3 it's definitely of in
double<00:02:34.890> digits<00:02:35.010> probably<00:02:35.640> heading<00:02:35.850> towards

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
double digits probably heading towards

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.960 
double digits probably heading towards
the<00:02:36.239> 20s<00:02:36.690> 20<00:02:37.680> times<00:02:37.860> playing<00:02:38.430> both<00:02:38.730> of<00:02:38.880> them

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
the 20s 20 times playing both of them

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.000 
the 20s 20 times playing both of them
through<00:02:39.180> at<00:02:39.810> this<00:02:39.930> point<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.410> I<00:02:40.709> think<00:02:40.739> we're

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
through at this point and I think we're

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.680 
through at this point and I think we're
at<00:02:41.160> starting<00:02:41.580> around<00:02:41.700> for<00:02:42.030> at<00:02:42.120> some<00:02:42.330> point<00:02:42.540> as

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
at starting around for at some point as

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.620 
at starting around for at some point as
well<00:02:43.010> so<00:02:44.010> yes<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:44.310> they<00:02:44.820> really<00:02:45.090> Mass<00:02:45.600> Effect

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
well so yes that they really Mass Effect

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.920 
well so yes that they really Mass Effect
2<00:02:45.900> in<00:02:46.020> 3<00:02:46.140> do<00:02:46.500> not<00:02:46.739> need<00:02:46.980> an<00:02:47.400> upgraded<00:02:48.330> or

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930

upraised version on next-gen they just

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.390 
upraised version on next-gen they just
don't<00:02:51.660> need<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:51.900> if<00:02:52.680> they<00:02:52.920> were<00:02:53.010> going<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.310> do

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
don't need it if they were going to do

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.949

it<00:02:53.519> Mass<00:02:53.700> Effect<00:02:53.940> won't<00:02:54.120> be<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.330> one<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.690> do<00:02:54.930> it

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
it Mass Effect won't be the one to do it

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:55.970 
it Mass Effect won't be the one to do it
