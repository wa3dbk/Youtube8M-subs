running or swimming all you have to do

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.590

taking per day how many calories do I

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.050 
taking per day how many calories do I
need<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.240> burn<00:00:27.570> Brendan<00:00:28.109> in<00:00:28.230> order<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:29.060> lose

need to burn Brendan in order to lose
this<00:00:30.330> weight<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:30.859> one<00:00:31.859> pound<00:00:32.219> equates<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.590> 3500

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
this weight so one pound equates to 3500

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.920 
this weight so one pound equates to 3500
calories<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.640> if<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.940> want<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.210> lose<00:00:36.510> one

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
calories so if you want to lose one

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.069 
calories so if you want to lose one
pound<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:38.129> have<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.489> burn<00:00:38.730> 3,500<00:00:39.180> more

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
pound you have to burn 3,500 more

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.350 
pound you have to burn 3,500 more
calories<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.739> your<00:00:40.860> intaking<00:00:41.520> okay

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
calories and your intaking okay

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.090 
calories and your intaking okay
obviously<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.260> can't<00:00:43.500> do<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.710> in<00:00:43.860> one<00:00:44.070> day

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
obviously you can't do this in one day

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.000 
obviously you can't do this in one day
so<00:00:44.309> what<00:00:45.059> do<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.210> tell<00:00:45.420> individuals<00:00:45.710> do<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.860> in

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
so what do I tell individuals do this in

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
attach a calculator in the description

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.210 
attach a calculator in the description
for<00:01:25.740> that

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
for that

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.580

I'll<00:01:26.280> also<00:01:26.729> attach<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.420> calculator<00:01:27.930> to

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
I'll also attach a calculator to

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.920

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
so I'll put the calculators in the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.780 
so I'll put the calculators in the
description<00:01:36.540> below<00:01:36.829> to<00:01:37.829> help<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.250> guys<00:01:38.490> so
