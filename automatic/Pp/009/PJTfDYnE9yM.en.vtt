00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.069
 Jack everything back to the start and we see 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.290
 today for the very first time a call of 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.300
 Duty goes gameplay here on the map 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.340
 Strikes out in the mode so hurt 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.089
 upset in German really stupid 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.289
 I 've got you with the sae 805 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.470
 played 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.960
 I have the m9 1 and yes 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.920
 the rsa 805 was a reflex like her and 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.810
 the silencer thereby the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.539
 Silencer is actually a must 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.769
 So, if you gamble before the release, that's me 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.080
 have it now I believe on friday 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.300
 earns and really crass the gameplay 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.030
 really nice then I still have c4 with me 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.399
 and a blendgranate and perks in focus 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.530
 on the ride and look up quickly 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.000
 and faster goal after the sprint me 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.190
 did not get injured with it 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.690
 especially a focus is such a kind 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.940
 Toughness, too, pretty much 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.789
 important we know everything black ops 2 and 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.199
 on the grid or on the client or yes 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.600
 I do not know how I do that 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.250
 talk is supposed to be spiritual 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.899
 At the beginning everybody thinks of drone 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.320
 if you do not build a streak anyway 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.000
 can 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.520
 that's why it's pretty pretty 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.960
 important and yes, how exactly that 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.670
 muffler because everyone runs away 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.140
 Living red dot on the map is 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.700
 because you have no idea what to do 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.590
 should 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.650
 otherwise I set and comes 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.689
 heli and yaz adcom is the new drone 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.570
 which one activates on the ground so the 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.580
 you have to stop and place well 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.750
 and yes the running dog source the 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.040
 you will be behind all the time 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.320
 will still be playing here 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.670
 and yes there is another heli the new delhi 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.119
 that's pretty cool that's how it is 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.360
 a kind of cobra from mw3 just that he still 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.860
 yes so mortar fine leaves so small 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.540
 bombs then fall down but me 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.040
 think for a new acoustics or 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.780
 It is actually points of happiness 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.220
 actually overboard it sounds 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.680
 maybe now but from then on it's a 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.740
 heli is with server and so is 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.740
 really not so op and yes now here 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.560
 activate 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.390
 my dog ​​is my time because they have 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.229
 I now also reach the viruses too 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.299
 right after that and castration is 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.680
 is currently the best web I must go 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.880
 say it's the smallest of me too 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.420
 believe that is a little smaller than that 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.520
 otherwise I say there are times 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.759
 not so many apps right now 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:13.319
 so blatant are good so it's all so 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.640
 aftermath from black ops 2 really so 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.019
 I'm not so easy with that yet 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.030
 I was hoping that somehow 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.290
 card package out there that they still 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.910
 up there, pure patch or any 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.610
 Maps made from either right bock 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.590
 otherwise it will not be that dollar 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.030
 the cards are the flop 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.100
 I have to give it like that 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.540
 otherwise year the weapons and everything 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.160
 which are still quite okay that is 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.170
 but everything was patched I heard 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.610
 and I actually wanted to say that too 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.290
 that you take really slow so me 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.150
 am now gorgeous only it moved 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.650
 Since Thursday evening or Friday at 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.049
 who turns out to be just three to four five 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.989
 and I'm almost there now 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.190
 priced 2 already and must say stop 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.630
 you have to slow down but there 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.060
 I was just told that you only 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.500
 a led from the points gets the 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.880
 you would otherwise get it then 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.370
 probably not much 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.290
 prestige gets no idea 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.820
 and yes I have special on this 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.930
 Unfortunately, gameplay is selected 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.549
 only 1 14 23 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.350
 I think you three minutes it goes into 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.100
 okay but you see now below left 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:11.109
 he has the cam strike in the care package 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.660
 get and so to speak, you can see times 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:15.190
 how the camps tracks is constructed or 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.709
 what happens the map he goes now 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.180
 completely broken and I load today 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.319
 again the gameplay up or chris 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.480
 lieto and again 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.730
 23 34 minutes that actually too 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.379
 looks pretty acceptable to me 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.420
 past you were making many many call 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.579
 of duty of the gameplay and the course lives 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.170
 also really much high is the 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.450
 really active to call of duty casting 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.609
 Send him all the ghost gameplays 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.680
 have in which camps any 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.659
 war any multi kids or something 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.790
 no idea so fat crass gameplay 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:44.560
 the crass ones easily send him his 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.189
 facebook page lay this video makes 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.189
 good in
