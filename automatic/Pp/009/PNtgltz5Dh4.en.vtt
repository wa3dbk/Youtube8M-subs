00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.920
 commenting and I bring you the first 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.170
 delivery of the zombie guide in die 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.030

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.889
 first episode, I'll bring you how 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.330
 activate the music of this map as 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.860
 always touching three milestones the first one what 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.560
 we found on that shelf for 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.970
 find this room you have to open the 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.230
 start gate the map remove the 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.939
 debris go down and open another door 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.590

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.539
 watching now going down these stairs 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.400
 we get to the part of the bar and 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.599
 we have to skirt around to get there 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.650
 to the next building that is also 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.689
 where is the weapons box 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.460
 very curious location since it is in 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.100
 the roof as I am teaching here is worth 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.260
 can appear here later when it 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.520
 go the box but mainly always 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.079
 it's going to look like at the beginning and how are you 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.219
 seeing jumps and they are quite altar and the 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.329
 You opened fences did not cost us much 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.340
 find her because she was on the roof and 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.860
 we did not see her next bear is in the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.180
 Buddha's room as I call it then 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.530
 do not go up this column and 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.910
 since the corner you have the bear you have 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.399
 to press as you always know with the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.579
 X in the Xbox or in Play 3 with the 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.469
 square and well the last bear is in 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.809

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.609
 delivery as with activate quick light and 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.809
 how to get the achievement in front of 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.220
 in front of the dragon or something like that is called 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.600
 so good here I leave you with the 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.000
 music 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.100
 until the music is over you have the 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.710
 today's gameplay to steal your rambo in the 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.880

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.500

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.920
 the day is divided 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.509
 villegas raffles with so many others 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.509
 sins 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.970
 but 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.970
 very well 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.360
 I think this is rather not 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.020
 if not 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.569
 and I guess it could be 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.080
 good 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.890
