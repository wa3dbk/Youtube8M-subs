 Bryant Bandit People claim you but 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.069
 it gives me a little bit of fear sometimes 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.129
 ask me this vague gentleman because 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.570

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.759

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.310

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.550

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.830
 I am this aggressive portent 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.050

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.939
 song endorsed the one that comes now the 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.769

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.830
 throat and day 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:59.020
 but we are very well prepared for 

00:05:56.809 --> 00:06:01.219
 listen to the opinion of our jury 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:05.180
 we will start this time with the lord 

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:08.889
 ricardo morán or listen to something very well 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.889
 a very good presentation 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:16.000
 there's something that did not convince me 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.800
 however in the first half 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.979
 I do not think you did have a problem 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:23.409
 of return or something happened there with the voice 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:25.030
 that I felt you were not putting him 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:26.560
 I'm not talking about the song 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.090
 it's nothing ballad and it's slow and that's why the 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.500
 energy is a little bit lower but 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.750
 there was something there that was not there 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.689
 squaring I do not know if the voice is not 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.490
 it was exactly the same ok but the 

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:38.740
 moment you go up has 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.449
 been very good has been impeccable that is 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.240
 your strong I think you have to work 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:45.190
 a little more the other is that otherwise 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.770
 pretty good there are pronunciation topics 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:49.990
 in English that here and there there 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.159
 review I would suggest that you review it 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.150
 very detailed because the 

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:55.240
 English pronunciation is very 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:58.990
 important very many thanks ricardo 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.699
 morán fernando arms we listen to that 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.710
 first part a little more weight in 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:04.690
 the voice of note more mature 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:08.810
 just after you are an artist 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:12.860
 and extraordinary rocker and great imitator 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:16.669

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.210
