00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
people are literally common from all

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.430 
people are literally common from all
over<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.240> UK<00:01:06.480> and<00:01:06.600> beyond<00:01:06.810> just<00:01:07.050> to<00:01:07.200> see<00:01:07.320> is

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
over in the UK and beyond just to see is

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.420 
over in the UK and beyond just to see is
because<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.920> rule<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.070> C<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.580> live<00:01:10.400> yeah<00:01:11.400> I

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
because the rule is C is live yeah I

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.830 
because the rule is C is live yeah I
mean<00:01:11.730> I<00:01:11.850> guess<00:01:12.030> there's<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.270> certain<00:01:12.540> amount<00:01:12.690> of

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
mean I guess there's a certain amount of

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.600 
mean I guess there's a certain amount of
pressure<00:01:13.050> that<00:01:13.380> goes<00:01:13.650> with<00:01:13.860> people<00:01:14.190> paying

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
pressure that goes with people paying

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.040 
pressure that goes with people paying
money<00:01:14.910> to<00:01:15.000> see<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.420> as<00:01:15.570> opposed<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.900> just

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
money to see you as opposed to just

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.900 
money to see you as opposed to just
showing<00:01:16.350> up<00:01:16.440> at<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.650> pub<00:01:16.860> incidentally<00:01:17.790> and

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
showing up at the pub incidentally and

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.090 
showing up at the pub incidentally and
seeing<00:01:18.120> you<00:01:18.210> player<00:01:18.450> there<00:01:18.720> but<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.710> guess<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
seeing you player there but I guess the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.920 
seeing you player there but I guess the
regularity<00:01:20.760> of<00:01:20.790> shows<00:01:21.120> having<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.570> do<00:01:21.660> them<00:01:21.750> so

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
regularity of shows having to do them so

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.260 
regularity of shows having to do them so
frequently<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:23.100> mean<00:01:23.850> that's<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.120> bit

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
frequently is I mean that's the bit

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.500 
frequently is I mean that's the bit
that's<00:01:24.360> actually<00:01:24.780> exhausting<00:01:25.410> I<00:01:25.800> think<00:01:26.510> the

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
that's actually exhausting I think the

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.760 
that's actually exhausting I think the
more<00:01:27.660> people<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.020> come<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.290> see<00:01:28.440> you<00:01:28.530> play

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
more people that come and see you play

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.100 
more people that come and see you play
somehow<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.280> easier<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.910> kind<00:01:30.300> of<00:01:30.420> to

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
somehow the easier it is to kind of to

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.730 
somehow the easier it is to kind of to
get<00:01:31.230> on<00:01:31.410> with<00:01:31.560> it

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
get on with it

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.710 
get on with it
you<00:01:32.610> kind<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.850> take<00:01:33.030> cut<00:01:33.270> off<00:01:33.390> from<00:01:33.570> an

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
you kind of take cut off from an

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.130 
you kind of take cut off from an
