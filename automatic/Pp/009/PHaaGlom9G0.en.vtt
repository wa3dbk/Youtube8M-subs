 After all it is painted in the same color under the waist, so is the image of the whole car changed a lot 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.180

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.720
 It is rear, right here- 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.550

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:55.050
 When you tighten this side button 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.990
 The extensive warning in the electric co 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.760

 It becomes a dealer car here , and there is a setting with meeha zero in 4 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:34.790
 The engine it's suffering from a bell, but 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.790
 Here is a 3.6-liter engine I would like to steam a little 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:48.940

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:59.360
 The travel distance is about 50,000 km 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:05.100
 That's right Steering Committee 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:11.120
 There is nothing particularly noticeable that is a thread or scratch 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:11.120

 And know while controlling automatically here this looks Well downhill of it steep gradient is here 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:28.950
 It becomes the button of the device that 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:35.510
 Also here are two buttons depending on the road situation 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:35.510
 It becomes an a button that raises and lowers the vehicle height 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.650
 It it is is 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:48.310
 It is anti-slip and horizontal bar guess is that here as an example 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.249
 And this is a Stirling heater 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.460

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:30.639
 All seats are in the same form 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:36.600
 Here is the second seat and the second seat is also a meeting of female driver's seat 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:40.970
 There is also a lot of leg space, so even if you get behind you 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.970

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:50.060
