00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.939 
of cyborg and the reason I'm doing this
is<00:00:18.210> because<00:00:18.480> this<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.109> kind<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.439> weird<00:00:19.650> the

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
is because this is kind of weird the

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.230 
is because this is kind of weird the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
suit we don't usually see cyborg in this

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.900 
suit we don't usually see cyborg in this
we<00:00:28.439> already<00:00:28.740> have<00:00:28.920> seen<00:00:29.099> cyborg<00:00:29.609> in<00:00:29.760> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
we already have seen cyborg in the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.540 
we already have seen cyborg in the
trailer<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.570> new<00:00:31.140> 52<00:00:31.289> suit<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.040> obviously

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
trailer in the new 52 suit so obviously

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.639

he's<00:00:32.790> going<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.120> have<00:00:33.329> two<00:00:34.050> different<00:00:34.260> suits

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
he's going to have two different suits

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.110 
he's going to have two different suits
which<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.070> new<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.460> series<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.030> it's

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.090 
which is new to the series and it's
pretty<00:00:36.329> exciting<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.870> know<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.100> hopefully

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
pretty exciting to know that hopefully

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.979 
pretty exciting to know that hopefully
every<00:00:38.520> character<00:00:39.000> can<00:00:39.149> have<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.329> bunch<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.809> new

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
every character can have a bunch of new

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.410 
every character can have a bunch of new
suits<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.739> can<00:00:40.920> do<00:00:41.100> more<00:00:41.460> not<00:00:42.030> just<00:00:42.210> like<00:00:42.329> a

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
suits that can do more not just like a

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.970 
suits that can do more not just like a
different<00:00:42.719> costume<00:00:42.899> but<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> whole<00:00:43.620> different

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
different costume but a whole different

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.880 
different costume but a whole different
like<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.329> design<00:00:45.329> tool<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:45.930> obviously<00:00:46.350> cyborgs

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
like a design tool so obviously cyborgs

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.740 
like a design tool so obviously cyborgs
gonna<00:00:47.039> have<00:00:47.190> more<00:00:47.399> power<00:00:47.700> when<00:00:48.300> he's<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:48.600> this

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
gonna have more power when he's in this

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.020 
gonna have more power when he's in this
suit<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.320> think<00:00:49.890> they<00:00:49.980> did<00:00:50.160> this<00:00:50.309> cons<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.820> copy

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
suit I think they did this cons to copy

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.880 
suit I think they did this cons to copy
the<00:00:51.239> Hulk<00:00:51.510> because<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.199> know<00:00:52.289> more<00:00:52.590> Lego

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
the Hulk because you know more Lego

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.709 
the Hulk because you know more Lego
Marvel<00:00:53.309> had<00:00:53.489> their<00:00:53.699> huge<00:00:54.090> character<00:00:54.360> with

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
Marvel had their huge character with

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.689 
Marvel had their huge character with
drank<00:00:55.020> now<00:00:55.260> we're<00:00:55.440> gonna<00:00:55.530> have<00:00:55.800> cyborgs<00:00:56.460> in

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699

like<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.300> huge<00:00:57.449> mech<00:00:57.750> suit<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.230> looks

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
like this huge mech suit and looks

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:59.869 
like this huge mech suit and looks
pretty<00:00:58.859> cool<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.160> me<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.430> doesn't<00:00:59.609> look<00:00:59.820> that

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
pretty cool to me it doesn't look that

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.000 
pretty cool to me it doesn't look that
detail<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.629> be<00:01:00.719> honest<00:01:01.050> like<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.379> know<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:01.949> a

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
detail to be honest like I know it's a

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.460 
detail to be honest like I know it's a
Lego<00:01:02.160> game<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:02.699> Lego<00:01:02.879> games<00:01:03.149> recently<00:01:04.019> have

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
Lego game but Lego games recently have

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.899 
Lego game but Lego games recently have
been<00:01:04.589> pretty<00:01:04.799> detailed<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.489> isn't<00:01:05.790> that

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
been pretty detailed this isn't that

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.359 
been pretty detailed this isn't that
detail<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.540> looks<00:01:06.659> pretty<00:01:06.869> cool<00:01:07.110> uh<00:01:07.369> maybe

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
detail but it looks pretty cool uh maybe

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.039 
detail but it looks pretty cool uh maybe
in<00:01:08.610> gameplay<00:01:08.850> we<00:01:09.180> can<00:01:09.299> see<00:01:09.479> what<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.750> can<00:01:09.840> do

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
in gameplay we can see what it can do

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.320 
in gameplay we can see what it can do
hopefully<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:10.979> maybe<00:01:11.130> has<00:01:11.369> some<00:01:11.610> obviously

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
hopefully that maybe has some obviously

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.630 
hopefully that maybe has some obviously
looks<00:01:12.540> like<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.720> has<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.869> laser<00:01:13.170> on<00:01:13.320> his<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.799> left

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
looks like it has a laser on his I left

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.190 
looks like it has a laser on his I left
arm<00:01:14.970> or<00:01:15.119> whatever<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.540> right<00:01:15.720> arm<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:16.020> don't

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
arm or whatever the right arm I don't

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.230 
arm or whatever the right arm I don't
 know<00:01:16.590> but<00:01:17.070> um<00:01:17.220> obviously<00:01:17.880> he's<00:01:18.150> gonna

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
 know but um obviously he's gonna

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.789 
 know but um obviously he's gonna
have<00:01:18.450> more<00:01:18.630> power<00:01:18.840> when<00:01:19.080> he's<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.470> suit

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
have more power when he's in this suit

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.840 
have more power when he's in this suit
so<00:01:20.159> pretty<00:01:20.909> much<00:01:21.090> we're<00:01:21.240> gonna<00:01:21.330> get<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.799> cyborg

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.760 
so pretty much we're gonna get a cyborg
