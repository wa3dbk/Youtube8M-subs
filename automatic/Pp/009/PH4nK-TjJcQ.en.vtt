00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 today how to fish with potatoes 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.420
 so first know that we are fishing 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.860
 at the general state potato do not be 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.809
 not surprised if you fish other 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.000
 fish but mainly you 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.980
 take cards then for pechalate 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.980
 baghdad and especially to kill potatoes 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.330
 makes sure to find small ones 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.230
 as you can see I'm going 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.869
 try to take one for yourself 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.609
 to see them lose heavily they are 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.760
 really it's small potatoes that we 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.160
 pick up we will not eat though 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.750
 for them to fish it's perfect then 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.610
 make it pretty much 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.840
 all the same diameter so that the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.460
 cooking is almost homogeneous 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:45.680
 put them in the clos enough 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.989
 do not hesitate for water then to him but 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.680
 here and now when boiling 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.629
 to monitor you but you must at least 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.530
 20 minutes to mistresses have the best 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.750
 it's from rijeka sooner it takes 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.370
 they are neither the soft rni is 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.159
 to say that if they are too hard you 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.570
 can not fish because the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.520
 lesson of raptors hanging in the 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.680
 mouth if they are too soft when 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.750
 to show you that from others 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.619
 really really important cooking 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.790
 it has to be between the two 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.670
 to know if they are cooked 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:26.159
 take a knife or a pick then stitch 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.570
 on it and if a little resistance but 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.579
 that it sinks relatively well as 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:35.610
 here it's good it's yes after bike and 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.670
 it's gone for fishing here fishing 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:44.790

 it's in the middle that we could see it 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.550
