to<00:05:06.690> put<00:05:07.020> it<00:05:07.110> that<00:05:07.200> way<00:05:07.260> again<00:05:07.650> Paul's<00:05:08.310> had<00:05:08.550> a

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
to put it that way again Paul's had a

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.460 
to put it that way again Paul's had a
couple<00:05:08.820> ideas<00:05:08.970> that<00:05:09.480> he's<00:05:09.600> brought<00:05:09.840> to<00:05:09.990> us<00:05:10.110> on

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
couple ideas that he's brought to us on

couple ideas that he's brought to us on
pending<00:05:11.300> approval<00:05:12.300> that<00:05:12.510> we<00:05:12.630> like<00:05:12.840> and<00:05:13.200> I

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
pending approval that we like and I

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.190 
pending approval that we like and I
think<00:05:13.770> would<00:05:14.190> work<00:05:14.400> they<00:05:15.390> just<00:05:15.570> depending<00:05:16.200> on

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
think would work they just depending on

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.230 
think would work they just depending on
whether<00:05:16.500> or<00:05:16.590> not<00:05:16.650> CBS<00:05:17.070> place<00:05:17.400> the<00:05:17.550> idea<00:05:17.820> and

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
whether or not CBS place the idea and

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.540 
whether or not CBS place the idea and

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
then suddenly obviously want to take in

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.070 
then suddenly obviously want to take in
