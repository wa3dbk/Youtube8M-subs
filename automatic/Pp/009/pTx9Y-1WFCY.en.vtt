funny that he ended up in there but yeah

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.990 
funny that he ended up in there but yeah
as<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.770> can<00:00:40.920> see<00:00:41.129> he's<00:00:41.370> sitting<00:00:41.700> on<00:00:41.790> one<00:00:41.940> of

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
as you can see he's sitting on one of

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.450 
as you can see he's sitting on one of
the<00:00:42.149> powered<00:00:42.570> tracks<00:00:43.440> right<00:00:43.710> now<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.070> one<00:00:44.309> of

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
the powered tracks right now and one of

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.360 
the powered tracks right now and one of
my<00:00:45.200> disappointment<00:00:46.200> with<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:47.010> when

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
my disappointment with this is that when

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.400 
my disappointment with this is that when
you<00:00:47.520> flip<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:47.969> switch<00:00:48.239> he<00:00:49.050> doesn't

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
you flip a switch he doesn't

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.529 
you flip a switch he doesn't
automatically<00:00:50.129> get<00:00:50.370> boosted<00:00:50.850> by<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.210> track

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
automatically get boosted by that track

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.590 
automatically get boosted by that track
and<00:00:52.699> it's<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.820> little<00:00:54.059> disappointing<00:00:54.239> but

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
and it's a little disappointing but

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.200 
and it's a little disappointing but
there's<00:00:55.289> an<00:00:55.559> easy<00:00:55.860> solution<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.699> i<00:00:56.910> will

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
there's an easy solution to that i will

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.560 
there's an easy solution to that i will
show<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.510> right<00:00:57.809> here<00:00:57.890> so<00:00:58.890> as<00:00:59.180> let<00:01:00.180> me<00:01:00.300> push

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.920 
show you right here so as let me push
him<00:01:00.719> off<00:01:00.899> there<00:01:01.140> for<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.410> second<00:01:02.660> there<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.809> an

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
him off there for a second there is an

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.950 
him off there for a second there is an
easy<00:01:04.290> solution<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.430> we<00:01:05.610> will<00:01:05.820> i<00:01:06.119> will<00:01:06.689> show<00:01:06.900> you

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
easy solution so we will i will show you

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.250 
easy solution so we will i will show you
that<00:01:07.049> right<00:01:07.380> now<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:08.750> solution<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.869> this<00:01:09.990> is

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
that right now a solution to this is

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.429 
that right now a solution to this is
simply<00:01:10.740> make<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.430> power<00:01:11.820> track<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.780> slant

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
simply make the power track on a slant

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.710 
simply make the power track on a slant
so<00:01:14.159> as<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.580> can<00:01:14.820> see<00:01:15.030> right<00:01:15.060> now<00:01:15.270> he<00:01:15.479> is

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
so as you can see right now he is

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.070 
so as you can see right now he is
stopped<00:01:16.259> at<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> downhill<00:01:17.369> slant<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.330> we<00:01:18.900> got

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
stopped at a downhill slant and we got

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.030 
stopped at a downhill slant and we got
the<00:01:19.320> red<00:01:20.390> red<00:01:21.390> stony<00:01:21.720> are<00:01:21.930> going<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.470> power<00:01:22.740> it

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
the red red stony are going to power it

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.700 
the red red stony are going to power it
and<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.490> all<00:01:23.700> we<00:01:23.820> need<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.030> do<00:01:24.240> now<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:25.439> flip

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
and so all we need to do now is you flip

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.190 
and so all we need to do now is you flip
the<00:01:25.860> switch<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.970> powers<00:01:27.270> them<00:01:27.630> around<00:01:27.869> i

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the switch and it powers them around i

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.850 
the switch and it powers them around i
mean<00:01:28.950> that's<00:01:29.159> that's<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.759> pretty<00:01:29.970> cool<00:01:30.299> deal

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
mean that's that's a pretty cool deal

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.010 
mean that's that's a pretty cool deal
that<00:01:31.860> way<00:01:32.100> i<00:01:32.369> mean<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:32.970> can<00:01:33.119> do<00:01:33.240> all<00:01:33.450> sorts<00:01:33.479> of

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
that way i mean you can do all sorts of

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.240 
that way i mean you can do all sorts of
things<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.880> you<00:01:35.880> can<00:01:36.060> basically<00:01:36.409> do<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.439> big<00:01:37.890> car

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
things so you can basically do a big car

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.340 
things so you can basically do a big car
track<00:01:38.579> where<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:38.970> want<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.329> press<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.020> button

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
track where you want to press a button

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.469 
track where you want to press a button
to<00:01:40.500> retrieve<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.400> cart<00:01:41.790> let's<00:01:42.030> say<00:01:42.270> you're

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
to retrieve a cart let's say you're

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.990 
to retrieve a cart let's say you're
sitting<00:01:43.229> on<00:01:43.350> like<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.189> roller<00:01:44.520> coaster<00:01:44.610> for

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
sitting on like a roller coaster for

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.270 
sitting on like a roller coaster for
example<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.720> press<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.020> button<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.979> cart

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
example you press a button and a cart

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.090 
example you press a button and a cart
will<00:01:47.490> come<00:01:48.360> up<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.680> don't<00:01:49.860> have<00:01:49.979> to

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
will come up to you so you don't have to

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.889 
will come up to you so you don't have to
keep<00:01:50.280> putting<00:01:50.579> down<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.880> new<00:01:51.149> card<00:01:51.450> each<00:01:51.600> time

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
keep putting down a new card each time

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.690 
keep putting down a new card each time
so<00:01:52.350> that's<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.590> pretty<00:01:52.770> cool<00:01:53.040> feature<00:01:53.340> right

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
so that's a pretty cool feature right

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.280 
so that's a pretty cool feature right
there<00:01:54.020> an<00:01:55.020> easy<00:01:55.380> way<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.770> fix<00:01:56.280> an<00:01:57.270> easy<00:01:57.990> way<00:01:58.229> to

simple<00:02:02.340> flat<00:02:04.219> powered<00:02:05.219> rail<00:02:05.490> be<00:02:06.270> able<00:02:06.450> to

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
simple flat powered rail be able to

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.930 
simple flat powered rail be able to
power<00:02:06.899> with<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.200> switch<00:02:07.590> there<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.220> as<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.819> can

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
power with a switch there so as you can

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.410 
power with a switch there so as you can
see<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.360> was<00:02:09.509> my<00:02:10.550> where<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.580> was<00:02:11.790> testing<00:02:12.300> it

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
see that was my where I was testing it

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.070 
see that was my where I was testing it
and

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
and

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.020 
and
so<00:02:14.010> now<00:02:14.220> our<00:02:14.250> sheep<00:02:14.760> buddy<00:02:15.060> can<00:02:16.280> have<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.310> good

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
so now our sheep buddy can have a good

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.650 
so now our sheep buddy can have a good
track<00:02:18.300> here<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:19.200> also<00:02:19.590> added<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.820> give<00:02:21.630> a

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
track here and I also added to give a

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.520 
track here and I also added to give a
little<00:02:21.930> more<00:02:22.080> example<00:02:22.770> to<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.580> detector

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
little more example to the detector

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.770 
little more example to the detector
track<00:02:25.530> now<00:02:26.100> this<00:02:26.340> this<00:02:26.610> is<00:02:26.970> very<00:02:27.270> cool<00:02:27.540> what

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
track now this this is very cool what

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.870 
track now this this is very cool what
you<00:02:27.900> can<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.620> capabilities<00:02:29.310> what<00:02:29.460> you<00:02:29.580> can<00:02:29.760> do

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
you can the capabilities what you can do

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.210 
you can the capabilities what you can do
with<00:02:30.060> this<00:02:30.270> as<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.320> can<00:02:31.440> see<00:02:31.680> right<00:02:31.710> here<00:02:32.130> I

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
with this as you can see right here I

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.200 
with this as you can see right here I
actually<00:02:33.350> loop<00:02:34.350> this<00:02:34.710> detector<00:02:35.340> track<00:02:35.640> over

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
actually loop this detector track over

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.970 
actually loop this detector track over
to<00:02:36.420> another<00:02:38.660> another<00:02:39.660> powered<00:02:40.200> rail<00:02:40.500> track

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
to another another powered rail track

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.720 
to another another powered rail track
another<00:02:41.400> car<00:02:42.270> track<00:02:42.630> so<00:02:43.080> i<00:02:44.030> am<00:02:45.030> just<00:02:45.060> going<00:02:45.540> to

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
another car track so i am just going to

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:56.780 
another car track so i am just going to
briefly<00:02:47.730> power<00:02:48.330> this<00:02:48.690> over<00:02:49.110> here<00:02:55.580> and<00:02:56.580> that

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
briefly power this over here and that

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.580 
briefly power this over here and that
that<00:02:57.240> is<00:02:57.390> powered<00:02:57.660> right<00:02:57.870> there<00:02:58.110> so<00:02:58.380> we<00:02:58.500> will

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
that is powered right there so we will

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.290 
that is powered right there so we will
get<00:02:58.860> this<00:02:59.820> cart<00:03:00.240> back<00:03:00.630> up<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:00.990> top<00:03:01.110> there

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
get this cart back up to the top there

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.460 
get this cart back up to the top there
well<00:03:03.770> that<00:03:04.770> did<00:03:04.980> not<00:03:05.100> power<00:03:05.430> very<00:03:05.700> well<00:03:05.910> did<00:03:06.090> it

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
well that did not power very well did it

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.840 
well that did not power very well did it
how<00:03:07.470> do<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.770> know<00:03:07.890> what<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.040> think<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.459> is<00:03:08.490> I

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
how do you know what I think it is I

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.270 
how do you know what I think it is I
think<00:03:08.910> I<00:03:09.330> put<00:03:09.630> it<00:03:09.750> in<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:09.959> wrong<00:03:10.260> direction

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:33.440 

alright<00:03:14.280> let's<00:03:14.520> see<00:03:14.700> if<00:03:14.760> that

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.850 

sorry<00:03:34.450> guys<00:03:34.690> I'm<00:03:34.870> messing<00:03:35.260> around<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:35.620> fist

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
sorry guys I'm messing around the fist

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.770 
sorry guys I'm messing around the fist
trying<00:03:36.160> to<00:03:36.280> get<00:03:36.790> it<00:03:36.910> just<00:03:37.090> right<00:03:37.240> as<00:03:37.480> you<00:03:37.630> can

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
trying to get it just right as you can

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.410 
trying to get it just right as you can
see<00:03:37.960> even<00:03:38.080> i<00:03:38.320> don't<00:03:38.350> know<00:03:38.730> how<00:03:39.730> this<00:03:40.030> works

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
see even i don't know how this works

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:49.710 
see even i don't know how this works
exactly<00:03:41.670> hmm<00:03:43.320> that<00:03:44.320> isn't<00:03:44.680> wanting<00:03:45.040> to<00:03:48.720> power

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
exactly hmm that isn't wanting to power

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.410 
exactly hmm that isn't wanting to power
it<00:03:50.020> enough<00:03:50.320> anyways<00:03:50.740> um<00:03:50.980> I'll<00:03:51.820> just<00:03:52.180> continue

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
it enough anyways um I'll just continue

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.730 
it enough anyways um I'll just continue
with<00:03:52.780> its<00:03:52.959> example<00:03:53.530> so<00:03:54.510> this<00:03:55.510> detector<00:03:56.260> track

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 
with its example so this detector track

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.460 
with its example so this detector track
has<00:03:57.070> so<00:03:57.490> many<00:03:57.610> possibilities<00:03:58.150> will<00:03:58.959> see<00:03:59.230> right

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
has so many possibilities will see right

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.990 
has so many possibilities will see right
here<00:03:59.890> if<00:04:00.070> we<00:04:00.820> turn<00:04:01.120> this<00:04:01.330> on<00:04:01.600> for<00:04:02.380> the<00:04:02.470> Sheep

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
here if we turn this on for the Sheep

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.120 
here if we turn this on for the Sheep
he'll<00:04:04.000> actually<00:04:04.240> roll<00:04:04.660> over<00:04:04.959> this<00:04:05.110> and<00:04:05.350> start

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
he'll actually roll over this and start

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.120 
he'll actually roll over this and start
that<00:04:06.370> other<00:04:06.820> track<00:04:07.390> over<00:04:07.750> here<00:04:08.140> so<00:04:08.650> there<00:04:09.100> are

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
that other track over here so there are

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.030 
that other track over here so there are
many<00:04:09.640> things<00:04:10.000> you<00:04:10.180> can<00:04:10.420> do<00:04:10.570> with<00:04:10.720> that<00:04:10.920> as<00:04:11.920> you

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
many things you can do with that as you

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.280 
many things you can do with that as you
can<00:04:12.250> see<00:04:12.489> just<00:04:12.520> keeps<00:04:13.180> looping<00:04:13.450> around<00:04:13.720> here

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
can see just keeps looping around here

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.810 
can see just keeps looping around here
and<00:04:14.410> going<00:04:15.310> on<00:04:15.550> that<00:04:15.760> detector<00:04:16.359> track<00:04:16.660> which

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
and going on that detector track which

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.280 
and going on that detector track which
enables<00:04:18.820> this<00:04:19.030> each<00:04:19.299> time<00:04:19.329> to<00:04:19.900> be<00:04:20.019> able<00:04:20.109> to

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
enables this each time to be able to

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.340 
enables this each time to be able to
boost<00:04:20.590> another<00:04:21.370> card<00:04:21.700> around<00:04:22.030> so<00:04:22.900> that<00:04:22.930> is

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
boost another card around so that is

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.840 
boost another card around so that is
pretty<00:04:23.680> cool<00:04:23.770> there<00:04:24.220> is<00:04:24.400> so<00:04:24.730> many

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
pretty cool there is so many

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.810 
pretty cool there is so many
capabilities<00:04:25.169> with<00:04:26.169> this<00:04:26.440> new<00:04:26.680> cart<00:04:27.250> system

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
capabilities with this new cart system

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.960 
capabilities with this new cart system
I'm<00:04:28.300> very<00:04:28.960> glad<00:04:29.169> that<00:04:29.290> notch<00:04:29.770> and<00:04:30.070> the<00:04:30.250> guys<00:04:30.730> at

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
I'm very glad that notch and the guys at

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.210 
I'm very glad that notch and the guys at
mojang<00:04:31.419> we're<00:04:31.750> able<00:04:31.930> to<00:04:32.110> put<00:04:32.320> this<00:04:32.440> in<00:04:32.680> because

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
mojang we're able to put this in because

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.250 
mojang we're able to put this in because
it<00:04:34.260> saves<00:04:35.260> so<00:04:35.560> much<00:04:35.970> work<00:04:36.970> instead<00:04:37.870> of<00:04:37.990> doing

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
it saves so much work instead of doing

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.700 
it saves so much work instead of doing
booster<00:04:38.710> tracks<00:04:39.010> now<00:04:39.250> we<00:04:39.910> have<00:04:40.120> our<00:04:40.270> own
