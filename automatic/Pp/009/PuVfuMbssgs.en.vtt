00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
so as you see we're going to kind of

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.260 
so as you see we're going to kind of
progress<00:02:04.920> down<00:02:07.520> now<00:02:08.520> I'm<00:02:08.670> keeping<00:02:09.030> all<00:02:09.119> the

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
flowers and similar groupings so I'm not

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.300 
flowers and similar groupings so I'm not
really<00:02:13.080> mixing<00:02:13.620> up<00:02:13.770> like<00:02:13.950> this<00:02:14.040> is<00:02:14.190> really

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
really mixing up like this is really

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.500 
really mixing up like this is really
going<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.520> be<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.640> sunflower<00:02:15.030> area<00:02:15.330> this<00:02:15.450> is

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
going to be the sunflower area this is

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.420 
going to be the sunflower area this is
going<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.840> gerber<00:02:16.110> daisy<00:02:16.290> area<00:02:16.650> I<00:02:16.920> just

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
going to the gerber daisy area I just

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.190 
going to the gerber daisy area I just
think<00:02:17.520> that's<00:02:17.670> kind<00:02:17.940> of<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.209> nice<00:02:18.480> modern<00:02:18.810> take

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
think that's kind of a nice modern take

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.760
