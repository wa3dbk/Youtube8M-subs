00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.720
 the numbers correspond to it 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.480
 program you choose 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.570

 special programs including 6 shore is 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.420
 well that is also cold at 40 degrees then 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.190
 number 7 is silk and the delicate fabrics 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.050
 such as a lingerie 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.850
 but you can also watch out the curtains 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.220
 that's at 30 degrees 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.650
 then 8 the special program for jeans 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.320
 you at 40 degrees but to ensure 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.210
 that you wear 10 pieces as little as possible 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.490
 then number nine is for the sportswear 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.490
 a special washing programs also really the 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.619
 swede also goes well beyond 10 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.140

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.019
 program that was for a maximum of two 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.110
 pairs of shoes than the drying programs 11 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.580
 is for cotton to dry 12 is for 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.739
 synthetic rubber eyes 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.450
 13 I actually think violence is the toughest 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.670
 program that does the washing 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.500
 and drying at the same time that is alone 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.310
 for small quantities up to half 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.660
 kilos 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.250
 so if you need your jeans quickly 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.739
 We need as he also dried 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.420
 immediately after that it is only possible 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.420
 also of course for a few shirts 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.780
 then him three more programs 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.300
 this is to leave an extra time 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.520
 then rinse the program to even 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.380
 get extra certified and you were allowed to 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.900
 have used rinsing stop to the water 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.220
 to pump off then still have if function 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.590
 eco time 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.630
 if you could do a little laundry 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.010
 turn and use soak orange looks too 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.950
 that in reduced 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.530
 in terms of time but then you also use less 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.300
 less water flow and quicker 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.480
 ready but only meant for the little ones 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.480
 washes 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.580
 all washing programs are natural 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.590
 ideally set up but you could have your own 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.720
 program still want green then 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.790
 as a function also eco time 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.770
 eco time is for the smaller ones 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.720
 yes then get ready faster from 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.060
 that less energy and also less 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.900
 but water is meant for that couple 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.760
 shirts 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.260
 Do you wish you were good as little as possible 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.330
 wrinkles come out then have it 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.370
 program that this is the ironable 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.020
 up there that is easier for me 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.540
 he has a special ironing 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.000
 way of moving and then it comes 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.320
 all less printed out than you are 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.860
 option would like him sometime 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.959
 extra rinse we use this 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.459
 to this function is for delayed 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.550
 Start 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.650
 and that is possible up to 24 hours and also the 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.470
 You can adjust the temperature of the washing programs 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.940
 also adjust yourself and have this 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.500
 button is an additional feature that you own 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.790
 can choose the speed 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.790
 up to 14 rpm 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.519
 and then the best of these 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.890
 washing machine that he can wash and dry 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.019
 but can't do that at the same time 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.030
 that's with the cotton programs and with 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.620
 the jeans program then we grab it 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.049
 buttons and you can see that over there masse 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.780
 42 minutes but you want him then 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.000
 let it dry again 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.090
 follow it at the same time and then you can 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.930
 that a3 is completely dry 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.760
 a2 the hanger is dry and a1 is iron dry 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.570
 and he does it in a flowing one 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.000
 movement 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.620
 directly behind it the only thing you 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.260
 of course you have to pay attention 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.979
 he was up to 7 pounds and it dried to 5 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.320
 kilos 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.240
 so do n't throw in more than 5 pounds 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.720
 if you also want it washed and 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.060
 to dry 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.039
 at the same time and after choosing how to dry 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.240
 you can just have it on 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:56.370
 let it dry for a while 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:59.669
 180 minutes and so on until well 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.669
 30 minutes 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.940
 then load left above the sea 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.130
 no one you states so the left 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.160

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.780
