00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.260
 I entered Alf and probably 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.410
 From about 2 tour eyes 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.850
 yeah 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.250
 Because I think it's quartz 20 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.470
 29 number to not say exactly 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.939
 3 years to 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.939
 It became topography, prefecture 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.340

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.480
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.040
 I male and I was sound representation to put out of their own 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.220
 Can you express it? Kids 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.040
 By 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.150
 Layered 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.350
 It is easy to use 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:57.350
 I to be Sneh was not that the idea to other Dora manufacturers 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:01:00.540
 Numata hen egg rum is a great fun product or a great product 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:06.960
 Of course, it made a boom stand Shi unbearable 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:10.590
 I remember the great pedals of the iron cobra after a few minutes or a 5-minute bus or 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.150
 Terribly exciting that even in that sense 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.320
 I'm a company, and I will also find a job 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.320
 Fish bach 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:25.990
 Softening Hey really to be thought variety of course lineup of various color 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.590
 I chose it freely 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:34.539
 I didn't think about it just saying 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.430
 There were various color lineups , so I was really lost but I really want to try it elsewhere 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:40.540
 I thought a little bit 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:46.600
 There was a bit of something to say when I told it a bit 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:48.500
 There is a place where you can not get rid of something in yourself by all means 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.180
 I wonder if trying to make to give racers 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.180
 At that time that 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.450
 I'll let you know when I hate the house where my soul's nectar was also taken care of 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.710
 Oh 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:07.470
 I think I did not think about frosting, so I was thinking about the stage bytes for a while 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:11.810
 Beautiful to do even better to Kana and I'd thought Kachotto grateful sometimes hit the front 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:16.430
 I Do not never done until now and Well But the rainy season 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.210
 I was told that it would be scary or horrible if you had me make it 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.280
 It was an expression 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.280
 I 'm great I'm best in the middle commander 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.819
 What is important as a driver N Bessho's not what it does not become complacent Kana ultimate 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:42.180
 Speaking 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:43.200
 So N band as of the day there but would be session session Darouga 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.580
 that 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:50.910
 Well if it says a session, it is really only one night 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.200
 Also and other bread Continuing anxiety fin like in 12 years 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.720
 It will 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.070
 That in the 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.070
 I wonder what 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.470
 That moment 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:09.840
 Make a story properly 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:14.640
 How to train the message properly in words 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:17.480
 It is still conductor-like how to take it away to be easy to convey 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.460
 Drummer's being 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.450
 I think I wonder what the standing position 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.450
 It is difficult though 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.520
 To say the ultimate thing 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.030
 It's all 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:40.319

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:52.610
 yeah 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:53.430
 I think that in many places this sound will be heard more often by your eyes 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.490
 But 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:03.530
 I have just bought a cd by all means and now mountain climbers day and with all means 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:08.320
 I would like you to type the key sound of the cat's egg drum 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.320
 In the future, including the Dora Dora, I would like to thank you in the morning for the Hokusen. 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.300
