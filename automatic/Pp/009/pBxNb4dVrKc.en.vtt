00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.450 
when I don't feel like doing my hair I
can<00:00:48.360> slap<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.289> go<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:50.340> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
can slap this on and go and in the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.160 
can slap this on and go and in the
winter<00:00:50.700> time<00:00:50.940> especially<00:00:51.239> it's<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.899> good

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
winter time especially it's a good

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.560 
winter time especially it's a good
protective<00:00:52.739> style<00:00:53.039> especially<00:00:53.969> being<00:00:54.480> that

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
protective style especially being that

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.290 
protective style especially being that
my<00:00:54.750> hair<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:54.989> very<00:00:55.140> very<00:00:55.920> dry<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.579> then<00:00:57.120> it

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
my hair is very very dry and then it

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.939 
my hair is very very dry and then it
gives<00:00:57.420> me<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> chance<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.109> corner<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.530> my<00:00:58.680> hair

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
gives me a chance the corner on my hair

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.400 
gives me a chance the corner on my hair
and<00:00:59.160> then<00:00:59.579> just<00:00:59.760> leave<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.180> alone<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.960> I'm<00:01:01.230> not

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
and then just leave it alone so I'm not

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.820 
and then just leave it alone so I'm not
manipulating<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.370> as<00:01:02.520> much<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.830> basically

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
manipulating it as much so basically

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.740 
manipulating it as much so basically

something that I really want to like let

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.090 
something that I really want to like let
you<00:01:26.939> guys<00:01:27.119> know<00:01:27.420> if<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:28.200> decide<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.680> get<00:01:28.799> like

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
you guys know if you decide to get like

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.410 
you guys know if you decide to get like
all<00:01:29.430> natural<00:01:30.150> looking<00:01:30.509> weave<00:01:31.759> you<00:01:32.759> need<00:01:33.210> one

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
all natural looking weave you need one

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.960 
all natural looking weave you need one
of<00:01:33.450> these<00:01:33.630> bad<00:01:33.930> boys<00:01:34.170> or<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.369> can<00:01:35.549> simply<00:01:35.759> just

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
of these bad boys or you can simply just

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.590 
of these bad boys or you can simply just
use<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:37.400> net<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.610> comes<00:01:38.939> with<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.420> weave

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
use the net that comes with the weave

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.920 
use the net that comes with the weave
when<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.900> purchase<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.740> keep<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.549> in<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
when you purchase it and keep it in the

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.200 
when you purchase it and keep it in the
casing<00:01:42.930> but<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.409> think<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.460> it's<00:01:44.670> good<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:44.939> do

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
casing but I think that it's good to do

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.660 
casing but I think that it's good to do
that<00:01:45.450> because<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:46.680> curlier<00:01:47.130> weaves<00:01:47.399> get

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
that because the curlier weaves get

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.550 
that because the curlier weaves get
messed<00:01:47.939> up<00:01:48.149> entangled<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.200> easily<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:51.560> part

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
messed up entangled so easily and part

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.850 
messed up entangled so easily and part
of<00:01:52.680> like<00:01:52.950> maintaining<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.030> look<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.860> this

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
of like maintaining the look of it this

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.100 
of like maintaining the look of it this
really<00:01:56.189> helps<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.700> out<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.180> it's<00:01:57.360> like<00:01:57.570> keeping

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
really helps it out so it's like keeping

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.249 
really helps it out so it's like keeping
its<00:01:58.469> shape<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.979> then<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.700> net<00:01:59.969> helps<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.750> from

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
its shape and then the net helps it from

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.440 
its shape and then the net helps it from
