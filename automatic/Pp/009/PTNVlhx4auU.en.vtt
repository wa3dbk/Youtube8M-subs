00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.049
 save beauty people guys 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.950
 Good, I'll do biro neodi's review. 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.920
 Hi, what's up guys, I know I stayed. 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.660
 without doing the obvious I think a couple of 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.630
 or three weeks, right? 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.970
 some people already know the reason for 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.689
 I have not done any reviews 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.080
 and I'm here to clarify the reason 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:31.619
 and the asset is these people that I've broken 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.140
 okay my arm I broke my arm and I 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.680
 I'll try to do reviews anyway 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.640
 Let's see if I can do it. 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.489
 not at the moment 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.280
 I can already play those little fingers. 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.730
 things are much easier medium 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.640
 articulate the broken arm and that's it 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.140
 So people, I hope you have 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.199
 clarified, right? 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.510
 The reason I did not do more reviews 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.699
 Anyway, guys, that's enough of that, right? 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.620
 talk broken arm let's talk here 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.379
 that figure that hand 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.520
 this one is the beetle as I already said 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.369
 before is that the ultimate version 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.310
 this version has already appeared in the 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.770
 drawing the ultimate spider man or us 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.820
 nec comics also flame ultimate 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.820
 Spider man 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.880
 I was already expecting this very figure 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.280
 time I thought this version of the 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.890
 figure would be released in the spider series 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.829
 man classics, but unfortunately she does not 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.700
 was released and I do not know the reason but 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.119
 face 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.850
 thank goodness that they launched because this 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.040
 figure here she will be part of the 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.329
 my collection of spiderman figures 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:49.649
 the ultimate universe right and this manu 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:52.229
 beetle he is from the infinity series he is from 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.880
 series of the same series of those two 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.640
 other figures I've scored and saw 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:01.560
 not the spider man and the elektro 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.490
 amazing spider man 2 and this beetle it 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.280
 has a variant figure 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.130
 Well, in this case it would be this figure here. 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.099
 which is what I think is boomerang captain 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:16.810
 I'm not really sure if this one from here 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:19.239
 the correct name is it anyway but the series 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.470
 infinity in it brings two figures there 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.830
 variants né 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:28.660
 is the beetle the other is the merengue captain 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.590
 The beetle is articulated in the head in the 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.080
 chest 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.890
 I think it's very important that figure 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.269
 in the chest because 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.450
 makes it possible for us to do 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.380
 various poses of the beetle flying these 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.870
 things 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.480
 So I thought it was very important that 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:52.209
 articulation here is the beetle too 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.470
 articulated in the arms at the waist and 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.620
 elbows 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.880
 he has two elbow joints 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:04.720
 on the elbows here and the other here is the 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:08.109
 The beetle's hand also articulated the 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:11.650
 zhou also has leg joints 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:15.340
 they spin, and he has two 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:21.640
 joints in the knees and also has 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:24.459
 foot joints is personal is these 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:28.239
 here beetle wings they are removable 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:30.760
 state they actually come 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.810
 loose snow you have to fit in 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.989
 beetle and very cool face here I 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.180
 I think her painting is expensive 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:44.109
 the beetle painting was very cool 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.569
 I went to hell and people this pair 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:49.750
 here is the beetle and captain boomerang 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:54.220
 they were called the light falls 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:57.190
 né in the infinity series né mano 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.200
 It's two legal figures, man. I do not know. 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.990
 If I intend to catch the merengue captain 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.580
 it is because as a variant figure 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.620
 I think it 's harder to find 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.590
 in stores right? 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.510
 the mask is that 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.700
 This one from here, as you have seen, is the 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.680
 beetle card 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.840
 and here we have other figures from the 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.330
 series, we can see that it has 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.830
 several other variant figures do not 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:25.900
 of the black cat's carnage and is also 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.480
 as I already told you about the beetle 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:33.730
 well these are the figures in the series 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:36.730
 it's not the six security guards they 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:40.480
 here the Czech team is 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:43.960
 green sick of the ultimate universe and hand 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.710
 is here with you have realized is not the 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:50.560
 the back of the card and here 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:53.220
 the two characters who are 10 east 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:57.370
 falls né the beetle and the captain merengue 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:00.340
 and here we have a brief 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.800
 The story of the effort is yours. 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:06.220
 want to read can cause the 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:09.270
 Video whatever be comfortable where the 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.820
 people have a little nigga spider man 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:16.360

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:19.630
 right beetle and other guys I brought here 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.820
 infinity card cirs only this one 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.670
 Caution here she is from the amazing spider 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:28.000
 man 2 and this one is from another figure 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:31.300
 in case it would be a beetle free people 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.910
 you can see that the drawings on the side 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:37.390
 on cards moved right 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:41.080
 I do not know why this is good, and here. 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:44.860
 as I already showed is the front part 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.880
 of the card and here is his name laide 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.000
 false 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:52.600
 and here is another side with the same 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.450
 drawing here is the top of the 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.010
 chart and we can see that has changed 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.620
 the crazy is not 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:02.260
 in comparison to this logo here do not 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.040
 amazing spider man 2 and spider that stays 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.530
 on the part of 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:09.100
 up also you can see that 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:11.680
 changed everything on the top until the 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:16.170
 drawing of the spider and that's it guys 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:19.270
 hence this is the beetle cartel 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:22.360
 so galley the beetle 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.770
 it comes with the leprechaun's left leg 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.190
 green 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:30.490
 I really liked this part here, huh? 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:32.440
 which is kind of from the torn pants 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.860
 the emd I thought it was pretty cool 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.860
 same 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:43.210
 here it is articulated in the knees, right? 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.900
 have two knee joints are 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.200
 good 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:52.000
 this articulation here and this one that 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:53.920
 is also appearing here articulated 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.960
 I thought it was really cool. 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:03.970
 this detail is what gives them are 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:08.460
 very large and the details here too 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:11.350

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:13.660

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:15.730

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.650

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:29.620

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:32.890

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:47.260
 It's for you to see the figure and face. 

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.750
