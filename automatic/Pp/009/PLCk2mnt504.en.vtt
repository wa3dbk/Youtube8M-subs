but<00:04:37.610> I<00:04:37.970> do<00:04:38.479> crazy<00:04:38.900> certain<00:04:39.229> things<00:04:39.470> that<00:04:39.530> I

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
but I do crazy certain things that I

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.950 
but I do crazy certain things that I
normally<00:04:39.740> wouldn't<00:04:40.370> have<00:04:40.430> craved<00:04:40.820> it's<00:04:41.389> just

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960
