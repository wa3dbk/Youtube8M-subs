foot I stained it using some wakow
Danish<00:00:44.350> oil<00:00:44.739> this<00:00:45.579> will<00:00:45.639> be<00:00:45.879> the<00:00:46.089> top<00:00:46.420> surface

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:46.659 
Danish oil this will be the top surface

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:47.459 
Danish oil this will be the top surface
of<00:00:46.929> the<00:00:47.079> desk

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
of the desk

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:54.799 
of the desk
I<00:00:48.210> also<00:00:49.210> took<00:00:49.420> a<00:00:50.249> 2x4<00:00:52.319> rounded<00:00:53.319> all<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:53.620> edges

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
I also took a 2x4 rounded all the edges

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.899 
I also took a 2x4 rounded all the edges
then<00:00:55.809> I<00:00:55.839> cut<00:00:56.109> off<00:00:56.260> and<00:00:56.559> made<00:00:57.129> a<00:00:57.159> riser<00:00:57.489> for<00:00:57.789> the

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:57.909 
then I cut off and made a riser for the

00:00:57.909 --> 00:00:59.579 
then I cut off and made a riser for the
end<00:00:58.059> of<00:00:58.179> the<00:00:58.269> table<00:00:58.420> the<00:00:58.929> rest<00:00:59.199> of<00:00:59.379> the<00:00:59.469> table

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
end of the table the rest of the table

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:01.199 
end of the table the rest of the table
will<00:00:59.769> be<00:00:59.829> supported<00:01:00.280> against<00:01:00.579> the<00:01:00.699> wall<00:01:00.909> on<00:01:01.120> a

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:01.209 
will be supported against the wall on a

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:05.070 
will be supported against the wall on a
ledger<00:01:02.079> board<00:01:02.549> so<00:01:03.570> here's<00:01:04.570> what<00:01:04.690> I<00:01:04.720> have<00:01:04.839> right

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
ledger board so here's what I have right

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.570 
ledger board so here's what I have right
now<00:01:06.119> I'll<00:01:07.119> show<00:01:07.299> you<00:01:07.479> it's<00:01:08.170> a<00:01:08.260> subway<00:01:08.550> well<00:01:09.550> I

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
now I'll show you it's a subway well I

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.010 
now I'll show you it's a subway well I
don't<00:01:09.850> know<00:01:09.910> if<00:01:10.030> it's<00:01:10.120> a<00:01:10.180> combination<00:01:10.750> of<00:01:10.810> me

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
don't know if it's a combination of me

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.350 
don't know if it's a combination of me
not<00:01:11.260> looking<00:01:11.770> at<00:01:12.040> the<00:01:12.400> project<00:01:12.970> board<00:01:13.120> when<00:01:13.330> I

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
not looking at the project board when I

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.060 
not looking at the project board when I
bought<00:01:13.630> it<00:01:13.660> or<00:01:13.960> may<00:01:14.230> just<00:01:14.260> the<00:01:14.560> heat<00:01:14.770> here<00:01:14.980> in

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
bought it or may just the heat here in

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.280 
bought it or may just the heat here in
Arizona<00:01:15.430> it's<00:01:16.090> 110<00:01:16.690> right<00:01:16.900> now<00:01:17.020> while<00:01:17.260> I'm

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
Arizona it's 110 right now while I'm

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.810 
Arizona it's 110 right now while I'm
filling<00:01:17.560> this<00:01:17.770> but<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.840> tabletop<00:01:20.820> developed

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
filling this but the tabletop developed

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.580 
filling this but the tabletop developed
a<00:01:21.850> little<00:01:22.030> bit<00:01:22.120> of<00:01:22.180> a<00:01:22.270> bow<00:01:22.450> so<00:01:23.260> what<00:01:23.380> I'm<00:01:23.470> going

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
a little bit of a bow so what I'm going

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.630 
a little bit of a bow so what I'm going
to<00:01:23.620> do<00:01:23.770> is<00:01:23.920> I<00:01:24.100> plan<00:01:24.670> on<00:01:24.700> using<00:01:25.210> this<00:01:26.140> one<00:01:26.410> by<00:01:27.190> one

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
to do is I plan on using this one by one

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.740 
to do is I plan on using this one by one
let's<00:01:28.030> learn<00:01:28.180> a<00:01:28.240> half<00:01:28.450> body<00:01:28.660> 1<00:01:29.640> 4<00:01:30.640> as<00:01:30.970> a<00:01:31.360> ledger

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
let's learn a half body 1 4 as a ledger

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.930 
let's learn a half body 1 4 as a ledger
in<00:01:32.290> the<00:01:32.410> back<00:01:32.620> I'm<00:01:32.890> still<00:01:33.340> going<00:01:33.460> to<00:01:33.520> use<00:01:33.670> it<00:01:33.850> in

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
in the back I'm still going to use it in

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.280 
in the back I'm still going to use it in
the<00:01:34.030> back<00:01:34.210> because<00:01:34.600> that's<00:01:34.690> nice<00:01:35.020> and<00:01:35.260> flat

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
the back because that's nice and flat

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.410 
the back because that's nice and flat
but<00:01:36.040> on<00:01:36.190> the<00:01:36.340> edges<00:01:36.790> where<00:01:37.000> it's<00:01:37.120> got<00:01:37.270> the

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
but on the edges where it's got the

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.770 
but on the edges where it's got the
crown<00:01:37.720> or<00:01:38.470> I<00:01:38.530> put<00:01:38.920> a<00:01:38.950> piece<00:01:39.100> of<00:01:39.250> 2x4<00:01:39.780> against

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
crown or I put a piece of 2x4 against

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.080 
crown or I put a piece of 2x4 against
the<00:01:40.900> wall<00:01:41.050> and<00:01:41.350> I'll<00:01:42.130> have<00:01:42.310> enough<00:01:42.670> meat<00:01:42.940> in

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
the wall and I'll have enough meat in

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.820 
the wall and I'll have enough meat in
that<00:01:43.150> 2x4<00:01:43.480> where<00:01:43.810> I<00:01:43.870> can<00:01:44.020> screw<00:01:44.320> down<00:01:44.530> and

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
that 2x4 where I can screw down and

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.060 
that 2x4 where I can screw down and
actually<00:01:45.460> straighten<00:01:46.170> flatten<00:01:47.170> out<00:01:47.260> the<00:01:47.500> the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
actually straighten flatten out the the

00:01:48.070 --> 00:02:19.820 
actually straighten flatten out the the
crown<00:01:48.340> and<00:01:48.610> make<00:01:48.909> the<00:01:49.030> desk<00:01:49.210> nice<00:01:49.420> and<00:01:49.630> flat

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.589 

so<00:02:20.830> it's<00:02:21.010> 110<00:02:21.489> degrees<00:02:21.519> outside<00:02:21.970> this<00:02:22.480> is

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
so it's 110 degrees outside this is

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.860 
so it's 110 degrees outside this is
where<00:02:22.720> you<00:02:22.870> stay<00:02:23.200> cool<00:02:23.470> so<00:02:24.099> a<00:02:24.629> cool<00:02:25.629> towel

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
where you stay cool so a cool towel

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.699 
where you stay cool so a cool towel
basically<00:02:26.680> you<00:02:26.769> just<00:02:26.799> take<00:02:27.010> it<00:02:28.110> get<00:02:29.110> it<00:02:29.230> wet<00:02:29.410> I

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
basically you just take it get it wet I

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.100 
basically you just take it get it wet I
use<00:02:30.519> ice<00:02:30.670> water<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.950> wring<00:02:33.160> it<00:02:33.280> out<00:02:33.400> and

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
use ice water you wring it out and

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:42.360 
use ice water you wring it out and
supposed<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.170> snap<00:02:35.500> it<00:02:35.709> like<00:02:36.579> this<00:02:40.769> and<00:02:41.769> the

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
supposed to snap it like this and the
