00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
we need to do to begin with to make it a

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.110 
we need to do to begin with to make it a
little<00:00:07.770> bit<00:00:08.010> easier<00:00:08.340> so<00:00:08.400> I'm<00:00:08.670> going<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:08.940> do<00:00:09.090> a

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
little bit easier so I'm going to do a

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.520 
little bit easier so I'm going to do a
line<00:00:09.389> when<00:00:09.690> you<00:00:09.780> stitch<00:00:10.019> it<00:00:10.050> around<00:00:10.380> the

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
line when you stitch it around the

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.070 
line when you stitch it around the
neckline<00:00:10.710> on<00:00:11.250> both<00:00:11.490> sides<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:12.420> gather<00:00:12.660> it<00:00:12.840> then

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
neckline on both sides to gather it then

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.289 
neckline on both sides to gather it then
so<00:00:13.620> I'm<00:00:13.679> doing<00:00:13.799> that<00:00:13.889> so<00:00:14.190> already<00:00:14.549> I've<00:00:15.240> got

tutorial<00:01:30.159> where<00:01:30.640> things<00:01:30.850> will<00:01:30.969> be<00:01:31.090> a<00:01:31.119> little

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
tutorial where things will be a little

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.499 
tutorial where things will be a little
bit<00:01:31.509> clearer<00:01:31.840> but<00:01:32.380> I'm<00:01:33.130> going<00:01:33.340> to<00:01:33.429> just<00:01:33.609> start

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
bit clearer but I'm going to just start

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.440 
bit clearer but I'm going to just start
by<00:01:34.689> putting<00:01:35.079> three<00:01:35.380> stitches<00:01:36.009> in<00:01:36.219> quite<00:01:37.149> small

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
by putting three stitches in quite small

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.679 
by putting three stitches in quite small
in<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:37.899> same<00:01:38.170> place<00:01:38.469> and<00:01:38.740> that<00:01:38.799> will<00:01:38.950> just

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
in the same place and that will just

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.760 
in the same place and that will just
strengthen<00:01:40.689> the<00:01:40.780> knot<00:01:40.959> there<00:01:41.229> to<00:01:41.500> begin<00:01:41.619> with

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
strengthen the knot there to begin with

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.940 
strengthen the knot there to begin with
and<00:01:42.130> then<00:01:42.579> I'm<00:01:43.030> going<00:01:43.240> to<00:01:43.359> go<00:01:43.450> in<00:01:43.630> come<00:01:44.319> out<00:01:44.619> on

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
and then I'm going to go in come out on

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.730 
and then I'm going to go in come out on
the<00:01:45.069> same<00:01:45.340> side<00:01:45.899> go<00:01:46.899> across<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.590> other
