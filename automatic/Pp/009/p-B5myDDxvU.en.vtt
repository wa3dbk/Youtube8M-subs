basic rule of thumb is we need to be

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.410 
basic rule of thumb is we need to be
eating<00:00:57.870> lower<00:00:58.379> on<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.190> marine<00:00:59.460> food<00:00:59.820> chain<00:01:00.180> we

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.330 
eating lower on the marine food chain we

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
of thumb to keep in mind is to think

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.230 
of thumb to keep in mind is to think
about<00:01:49.470> how<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.770> fish<00:01:50.189> were<00:01:50.399> caught<00:01:50.430> part<00:01:51.149> of

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
about how the fish were caught part of

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.550 
about how the fish were caught part of
the<00:01:51.299> reason<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:52.049> world's<00:01:52.350> fish

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
the reason that the world's fish

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.620 
the reason that the world's fish
populations<00:01:53.280> have<00:01:53.490> become<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.000> endangered<00:01:54.509> is

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
populations have become so endangered is

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.420 
populations have become so endangered is
because<00:01:54.869> we've<00:01:55.049> gotten<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.799> good<00:01:56.009> at<00:01:56.159> fishing

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
because we've gotten so good at fishing

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.310 
because we've gotten so good at fishing
but<00:01:56.759> we<00:01:56.850> can<00:01:57.000> go<00:01:57.119> after<00:01:57.299> them<00:01:57.540> with<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.960> net

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
but we can go after them with a net

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.109 
but we can go after them with a net
that's<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:58.829> large<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.579> could<00:01:59.729> literally

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
that's so large that it could literally

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.560 
that's so large that it could literally
pull<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:01.110> 747<00:02:02.100> airplane<00:02:02.280> off<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.060> bottom<00:02:03.420> of

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
pull a 747 airplane off the bottom of

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.170 
pull a 747 airplane off the bottom of
the<00:02:03.780> ocean<00:02:04.140> floor<00:02:04.350> now<00:02:04.740> smaller<00:02:05.280> fishers<00:02:05.939> and

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
the ocean floor now smaller fishers and

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.580 
the ocean floor now smaller fishers and
they're<00:02:06.270> still<00:02:06.479> going<00:02:06.719> after<00:02:06.840> fish<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.380> very

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
they're still going after fish in very

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.589 
they're still going after fish in very
selective<00:02:08.190> ways<00:02:08.429> like<00:02:08.759> with<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:08.970> hook<00:02:09.209> in<00:02:09.360> line

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
selective ways like with a hook in line

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.930 
selective ways like with a hook in line
with<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.289> smaller<00:02:10.739> net<00:02:11.129> with<00:02:11.400> all<00:02:11.520> sorts<00:02:11.819> of

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
with a smaller net with all sorts of

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.940 
with a smaller net with all sorts of
fish<00:02:12.209> traps<00:02:12.629> and<00:02:13.050> so<00:02:13.230> another<00:02:13.470> good<00:02:13.680> rule

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
fish traps and so another good rule

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.190 
fish traps and so another good rule
of<00:02:14.010> thumb<00:02:14.280> it's<00:02:14.640> choosing<00:02:15.090> fish<00:02:15.780> that's

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
of thumb it's choosing fish that's

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.250 
of thumb it's choosing fish that's
caught<00:02:16.590> by<00:02:16.860> smaller<00:02:17.400> fishers<00:02:18.180> more<00:02:18.750> artisanal

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
caught by smaller fishers more artisanal

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.559 
caught by smaller fishers more artisanal
fishing<00:02:19.739> techniques<00:02:20.370> is<00:02:20.580> also<00:02:21.180> a<00:02:21.209> good<00:02:21.390> bet

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
fishing techniques is also a good bet

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.030 
fishing techniques is also a good bet
that<00:02:21.599> you're<00:02:21.900> doing<00:02:22.140> better<00:02:22.260> for<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.680> ocean

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
that you're doing better for the ocean

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.680 
that you're doing better for the ocean
but<00:02:23.220> also<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.790> quality<00:02:24.209> of<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.360> fish<00:02:24.540> is

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
but also that the quality of the fish is

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.199 
but also that the quality of the fish is
likely<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:25.110> be<00:02:25.230> higher<00:02:26.030> whether<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.090> have

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
likely to be higher whether you have

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.820 
likely to be higher whether you have
health<00:02:27.450> concerns<00:02:27.959> or<00:02:28.140> you're<00:02:28.260> just<00:02:28.290> concerned

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
health concerns or you're just concerned

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.680 
health concerns or you're just concerned
about<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.340> fish<00:02:29.519> population<00:02:30.209> in<00:02:30.390> general

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
about the fish population in general

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.809 
about the fish population in general
it's<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.560> good<00:02:31.590> rule<00:02:31.950> of<00:02:31.980> thumb<00:02:32.099> to<00:02:32.340> begin

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
it's a good rule of thumb to begin

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.769 
it's a good rule of thumb to begin
eating<00:02:33.060> lower<00:02:33.360> on<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.900> marine<00:02:34.140> food<00:02:34.170> chain
