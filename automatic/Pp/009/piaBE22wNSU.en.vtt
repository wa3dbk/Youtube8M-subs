they'll change to blue and he now has
the<00:00:59.640> freeze<00:00:59.879> ray<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.750> that's<00:01:00.960> pretty<00:01:01.109> cool

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
the freeze ray so that's pretty cool

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.750 
the freeze ray so that's pretty cool
that's<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.859> then<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.219> can<00:01:02.370> keep<00:01:02.550> switching

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
that's and then you can keep switching

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.030 
that's and then you can keep switching
between<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.210> light<00:01:03.359> red<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.890> green<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:04.949> blue

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
between the light red and green and blue

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.980 
between the light red and green and blue
and<00:01:05.129> there's<00:01:05.970> also<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.210> red<00:01:06.390> one<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.630> fine<00:01:06.810> as

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
and there's also a red one to fine as

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.890 
and there's also a red one to fine as
well<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.850> then<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.450> does<00:01:09.630> sound<00:01:09.840> different

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
well so then that does sound different

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.359 
well so then that does sound different
now<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.680> freeze<00:01:11.250> your<00:01:11.520> enemies<00:01:13.369> I

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
now so you can freeze your enemies I

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.140 
now so you can freeze your enemies I
quite<00:01:14.970> like<00:01:15.090> freezing<00:01:15.390> these<00:01:15.630> ones<00:01:15.840> okay<00:01:16.530> and

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
quite like freezing these ones okay and

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.670 
quite like freezing these ones okay and
the<00:01:18.150> freeze<00:01:18.360> ray<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.900> freeze<00:01:19.229> ray<00:01:19.380> also

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
the freeze ray this freeze ray also

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.649 
the freeze ray this freeze ray also
opens<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.070> door<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:21.180> can't<00:01:21.390> do<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
opens that door you can't do it the

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.149 
opens that door you can't do it the
Greenland<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.799> stuff<00:01:23.159> like<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:24.049> so<00:01:25.159> I'm

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159

gonna start by giving you all of this

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.649 
gonna start by giving you all of this

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.600 
what you need to start with is paste
this<00:01:44.340> code<00:01:44.549> in<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:46.020> separate<00:01:47.009> layer<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.430> its

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
this code in to a separate layer of its

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.319 
this code in to a separate layer of its
own<00:01:48.530> all<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.680> goes<00:01:49.860> there<00:01:50.119> get<00:01:51.119> your<00:01:51.240> little

own all that goes there get your little
character<00:01:51.840> calling<00:01:52.680> char<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:54.619> get<00:01:55.619> another

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
character calling char and get another

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.539 
character calling char and get another
movie<00:01:57.180> clip<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.630> call<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.899> ground<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.920> if

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
movie clip and call it ground and if

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.520 
movie clip and call it ground and if
you've<00:01:59.670> got<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.299> mean<00:02:00.840> literally<00:02:01.200> if<00:02:01.409> I

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
you've got that I mean literally if I

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.030 
you've got that I mean literally if I
just<00:02:03.079> take<00:02:04.079> him<00:02:04.259> out<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.530> equation<00:02:04.740> just

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
just take him out of the equation just

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.059 
just take him out of the equation just
make<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:06.439> char<00:02:08.869> now<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.140> would<00:02:10.289> there<00:02:10.979> not

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
make that char now that would there not

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.100 
make that char now that would there not
been<00:02:11.220> there<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.459> fall<00:02:11.940> off<00:02:12.090> but<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.959> would

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
been there to fall off but that would

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.880 
been there to fall off but that would
now<00:02:13.200> be<00:02:13.260> my<00:02:13.500> care

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
now be my care

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.810 
now be my care
and<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:14.790> can<00:02:14.940> control<00:02:15.240> that<00:02:16.610> but<00:02:17.610> we<00:02:17.700> don't

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
and I can control that but we don't

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.680 
and I can control that but we don't
really<00:02:18.270> want<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.480> exactly<00:02:19.110> get<00:02:19.800> rid<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:19.950> that

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
really want that exactly get rid of that

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.220 
really want that exactly get rid of that
and<00:02:21.920> this<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.070> our<00:02:23.190> character<00:02:23.610> so<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.230> might

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
and this is our character so I might

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.040 
and this is our character so I might
even<00:02:25.760> yeah<00:02:26.760> well<00:02:26.910> I'll<00:02:27.030> upload<00:02:27.270> this<00:02:27.480> tutorial

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050

this is my character and if I go into it

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.600 
this is my character and if I go into it
he's<00:02:39.840> got<00:02:40.020> all<00:02:40.650> these<00:02:40.860> different<00:02:41.010> animations

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
fly red so I'll explain that in another

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.970 
fly red so I'll explain that in another
tutorial

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
tutorial

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.040 
tutorial
that's<00:03:11.550> why<00:03:11.760> we'll<00:03:12.000> with<00:03:12.120> this<00:03:12.300> thing<00:03:12.780> here

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
that's why we'll with this thing here

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.670 
that's why we'll with this thing here
and<00:03:13.290> this<00:03:13.560> thing<00:03:13.800> here<00:03:14.480> but<00:03:15.480> just<00:03:16.440> try<00:03:16.620> and

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
and this thing here but just try and

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.750 
and this thing here but just try and
keep<00:03:16.770> the<00:03:16.890> head<00:03:17.100> if<00:03:17.340> you're<00:03:17.459> gonna<00:03:17.580> do<00:03:17.730> like

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
keep the head if you're gonna do like

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.520 
keep the head if you're gonna do like
this<00:03:18.030> in<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.480> same<00:03:18.720> position<00:03:19.140> so<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.410> head

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
this in the same position so the head

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.490 
this in the same position so the head
doesn't<00:03:19.739> move<00:03:19.860> in<00:03:20.190> this<00:03:20.310> animation<00:03:20.640> or<00:03:21.500> this

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
doesn't move in this animation or this

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.410 
doesn't move in this animation or this
animation<00:03:23.010> or<00:03:23.130> this<00:03:23.400> animation<00:03:23.970> whichever

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
animation or this animation whichever

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.070 
animation or this animation whichever
animation<00:03:25.080> it<00:03:25.200> is<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:26.340> head<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.900> head

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
animation it is the head the head

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.320 
animation it is the head the head
doesn't<00:03:28.590> move<00:03:28.739> for<00:03:29.610> that's<00:03:29.730> only<00:03:29.880> two<00:03:30.060> but

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
doesn't move for that's only two but

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.360 
doesn't move for that's only two but
then<00:03:31.320> I'll<00:03:31.440> just<00:03:31.560> make<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:31.830> easier<00:03:32.070> for<00:03:32.130> this

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
then I'll just make it easier for this

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.350 
then I'll just make it easier for this
thing<00:03:32.640> and<00:03:32.880> this<00:03:32.970> thing

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
thing and this thing

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.540 
thing and this thing

so that's mighty mighty alarm is now

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:45.229 
so that's mighty mighty alarm is now
going<00:03:38.760> off<00:03:41.450> I'll<00:03:42.450> let<00:03:42.630> it<00:03:42.660> burn<00:03:42.870> so<00:03:43.620> I'm<00:03:44.239> yeah

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.420 
pasting code that can't be bullets doing
it<00:04:16.769> so<00:04:17.729> I'm<00:04:18.419> saying<00:04:18.660> is<00:04:18.840> here<00:04:19.080> is<00:04:19.109> if<00:04:19.830> I'm

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
it so I'm saying is here is if I'm

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
it so I'm saying is here is if I'm
pressing<00:04:20.850> up<00:04:21.030> and<00:04:21.410> I'm<00:04:22.410> touching<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:22.950> ground

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
pressing up and I'm touching the ground

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.719 
pressing up and I'm touching the ground
then<00:04:24.450> when<00:04:24.720> what<00:04:25.440> happens<00:04:25.770> I'll<00:04:26.130> jump<00:04:26.520> into

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
then when what happens I'll jump into

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:27.640 
then when what happens I'll jump into
the<00:04:26.880> air<00:04:26.910> I<00:04:27.270> think

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
the air I think

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.290 
the air I think
now<00:04:28.630> okay<00:04:30.250> but<00:04:31.250> you<00:04:31.370> could<00:04:31.520> then<00:04:31.669> say<00:04:31.910> if

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
now okay but you could then say if

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.240 
now okay but you could then say if
you're<00:04:32.900> pressing<00:04:33.110> key<00:04:33.350> up<00:04:33.590> and<00:04:33.860> you're<00:04:34.070> not

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
you're pressing key up and you're not

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
you're pressing key up and you're not
touching<00:04:34.460> the<00:04:34.639> ground<00:04:34.729> so<00:04:35.000> if<00:04:35.090> you're<00:04:35.180> already

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
touching the ground so if you're already

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.120 
touching the ground so if you're already
in<00:04:35.419> the<00:04:35.600> air<00:04:35.720> then<00:04:36.530> it<00:04:36.650> can<00:04:36.770> do<00:04:36.889> sound

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
in the air then it can do sound

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.409 
in the air then it can do sound
completely<00:04:37.550> different<00:04:37.850> so<00:04:37.970> it<00:04:38.030> could<00:04:38.120> go<00:04:38.240> to<00:04:38.300> a

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
completely different so it could go to a

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:40.360 
completely different so it could go to a
different<00:04:38.570> animation<00:04:39.199> so<00:04:39.860> just<00:04:40.070> to<00:04:40.130> do<00:04:40.250> that

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
different animation so just to do that

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.219 
different animation so just to do that
you<00:04:40.580> press<00:04:40.820> that<00:04:41.300> we've<00:04:41.630> actually<00:04:41.810> just<00:04:42.080> put

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
you press that we've actually just put

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.350 
you press that we've actually just put
an<00:04:42.320> exclamation<00:04:42.500> mark<00:04:42.919> so<00:04:43.699> if<00:04:43.820> you<00:04:43.910> press<00:04:44.060> ante

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
an exclamation mark so if you press ante

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.230 
an exclamation mark so if you press ante
up<00:04:44.600> and<00:04:44.810> you're<00:04:45.289> not<00:04:45.320> touching<00:04:45.680> ground<00:04:46.240> then

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
up and you're not touching ground then

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.689 
up and you're not touching ground then
you<00:04:47.660> could<00:04:48.110> do<00:04:48.199> like<00:04:48.500> and<00:04:48.860> then<00:04:49.039> agree<00:04:49.250> let's

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
you could do like and then agree let's

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.969 
you could do like and then agree let's
just<00:04:49.850> try<00:04:50.030> at<00:04:50.120> the<00:04:50.210> root<00:04:50.389> alpha<00:04:50.750> could<00:04:51.320> turn

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
just try at the root alpha could turn

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:53.610 
just try at the root alpha could turn
different<00:04:52.490> let's<00:04:52.610> try<00:04:52.820> it

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
different let's try it

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.590 
different let's try it
so<00:04:54.620> that's<00:04:55.009> and<00:04:55.340> not<00:04:55.789> touching<00:04:56.120> ground

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
so that's and not touching ground

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.090 
so that's and not touching ground
I'll<00:04:57.410> put<00:04:57.740> cha<00:04:58.300> underscore<00:04:59.300> alpha<00:05:00.100> equals

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
I'll put cha underscore alpha equals

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.430 
I'll put cha underscore alpha equals
before<00:05:01.639> T<00:05:01.789> so<00:05:02.150> should<00:05:02.539> when<00:05:02.780> I'm<00:05:02.900> pressing<00:05:03.289> up

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
before T so should when I'm pressing up

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.290 
before T so should when I'm pressing up
and<00:05:03.680> I'm<00:05:03.830> not<00:05:03.860> touching<00:05:04.789> the<00:05:04.850> ground<00:05:04.880> I<00:05:05.120> should

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
and I'm not touching the ground I should

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.890 
and I'm not touching the ground I should
go<00:05:05.419> pretty<00:05:05.720> much<00:05:05.750> invisible<00:05:07.389> yeah<00:05:08.389> which<00:05:08.690> I<00:05:08.780> do

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.350 

so<00:05:11.900> that's<00:05:12.169> an<00:05:12.289> example<00:05:12.380> but<00:05:12.979> probably<00:05:13.820> not

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
so that's an example but probably not

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.659 
so that's an example but probably not
something<00:05:14.630> you<00:05:14.840> get<00:05:14.960> gonna<00:05:15.289> do<00:05:15.500> so<00:05:16.460> then<00:05:16.580> I've

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
something you get gonna do so then I've

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.850 
something you get gonna do so then I've
got<00:05:16.789> key<00:05:16.970> left<00:05:17.180> and<00:05:17.930> touching<00:05:18.260> ground<00:05:18.350> then<00:05:18.770> I

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
got key left and touching ground then I

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.439 
got key left and touching ground then I
moved<00:05:19.070> to<00:05:19.130> the<00:05:19.250> left<00:05:19.400> and<00:05:20.030> then<00:05:20.180> I<00:05:20.210> moved<00:05:20.389> to

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449 
moved to the left and then I moved to

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:24.010 
moved to the left and then I moved to
the<00:05:20.570> right<00:05:20.780> with<00:05:20.990> that<00:05:21.110> one<00:05:22.810> you<00:05:23.810> don't<00:05:23.840> have

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
the right with that one you don't have

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.450 
the right with that one you don't have
to<00:05:24.169> worry<00:05:24.320> too<00:05:24.560> much<00:05:24.590> about<00:05:24.740> this<00:05:25.160> at<00:05:25.370> the

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
to worry too much about this at the

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.980 
to worry too much about this at the
minute<00:05:25.849> because<00:05:25.940> there's<00:05:26.570> something<00:05:26.810> I'll

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
minute because there's something I'll

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.740 
minute because there's something I'll
explain<00:05:27.289> another<00:05:27.889> time<00:05:28.240> if<00:05:29.240> I'm<00:05:29.419> pressing

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
explain another time if I'm pressing

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.050 
explain another time if I'm pressing
left<00:05:29.990> and<00:05:30.199> I'm<00:05:30.289> not<00:05:30.500> touching<00:05:30.830> ground<00:05:31.099> it's

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
left and I'm not touching ground it's

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.969 
left and I'm not touching ground it's
gonna<00:05:32.150> do<00:05:32.300> the<00:05:32.330> same<00:05:32.570> thing<00:05:32.630> so<00:05:33.139> when<00:05:33.770> he's<00:05:33.860> in

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
gonna do the same thing so when he's in

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:35.379 
gonna do the same thing so when he's in
the<00:05:34.070> air<00:05:34.190> he's<00:05:34.460> still<00:05:34.669> gonna<00:05:34.820> move<00:05:35.000> left<00:05:35.270> and

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
the air he's still gonna move left and

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:36.640 
the air he's still gonna move left and
right<00:05:35.630> but<00:05:35.960> you<00:05:36.050> could<00:05:36.199> change<00:05:36.380> the<00:05:36.530> animation

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
right but you could change the animation

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:42.219 
right but you could change the animation
maybe<00:05:37.389> so<00:05:38.389> it's<00:05:39.320> quite<00:05:39.500> handy<00:05:40.720> so<00:05:41.720> this<00:05:42.110> is

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
maybe so it's quite handy so this is

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:42.610 
maybe so it's quite handy so this is
quite<00:05:42.410> good

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
quite good

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.730 
quite good
if<00:05:43.130> I'm<00:05:43.520> pressing<00:05:43.849> down<00:05:44.110> this<00:05:45.110> one<00:05:45.229> and<00:05:45.470> I'm

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
if I'm pressing down this one and I'm

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:46.689 
if I'm pressing down this one and I'm
touching<00:05:46.099> the<00:05:46.250> ground

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:46.699 
touching the ground

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:48.820 
touching the ground
he'll<00:05:47.479> Crouch<00:05:47.780> who<00:05:48.139> goes<00:05:48.349> to<00:05:48.440> my<00:05:48.470> crouch

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
he'll Crouch who goes to my crouch

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.370 
he'll Crouch who goes to my crouch
animation<00:05:49.520> which<00:05:50.300> is<00:05:50.389> 8<00:05:50.599> but<00:05:51.050> if<00:05:51.169> he's<00:05:51.349> not

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
animation which is 8 but if he's not

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.740 
animation which is 8 but if he's not
touching<00:05:52.039> the<00:05:52.220> ground<00:05:52.310> and<00:05:52.520> pressed<00:05:52.789> down<00:05:52.849> it

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
touching the ground and pressed down it

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.149 
touching the ground and pressed down it
does<00:05:53.930> something<00:05:54.139> different<00:05:54.289> so<00:05:54.740> he<00:05:54.830> does<00:05:55.010> this

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:55.159 
does something different so he does this

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:57.279 
does something different so he does this
so<00:05:55.340> I'm<00:05:55.430> pressing<00:05:55.580> down<00:05:55.760> now<00:05:56.120> and<00:05:56.780> he<00:05:57.020> traced

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289 
so I'm pressing down now and he traced

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:59.350 
so I'm pressing down now and he traced
the<00:05:57.440> air<00:05:58.159> so<00:05:58.699> you<00:05:58.760> can<00:05:58.880> stay<00:05:59.060> in<00:05:59.120> the<00:05:59.210> air

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
the air so you can stay in the air

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.839 
the air so you can stay in the air
longer<00:05:59.680> but<00:06:00.680> if<00:06:00.740> I<00:06:00.830> land<00:06:01.039> and<00:06:01.220> press<00:06:01.400> down<00:06:01.610> a
