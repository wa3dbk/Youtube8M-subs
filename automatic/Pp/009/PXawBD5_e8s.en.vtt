for<00:00:01.319> thousands<00:00:01.890> of<00:00:01.979> years<00:00:02.360> saturn<00:00:03.360> has<00:00:03.570> been

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
for thousands of years saturn has been

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.690 
for thousands of years saturn has been
worshipped<00:00:05.160> as<00:00:05.339> a<00:00:05.400> god<00:00:06.029> and<00:00:06.740> it<00:00:07.740> has<00:00:08.189> unique

worshipped as a god and it has unique
symbolism<00:00:09.330> embedded<00:00:10.309> around<00:00:11.309> at<00:00:11.490> South<00:00:11.759> Pole

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
symbolism embedded around at South Pole

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.780 
symbolism embedded around at South Pole
especially<00:00:12.929> as<00:00:13.110> you<00:00:13.440> can<00:00:13.590> see<00:00:13.799> here<00:00:14.250> this

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
especially as you can see here this

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.710 
especially as you can see here this
system<00:00:15.630> that<00:00:16.049> spins<00:00:16.500> creates<00:00:17.400> this<00:00:17.850> hexagon

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
system that spins creates this hexagon

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.300 
system that spins creates this hexagon
six<00:00:19.619> star<00:00:19.920> pattern<00:00:20.779> this<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:22.140> sacred<00:00:22.710> geometry

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
six star pattern this is sacred geometry

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.230 
six star pattern this is sacred geometry
at<00:00:23.880> its<00:00:24.210> finest<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.680> some<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.400> hidden

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
at its finest in this some of the hidden

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.359 
at its finest in this some of the hidden
knowledge<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.960> they<00:00:28.050> do<00:00:28.109> not<00:00:28.380> want<00:00:28.800> the

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
knowledge that they do not want the

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.240 
knowledge that they do not want the
masses<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.000> understand<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:31.380> if<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.830> ever<00:00:31.949> want

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
masses to understand so if you ever want

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.590 
masses to understand so if you ever want
to<00:00:32.309> understand<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.300> have<00:00:33.480> to

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
to understand this you have to

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.229 
to understand this you have to
understand<00:00:34.050> sacred<00:00:34.469> geometry<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:36.000> little

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
understand sacred geometry and a little

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.680 
understand sacred geometry and a little
bit<00:00:36.329> about<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.890> so<00:00:37.890> if<00:00:38.520> we<00:00:38.640> were<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.940> go<00:00:39.090> looking

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
bit about it so if we were to go looking

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.930 
bit about it so if we were to go looking
at<00:00:39.809> other<00:00:39.930> planets<00:00:40.469> what<00:00:41.280> are<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.460> odds<00:00:41.489> we

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
at other planets what are the odds we

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.540 
at other planets what are the odds we
could<00:00:42.090> find<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.540> elsewhere<00:00:43.250> they've<00:00:44.250> looked

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
could find it elsewhere they've looked

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.020 
could find it elsewhere they've looked
at<00:00:44.670> Mars<00:00:44.940> they've<00:00:45.629> looked<00:00:45.870> at<00:00:45.960> Jupiter<00:00:47.030> all

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
at Mars they've looked at Jupiter all

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.110 
at Mars they've looked at Jupiter all
the<00:00:48.390> other<00:00:48.539> planets<00:00:49.050> but<00:00:49.410> nothing<00:00:49.860> like<00:00:50.010> this

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
the other planets but nothing like this

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.760 
the other planets but nothing like this
could<00:00:51.120> we<00:00:51.239> get<00:00:51.390> lucky<00:00:51.660> enough<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.230> find<00:00:52.260> a

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
could we get lucky enough to find a

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.350 
could we get lucky enough to find a
five-star<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:54.440> pentagram<00:00:56.030> swirling<00:00:57.030> around<00:00:57.149> a

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
five-star a pentagram swirling around a

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.100 
five-star a pentagram swirling around a
pole<00:00:58.070> well<00:00:59.070> guess<00:00:59.309> what<00:01:00.020> we've<00:01:01.020> got<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.469> right

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
pole well guess what we've got it right

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:11.630 
pole well guess what we've got it right
here<00:01:04.110> on<00:01:04.619> planet<00:01:05.400> earth<00:01:05.549> now<00:01:10.280> when<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.310> first

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
here on planet earth now when I first

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.380 
here on planet earth now when I first
seen<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.180> my<00:01:12.960> jaw<00:01:13.229> hit<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.470> floor<00:01:14.180> because<00:01:15.180> I

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
seen this my jaw hit the floor because I

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.590 
seen this my jaw hit the floor because I
just<00:01:15.860> ran<00:01:16.860> across<00:01:16.950> Thomas's<00:01:17.790> video<00:01:18.210> which<00:01:18.479> i

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
just ran across Thomas's video which i

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.880 
just ran across Thomas's video which i
