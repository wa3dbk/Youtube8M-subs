00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.749 
that is pretty much it another thing
that<00:01:45.780> shows<00:01:45.810> in<00:01:46.619> his<00:01:46.649> in<00:01:46.770> game<00:01:47.130> stats<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.579> is

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
that shows in his in game stats that is

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.999 
that shows in his in game stats that is
he<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.240> bad<00:01:48.509> at<00:01:48.689> free<00:01:48.899> kicks<00:01:49.140> but<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.710> don't

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
he is bad at free kicks but I don't

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.190 
he is bad at free kicks but I don't
think<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.579> because<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.939> was<00:01:51.299> able<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.780> score<00:01:51.990> one

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
think so because I was able to score one

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.139 
think so because I was able to score one
free<00:01:52.439> kick<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:53.220> lot<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.909> free-kick

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
free kick and a lot of the free-kick

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.899 
free kick and a lot of the free-kick
chances<00:01:54.750> i<00:01:54.869> did<00:01:55.170> have<00:01:55.409> were<00:01:55.890> pretty<00:01:56.310> close<00:01:56.700> to

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
chances i did have were pretty close to

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.999 
chances i did have were pretty close to
going<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.689> love<00:01:58.079> them<00:01:58.259> hit<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.500> poster<00:01:58.979> boy

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
going in I love them hit the poster boy

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.580 
going in I love them hit the poster boy
but<00:01:59.640> so<00:02:00.000> many<00:02:00.210> were<00:02:00.509> close<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.899> going<00:02:01.049> in<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.530> I

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
but so many were close to going in and I

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.980 
but so many were close to going in and I
don't<00:02:01.890> think<00:02:02.159> his<00:02:02.369> free-kick<00:02:02.640> accuracy<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.509> as

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
don't think his free-kick accuracy is as

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.620 
don't think his free-kick accuracy is as
bad<00:02:04.290> as<00:02:04.500> his<00:02:04.680> in<00:02:04.890> game<00:02:05.100> stats<00:02:05.399> show<00:02:06.000> another

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
bad as his in game stats show another

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.389 
bad as his in game stats show another
things<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.110> he<00:02:07.290> showed<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.680> shows<00:02:07.890> he<00:02:08.069> has<00:02:08.099> a

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
things that he showed it shows he has a

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.309 
things that he showed it shows he has a
seasick<00:02:08.759> space<00:02:09.060> which<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.780> definitely<00:02:10.140> agree

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
seasick space which I definitely agree

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.290 
seasick space which I definitely agree
with<00:02:10.679> he<00:02:10.860> doesn't<00:02:11.160> feel<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.550> slow<00:02:11.910> anymore

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300

he<00:02:12.629> doesn't<00:02:12.660> feel

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
he doesn't feel

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.740 
he doesn't feel
costs<00:02:13.620> but<00:02:13.920> he's<00:02:13.980> feels<00:02:14.460> just<00:02:14.760> right<00:02:14.940> for<00:02:15.180> 86

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
it first up he is very to dribble

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.010

the<00:02:34.380> ball<00:02:34.650> with<00:02:34.890> I<00:02:35.070> mean<00:02:35.460> seriously<00:02:35.700> very

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
the ball with I mean seriously very

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.050 
the ball with I mean seriously very
you<00:02:37.260> can't<00:02:37.560> rely<00:02:37.770> on<00:02:37.920> dribbling<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.880> ball

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
you can't rely on dribbling the ball

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.150 
you can't rely on dribbling the ball
with<00:02:39.240> him<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.780> could<00:02:39.960> barely<00:02:40.260> ever<00:02:40.620> past

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
with him you could barely ever past

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.800 
with him you could barely ever past
defenders<00:02:41.490> because<00:02:42.120> it's<00:02:42.270> impossible

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
defenders because it's impossible

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.500 
defenders because it's impossible
another<00:02:43.800> thing<00:02:44.070> that<00:02:44.100> he<00:02:44.430> only<00:02:44.670> has<00:02:45.000> freestyle

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
another thing that he only has freestyle

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.870 
another thing that he only has freestyle
skills<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.020> freestyle<00:02:46.709> weak<00:02:46.980> foot<00:02:47.280> so<00:02:47.790> you

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
skills and freestyle weak foot so you

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.790 
skills and freestyle weak foot so you
can't<00:02:48.270> really<00:02:48.330> do<00:02:48.600> any<00:02:48.840> schools<00:02:49.260> of<00:02:49.410> hip<00:02:49.590> where

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
can't really do any schools of hip where

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.130 
can't really do any schools of hip where
you<00:02:49.860> can't<00:02:50.160> but<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.790> seems<00:02:51.180> really<00:02:51.630> hard<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:52.020> do

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
you can't but it seems really hard to do

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.080 
you can't but it seems really hard to do
those<00:02:52.290> skills<00:02:52.590> with<00:02:52.740> him<00:02:52.950> because<00:02:53.490> of<00:02:53.850> how

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
those skills with him because of how

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.170 
those skills with him because of how
 his<00:02:54.780> dribbling<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.680> he<00:02:56.190> is<00:02:56.340> so<00:02:56.670> damn

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
 his dribbling is and he is so damn

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.300 
 his dribbling is and he is so damn
weak<00:02:57.600> so<00:02:58.170> if<00:02:58.470> you're<00:02:58.650> if<00:02:58.890> you're<00:02:59.100> thinking

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
weak so if you're if you're thinking

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.520 
weak so if you're if you're thinking
that<00:02:59.520> maybe<00:02:59.910> his<00:03:00.270> strength<00:03:01.050> is<00:03:01.140> gonna<00:03:01.350> get

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
that maybe his strength is gonna get

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.260 
that maybe his strength is gonna get
upgraded<00:03:01.920> just<00:03:02.340> cause<00:03:02.580> he<00:03:02.700> got<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:02.850> second

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
upgraded just cause he got a second

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.660 
upgraded just cause he got a second
inform<00:03:03.630> think<00:03:04.170> again<00:03:04.500> he<00:03:04.709> seems<00:03:05.010> very<00:03:05.160> weak

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
inform think again he seems very weak

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.970 
inform think again he seems very weak
and<00:03:05.910> he<00:03:06.390> is<00:03:06.450> really<00:03:06.750> difficult<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.709> score

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
and he is really difficult to score

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.250 
and he is really difficult to score
