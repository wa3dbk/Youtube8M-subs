00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
and your toeside 180 is good so you know

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.460 
and your toeside 180 is good so you know
how<00:00:02.700> to<00:00:02.760> do<00:00:03.090> these<00:00:03.270> two<00:00:03.570> tricks<00:00:03.899> already<00:00:04.259> we're

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
how to do these two tricks already we're

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.440 
how to do these two tricks already we're
just<00:00:04.650> going<00:00:04.799> to<00:00:04.859> put<00:00:05.069> them<00:00:05.190> together<00:00:05.450> some

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
just going to put them together some

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.179 
just going to put them together some
people<00:00:06.690> honestly<00:00:07.020> can't<00:00:07.319> even<00:00:07.379> do<00:00:07.649> a<00:00:07.680> toe<00:00:07.919> side

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
people honestly can't even do a toe side

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.560 
people honestly can't even do a toe side
three<00:00:08.490> but<00:00:08.639> they<00:00:08.730> can<00:00:08.880> do<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.000> five<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.510> the

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
three but they can do a five and the

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.839 
three but they can do a five and the
reason<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:10.050> when<00:00:10.530> you<00:00:10.650> land<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:11.010> five<00:00:11.309> it's<00:00:11.610> just

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
reason is when you land a five it's just

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.049 
reason is when you land a five it's just
like<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.000> toe<00:00:12.240> side<00:00:12.509> wake<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.320> wake<00:00:13.349> 180<00:00:14.059> it's

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
like a toe side wake to wake 180 it's

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.820 
like a toe side wake to wake 180 it's
almost<00:00:15.299> easier<00:00:15.719> than<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.960> toe<00:00:16.170> side<00:00:16.440> just

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
almost easier than a toe side just

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.830 
almost easier than a toe side just
straight<00:00:17.250> air<00:00:17.460> because<00:00:18.359> you<00:00:18.480> can<00:00:18.660> land

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
straight air because you can land

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.080 
straight air because you can land
leaning<00:00:19.289> against<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.890> rope<00:00:20.070> so<00:00:20.760> what<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:20.910> want

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
leaning against the rope so what I want

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.820 
leaning against the rope so what I want
you<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.300> do<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.480> think<00:00:21.779> about<00:00:21.900> that<00:00:22.260> toe<00:00:22.529> side

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
you to do is think about that toe side

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.880 
you to do is think about that toe side
three<00:00:24.140> approach<00:00:25.140> we're<00:00:25.380> going<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.619> come<00:00:25.769> in

that what you can do is you can think

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.529 
that what you can do is you can think
about<00:00:53.100> actually<00:00:53.489> squaring<00:00:54.000> up<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.360> boat

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
about actually squaring up to the boat

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.330 
about actually squaring up to the boat
just<00:00:54.750> for<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> second<00:00:55.440> that's<00:00:55.800> going<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.190> make

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
just for a second that's going to make

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.520 
just for a second that's going to make
sure<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.789> get<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.000> good<00:00:57.210> axis<00:00:57.660> okay<00:00:57.960> so

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
sure that you get a good axis okay so

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.400 
sure that you get a good axis okay so
keep<00:00:59.180> keep<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.329> board<00:01:00.539> going<00:01:00.840> on<00:01:00.960> its<00:01:01.140> edge

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
keep keep the board going on its edge

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.840 
keep keep the board going on its edge
all<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.800> way<00:01:01.920> through<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.219> top<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.670> wake

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
all the way through the top of the wake

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.729 
all the way through the top of the wake
and<00:01:03.090> then<00:01:03.690> squaring<00:01:04.080> up<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.379> boat<00:01:04.500> that's

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
and then squaring up to the boat that's

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.050 
and then squaring up to the boat that's
two<00:01:04.979> things<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.280> can<00:01:05.400> do<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.610> make<00:01:05.760> sure<00:01:05.939> that

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
two things you can do to make sure that

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.580 
two things you can do to make sure that
you<00:01:06.210> don't<00:01:06.390> start<00:01:06.689> spinning<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.229> thing<00:01:07.439> off

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
you don't start spinning this thing off

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.700 
you don't start spinning this thing off
access<00:01:08.840> so<00:01:09.840> as<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.110> get<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.409> top<00:01:10.590> you're

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
access so as you get to the top you're

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.350 
access so as you get to the top you're
going<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.920> square<00:01:11.280> up<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.700> boat<00:01:11.939> for<00:01:12.150> just

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
going to square up to the boat for just

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.670 
going to square up to the boat for just
a<00:01:12.479> second<00:01:12.930> you're<00:01:13.080> almost<00:01:13.229> going<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.500> feel

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
a second you're almost going to feel

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.440 
a second you're almost going to feel
like<00:01:13.860> your<00:01:14.070> shoulders<00:01:14.490> are<00:01:14.820> square<00:01:15.240> and

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
like your shoulders are square and

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.679 
like your shoulders are square and
that's<00:01:16.200> at<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.409> point<00:01:17.210> where<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.330> can<00:01:18.479> pull

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
that's at that point where you can pull

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.870 
that's at that point where you can pull
with<00:01:18.810> two<00:01:19.049> hands<00:01:19.560> pretty<00:01:20.310> aggressively

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
with two hands pretty aggressively

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.359 
with two hands pretty aggressively
towards<00:01:21.299> your<00:01:21.420> back<00:01:21.570> hip<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.740> as<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.070> square

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
towards your back hip so as you square

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.800 
towards your back hip so as you square
