from experience and be very careful if

you are pulling this right on the box

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.440 
you are pulling this right on the box
using<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.229> first<00:01:46.530> time<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:47.340> will<00:01:47.579> have<00:01:47.610> on<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
processor some pre-attached thermal

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.080 
processor some pre-attached thermal
grease<00:01:55.229> which<00:01:55.619> helps<00:01:55.979> dissipate

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
grease which helps dissipate

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.240 
grease which helps dissipate
it<00:01:57.329> comes<00:01:57.539> off<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.750> processor<00:01:58.259> because<00:01:58.740> we

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
it comes off the processor because we

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.950 
it comes off the processor because we
use<00:01:59.579> this<00:02:00.000> fan<00:02:00.960> asked<00:02:01.850> that<00:02:02.850> stuff<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.659> not

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
use this fan asked that stuff is not

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.630 
use this fan asked that stuff is not
here<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.740> first<00:02:04.950> thing<00:02:05.039> that<00:02:05.159> we<00:02:05.399> need<00:02:05.429> to

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
here so the first thing that we need to

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.309 
here so the first thing that we need to
do<00:02:05.789> before<00:02:05.939> we<00:02:06.270> apply<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.899> processor

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
do before we apply this to the processor

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.589 
do before we apply this to the processor
is<00:02:07.590> reapply<00:02:08.340> thermal<00:02:08.670> grease<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.269> make<00:02:09.390> sure

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
is reapply thermal grease to make sure

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.800 
is reapply thermal grease to make sure
that<00:02:09.869> we<00:02:10.019> are<00:02:10.050> not<00:02:10.349> going<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.709> start<00:02:10.979> any<00:02:11.220> fires

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
that we are not going to start any fires

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.360 
that we are not going to start any fires
this<00:02:12.810> is<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.170> thermal<00:02:13.500> reason<00:02:14.190> we're<00:02:14.340> going

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
this is the thermal reason we're going

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.490 
this is the thermal reason we're going
to<00:02:14.549> be<00:02:14.640> using<00:02:14.670> on<00:02:15.180> our<00:02:15.540> computer<00:02:16.019> today<00:02:16.140> it's

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
to be using on our computer today it's
