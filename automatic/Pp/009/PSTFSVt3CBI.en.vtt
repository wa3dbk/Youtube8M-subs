00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:17.619
 it goes 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.550
 therefore, parking the race all in life for the neroverdi 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.500
 therefore, they must do without one of the most representative men 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.469
 let the net need 10 against 11 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:40.960
 the lively protests 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.680
 so against the referee from the children players toll-free number then 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.100
 Marchegiani forced 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.690
 the protests continue also to the Turkish 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:51.539
 you see 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.139
 big fabio grosso that dm away from always part 

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:59.300
 of a of a black-green player 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.010
 novella l &amp; protest that this is good then hiller first episode of the race 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.670
 there have been several episodes they have seen 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.390
 the main character of the arbitration triad 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.180
 the competition judge 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.829
 here we are at the seventeenth minute 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:15.590
 with 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.950
 cost that is from 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.469
 on the left sofia a good ball, a direct opponent 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:23.689
 and then the shoe collection 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.310
 that ends up just that little 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.060
 clear occasions aperitifs who and rights expired the first time 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.400
 then at the twenty-eighth the big shot succeeds a defender to save on 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.920
 Libya 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.050
 the twenty-third is done under the bed a tantaro from the edge of the area with me 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.409
 this pole right wing of the goalkeepers then still the thirtieth the 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.850
 be very dangerous with this header from terry 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.500
 checco of what full control units the crossbar still the catanzaro 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.240
 musarra musarra forced to work overtime 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.790
 in this first part of the game however 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.390
 to the total prerogative of the neroverdi 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.050
 and then again catanzaro with this 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.910
 high shot over the crossbar here 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.109
 we are 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:15.869
 at the resumption the key episode with rigor the twenty-first minute 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:20.699
 a penalty definitely doubtful assigned by the referee 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:27.129
 therefore catanzaro will be realized in advantage over chieti chieti we remember 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.499
 reduced 10 men for expulsion to park 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:34.089
 equity we see and the other episode that probably 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.409
 if you had to give 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.659
 positive outcomes could also give the table a win 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.950
 of the one asked by the hiller we will bring would have been hit by a 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.840
 blunt object images that unfortunately 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.280
 they have no probative value in the incisional offices of the league 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.330
 they clearly indicate that there was also a stadium attendant who has 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.059
 threw me project out of the question 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:05.799
 then here there was a last chance with this foul of the Catanzaro ai 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:06.320
 damage 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.450
 I'm always fabio of you 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.430
 however rt 1200 of the race is not about
