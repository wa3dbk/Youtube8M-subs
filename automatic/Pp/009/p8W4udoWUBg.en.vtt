at<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.280> top<00:03:14.430> of<00:03:14.490> the<00:03:14.730> circle<00:03:14.990> on<00:03:15.990> the<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.530> shot

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
at the top of the circle on the the shot

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.920 
at the top of the circle on the the shot
by<00:03:17.160> Ridenhour<00:03:17.580> and<00:03:17.940> it's<00:03:18.210> since<00:03:18.750> written

hours<00:03:19.140> taking<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.440> shot<00:03:19.680> it's<00:03:20.280> kind<00:03:20.580> of

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
hours taking the shot it's kind of

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.100 
hours taking the shot it's kind of
awkward<00:03:20.790> but<00:03:21.030> it's<00:03:21.150> his<00:03:21.270> job<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.570> get<00:03:21.870> back

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
awkward but it's his job to get back

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.450 
awkward but it's his job to get back
since<00:03:22.380> he's<00:03:22.500> at<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.710> top<00:03:22.890> of<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.100> circle<00:03:23.280> you

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
since he's at the top of the circle you

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.070 
since he's at the top of the circle you
can<00:03:23.580> see<00:03:23.760> he<00:03:23.880> starts<00:03:24.180> off<00:03:24.300> even<00:03:24.690> with<00:03:24.780> plaza

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
can see he starts off even with plaza

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.010 
can see he starts off even with plaza
but<00:03:25.950> doesn't<00:03:26.280> really<00:03:26.310> totally<00:03:26.820> realize<00:03:27.180> when

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
but doesn't really totally realize when

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.660 
but doesn't really totally realize when
he<00:03:28.110> needs<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.410> help<00:03:28.560> get<00:03:28.710> back<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:29.280> can<00:03:29.460> see

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
he needs to help get back and can see

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.850 
he needs to help get back and can see
he's<00:03:29.880> far<00:03:30.330> too<00:03:30.360> slow<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:30.780> make<00:03:31.410> any<00:03:31.590> progress

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
he's far too slow to make any progress

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.030 
he's far too slow to make any progress
won<00:03:32.790> from<00:03:32.970> that<00:03:33.060> situation<00:03:33.210> but<00:03:33.960> I<00:03:34.170> think<00:03:34.950> he's

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
won from that situation but I think he's

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.710 
won from that situation but I think he's
going<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.280> struggle<00:03:35.520> in<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:36.030> fast-paced<00:03:36.360> game

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
going to struggle in a fast-paced game
