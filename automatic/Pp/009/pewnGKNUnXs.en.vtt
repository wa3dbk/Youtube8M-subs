00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
all the evil of an onion is in the root

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.240 
all the evil of an onion is in the root
so<00:00:15.509> we're<00:00:15.660> gonna<00:00:15.750> avoid<00:00:16.139> cutting<00:00:16.650> up<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.949> root

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.380 

and<00:00:20.250> this<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.670> yellow<00:00:20.910> onion<00:00:21.150> which

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
and this is a yellow onion which

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.040 
and this is a yellow onion which
typically<00:00:21.960> makes<00:00:22.289> me<00:00:22.590> cry<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.130> cut<00:00:23.400> it

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
typically makes me cry so you cut it

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.420 
typically makes me cry so you cut it
it's<00:00:25.050> better<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.410> have<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.560> very<00:00:25.830> sharp<00:00:26.099> knife

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
it's better to have a very sharp knife

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.570 
it's better to have a very sharp knife
because<00:00:26.670> then<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:28.039> is<00:00:29.039> there<00:00:29.189> any<00:00:29.250> other

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
because then that is there any other

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.930 
because then that is there any other
near<00:00:29.880> sharper<00:00:30.300> knives

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.120

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
so the sharper your knife the less you

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.170 
so the sharper your knife the less you
cry<00:00:35.399> generally<00:00:36.149> because<00:00:36.480> you're<00:00:36.660> not

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.109 

alright<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:34.540> the<00:01:34.659> first<00:01:34.689> cut<00:01:35.170> you<00:01:35.289> do<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:36.820> in

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
alright so the first cut you do is in

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.590 
alright so the first cut you do is in
this<00:01:37.299> direction<00:01:38.670> but<00:01:39.670> you<00:01:39.759> don't<00:01:40.030> cut<00:01:40.270> all<00:01:40.450> the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
this direction but you don't cut all the

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.190 
this direction but you don't cut all the
way<00:01:40.750> through<00:01:40.780> you<00:01:41.320> cut<00:01:41.530> about<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.939> leave<00:01:43.210> this

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
way through you cut about you leave this

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.240 
way through you cut about you leave this
part<00:01:44.560> intact<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:47.350> just<00:01:47.560> don't<00:01:47.860> go<00:01:48.009> all<00:01:48.039> the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
part intact you just don't go all the

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.490 
part intact you just don't go all the
way<00:01:48.369> through<00:01:48.670> so<00:01:49.509> if<00:01:49.630> I<00:01:49.689> hold<00:01:49.899> it<00:01:50.080> it's<00:01:50.229> still

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
way through so if I hold it it's still

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.429 
way through so if I hold it it's still
it's<00:01:51.100> still<00:01:51.159> all<00:01:51.429> together

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
it's still all together

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.760 
it's still all together
and<00:01:53.439> then<00:01:53.830> you<00:01:54.280> do<00:01:54.399> it<00:01:54.429> this<00:01:54.670> way<00:01:54.899> also<00:01:55.899> keeping

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
and then you do it this way also keeping

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:05.930 
and then you do it this way also keeping
this<00:01:56.950> part<00:01:57.280> together<00:01:58.560> can<00:01:59.560> hold<00:01:59.860> the<00:02:00.100> sides

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.809 

and<00:02:06.940> then<00:02:07.769> you<00:02:08.769> hold<00:02:08.979> it<00:02:09.190> and<00:02:09.489> then<00:02:09.580> use<00:02:09.729> the

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
and then you hold it and then use the

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.000 
and then you hold it and then use the
dice
