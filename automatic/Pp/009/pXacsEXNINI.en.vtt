00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
this so then switching between yeah they

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.510 
this so then switching between yeah they
should<00:01:01.559> have<00:01:01.649> made<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:01.949> left<00:01:02.160> clicking<00:01:02.340> as

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520

so once you get in first off you have to
power<00:05:19.270> the<00:05:19.419> plane<00:05:19.630> when<00:05:20.110> you<00:05:20.200> press<00:05:20.470> are

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
power the plane when you press are

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.670 
power the plane when you press are
everybody<00:05:22.360> got<00:05:22.480> coal<00:05:22.720> enamel<00:05:23.169> and<00:05:23.230> stuff<00:05:23.470> but

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
you can put a mo now while holding left

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.230 
you can put a mo now while holding left
control<00:05:29.860> you<00:05:30.100> shoot<00:05:30.310> bullets<00:05:30.550> you<00:05:30.970> can<00:05:31.090> barely

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
control you shoot bullets you can barely

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.000 
control you shoot bullets you can barely
see<00:05:31.450> that<00:05:31.600> but<00:05:31.750> it<00:05:31.840> is<00:05:32.410> a<00:05:32.440> fair<00:05:32.710> amount<00:05:32.830> of

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
see that but it is a fair amount of

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.730 
see that but it is a fair amount of
damage<00:05:33.280> i<00:05:33.370> guess<00:05:33.490> i<00:05:33.640> mean<00:05:33.760> it's<00:05:34.410> it's<00:05:35.410> it's

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
damage i guess i mean it's it's it's

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.409 
damage i guess i mean it's it's it's
less<00:05:36.010> strong<00:05:36.250> like<00:05:36.640> one<00:05:36.910> bolt<00:05:37.180> is<00:05:37.300> less

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
less strong like one bolt is less

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.390 
less strong like one bolt is less
stronger<00:05:37.750> than<00:05:37.870> a<00:05:37.930> bow<00:05:38.590> that's<00:05:38.830> for<00:05:39.070> sure<00:05:39.220> but

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
stronger than a bow that's for sure but

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.690 
stronger than a bow that's for sure but
now<00:05:39.580> yeah<00:05:40.360> there<00:05:40.570> you<00:05:40.660> go<00:05:40.720> see<00:05:41.050> so<00:05:41.650> you<00:05:42.580> can

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
now yeah there you go see so you can

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.850 
now yeah there you go see so you can
come<00:05:42.820> be<00:05:42.940> a<00:05:42.970> fighter<00:05:43.480> pilot<00:05:43.570> and<00:05:44.140> dived<00:05:44.440> are

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
come be a fighter pilot and dived are

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.350 
come be a fighter pilot and dived are
and<00:05:45.130> then<00:05:45.220> start<00:05:45.460> shooting<00:05:45.820> not<00:05:45.970> to<00:05:46.090> use<00:05:46.210> and

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
and then start shooting not to use and

you want to actually know more about

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.390 
you want to actually know more about
this<00:06:08.599> mod<00:06:08.810> i'm<00:06:09.110> not<00:06:09.289> going<00:06:09.440> to<00:06:09.470> do<00:06:10.250> another

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
this mod i'm not going to do another

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.059 
this mod i'm not going to do another
review<00:06:10.789> of<00:06:10.909> it<00:06:11.060> i<00:06:11.090> mean<00:06:11.360> well<00:06:12.139> it<00:06:12.440> all<00:06:12.710> i'll

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:13.069 
review of it i mean well it all i'll

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:15.430 
review of it i mean well it all i'll
just<00:06:13.490> link<00:06:13.729> code<00:06:13.970> it<00:06:14.330> does<00:06:14.629> it<00:06:14.720> run<00:06:14.840> faster<00:06:15.110> now

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
just link code it does it run faster now

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.480 
just link code it does it run faster now
i<00:06:15.470> think<00:06:15.590> it<00:06:15.800> does<00:06:16.009> this<00:06:16.759> plane<00:06:16.970> anyways<00:06:17.569> um

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
i think it does this plane anyways um

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.460 
i think it does this plane anyways um
i'll<00:06:19.490> put<00:06:19.970> the<00:06:20.300> link<00:06:20.629> to<00:06:20.810> the<00:06:20.900> mod<00:06:21.110> in<00:06:21.379> the

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
i'll put the link to the mod in the

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:27.490 
i'll put the link to the mod in the
