00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
it makes parks more sliceable but if you

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.100 
it makes parks more sliceable but if you
cook<00:02:44.560> it<00:02:44.590> to<00:02:44.739> 195<00:02:45.190> that<00:02:45.580> makes<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:45.910> more<00:02:46.120> where

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
why you wrap it in foil is because you

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.980 
why you wrap it in foil is because you
smoke<00:04:06.530> it<00:04:06.680> till<00:04:06.860> you<00:04:06.980> get<00:04:07.100> the<00:04:07.220> color<00:04:07.430> and<00:04:07.990> then

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
smoke it till you get the color and then

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.070 
smoke it till you get the color and then
after<00:04:10.209> you<00:04:11.209> get<00:04:11.300> the<00:04:11.450> color<00:04:11.630> that<00:04:11.900> you<00:04:12.050> want

after you get the color that you want

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.770 
after you get the color that you want
now<00:04:12.650> you<00:04:12.680> wrap<00:04:13.040> it<00:04:13.069> in<00:04:13.280> foil<00:04:13.489> and<00:04:13.790> that<00:04:14.480> helps

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
now you wrap it in foil and that helps

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.180 
now you wrap it in foil and that helps
to<00:04:14.930> meet<00:04:15.080> break<00:04:15.319> down<00:04:15.530> and<00:04:15.770> make<00:04:15.920> it<00:04:16.010> a<00:04:16.040> nice
