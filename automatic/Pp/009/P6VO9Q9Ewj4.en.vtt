00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.820
 be there to defend 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.240

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.580

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.970

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.270
 educational matter the enactment is 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.550
 performed at the National Palace of Mexico 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.830
 in his speech the president of the country 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.480
 Enrique Peña Nieto clarified that the reform 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.610
 emerged from work among various 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.110
 social sectors the president indicated 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.940
 that the initiative is aimed at 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.070
 improve the quality of education in the 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.570
 country strengthen the mechanisms of 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.580
 evaluation to which the 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.890
 teachers and encourage participation 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.420
 of the communities in the management of 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.030
 schools 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.580
 to make the evaluation a mechanism 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.540
 efficient to improve the quality of 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:50.509
 education for it the reform elevates to 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.280
 constitutional rank at the institute 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.899
 for the evaluation of the 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.750
 education and gives it full autonomy 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:02.390
 it also orders the creation of a system 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.880
 national educational evaluation that 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.149
 take into account the conditions and 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.019
 challenges faced by teachers in 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.019
 your everyday reality 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.730
 well this is what they say this is 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.709
 what the tuft says is that what 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.370
 they are both bragging about what comes out 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.920
 the envy to scream that finally goes to 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.230
 have a quality education in mexico 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.260
 that is going to take into account all that 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.349
 that has never been taken into account and that 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:37.580
 now we are going to have a high level 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:40.200
 education in all sectors of the country 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.110
 anywhere in the country 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.410
 and I wonder and why should we now 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.629
 believe them because now because they are the 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.390
 new PRI members because it is the new PRI 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.790
 because they returned to the government because of 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.700
 truth they intend to educate of 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.500
 adequate way to all Mexicans to 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.290
 all children to all of 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.170
 secondary to all high schools to 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.880
 all universities nothing more for that 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:11.200
 do not die I do not believe in mother 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:14.380
 proof of this is that schools 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.410
 normal who try to carry a 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.990
 education according to the reality of the 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.930
 community have been attacked by the 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.120
 PRI government I am referring to the 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.460
 PRI government of the decrepit old man 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.340
 of fausto vallejo in michoacán that is a 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.709
 example oaxaca waves 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.319
 these gentlemen what they want to impose is 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.020
 a style of neoliberal education in 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.500
 where 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:43.110
 the students are taught to delegate 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.400
 responsibilities and to obey what 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.319
 they are creating are machines 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.319
 because they fuck they have to learn 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:54.340
 English the Purépecha children would have to 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:57.340
 rescue your language for example 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.860
 I do not think anything that does not help them this 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.459
 it's pure rubbish I'm against 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.310
 completely of this educational reform 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:09.250
 which is just saying in the beginning 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:11.860
 give astonishment with the finger to the less 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.340
 fit and you are very surprised that there 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.019
 so many applauders of this pendejada 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.019
 when in this video I'm going to leave you 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.600
 I'm going to show you since we're 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.460
 So we returned to our 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.800
 continent then according to a survey 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.110
 recent unesco Mexico occupies the 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.120
 second to last place on a list of 108 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.330
 countries in relation to the habit of 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.430
 reading the average citizen reads 2.8 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.200
 books per year and 40 percent of the 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.389
 population of that country has never entered 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.169
 a bookstore more information with our 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:45.569
 correspondent jorge pita 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.639
 for 14 days the city of mexico- 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:49.560
 hosts the oldest literary event 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.810
 of the country the international fair of 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.759
 book in the mining palace over 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.740
 100 thousand people attend this appointment 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.999
 annual to know the news of the 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.889
 sector 

00:04:56.999 --> 00:05:00.240
 I really like reading here at the fair 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.889
 mining over the years always 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.830
 there are very good very good titles 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:09.090
 offers a variety of books always 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.979
 there are some new offers and there are 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.900
 editorials like these that are 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:15.560
 university students who are not 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.520
 easily every day in the city 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.529
 authorities and cultural institutions 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.389
 they are worried because the 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:24.569
 Mexican society is one of those that 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:26.520
 less reads in the whole world the only 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:29.849
 possibility of breaking with the regrettable 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.220
 circle that is generated between poverty and 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:34.430
 ignorance 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:37.870
 education as part of it the 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.870
 Mexicans of mind 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.730
 unfortunately we have to recognize it 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.830
 We lost time because opinions 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:48.070
 differ in relation to the cause u 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:50.050
 origin of this little situation to me 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.810
 it seems that there have been no policies 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.930
 adequate public resources to boost the 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.940
 people to leh to raise the level of 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.850
 knowledge and cultural 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.860
 in the end 80% of the people their first 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.110
 medium of information is television 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.300
 so I think that television is the 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.090
 that catches people's attention and does not 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.740
 allows people to think 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.750
 through the books through the 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.660
 newspapers through different 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.640
 publications a custom events 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.950
 of this kind try to reverse without great 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.720
 success for the moment 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.150
 and is that according to the data of the last 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.520
 national survey on readings six of 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.880
 every ten Mexicans do not read any book 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.830
 year
