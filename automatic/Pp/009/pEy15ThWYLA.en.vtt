00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:12.170
 How about we make this flower? 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.510
 let's do it so it's so look you go 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.920
 need a needle to grow and I 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:20.449
 here with 1.5 and a wire of your choice 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.029
 Here I am with a shade of red. 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:26.029
 even darker than it was used 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.880
 in the first flower but is a cotton yarn 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.949
 thousand thickness that will be 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.860
 Flemish he does his work with the 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.440
 cord of 5 chains the last point 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.360
 should be attached to the former with a 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.329
 extremely low point 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.050
 note that you should get a circus 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.629
 make a chain around this 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.710
 circus or by passing the needle through the 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:56.840
 half of it you sar at 11 points 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:01:16.190
 so check out the one here two here 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:18.470
 3 now 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and 11 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.900
 the last point executed must be 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.410
 stuck with that first threshold 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:27.110
 a very low point next career 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:31.490
 should be started with the 6 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:34.070
 then one two three four 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.730
 five and six 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:41.060
 a base point and in the next 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:46.130
 point make a high point 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.510
 do 3 chains one two and three there 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.660
 again 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.370
 skip one base point and the next one 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.710
 Hight point 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.170
 let's repeat the procedure in the contour 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.720
 all to arrive at the end of this career 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.620
 where you should already have five 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.750
 spaces formed and in the latter will be 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.190
 formed at this moment you pass the 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.800
 needle by the first second third 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.569
 starting point beyond the 6 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.640
 then you will pass 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.880
 needle through the third stitch and with a 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.370
 Very low point you end this house 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.700
 was the next career started with the 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:29.960
 cord of 3 chains one two and three 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:33.490
 there if in this space execute three points 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:36.500
 the first or second 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.630
 and the third 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.810
 remember one thing to those three 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.360
 the chains you have made are interpreted 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:49.010
 like it's a high point, it's okay 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:52.880
 make four chains one two 13/4 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.990
 there if in the next space you will make four 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.240
 high points 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.170
 So I'm already the one who 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.260
 midfield 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.710
 the second high point here 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.300
 the third high and clear point enclosing 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.060
 the fourth high point 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:12.730
 make four chains again the sea 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:16.520
 two 13 4 starts the process again 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:20.570
 let's make the whole outline of this 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.790
 career is at the end I come back here to 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.630
 continue to join us in closing this 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.940
 career 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.120
 the last stitch on the needle should be 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.570
 attached to the first point executed with a 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.690
 very low point starts the next 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.390
 career with a chain and a point 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.130
 down in the second high point what you 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.070
 did in his previous career 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.530
 make two current days there if you go 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.810
 to a continuity of three high points 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.030
 interspersed by chains, then I see 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.970
 the first high point to bet whoever 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.940
 ready the first high point and a 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.730
 chain re- launches the second 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.240
 high point and a chain of 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.780
 new 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:06.410
 the third high point now three 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.600
 two and three 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.020
 again and again a continuity 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.910
 of three high points interspersed by 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.900
 a chain so here I have 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.680
 second high point and the third point 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.890
 high 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:27.050
 make two chains you had and again 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:30.440
 in central station 1 234 high points 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:33.220
 it's not between you'll make a low 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.770
 again two current days 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.170
 again we will continue the 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.840
 three high points, then see 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:44.440
 high point and interspersed with a 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:47.530
 chain another high point and again 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.810
 a chain to finish the 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.750
 third and last high point 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:56.320
 I make three chains one two and three 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.480
 I think it makes a high point. 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.510
 interleaved with loop 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:04.510
 again and the second new high point 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:08.440
 chain ends with the third 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:11.950
 high point where I make two chains 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:14.410
 had and holding the low on the 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:17.590
 half of the previous career motive 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.780
 we are going to perform the contour to the 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.240
 channel of your execution when you 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.640
 have two chains on your needle 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.860
 you will learn the last point in the 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:31.000
 first run with a dot 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:34.440
 Very low and here's your little flower 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.440
 all done
