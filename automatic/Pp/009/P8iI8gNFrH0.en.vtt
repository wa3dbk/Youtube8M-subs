00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 hydraulic press for production 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:09.420
 Lego brick during operation I revealed 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.410
 Some shortcomings therefore I had to 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:18.300
 replace the top cover and also 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:24.170
 clamps under the cover now the whole thing 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.170
 fixed eccentric that's the center 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.180
 also heightened the snow 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.300
 replaced the oil pump 32 and joanna 10 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.950
 increased speed 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.950
 most important compression force 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.170
 and 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.830
 note 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.330
 brick walls get peeking
