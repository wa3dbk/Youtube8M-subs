I'm adding even more soil because what
will<00:00:58.480> happen<00:00:58.510> is<00:00:58.899> the<00:00:59.079> roots<00:00:59.320> will<00:00:59.920> grow<00:01:00.219> out

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
will happen is the roots will grow out

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.119 
will happen is the roots will grow out
of<00:01:00.430> the<00:01:00.609> side<00:01:00.910> of<00:01:01.149> the<00:01:01.269> stem<00:01:01.629> and<00:01:01.989> you'll<00:01:02.920> make

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
of the side of the stem and you'll make

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.430 
of the side of the stem and you'll make
a<00:01:03.370> much<00:01:03.730> stronger<00:01:04.120> plant<00:01:04.540> you<00:01:04.840> want<00:01:05.020> as<00:01:05.110> large

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
a much stronger plant you want as large

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.200 
a much stronger plant you want as large
and<00:01:05.800> develop<00:01:06.250> a<00:01:06.340> root<00:01:06.520> system<00:01:07.000> as<00:01:07.120> you

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
and develop a root system as you

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.330 
and develop a root system as you
possibly<00:01:07.780> can<00:01:08.140> okay<00:01:08.650> so<00:01:08.890> I've<00:01:08.980> got<00:01:09.010> these

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
possibly can okay so I've got these

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.640 
possibly can okay so I've got these
already<00:01:09.580> and<00:01:10.390> I'll<00:01:10.510> keep<00:01:10.690> fertilizing<00:01:11.500> them

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650

and keeping them consistently moist and
they'll<00:01:14.230> just<00:01:14.260> continue<00:01:14.920> to<00:01:14.950> grow<00:01:15.220> and<00:01:15.460> I've

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
plant the seed about six weeks before I

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.260 
plant the seed about six weeks before I
think<00:01:29.440> I'm<00:01:29.560> gonna<00:01:29.710> move<00:01:29.920> the<00:01:30.130> plant<00:01:30.490> outside

soil<00:01:44.820> mix<00:01:45.820> together<00:01:46.660> and<00:01:46.990> the<00:01:47.470> roots<00:01:47.740> can<00:01:47.980> grow

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
soil mix together and the roots can grow

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.220 
soil mix together and the roots can grow
in<00:01:48.430> this<00:01:48.580> you<00:01:48.820> form<00:01:49.330> a<00:01:49.390> little<00:01:49.630> root<00:01:49.750> ball<00:01:50.020> with

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
in this you form a little root ball with

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.360 
in this you form a little root ball with
the<00:01:50.350> plant<00:01:50.620> and<00:01:50.860> what<00:01:50.980> you<00:01:51.070> do<00:01:51.190> is<00:01:51.280> you<00:01:51.340> just

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
the plant and what you do is you just

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.850 
the plant and what you do is you just
take<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:51.910> seed<00:01:52.210> and<00:01:52.990> what's<00:01:53.140> convenient<00:01:53.740> is

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
take the seed and what's convenient is

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.710 
take the seed and what's convenient is
that<00:01:54.070> a<00:01:54.100> packet<00:01:54.520> of<00:01:54.640> these<00:01:54.790> seed<00:01:55.180> this<00:01:55.540> is

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
that a packet of these seed this is

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.590 
that a packet of these seed this is
Brandywine<00:01:56.290> tomato<00:01:56.710> by<00:01:56.980> the<00:01:57.040> way<00:01:57.450> I'll<00:01:58.450> just

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
Brandywine tomato by the way I'll just

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.110 
Brandywine tomato by the way I'll just
drop<00:01:58.810> a<00:01:58.840> little<00:01:59.080> seed<00:01:59.410> in<00:01:59.620> there<00:01:59.800> and<00:02:00.070> cover<00:02:00.910> it

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
drop a little seed in there and cover it

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.940 
drop a little seed in there and cover it
up<00:02:01.240> like<00:02:01.570> that<00:02:01.810> look<00:02:02.050> about<00:02:02.230> a<00:02:02.290> half<00:02:02.560> inch<00:02:02.800> of

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
up like that look about a half inch of

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.950 
up like that look about a half inch of
soil<00:02:03.220> now<00:02:03.820> what<00:02:04.060> I'll<00:02:04.150> do<00:02:04.330> is<00:02:04.510> these<00:02:04.750> will

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
soil now what I'll do is these will

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.160 
soil now what I'll do is these will
germinate<00:02:05.230> and<00:02:05.740> after<00:02:06.250> they<00:02:06.400> have<00:02:06.640> about<00:02:07.170> four

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
germinate and after they have about four

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.980 
germinate and after they have about four
leaves<00:02:08.680> on<00:02:09.160> them<00:02:09.430> I'll<00:02:09.759> bump<00:02:10.149> them<00:02:10.390> up<00:02:10.539> to<00:02:10.960> a

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
leaves on them I'll bump them up to a

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.590 
leaves on them I'll bump them up to a
larger<00:02:11.650> peat<00:02:12.160> pot<00:02:12.760> like<00:02:13.060> this

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
larger peat pot like this

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.420 
larger peat pot like this
but<00:02:13.990> when<00:02:14.140> I<00:02:14.170> do<00:02:14.290> that<00:02:14.650> I'm<00:02:14.920> gonna<00:02:15.040> make<00:02:15.250> sure

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
but when I do that I'm gonna make sure

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.240 
but when I do that I'm gonna make sure
that<00:02:15.460> I<00:02:15.640> tear<00:02:16.060> into<00:02:16.480> this<00:02:17.110> little<00:02:17.380> fibrous

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
that I tear into this little fibrous

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.250 
that I tear into this little fibrous
netting<00:02:18.790> because<00:02:19.270> I<00:02:19.360> want<00:02:19.570> those<00:02:19.720> roots<00:02:19.990> to<00:02:20.110> be

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
netting because I want those roots to be

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.470 
netting because I want those roots to be
able<00:02:20.320> to<00:02:20.500> grow<00:02:20.650> out<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:21.100> fill<00:02:21.700> up<00:02:22.000> this<00:02:22.240> entire

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
able to grow out and fill up this entire

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.140 
able to grow out and fill up this entire
peat<00:02:23.050> pot<00:02:23.440> now<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.100> great<00:02:24.460> thing<00:02:24.700> about<00:02:24.730> these

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
peat pot now the great thing about these

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.300 
peat pot now the great thing about these
you<00:02:25.390> can<00:02:25.570> plant<00:02:25.870> them<00:02:25.990> directly<00:02:26.710> in<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.070> soil

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
you can plant them directly in the soil

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.090 
you can plant them directly in the soil
so<00:02:28.000> what<00:02:28.450> I<00:02:28.480> can<00:02:28.690> do<00:02:28.840> is<00:02:28.960> I<00:02:29.080> can<00:02:29.140> take<00:02:29.440> these<00:02:29.740> and

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
so what I can do is I can take these and

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.760 
so what I can do is I can take these and
just<00:02:30.550> tear<00:02:30.940> into<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.390> sides<00:02:31.690> of<00:02:32.050> them<00:02:32.260> tear

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
just tear into the sides of them tear

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.070 
just tear into the sides of them tear
the<00:02:32.920> sides<00:02:33.190> off<00:02:33.490> they'll<00:02:34.080> decompose

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
the sides off they'll decompose

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.070 
the sides off they'll decompose
naturally<00:02:35.440> they<00:02:35.980> just<00:02:36.130> become<00:02:36.400> part<00:02:36.760> of<00:02:36.880> the

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
naturally they just become part of the

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.350 
naturally they just become part of the
soil<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.590> soil<00:02:39.040> structure<00:02:39.490> and<00:02:39.940> they'll

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
soil the soil structure and they'll

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.000 
soil the soil structure and they'll
panel<00:02:40.870> just<00:02:41.050> keep<00:02:41.200> on<00:02:41.380> growing<00:02:41.770> and<00:02:41.890> when<00:02:41.980> I

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
panel just keep on growing and when I

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.130 
panel just keep on growing and when I
plant<00:02:42.340> them<00:02:42.460> in<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.610> ground<00:02:42.760> I'll<00:02:43.180> take<00:02:43.930> all

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
plant them in the ground I'll take all

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.110 
plant them in the ground I'll take all
these<00:02:44.290> lower<00:02:44.560> leaves<00:02:44.800> off<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:45.460> I'll<00:02:45.820> bring

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
these lower leaves off and I'll bring

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.760 
these lower leaves off and I'll bring
the<00:02:46.330> soil<00:02:46.540> right<00:02:46.900> up<00:02:47.080> to<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.290> neck<00:02:47.500> whereas

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
the soil right up to the neck whereas

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.550 
the soil right up to the neck whereas
you<00:02:47.890> only<00:02:48.040> have<00:02:48.250> 20%<00:02:48.640> of<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.150> plant<00:02:49.560> standing

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
you only have 20% of the plant standing

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.800 
you only have 20% of the plant standing
again<00:02:51.280> that<00:02:51.580> goes<00:02:51.700> back<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:51.970> what<00:02:52.180> I<00:02:52.240> did<00:02:52.330> here

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
again that goes back to what I did here

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.080 
again that goes back to what I did here
you<00:02:53.170> get<00:02:53.350> a<00:02:53.590> really<00:02:53.920> strong<00:02:53.980> root<00:02:54.550> system<00:02:55.060> that

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
you get a really strong root system that

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.700 
you get a really strong root system that
way<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:55.960> one<00:02:56.110> of<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.230> things<00:02:56.380> you<00:02:56.470> want<00:02:56.650> to

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
way and one of the things you want to

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:57.960 
way and one of the things you want to
make<00:02:56.830> sure<00:02:56.860> you<00:02:57.160> do<00:02:57.340> is<00:02:57.460> you<00:02:57.580> want<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:57.820> make

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
make sure you do is you want to make

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.760 
make sure you do is you want to make
sure<00:02:58.000> that<00:02:58.330> these<00:02:58.540> stay<00:02:58.780> consistently<00:02:59.500> moist

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
sure that these stay consistently moist

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.770 
sure that these stay consistently moist
they<00:03:00.130> can't<00:03:00.430> sit<00:03:00.760> in<00:03:00.880> standing<00:03:01.300> water<00:03:01.330> I'll

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
they can't sit in standing water I'll

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.170 
they can't sit in standing water I'll
cover<00:03:02.290> this<00:03:02.650> with<00:03:03.130> this<00:03:03.250> little<00:03:03.460> plastic<00:03:03.610> top

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
cover this with this little plastic top

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.640 
cover this with this little plastic top
so<00:03:04.480> it's<00:03:04.600> going<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:04.840> create<00:03:05.080> its<00:03:05.260> own<00:03:05.470> little

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
so it's going to create its own little

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.350 
so it's going to create its own little
greenhouse<00:03:06.130> environment<00:03:06.400> I<00:03:07.060> want<00:03:07.120> to<00:03:07.240> make

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
greenhouse environment I want to make

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.880 
greenhouse environment I want to make
sure<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.600> temperatures<00:03:08.080> stay<00:03:08.410> in<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.650> 70s

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
sure the temperatures stay in the 70s

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.190 
sure the temperatures stay in the 70s
here<00:03:09.430> if<00:03:10.000> you<00:03:10.210> don't<00:03:10.360> have<00:03:10.600> that<00:03:10.720> at<00:03:10.870> home<00:03:11.020> you

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
here if you don't have that at home you

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.200 
here if you don't have that at home you
at<00:03:11.290> least<00:03:11.530> want<00:03:11.740> to<00:03:11.800> put<00:03:11.980> them<00:03:12.220> on<00:03:12.400> a<00:03:12.490> warming

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
at least want to put them on a warming

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.430 
at least want to put them on a warming
map<00:03:13.450> that<00:03:13.630> you<00:03:13.690> can<00:03:13.750> pick<00:03:13.990> up<00:03:14.080> at<00:03:14.200> a<00:03:14.260> local
