like<00:04:26.720> he<00:04:26.900> was<00:04:26.930> getting<00:04:28.060> maybe<00:04:29.060> a<00:04:29.180> little<00:04:29.360> tired

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:29.599 
like he was getting maybe a little tired

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:31.149 
like he was getting maybe a little tired
but<00:04:29.810> he's<00:04:29.960> more<00:04:30.139> going<00:04:30.470> in<00:04:30.590> defensive<00:04:31.130> mode

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:31.159 
but he's more going in defensive mode

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:32.710 
but he's more going in defensive mode
and<00:04:31.550> a<00:04:31.729> lot<00:04:32.000> of<00:04:32.030> times<00:04:32.240> we<00:04:32.360> can<00:04:32.449> get<00:04:32.539> in<00:04:32.630> that

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
and a lot of times we can get in that

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.950 
and a lot of times we can get in that
defensive<00:04:33.169> mode<00:04:33.320> you<00:04:33.500> kind<00:04:33.710> of<00:04:33.880> really<00:04:34.880> end<00:04:35.810> up

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
defensive mode you kind of really end up

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.529 
defensive mode you kind of really end up
wrestling<00:04:36.139> on<00:04:36.409> your<00:04:36.560> heels<00:04:36.830> and<00:04:37.070> I<00:04:37.669> was<00:04:38.330> able

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
wrestling on your heels and I was able

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.779 
wrestling on your heels and I was able
to<00:04:38.570> catch<00:04:38.750> him<00:04:38.930> off<00:04:39.080> and<00:04:39.349> grab<00:04:40.190> that<00:04:40.370> ankle<00:04:40.699> and

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789 
to catch him off and grab that ankle and

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:44.950 
to catch him off and grab that ankle and
drive<00:04:41.030> through<00:04:42.639> and<00:04:43.639> I<00:04:43.729> pretty<00:04:44.599> much<00:04:44.750> I<00:04:44.900> was

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
drive through and I pretty much I was

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.040 
drive through and I pretty much I was
just<00:04:45.139> pulling<00:04:45.320> on<00:04:45.530> his<00:04:45.650> head<00:04:46.870> trying<00:04:47.870> to<00:04:47.960> get

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
just pulling on his head trying to get

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.320 
just pulling on his head trying to get
his<00:04:48.139> feet<00:04:48.349> moving<00:04:48.560> and<00:04:48.949> like<00:04:49.789> I<00:04:49.909> said<00:04:49.970> he<00:04:50.210> was

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
his feet moving and like I said he was

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.779 
his feet moving and like I said he was
in<00:04:50.419> defensive<00:04:50.870> mode<00:04:50.930> and<00:04:51.320> I<00:04:51.560> think<00:04:52.490> he<00:04:52.580> was<00:04:52.639> on

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 
in defensive mode and I think he was on

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.490 
in defensive mode and I think he was on
his<00:04:52.940> heels<00:04:53.300> and<00:04:55.510> was<00:04:56.510> just<00:04:57.020> trying<00:04:57.199> to<00:04:57.229> run<00:04:57.380> out
