00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.449
 fairs you know 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.090
 in 1954 the giulietta sprint e was born 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.320
 one of the most loved and famous alfa romeo 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.810
 worldwide 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.250
 60 years later at the end of last year 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.200
 alfa romeo has launched this version 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.029
 sprint of the giulietta currently in 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.650
 trade that differs from the rest 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.550
 of the range for some details that 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.619
 we will see later 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.390
 what interests us today to find it 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.760
 on caprino spiazzi or on a 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.110
 stretch of road that hosted one 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.350
 of the most famous uphill races in Italy 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.970
 it is a race that this year perhaps, perhaps 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.649
 it could be played again later 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.570
 some years of stop 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.809
 ok now to go and try it and see 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.809
 how are you 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.670
 aesthetically the details that make the 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.020
 difference between the sprint and the others are 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.270
 the handles and mirror caps 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.640
 charcoal colored searches 5 out 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.380
 specific and the chrome exhaust over 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.430
 to the extractor in the rear bumper e 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.430
 the sprint logo on the wheel arch 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.760
 internally to characterize it are 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.650
 instead the red thread of the seams of 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.130
 steering wheel seats together with the sprint lake 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.130
 on the headrest 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.130
 to 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.170
 the legacy of the giulietta sprint is 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.549
 therefore heavy or to forget 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.930
 on the contrary, remember its namesake of 1954 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.299
 one of the sports of the snake more 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.320
 love all times you can 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.780
 answer is positive 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.750
 the engine is quite bright too 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.940
 if not exactly sports from 2500 thousand e 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.920
 500 rpm threshold beyond which it does not have 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.960
 sense to push because the push goes down e 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.640
 they only increase consumption but it is 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.060
 especially the frame which is like a real alpha 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.030
 romeo 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.340
 the steering is quick and quite accurate and 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.440
 the asset contains a contains properly 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.420
 roll so you both enjoy a great 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.119
 road holding and great agility 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.590
 in changes of direction 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.330
 the less convincing aspect therefore is the 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.950
 change a six- speed manual from 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.700
 rather gummy and even grafts 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.700
 quite long 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.480
 sprint setup is available at 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.820
 a large number of engines goes from the 1400s 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.550
 LPG turbo bifuel gasoline from 120 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.280
 horses to 1400 always turbobenzina from 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.730
 170 horses passing through the turbo diesel 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:41.990
 1600 from 105 horses to 2000 turbodiesels 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.880
 from 150 to 175 our giulietta was 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.860
 instead equipped with the last among the 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.380
 sports heart introduced namely the 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:52.060
 1400 turbo petrol with 150 horses 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.060
 the list for 26,100 euros 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.640
 in short, the giulietta in 1954 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.680
 something is left we talk about pleasure 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.900
 driving the engine brightness e 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.000
 also the exhaust sounds for the 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.040
 rest 60 years are many and feel 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.080
 all the Juliet of our day is 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.030
 indeed governed by electronics in 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.620
 particular from the manettino dna that 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.320
 lets you choose three modes 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.970
 guide and a sp that leaves the margin 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.190
 the driver but that in any case beyond one 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.330
 a certain threshold intervenes and places in mine 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.820
 of any errors 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.070
 a guarantee for safety and everything 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.730
 added up not too much a limit for the 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.730
 driving pleasure
