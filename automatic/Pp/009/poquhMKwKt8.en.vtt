COOKING FROM THE HEART

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.140
Dear my culinary friends,

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.900
our today’s guest lived for a long time over there in the US

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:19.340
and recently she came here to visit friends and family.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.140
And we used this occasion to invite her to our show

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.380
because she practices, for us really unusual and unordinary,

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.020
type of diet and philosophy of life.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.300
Ms Milica Milovanovic

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.980
Welcome

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.660
It’s good to see you

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.700
So Milica you have been practicing Macrobiotics for...

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.660
22 years

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.340
22 whole years

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.460
Did you go to some school in the US?

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.980
Yes, I was living and working at the Kushi Institute

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.060
in Beckett, Massachusetts with the leading Macrobiotic teacher Michio Kushi.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.180
There were also other teachers but he is the founder.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.180
And what is the core of that philosophy?

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.140
The core is, for example I am female and you are male

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.620
and we attract each other.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.300
So if we add salt to something that is sweet

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.520
then the sugar will come to the surface.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.460
It is about 2 philosophies, totally different...

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.500
sorry, not philosophies

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.380
2 different principles that complement each other.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.300
That means that every yin has a yang part

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.860
and every yang has a yin part.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.935
So in the relation to how and what do you eat

00:01:30.935 --> 00:01:33.380
you can make your condition

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.580
stronger or if you eat weaker foods

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.140
that doesn’t have enough energy

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.500
you become more depressive and uninterested.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.760
If you are too fidgety and nervous

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.220
you can relax yourself with the food.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.000
Yes that’s right

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.780
Really interesting way of thinking,

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.140
there is entire philosophy on it not only the diet.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.780
Yes, Macrobiotics is an everyday observation

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.820
of life

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:08.100
that leads to a choice of your freedom and your destiny.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.740
Destiny. Thank you for coming

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.700
and I hope that your meal today will be interesting for our viewers also.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.820
Thanks for having me.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.780
RECIPE OF THE DAY

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.900
So Milica what are we preparing for today?

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.020
I am going to add a little bit of oil,

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.900
because it is a summer period, we need some extra energy.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.980
What are you making for us?

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.340
I am making a soup with parsnips, corn and leeks.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.900
Before we chop the leeks we need to cut them in half

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.740
because usually they have some dirt underneath.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:59.900
It is the best to wash it first, and then we can cut it and then cook it.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.580
This is good for summer days,

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.660
when we sweat a lot

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.220
and need something to cool us down.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.260
Ok, now we are going to grate the corn,

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.100
and then we will strip down everything

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.140
because this is the sweetest part.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.220
See how this knife is good.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.180
Now we are going to add some water

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.100
and leave it on the stove

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.940
until we finish grating the corn and parsnips.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.020
Very good

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.300
So Milica here you already grated the corn and parsnips,

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.780
it looks really nicely chopped

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.900
Here we simmered the leeks

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.100
Leeks were tiny chopped.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.900
Of course, now we are going to add some parsnips.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.940
It will all blend and cook together.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.500
Good

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.460
And some corn...

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.980
Yes also some corn on the top.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.620
Corn is really fresh

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.860
Yes It is. This is going to be a nice soup with parsnips, corn and leeks

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.820
Macrobiotics is not a boogie man,

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.220
it is a traditional way of eating.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.380
Our grandmothers were making this.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.460
he only spice is salt, nothing else.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.620
We are going to cook this for 15 minutes.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.260
That is it

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.980
Now we are going to add some salt.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.780
Salt needs to be cooked for at least 10 minutes so that it becomes digestible.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:56.140
If you season your meal with uncooked salt you don’t support your indigestion.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.420
It is the best to cook it for 10 minutes.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.460
You can see how it looks colorful and beautiful.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.300
We can add more water if we want it to be thinner

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.860
or we can add some polenta if we want it to be denser,

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.540
but I think this is the best way.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.020
The best variation, that’s right.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.860
we are going to cook this for about 15 minutes...

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:17.900
...and then we will try it

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:18.700
...and we will try it then.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.940
PARSNIPS SOUP:

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:40.100
3 leeks, 2 sweet corns, bunch of parsnips root, pinch of salt, water

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.180
FOOD FOR THE EYES

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.460
Hey Dejan here is something for the spoon.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.780
this is not bad at all

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.900
It is sweet and nice...

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.540
yes it is sweet, because it is sweet corn

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.860
leeks also contribute to sweetness.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.140
Mhm, very tasty

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.500
Parsnips also contribute to sweet taste.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.340
That’s right. This is really unusual with parsnips and so much sweet corn,

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.900
I've never tried it before.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.300
This is great

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.460
I’m glad you like it.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.460
You are the first one that cooked Macrobiotic dish that is tasty and edible.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.780
There are no chemicals in it.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.900
No chemicals, that’s great

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.300
It is something traditional as it always is with Macrobiotics
