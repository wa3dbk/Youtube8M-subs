00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.160 
pointer and it's actually pretty cool
and<00:00:57.969> something<00:00:58.449> that<00:00:58.569> I<00:00:58.719> really<00:00:58.870> like<00:00:59.140> about

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
and something that I really like about

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.139 
and something that I really like about
this<00:00:59.559> device<00:00:59.859> is<00:01:00.069> that<00:01:00.280> your<00:01:00.399> thumb<00:01:00.729> never

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
this device is that your thumb never

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.630 
this device is that your thumb never
really<00:01:01.600> leaves<00:01:01.929> the<00:01:02.260> center<00:01:02.559> area<00:01:02.769> because

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
really leaves the center area because

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.790 
really leaves the center area because
there<00:01:03.909> are<00:01:04.059> soft<00:01:04.449> keys<00:01:04.750> so<00:01:05.229> you're<00:01:05.409> moving<00:01:05.560> the

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
there are soft keys so you're moving the

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.260 
there are soft keys so you're moving the
cursor<00:01:05.950> with<00:01:06.280> this<00:01:06.460> and<00:01:06.700> you're<00:01:06.790> you're

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
cursor with this and you're you're

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.120 
cursor with this and you're you're
pressing<00:01:07.780> on<00:01:07.990> the<00:01:08.020> soft<00:01:08.320> keys<00:01:08.530> like<00:01:08.710> that<00:01:08.950> and

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
pressing on the soft keys like that and

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.100 
pressing on the soft keys like that and
it's<00:01:09.580> great<00:01:09.850> for<00:01:10.060> one<00:01:10.180> handed<00:01:10.240> usability<00:01:10.990> if

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
it's great for one handed usability if

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.870 
it's great for one handed usability if
you<00:01:11.229> look<00:01:11.380> at<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:11.590> palm<00:01:11.799> treo<00:01:12.100> pro<00:01:12.159> which

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
you look at the palm treo pro which

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.480 
you look at the palm treo pro which
doesn't<00:01:13.329> have<00:01:13.509> these<00:01:13.719> soft<00:01:14.530> keys<00:01:14.829> if<00:01:15.040> you're

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
doesn't have these soft keys if you're

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.550 
doesn't have these soft keys if you're
if<00:01:15.670> you're<00:01:15.820> operating<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.509> d-pad<00:01:16.930> and<00:01:16.960> moving

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
if you're operating the d-pad and moving

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.889 
if you're operating the d-pad and moving
around<00:01:17.649> menus<00:01:18.130> to<00:01:18.670> confirm<00:01:19.180> a<00:01:19.210> selection<00:01:19.630> you

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
around menus to confirm a selection you

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:21.359 
around menus to confirm a selection you
have<00:01:20.049> to<00:01:20.200> press<00:01:20.380> on<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:20.649> screen<00:01:20.950> like<00:01:21.159> that

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
have to press on the screen like that

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.429 
have to press on the screen like that
and<00:01:21.549> move<00:01:21.670> your<00:01:21.790> thumb<00:01:22.060> a<00:01:22.240> lot<00:01:22.539> so<00:01:22.990> I<00:01:23.020> think<00:01:23.140> the

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
and move your thumb a lot so I think the

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:24.899 
and move your thumb a lot so I think the
epics<00:01:23.799> is<00:01:23.890> going<00:01:24.039> to<00:01:24.100> rank<00:01:24.219> really<00:01:24.640> high<00:01:24.880> in

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
epics is going to rank really high in

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.749 
epics is going to rank really high in
one-handed<00:01:25.479> usability<00:01:26.170> so<00:01:27.159> going<00:01:27.340> down<00:01:27.460> to

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
one-handed usability so going down to

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.429 
one-handed usability so going down to
the<00:01:27.789> keyboard<00:01:28.270> we<00:01:28.689> see<00:01:28.899> that<00:01:28.930> it's<00:01:29.170> a<00:01:29.229> full

three<00:03:00.129> ways<00:03:00.400> look<00:03:00.700> at<00:03:00.819> this<00:03:00.970> two<00:03:01.870> three<00:03:02.730> it's

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
three ways look at this two three it's

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.580 
three ways look at this two three it's
kind<00:03:03.879> of<00:03:03.970> kind<00:03:04.180> of<00:03:04.329> unique<00:03:04.540> but<00:03:04.840> I<00:03:04.870> think

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
kind of kind of unique but I think

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.960 
kind of kind of unique but I think
