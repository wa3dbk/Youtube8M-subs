00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.139
 hello girls today I bring you this look 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.759
 pretty colorful taking advantage of 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.860
 last weeks that we have left of summer 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.690
 it's a combination of both matte shadows 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.270
 like ximet that range from the mint green 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.250
 until purple and pink and I hope they 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.960
 like it and then let's start like 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.609
 we always start by applying a first in 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.160
 all our eyelid now I'm going to apply 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.859
 a little bit of this first white jumbo 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.230
 just a little here on the eyelid 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.719
 mobile and with our finger we started it 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.250
 blur I'm going to take this object from wet 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.380
 and wild and with a brush to blur 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.750
 I'm going to take some of this shadow in a 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.079
 tone like peach skin can apply 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.190
 here 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.190
 on the fixed eyelid 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.790
 and with an angled brush I'm going to take a 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.830
 little of this shade purple all of 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.850
 this palette are matte this is going to apply 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.850
 right in the basin 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.620
 and then start mixing with the shadow 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.629
 from above without raising it too much 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.930
 now I'm going to take this palette of urbani 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.570
 cane I'm going to take some of this shadow 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.550
 abode all of this palette are 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.830
 shimmer using the same brush as 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.710
 we use to apply the shadow and the 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.290
 salmon from the wet and wild paddle 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.470
 I will place here 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.800
 where we put that tone and using the 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.380
 purple tone recurred the matt tone I'm 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.410
 using these two palettes because I want 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.290
 the intensity of the matte shadow but 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:36.680
 I want the reflections of the shadow shimmer 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:40.130
 I do not want to use only the debts 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.430
 of cage that looks too bright the 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.130
 look 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.350
 I just want some true flash 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.600
 reflex if necessary we take again 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.460
 a little bit of the salmon shadow of wet and 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.530
 white and we blur this part a little 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.320
 This shadow will serve us as 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.960
 transition takes the object of wet and 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.659
 wild and I will use this green shadow 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.810
 mint and these apply throughout the 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.490
 eyelid mobile 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.209
 I'm going to put it on a bit of 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.730
 these green waves we put taps 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.470
 around the mobile eyelid trying not to 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.050
 mix what is green with purple 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.920
 so that a new color is not formed and 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.500
 see 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.750
 a strange combination I think they will be 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.640
 the two tones well defined now with 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.920
 this vanilla shadow I will apply 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.930
 here in the arch of my eyebrows to 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.720
 illuminate and also to blur a 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.160
 little the edges of the pink tone of the 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.680
 pink shadow that we apply at the beginning 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.620
 with this eraser in pencil in tone 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.880
 milan water and it was a thin line 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.489
 and tabs to the roots 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.989
 inferiors and how the brush is left 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.780
 with which we apply the green shadow 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.340
 let's blur it so that it does not 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.769
 so marked and also to seal it a 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.810
 little with this liquid eyeliner in tone 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.870
