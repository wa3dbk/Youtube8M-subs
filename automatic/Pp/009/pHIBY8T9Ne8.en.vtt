nobody has plugged up the courage as yet
to<00:00:05.339> ask<00:00:05.910> me<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.299> do<00:00:06.480> this<00:00:06.899> video<00:00:08.450> but<00:00:09.450> I'm<00:00:09.540> going

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
to ask me to do this video but I'm going

to ask me to do this video but I'm going
to<00:00:09.719> do<00:00:09.809> it<00:00:09.929> anyway<00:00:11.090> because<00:00:12.090> this<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.900> a

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
to do it anyway because this is a

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.910 
to do it anyway because this is a
problem<00:00:13.620> which<00:00:14.160> affects<00:00:15.379> vast<00:00:16.379> numbers<00:00:16.890> of

problem which affects vast numbers of

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.650 
problem which affects vast numbers of
people<00:00:17.750> and<00:00:19.550> I<00:00:20.550> think<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.000> would<00:00:21.119> be<00:00:21.150> very<00:00:21.420> good

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
people and I think it would be very good

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.279 
people and I think it would be very good
idea<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.470> solve<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.949> before<00:00:23.939> Christmas<00:00:24.570> how

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
idea to solve it before Christmas how

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.050 
idea to solve it before Christmas how
about<00:00:25.500> now<00:00:26.990> and<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.470> problem<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:29.130> shall<00:00:29.970> we

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
about now and this problem is shall we

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:38.080 
about now and this problem is shall we
say<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.630> problem<00:00:31.439> with<00:00:32.329> the<00:00:33.329> flow<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.989> money<00:00:36.770> now

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
say a problem with the flow of money now

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.280 
say a problem with the flow of money now
this<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:40.340> not<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.550> problem<00:00:41.940> which<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.390> in<00:00:42.870> any

it's<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.510> problem<00:00:48.930> created<00:00:49.860> by<00:00:49.860> skewed

exactly in english notes I've actually

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.950 
exactly in english notes I've actually
said<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.200> but<00:01:22.500> we<00:01:22.650> can<00:01:22.830> try<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.960> literally

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
said it but we can try it literally

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.719 
said it but we can try it literally
means<00:01:25.369> foreign<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.970> reality<00:01:28.159> so<00:01:29.159> it's<00:01:29.579> like

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
means foreign to reality so it's like

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.770 
means foreign to reality so it's like
this<00:01:30.659> comes<00:01:30.930> from<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.320> foreign<00:01:31.680> country<00:01:32.299> and<00:01:33.299> it

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
this comes from a foreign country and it

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.980 
this comes from a foreign country and it
doesn't<00:01:34.049> belong<00:01:34.259> here<00:01:35.390> and<00:01:36.390> this<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.780> what

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
doesn't belong here and this is what

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.980 
doesn't belong here and this is what
money<00:01:37.790> information<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.970> we<00:01:39.090> all<00:01:39.119> are<00:01:39.600> the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
money information that we all are the

money information that we all are the
majority<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.680> us<00:01:41.009> suffer<00:01:41.850> under<00:01:42.180> or<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> have

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.170 
suffered under I no longer doom but we
can<00:01:47.340> actually<00:01:47.549> remove<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.899> lot<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.610> this<00:01:50.610> skewed

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
can actually remove a lot of this skewed

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.160 
can actually remove a lot of this skewed
information<00:01:52.100> from<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.369> general<00:01:53.790> energy

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
information from the general energy

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.990 
information from the general energy
field<00:01:55.170> around<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.790> no<00:01:56.969> longer

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
field around you so that it no longer

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.539 
field around you so that it no longer
affects<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.799> will<00:01:58.950> find<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.399> you

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
affects you and you will find that you

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.359 
affects you and you will find that you
will<00:01:59.579> cease<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.030> believe<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.619> when<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.189> no

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
will cease to believe it and when you no

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.100 
will cease to believe it and when you no
longer<00:02:02.399> believe<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:04.009> then<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:06.270> truth<00:02:06.719> about

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
longer believe it then the truth about

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.550 
longer believe it then the truth about
money<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.069> abundance<00:02:08.729> will<00:02:09.629> materialize

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
money and abundance will materialize

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.830 
money and abundance will materialize
itself<00:02:11.069> much<00:02:11.580> more<00:02:11.910> readily<00:02:12.840> in<00:02:13.230> your

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
itself much more readily in your

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.140 
itself much more readily in your
so<00:02:15.840> this<00:02:16.050> is<00:02:16.080> what<00:02:16.320> this<00:02:16.830> video<00:02:17.520> which<00:02:17.790> follows

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
so this is what this video which follows

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.930 
so this is what this video which follows
this<00:02:18.300> introduction<00:02:18.720> is<00:02:18.990> about<00:02:19.260> it's<00:02:19.590> about

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
this introduction is about it's about

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.380 
this introduction is about it's about
removing<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.330> belief<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:23.030> you<00:02:24.030> could<00:02:24.240> have

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
removing the belief that you could have

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.650 
removing the belief that you could have
a<00:02:24.420> shortage<00:02:24.900> of<00:02:25.020> anything<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:26.190> by<00:02:27.150> removing

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
a shortage of anything and by removing

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.340 
a shortage of anything and by removing
that<00:02:28.020> false<00:02:28.530> belief<00:02:29.330> your<00:02:30.330> natural<00:02:30.900> true

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
that false belief your natural true

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.860 
that false belief your natural true
state<00:02:31.800> is<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.190> only<00:02:32.370> one<00:02:32.640> which<00:02:32.850> can<00:02:33.210> manifest

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
state is the only one which can manifest

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.670 
state is the only one which can manifest
and<00:02:34.290> so<00:02:34.940> you<00:02:35.940> move<00:02:36.150> naturally<00:02:36.720> into<00:02:37.320> greater

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
and so you move naturally into greater

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.910 
and so you move naturally into greater
abundance<00:02:39.560> so<00:02:40.610> let's<00:02:41.610> do<00:02:41.760> it
