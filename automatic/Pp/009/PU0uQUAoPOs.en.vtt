00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello teum up and 4bis 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.859
 banks so today we find ourselves 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.930
 for a new city at the trampoline the 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.510
 first for this string so him 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:15.089
 trace the basic figures for you 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:17.730
 read them without much complicity to his 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.670
 process so difficulty rather center in 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.050
 difficulty so start with the roulade 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.269
 the round was done yesterday by castle 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.099
 before when I was little thing like that 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.150
 that you can buy spare and 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.840
 mixed for example you want to do 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:35.550
 a time roll like theopilus after 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:40.260
 I can all come to prague the wii 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.870
 offers a mix at home both 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.170
 things you treat the pleasant ones to 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.879
 watch 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.370
 why why do you start with the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:53.910
 ruda you just live 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.750
 we all got a lot of it having been 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:04.949
 posed marks and his nose in a 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:10.290
 drift and then we do not have to 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:15.270
 secret or worse if you get your 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:19.740
 head and you push you ignore on 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:26.600
 Pauline on the run snapped before so 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:32.119
 we get there we are the height and tour 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:34.470
 general group and that's why too 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.700
 like that give you more rotations 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.700
 and it happened 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.909
 finally I do not know how to do I'll be 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.579
 not shown all their chances of 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.130
 videos you learn it variable this 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.770
 video is not for you we were not 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.820

 that it will intervene the good time I 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.890
 want well but brilliantly 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.969
 you will make a movement of 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:17.400
