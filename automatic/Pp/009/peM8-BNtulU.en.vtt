we turn that around the talk we had it's

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.150 
we turn that around the talk we had it's
halftime<00:06:21.940> and<00:06:22.390> the<00:06:22.540> fact<00:06:22.810> that<00:06:22.900> we<00:06:23.110> changed<00:06:23.950> so

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 
halftime and the fact that we changed so

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.920 
halftime and the fact that we changed so
many<00:06:24.310> players<00:06:24.670> and<00:06:25.030> that<00:06:25.060> is<00:06:25.240> difficult<00:06:25.900> for

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
many players and that is difficult for

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.740

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
I think we'll play better than second

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.650 
I think we'll play better than second
half<00:06:30.580> and<00:06:31.620> it<00:06:32.620> was<00:06:32.860> gold<00:06:33.160> that<00:06:34.090> goal<00:06:34.630> was

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.660

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:44.890 
well I think when we started the first

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:46.680 
well I think when we started the first
half<00:06:45.100> things<00:06:45.490> were<00:06:45.640> really<00:06:45.790> jumbled<00:06:46.300> you<00:06:46.540> know

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:46.690

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:50.230 
totally putting a lot of pressure on our

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:51.390 
totally putting a lot of pressure on our
backs<00:06:50.410> it<00:06:50.680> was<00:06:50.770> really<00:06:50.950> hard<00:06:51.100> to<00:06:51.130> hold<00:06:51.280> the

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 
backs it was really hard to hold the

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.520 
backs it was really hard to hold the
ball<00:06:51.550> and<00:06:51.760> keep<00:06:51.910> it<00:06:52.090> and<00:06:52.260> get<00:06:53.260> that<00:06:53.290> rhythm

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:13.900 
against the Brazil you know defense it

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.200 
against the Brazil you know defense it
was<00:07:14.169> a<00:07:14.500> tiring<00:07:15.010> game<00:07:15.370> you<00:07:15.669> know<00:07:15.790> we've<00:07:16.180> been

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:16.210 
was a tiring game you know we've been

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.060 
was a tiring game you know we've been
training<00:07:16.720> really<00:07:16.900> hard<00:07:16.990> and<00:07:17.500> you<00:07:17.800> know<00:07:17.919> I<00:07:17.950> was

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:18.070 
training really hard and you know I was

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.770 
training really hard and you know I was
pretty<00:07:18.190> tired<00:07:18.310> from<00:07:18.640> very<00:07:18.850> beginning<00:07:18.970> so<00:07:19.480> I

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:19.780 
pretty tired from very beginning so I

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.659 
pretty tired from very beginning so I
think<00:07:19.930> a<00:07:20.260> lot<00:07:20.290> of<00:07:20.500> it<00:07:20.650> was<00:07:20.770> mental<00:07:21.130> and<00:07:21.400> it<00:07:21.550> was

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:21.669 
think a lot of it was mental and it was

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:23.490 
think a lot of it was mental and it was
just<00:07:21.760> a<00:07:21.850> matter<00:07:21.970> of<00:07:22.150> being<00:07:22.300> able<00:07:22.630> to<00:07:22.780> push

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:23.500 
just a matter of being able to push

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.200 
just a matter of being able to push
through<00:07:23.530> for<00:07:23.860> 90<00:07:24.100> minutes<00:07:24.280> and<00:07:24.669> you<00:07:24.880> know<00:07:25.000> it

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.210 
through for 90 minutes and you know it

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.150 
through for 90 minutes and you know it
they're<00:07:25.750> very<00:07:25.870> physical<00:07:26.380> so<00:07:26.620> I<00:07:26.650> think<00:07:26.890> it's

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:27.160 
they're very physical so I think it's

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.710 
they're very physical so I think it's
you<00:07:27.760> not<00:07:27.940> like<00:07:28.090> the<00:07:28.210> other<00:07:28.330> teams<00:07:28.540> that<00:07:28.630> we

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 
you not like the other teams that we

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.630 
you not like the other teams that we
haven't<00:07:28.990> that<00:07:29.470> we<00:07:29.560> played<00:07:29.800> aren't<00:07:30.250> but<00:07:30.610> I

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:30.640 
haven't that we played aren't but I

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.980 
haven't that we played aren't but I
think<00:07:30.910> this<00:07:31.060> team<00:07:31.240> is<00:07:31.450> just<00:07:31.480> it's<00:07:31.750> a<00:07:31.810> little

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:31.990 
think this team is just it's a little

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.900 
think this team is just it's a little
different<00:07:32.169> and<00:07:32.530> you<00:07:33.070> know<00:07:33.100> very<00:07:33.250> fast-paced

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:33.910 
different and you know very fast-paced

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.510 
different and you know very fast-paced
very<00:07:34.870> hectic<00:07:35.080> at<00:07:35.320> times<00:07:35.350> so<00:07:35.890> you<00:07:35.950> know<00:07:36.280> it's<00:07:36.430> up
