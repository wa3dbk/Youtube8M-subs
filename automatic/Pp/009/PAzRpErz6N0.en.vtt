00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.730 
HD display so more pixels but then yeah
quickly<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.030> video<00:02:06.329> here<00:02:06.630> checking<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.290> out<00:02:07.409> on

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
quickly a video here checking it out on

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.100 
quickly a video here checking it out on
these<00:02:07.920> pictures<00:02:08.340> from<00:02:08.580> on<00:02:08.819> leaks<00:02:09.110> hopefully

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
these pictures from on leaks hopefully

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.180 
these pictures from on leaks hopefully
you<00:02:10.259> did<00:02:10.500> enjoy

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
you did enjoy

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.940 
you did enjoy
there<00:02:12.580> do<00:02:13.120> you<00:02:13.180> want<00:02:13.420> us<00:02:13.600> device<00:02:13.960> you<00:02:14.350> probably

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
there do you want us device you probably

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.470 
there do you want us device you probably
do<00:02:15.190> it<00:02:15.630> also<00:02:16.630> looks<00:02:16.810> like<00:02:17.050> it<00:02:17.230> might<00:02:17.530> have

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
do it also looks like it might have

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.110 
do it also looks like it might have
maybe<00:02:19.480> some<00:02:19.780> sharper<00:02:20.290> edges<00:02:20.500> or<00:02:21.430> not<00:02:21.910> just

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
maybe some sharper edges or not just

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.940 
maybe some sharper edges or not just
rounded<00:02:22.720> edges<00:02:23.050> but<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:23.380> can<00:02:23.500> see<00:02:23.620> there<00:02:23.830> in

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
rounded edges but you can see there in

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.670 
rounded edges but you can see there in
the<00:02:24.040> middle<00:02:24.360> on<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.420> edges<00:02:25.900> it<00:02:26.140> almost<00:02:26.410> looks

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
the middle on the edges it almost looks

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.230 
the middle on the edges it almost looks
like<00:02:26.770> it<00:02:26.980> could<00:02:27.100> be<00:02:27.130> a<00:02:27.250> little<00:02:27.400> bit<00:02:27.550> sharper<00:02:27.970> so

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
like it could be a little bit sharper so

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.140 
like it could be a little bit sharper so
maybe<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.630> design<00:02:29.260> difference<00:02:29.710> here<00:02:29.830> as<00:02:29.920> well

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
maybe a design difference here as well

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.430 
maybe a design difference here as well
as<00:02:31.150> playing<00:02:31.330> see<00:02:31.540> this<00:02:31.690> twice<00:02:31.810> maybe<00:02:32.140> come

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
as playing see this twice maybe come

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.770 
as playing see this twice maybe come
this<00:02:32.710> summer<00:02:33.010> so<00:02:33.490> definitely<00:02:34.210> stay<00:02:34.300> tuned<00:02:34.540> for

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
this summer so definitely stay tuned for

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.450 
this summer so definitely stay tuned for
that<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.170> yeah<00:02:36.130> have<00:02:36.730> enough<00:02:36.880> like<00:02:37.060> peace
