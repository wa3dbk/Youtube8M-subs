00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.730
 for his recipes and we took care 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.320
 to select with marc accounts 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.089
 is different accounts is different 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.980
 it's also different textures of 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.500
 refining different as much for the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.529
 only for perfumes and 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.529
 flavors 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.420
 there are plenty of kinds of county going 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.279
 to make that tastes will change my 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.710
 work it's going to be selecting the 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.180
 fruit and according to each 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.190
 time of year to be able to propose to 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.200
 my clients this famous taste what we have in 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.390
 common with Marc with the creamers it's 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.920
 that they are always looking for excellence 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.070
 in the barrel we need people 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.960
 like that to bring us products 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.149
 exceptional but also tastes 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.949
 new tastes different south arts 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.809
 we can also finalist explain to them 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.609
 that we selected our cheeses at 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.590
 the refiners that 11 years a big 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.239
 selection of the flavors of the dough 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.189
 we have a way of proposing to our 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.080
 customers the goujat every moment of 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.090
 the year visit was very interesting 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.159
 so I did not suspect at all who 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.170
 had so much wealth in the county one 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.810
 go four dishes to dessert 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.400
 or a master of the group and the entry is going 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.229
 to be Saint Jacques in Viennese 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.490
 count and hazelnuts 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.590
 so we need an account is young 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.170
 even though I have a cheese from April 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.909
 which is rather fine a rather sweet taste 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.830
 which will correspond well to the first cheese 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.180
 that you asked me 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.550
 it's mostly the technical aspect that 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.890
 help us in the recipe the county is going 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.510
 to be mine is going to be the binder he's going to be 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.659
 melt hot huh 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.520
 it froze cold and then when we go 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.040
 warm it up it's going to give this little 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.050
 praline side praline is before being 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.720
 gratinÃ© we want it is she 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.720
 just little golden on the scallops 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.310
 jade is also I think we'll cook them 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.409
 50 minutes our eyes and we will cover them 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.080
 with a counting milk in the series 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.979
 on a toasted brioche and then we 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.979
 put some truffles 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.709
 to this statement and we take it 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.390
 take the pan we have milk and we 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.150
 puts the two counties to have used a 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.640
 account and jonas and creamy to bring 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.560
 binder and for the third of the 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.290
 preparation will add an account and a 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.760
 little older a little more refined for 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.760
 taste aromatic power 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:35.730
 then I need a 12 or 14 months 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:40.290
 we will use to connect the polenta 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.629
 who are worth with the ring have fled the 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.489
 polenta when polenta and cooked on 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.110
 incorporates the county at that moment I'm the 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.360
 touch a m that's the finishing touch 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.670
 it is once again that brings us 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.670
 the holding of the mellows and the perfume 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.159
 what I like in the kitchen or 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.019
 to count is the wealth of pallets 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.730
 which in fact makes it possible to 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.870
 starter a dish a dessert 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.489
 this is not a county but there is 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.629
 several counties that will serve me to 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:12.180
 make a lot of recipes 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:16.609
 so that's the sweetest it's going to be 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.609
 for dessert we made chis quai 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.400
 50 and that is rather back but enough 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.110
 lactic level of aromas agree so 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.730
 that's what we need because we 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.319
 does not want any aromatic power of 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.790
 reboot things like that we want the side 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.790
 lactic account and that's it 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.550
 a product that has such diversity 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.849
 aromatic 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.760
 such a power of you that it's 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.900
 always interesting to make shots 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.390
 taste like that with friends then there 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.860
 it's the 7th best jump today 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.630
 I do not need to convince someone 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.400
 to fit the account and I think that 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.519
 when we tasted it after we can more 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.519
 to do without
