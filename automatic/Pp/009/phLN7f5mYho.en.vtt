00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
end of the level and then you'll get on

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.840 
end of the level and then you'll get on
to<00:03:03.290> another<00:03:04.069> level<00:03:04.280> and<00:03:04.640> then<00:03:04.760> eventually

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
to another level and then eventually

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.570 
to another level and then eventually
you'll<00:03:05.330> have<00:03:05.450> to<00:03:05.510> do<00:03:05.690> bosses<00:03:06.110> so<00:03:06.770> nothing

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
you'll have to do bosses so nothing

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.370 
you'll have to do bosses so nothing
really<00:03:07.610> different<00:03:07.880> there<00:03:08.270> but<00:03:08.810> it<00:03:08.959> still<00:03:09.200> is<00:03:09.350> a

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
really different there but it still is a

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.350

very fun game especially you can do like
platforms<00:03:12.370> here<00:03:13.370> you've<00:03:13.790> got<00:03:13.970> several

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
platforms here you've got several

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.050 
platforms here you've got several
choices<00:03:14.540> you<00:03:15.110> can<00:03:15.260> either<00:03:15.680> turn<00:03:16.370> into<00:03:16.670> a<00:03:16.730> small

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
choices you can either turn into a small

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.790 
choices you can either turn into a small
dynamite<00:03:17.569> Headdy<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:18.080> keep<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.530> maca<00:03:18.739> root

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
dynamite Headdy and keep the maca root

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.740 
dynamite Headdy and keep the maca root
or<00:03:19.220> you<00:03:19.640> can<00:03:19.760> get<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:19.940> spike<00:03:20.180> head<00:03:20.360> I<00:03:20.450> was<00:03:20.600> just

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
or you can get the spike head I was just

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.570 
or you can get the spike head I was just
showing<00:03:20.930> you<00:03:21.050> earlier<00:03:21.140> on<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:21.709> climb<00:03:22.310> up<00:03:22.459> to

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
showing you earlier on and climb up to

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.330 
showing you earlier on and climb up to
the<00:03:22.610> top<00:03:22.730> so<00:03:23.690> that's<00:03:23.870> pretty<00:03:24.080> cool<00:03:24.350> it<00:03:24.590> gives

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
the top so that's pretty cool it gives

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.620 
the top so that's pretty cool it gives
the<00:03:25.489> game<00:03:25.610> a<00:03:25.670> little<00:03:25.760> bit<00:03:25.940> more<00:03:26.120> life<00:03:26.330> span

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
the game a little bit more life span

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.900 
the game a little bit more life span
because<00:03:27.319> of<00:03:27.470> our<00:03:27.560> areas<00:03:28.130> where<00:03:28.400> you<00:03:28.430> can't<00:03:28.760> do

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
because of our areas where you can't do

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:39.420 
because of our areas where you can't do
different<00:03:29.299> things<00:03:29.360> to<00:03:29.630> solve<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.019> puzzle

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.910 

music<00:03:40.430> wise<00:03:40.810> except<00:03:41.810> I<00:03:42.019> think<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.590> music<00:03:42.890> is

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
music wise except I think the music is

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.050 
music wise except I think the music is
pretty<00:03:43.040> good<00:03:43.340> but<00:03:43.610> I<00:03:43.640> don't<00:03:43.819> think<00:03:43.880> it's

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
pretty good but I don't think it's

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.570 
pretty good but I don't think it's
anything<00:03:44.209> too<00:03:44.480> special<00:03:45.040> I'll<00:03:46.040> just<00:03:46.310> shut<00:03:46.489> up

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
anything too special I'll just shut up

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:53.160 
anything too special I'll just shut up
for<00:03:46.610> a<00:03:46.760> few<00:03:46.880> seconds<00:03:47.209> to<00:03:47.299> let<00:03:47.360> you<00:03:47.480> listen

much standard every time you hear it it

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.479

makes<00:05:07.110> it<00:05:07.379> more<00:05:07.469> challenging<00:05:07.529> which<00:05:08.189> is

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
makes it more challenging which is

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.100 
makes it more challenging which is
something<00:05:08.639> that<00:05:08.879> a<00:05:09.029> lot<00:05:09.120> of<00:05:09.360> people<00:05:09.449> want<00:05:09.870> it's

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:15.920 
something that I definitely want
anywhere<00:05:12.979> there<00:05:13.979> are<00:05:14.099> actually<00:05:14.279> off<00:05:15.270> all<00:05:15.539> nine

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
anywhere there are actually off all nine

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.189 
anywhere there are actually off all nine
stages<00:05:16.379> in<00:05:16.650> the<00:05:16.740> game<00:05:16.919> and<00:05:17.159> then<00:05:17.719> final<00:05:18.719> stages

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
stages in the game and then final stages

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.469

00:05:26.269 --> 00:05:26.279 
sections and sub stages and then you'll

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:28.059 
sections and sub stages and then you'll
get<00:05:26.490> up<00:05:26.610> to<00:05:26.699> the<00:05:26.789> final<00:05:27.150> stages<00:05:27.569> which

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:28.069 
get up to the final stages which

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:30.110 
get up to the final stages which
depending<00:05:29.069> on<00:05:29.189> what<00:05:29.400> you<00:05:29.520> do<00:05:29.669> with<00:05:29.819> the<00:05:29.909> game
