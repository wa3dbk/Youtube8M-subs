00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello friends with you dagi rock and 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.759
 about how to build a car today 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.610
 minecraft 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.950
 using trolleys this mechanism i 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.139
 I saw whether Andrea but only he shot 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.630
 on earlier versions and he had one 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.440
 minus what expelled drove on and 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.430
 diagonally 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:25.050
 and then why are we doing such a circle 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.619
 from such a circle and circuses 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.550
 normal release if you output so 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:36.059
 about four or five put rails and 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:38.010
 now we are so simple very many many 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.890
 many many many many many many 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.920
 many many many many put trolleys 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.570
 so barely get out as we will see no longer 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:51.870
 trolleys that's it and I got out now 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:55.230
 we put the lever we activate it twice 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.730
 yes yes our car yes and 1 flies millet 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:04.530
 so I already went and now 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.840
 here we go 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.420
 pay attention after let's go again 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.299
 let's do many many many many 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:19.380
 many many many many many many 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:21.869
 trolleys and many many many many many 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.780
 many many many many many many 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.110
 trolleys like this 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.369
 now push the lever 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:34.020
 pushing and driving in Ufa and yet the car 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.470
 rides and as we see she rides on 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.930
 take 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.630
 and he really drove to the spike yes but 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.990
 sometimes there are such bugs that the machine 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.610
 quite simply 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.200
 stops and yes I do not advise you 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:52.170

 I am king of ear enteritis sit in front 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.719

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.729
 calcium yes here we come to such 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.860

 I have already seen some friends too 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.440
