watch and in this video we'll be doing a
direct<00:00:02.850> head-to-head<00:00:03.600> camera<00:00:04.230> comparison

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
direct head-to-head camera comparison

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.909 
direct head-to-head camera comparison
between<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.370> HTC<00:00:06.060> One<00:00:06.330> m9<00:00:06.690> and<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.440> Samsung

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
between the HTC One m9 and the Samsung

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.129 
between the HTC One m9 and the Samsung
Galaxy<00:00:08.429> s6<00:00:09.059> what<00:00:09.570> you're<00:00:09.690> looking<00:00:09.960> at<00:00:10.019> right

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
Galaxy s6 what you're looking at right

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.530 
Galaxy s6 what you're looking at right
now<00:00:10.200> is<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.500> front<00:00:10.950> facing<00:00:11.160> camera<00:00:11.309> on<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.910> both

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
now is the front facing camera on a both

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.850 
now is the front facing camera on a both
phone<00:00:12.809> so<00:00:12.990> we're<00:00:13.110> just<00:00:13.259> going<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.440> switch<00:00:13.650> back

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
phone so we're just going to switch back

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.790 
phone so we're just going to switch back
and<00:00:13.889> forth<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.519> see<00:00:15.030> how<00:00:15.330> they<00:00:15.570> look<00:00:15.960> now<00:00:16.379> one

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
and forth and see how they look now one

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.960 
and forth and see how they look now one
thing<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:17.130> note<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.460> that<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.730> Samsung

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
thing to note is that the Samsung

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.840 
thing to note is that the Samsung
actually<00:00:18.240> has<00:00:18.480> active<00:00:18.990> HDR<00:00:19.890> capabilities<00:00:20.640> so

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
actually has active HDR capabilities so

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.390 
actually has active HDR capabilities so
it's<00:00:21.000> changing<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.600> dynamic<00:00:22.050> range<00:00:22.289> as<00:00:22.560> we

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
it's changing the dynamic range as we

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.670 
it's changing the dynamic range as we
change<00:00:23.699> from<00:00:24.000> seeing<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.390> scene<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.779> on<00:00:25.529> the

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
change from seeing the scene and on the

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.370 
change from seeing the scene and on the
m9<00:00:26.010> we<00:00:26.160> have<00:00:26.279> an<00:00:26.400> ultra<00:00:26.730> pixel<00:00:26.880> sensor<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:27.990> it's

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
m9 we have an ultra pixel sensor so it's

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.019 
m9 we have an ultra pixel sensor so it's
supposedly<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.279> little<00:00:29.519> bit<00:00:29.609> better<00:00:29.730> than

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
supposedly a little bit better than

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.669 
supposedly a little bit better than
low-light<00:00:30.449> because<00:00:30.720> it's<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.960> little<00:00:31.349> bit<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.590> a

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
low-light because it's a little bit of a

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.310 
low-light because it's a little bit of a
larger<00:00:32.040> sensor<00:00:32.460> than<00:00:32.910> what<00:00:33.059> we<00:00:33.180> have<00:00:33.420> on<00:00:33.660> the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
larger sensor than what we have on the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.870 
larger sensor than what we have on the
Samsung<00:00:34.829> but<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.100> Samsung<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.550> terms<00:00:35.790> of

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
Samsung but the Samsung in terms of

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.450 
Samsung but the Samsung in terms of
megapixels<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.660> 5<00:00:36.930> megapixels<00:00:37.590> 1080p<00:00:38.160> video

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
megapixels is 5 megapixels 1080p video

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.440 
megapixels is 5 megapixels 1080p video
and<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:39.540> m9<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.500> also<00:00:40.950> 1080p<00:00:41.520> but<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.210> 4

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
and the m9 is also 1080p but a 4

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.020 
and the m9 is also 1080p but a 4
megapixel<00:00:42.690> Ultra<00:00:43.410> sensor<00:00:43.770> there<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.489> without

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
megapixel Ultra sensor there so without

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.639 
megapixel Ultra sensor there so without
any<00:00:45.180> further<00:00:45.360> ado<00:00:45.660> let's<00:00:45.870> take<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.260> look<00:00:46.469> at<00:00:46.559> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
any further ado let's take a look at the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.619 
any further ado let's take a look at the
rear<00:00:46.860> facing<00:00:47.129> cameras<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.820> see<00:00:48.210> which<00:00:48.390> one

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
rear facing cameras and see which one

00:00:48.629 --> 00:03:07.670 
rear facing cameras and see which one
looks<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.260> be<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.410> best

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.080 

but<00:03:08.680> I'm<00:03:08.830> night<00:03:09.010> guys<00:03:09.190> that's<00:03:09.640> really<00:03:09.880> it<00:03:09.970> make

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
but I'm night guys that's really it make

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.040 
but I'm night guys that's really it make

letting<00:03:11.830> me<00:03:11.950> know<00:03:12.040> which<00:03:12.580> phone<00:03:12.940> you<00:03:13.239> think

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
letting me know which phone you think

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.570 
letting me know which phone you think
has<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.840> best<00:03:13.959> cameras<00:03:14.530> both<00:03:14.920> in<00:03:15.130> terms<00:03:15.370> of

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
has the best cameras both in terms of

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.880 
has the best cameras both in terms of
steals<00:03:15.940> and<00:03:16.180> video<00:03:16.599> capabilities<00:03:16.780> for<00:03:17.739> me<00:03:17.860> I

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
steals and video capabilities for me I

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.589 
steals and video capabilities for me I
think<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.280> Samsung<00:03:18.700> is<00:03:18.819> the<00:03:18.849> clear<00:03:19.270> winner<00:03:19.300> in

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
think the Samsung is the clear winner in

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.420 
think the Samsung is the clear winner in
terms<00:03:19.810> of<00:03:19.989> most<00:03:20.140> circumstances<00:03:20.800> it's<00:03:21.220> a<00:03:21.280> more

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
terms of most circumstances it's a more

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.070 
terms of most circumstances it's a more
flexible<00:03:21.640> camera<00:03:22.120> certainly<00:03:22.660> a<00:03:22.690> lot<00:03:22.900> better

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
flexible camera certainly a lot better

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.740 
flexible camera certainly a lot better
in<00:03:23.260> low-light<00:03:23.920> conditions<00:03:23.950> but<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:24.940> m9<00:03:25.360> isn't

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
in low-light conditions but the m9 isn't

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.509 
in low-light conditions but the m9 isn't
certainly<00:03:26.080> bad<00:03:26.290> it<00:03:26.769> definitely<00:03:27.130> has<00:03:27.220> a<00:03:27.250> lot<00:03:27.489> of

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
certainly bad it definitely has a lot of

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.100 
certainly bad it definitely has a lot of
resolution<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.209> play<00:03:28.390> with<00:03:28.599> which<00:03:28.780> is<00:03:28.930> nice

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
resolution to play with which is nice

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.080 
resolution to play with which is nice
especially<00:03:29.290> if<00:03:30.040> your<00:03:30.190> stills<00:03:30.519> photographer

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
especially if your stills photographer

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.880 
especially if your stills photographer
and<00:03:31.180> I<00:03:31.239> think<00:03:31.450> the<00:03:31.540> camera<00:03:31.870> app<00:03:32.019> inside<00:03:32.680> is

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
and I think the camera app inside is

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.130 
and I think the camera app inside is
pretty<00:03:33.160> darn<00:03:33.400> good<00:03:33.640> as<00:03:33.819> well<00:03:34.060> but<00:03:34.540> again

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
pretty darn good as well but again

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.360 
pretty darn good as well but again
thanks<00:03:35.410> again<00:03:35.560> for<00:03:35.739> watching<00:03:36.040> make<00:03:36.160> sure<00:03:36.220> to

we have on these two smartphones if you

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.970 
we have on these two smartphones if you
haven't<00:03:40.510> already<00:03:40.600> but<00:03:41.230> other<00:03:41.799> than<00:03:41.920> that
