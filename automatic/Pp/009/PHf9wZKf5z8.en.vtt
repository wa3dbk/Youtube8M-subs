00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.690
 fps tones that returned to its reviews 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.720
 today I will propose you the inspired videogame 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.730
 to the phenomenon of the moment but that children 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.500
 smeducci sing or teenager licata this 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.830
 speaking of the walking dead on five 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.380
 fps artists of March 2013 released by 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.900
 activision in collaboration with the msi e 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.670
 real terminals I'll tell you right away that not 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.199
 will be a review all today and 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.850
 congratulations for this title 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.040
 I would call it a masterpiece 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.200
 miss the plot sees us in the shoes of 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.390
 dixon sign for about two minutes on 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.580
 time to be assailed tasted and 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.140
 spurred by several zombies 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.820
 subsequently the coder which 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.680
 I will play for the rest of the game 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.540
 fails to give us the coup de grace 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.670
 immediately after this sequence of 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.160
 together with the ces collins family friend 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.930
 intended a bad end they decide to 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.340
 go find the only man who can 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.950
 make a difference in an apocalypse 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.570
 zombie mair dixon currently detained 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.440
 in prison who will not make their own 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.970
 jump for joy 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.280
 believing it arrived later 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.229
 we will be right in atlanta looking for 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.830
 helicopters to develop soon 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.840
 and find a safe area excellent plot 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.670
 so let's start immediately with the notes 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.410
 my graphics hurt 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.880
 approximate makes this game 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.060
 an experience to live in close proximity 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.460
 with the melee killings are the 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.860
 more detailed scenes while neither i 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.780
 introductory movies or explosions o 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.550
 whatever else they will be up to a 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.190
 game developed in 2003 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.250
 so dear hell the engine and loved ones 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.980
 programmers having slightly touched 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.950
 the gameplay is as varied as it is gaunt 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.500
 our inventory will always say 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.210
 always consisting of ten slots we can 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.530
 bring everything but also a single 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.480
 bullet will prevent us from 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.240
 collect more supplies in two 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.250
 words a bad management approach 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.380
 of the board game is typical 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.390
 of a stealth game turned to 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.010
 zombies as you see bottles 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.050
 smoke bombs will be the flagship 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.660
 to avoid a comparison anyway 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.100
 direct against too many enemies search 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.810
 always getting around them 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.850
 stick your nice knife by 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.680
 hunting in the skull thus having the pleasure 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.980
 to show you the killings that you 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.530
 around 10 predefined weapons 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.150
 rifles are faithfully reproduced 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.430
 guns accepted 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.379
 baseball leaves firefighting hammers 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.599
 and anything else obviously a weapon 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:01.030
 blunt light necessity rati more 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.980
 heavy blows of a heavy weapon 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.890
 it will take at most 1 but with a time 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.900
 of higher charge the firearms are 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.819
 present in the game but I do not recommend it 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.680
 the stephen rick grimes approach just 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.099
 left the tank in the first 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.099
 season 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.250
 here is the clint eastwood staff 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.890
 it will only make things worse 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.900
 then you will attract a photo number to you 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.329
 more and more zombies and since le 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.640
 ammunition is scarce and does not grow 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.920
 on trees or lets say often e 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.680
 willingly plagiarized by so many workers 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.359
 in search of love, he will stand them and you 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.980
 your timing hit with the boss 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:49.530
 without any variable knife between the eyes 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.599
 of the unfortunate thing unrealistic I 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.670
 in fact I managed by 12 o'clock 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.310
 row without anyone ever succeeding in 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.500
 death impersonating daryl obviously not 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.870
 we will be able to come across the weapon more 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.680
 lethal of the game telefilm bar ie 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.139
 to the gym 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.750
 many complained about the system 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:08.579
 of aiming mine with minor dott 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.530
 but I assure you that for the accuracy not 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.540
 it gets better if the bug never fails 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.370
 acknowledgment in the physics of the dart that 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.959
 always remains at the same height and that 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.329
 will allow you to kill him zombies too 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.579
 at 20 meters away without suffering 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.590
 the actual force of gravity you can 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.080
 recover your head late 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.729
 from your enemies but not from the walls seen 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.039
 that after a missed shot it could 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:30.930
 sometimes destroy the arrow the means 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.849
 transport that we will find are 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.789
 most of the time we will have 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:38.430
 also the problems you get near guide type 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:40.680
 breakdowns or gasoline that is already what it is 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.630
 more than giving a realistic touch 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.610
 the length of time she takes a long time 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.010
 location always the same as the search for 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.539
 spare parts or gasoline journeys 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.460
 will be studied from level to level 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:52.860
 with the possibility of choosing roads 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.139
 alternatives and obviously different events 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.240
 before arriving in atlanta anyway 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.979
 final destination of the game during the 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.360
 path we will encounter so many are 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.330
 lived each with characteristics 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.909
 different according to their abilities e 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.460
 the same preferences may be 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:10.409
 used as pulleys for the 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.419
 supply recipe but watch out for 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:15.000
 percentage of risk what not to do 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.949
 absolutely that I do not recommend is a 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.199
 approach to the rambo 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:21.060
 if you are not a fanatic of the 18th one 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.639
 moving purpose like myself 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.560
 and avoid explaining punishments in 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:28.199
 other areas of the body because you will remember 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.240
 only the zombie run but not 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:32.400
 you will do too much damage as much as you can 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.050
 leave the arms and then vi 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.840
 you will find yourself against zombies there 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.260
 they always take aim at the head 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.930
 to the earth 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.360
 shoot only when it really is 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.430
 necessary to make a bad end in 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.620
 this game is as typical as the game is 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.600
 repetitiveness of the levels as and 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.820
 let's get on with another story 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.800
 weak point if you really want is 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.330
 the absence of a multiplayer and time 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.010
 the presence of tricks itself 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.770
 unlockables for each survivor 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:01.170
 saved who eats blown up the 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.630
 factor on bar up to the collection of 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.950
 secondary objects in almost impossible 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.450
 to be found among all those dead 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.370
 living or presumed such 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.590
 my personal vote of is around 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.050
 around him and a half is a given vote 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.270
 really bitter heart since I would be 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.850
 expected a management of skills 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.790
 ability reader the improvable in style 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.590
 far cry 3 with experience points instead 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.750
 we find ourselves with the same moves with the 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.550
 same weapons with the same knife up 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.640
 at the end of the game that turns around 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.890
 at 5 o'clock maximum there is no comparison with 

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.600
 the namesake of the tilt and the games it has 

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.110
 won numerous prizes as a game 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.820
 of the year 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.800
 also because we compare two styles of 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.590
 different game or for a point in click is 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.780
 a fps do it against the saga not 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.220
 I can certainly go more because 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.830
 attracted was really frustrating 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:49.220
 continue the game is just the jokes i 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:52.140
 speeches by the three actors michael rooker 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:54.060
 viruses that dubbed their alter 

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:56.460
 ego all analyzed are one of the 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.710
 many professions more for which this 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.520
 game never played until obviously 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.520
 wait for that 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.730
 salmons we do not boast
