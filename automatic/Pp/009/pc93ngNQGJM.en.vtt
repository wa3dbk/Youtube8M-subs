Greenpeace<00:05:05.570> had<00:05:05.870> a<00:05:05.900> few<00:05:06.140> ideas<00:05:07.000> what<00:05:08.000> can<00:05:08.180> only

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
Greenpeace had a few ideas what can only

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.040 
Greenpeace had a few ideas what can only
deal<00:05:08.600> Willie<00:05:09.260> to<00:05:09.580> avoid<00:05:10.580> having<00:05:11.060> to<00:05:11.180> eat<00:05:11.300> sandy

deal Willie to avoid having to eat sandy
in<00:05:12.260> about<00:05:12.500> 30<00:05:12.740> or<00:05:12.890> 40<00:05:13.130> years<00:05:13.160> time<00:05:13.490> well<00:05:13.880> I

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
in about 30 or 40 years time well I

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.250 
in about 30 or 40 years time well I
think<00:05:14.210> the<00:05:14.270> thing<00:05:14.300> is<00:05:14.570> that<00:05:14.600> we<00:05:14.870> what<00:05:15.020> we<00:05:15.050> need

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
think the thing is that we what we need

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.750 
think the thing is that we what we need
to<00:05:15.380> do<00:05:15.500> is<00:05:15.620> we<00:05:15.740> really<00:05:15.920> need<00:05:16.130> to<00:05:16.280> change<00:05:16.610> the

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
to do is we really need to change the

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.220 
to do is we really need to change the
fishing<00:05:17.030> industry<00:05:17.120> now<00:05:17.510> to<00:05:17.870> make<00:05:18.020> sure<00:05:18.050> that

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.230 
fishing industry now to make sure that

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:19.600 
fishing industry now to make sure that
we<00:05:18.290> have<00:05:18.410> a<00:05:18.440> reasonable<00:05:19.070> fishing<00:05:19.310> under<00:05:19.430> see

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
we have a reasonable fishing under see

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.190 
we have a reasonable fishing under see
in<00:05:19.670> the<00:05:19.730> future<00:05:19.850> and<00:05:20.480> that<00:05:20.630> means<00:05:20.840> we<00:05:20.990> need<00:05:21.050> to

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
in the future and that means we need to

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.050 
in the future and that means we need to
kind<00:05:21.380> of<00:05:21.470> give<00:05:21.620> the<00:05:21.650> fish<00:05:21.860> a<00:05:21.890> break<00:05:22.160> we<00:05:22.820> need<00:05:22.940> to

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
kind of give the fish a break we need to

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.820 
kind of give the fish a break we need to
fish<00:05:23.240> less<00:05:23.510> we<00:05:23.900> need<00:05:24.050> to<00:05:24.170> reduce<00:05:24.320> the<00:05:24.650> amount

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
fish less we need to reduce the amount

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.620 
fish less we need to reduce the amount
of<00:05:25.040> fishing<00:05:25.520> boats<00:05:25.700> and<00:05:26.030> fishermen<00:05:26.420> that<00:05:26.540> are

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
of fishing boats and fishermen that are

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.000

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.890 
out there trying to catch all the fish
and<00:05:28.640> we<00:05:28.730> need<00:05:28.880> to<00:05:28.940> waste<00:05:29.090> less<00:05:29.270> when<00:05:29.570> we<00:05:29.630> do<00:05:29.780> it

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
and we need to waste less when we do it

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.930 
and we need to waste less when we do it
but<00:05:30.440> why<00:05:30.620> does<00:05:30.890> what<00:05:31.100> why<00:05:31.310> our<00:05:31.490> government<00:05:31.670> is

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
but why does what why our government is

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.250 
but why does what why our government is
not<00:05:32.030> doing<00:05:32.090> that<00:05:32.270> is<00:05:32.660> quite<00:05:32.870> there's<00:05:33.110> quite
