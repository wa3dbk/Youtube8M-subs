00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.850
 beautiful I want to go out with a book and 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.830
 this is graphic novel takes here comes 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.870
 the March 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.400
 another trophy we are moving forward in the 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.950
 history we are tied trophy because 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.690
 we really can not there are other types of 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.760
 graphic novels where your interaction is 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.150
 a little bit because it's selecting 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.549
 answers and others is asking you 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.990
 and the story is advancing but this is not 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.150
 it is the case 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.830
 things that I can teach you here 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.520
 This game has me confused he looked at mine 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.590
 if it is the case here we have an answer 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:21.340
 that has missed us then 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.840
 I thought he was not that type and like 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.780
 I was saying we can all here 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.700
 in this good egg for really nothing 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.600
 a novel is from Japanese we 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.700
 we understand 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.920
 and here you will find your things look 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.770
 new characters are appearing bla 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.890
 blah blah blah blah and typical typical 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.680
 I'm going to put that it's subtitled 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.360
 in Spanish only letters are what 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.860
 happens that these games do not subtitles 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.960
 in Spanish in English because it really is not 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.730
 they have sale or exit 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.860
 but come on, it costs a little bit of work 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.060
 a text as it is is only a text 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.750
 write it to 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.670
 Spanish English to other languages 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.240
 so nothing is talked about here this 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.240
 gameplay 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.900
 and nothing I do not think there's much more 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.200
 here that 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.780
 to see what to investigate or what can be done 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.310
 prove they do nothing kids like 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.169
