you<00:04:49.570> getting<00:04:49.960> so<00:04:50.170> basically<00:04:50.680> the<00:04:50.800> card<00:04:51.040> is

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
you getting so basically the card is

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.280 
you getting so basically the card is
actually<00:04:51.850> like<00:04:52.120> it<00:04:52.240> went<00:04:52.720> up<00:04:52.810> over<00:04:53.020> a<00:04:53.200> hundred

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
actually like it went up over a hundred

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.560 
actually like it went up over a hundred
percent<00:04:53.770> in<00:04:54.100> value<00:04:54.520> just<00:04:54.730> because<00:04:54.820> of<00:04:55.240> noting

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
percent in value just because of noting

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:56.850 
percent in value just because of noting
coming<00:04:55.840> out<00:04:55.960> it<00:04:56.200> doesn't<00:04:56.380> even<00:04:56.590> make<00:04:56.800> any

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
coming out it doesn't even make any

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.010 
coming out it doesn't even make any
sense<00:04:57.100> so<00:04:57.880> let<00:04:58.090> me<00:04:58.120> know<00:04:58.210> what<00:04:58.390> you<00:04:58.570> guys<00:04:58.720> think

of<00:04:59.290> these<00:05:00.280> crazy<00:05:00.700> hype<00:05:01.090> trains<00:05:01.450> you<00:05:01.720> know<00:05:01.750> a

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
of these crazy hype trains you know a

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.050 
of these crazy hype trains you know a
lot<00:05:02.170> of<00:05:02.200> times<00:05:02.530> I<00:05:02.830> feel<00:05:03.370> like<00:05:03.550> they're<00:05:03.820> just

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
lot of times I feel like they're just

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.090 
lot of times I feel like they're just
absolutely<00:05:04.240> stupid<00:05:05.020> and<00:05:05.200> I<00:05:05.350> think<00:05:05.830> that<00:05:05.980> if

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
absolutely stupid and I think that if

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.980 
absolutely stupid and I think that if
you<00:05:06.400> the<00:05:06.640> player<00:05:06.850> decide<00:05:07.390> to<00:05:07.540> go<00:05:07.690> ahead<00:05:07.720> and

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
you the player decide to go ahead and

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.870 
you the player decide to go ahead and
try<00:05:08.110> and<00:05:08.200> cash<00:05:08.470> in<00:05:08.680> I<00:05:08.860> don't<00:05:09.130> fault<00:05:09.400> you<00:05:09.580> at<00:05:09.700> all

try and cash in I don't fault you at all
I<00:05:10.090> think<00:05:10.540> that<00:05:10.750> if<00:05:10.930> people<00:05:11.290> are<00:05:11.380> just<00:05:11.590> going<00:05:11.740> to

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
I think that if people are just going to

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.990 
I think that if people are just going to
be<00:05:11.920> stupid<00:05:12.400> they're<00:05:12.520> going<00:05:12.640> to<00:05:12.700> be<00:05:12.790> sheep

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
be stupid they're going to be sheep

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.700 
be stupid they're going to be sheep
they're<00:05:13.180> just<00:05:13.330> gonna<00:05:13.420> follow<00:05:13.720> every<00:05:14.440> quick

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
trend that pops up and if you make a

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.500 
trend that pops up and if you make a
quick<00:05:17.890> buck<00:05:17.920> like<00:05:18.370> I<00:05:18.550> can't<00:05:18.820> fault<00:05:19.090> you<00:05:19.180> the
