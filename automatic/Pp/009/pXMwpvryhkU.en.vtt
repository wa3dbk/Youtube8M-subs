 and no boys I had this absence 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.579

 to dedicate to you and one thing 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.280

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.190
 much to youtube 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.780

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.299
 I did the shit of us of not 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.240

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.229
 take many materials for the summer 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:34.009
 we have it this way I do the keys 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.009
 right does not go 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:45.880
 and instead you don't have the right button 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.299
 I'm pressing the right button but not 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.569
 now work in the controls 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:56.549

00:01:52.569 --> 00:02:07.289
 star wars ways where here is indeed 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:13.030

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.980

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:41.420

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.920

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.500
 I want so maybe you tell me in 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.300
 comments what is it because you gave that 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.700
 almost certainly many now 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.060
 I can when we're going to do guys today 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:56.060

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.730
 cottage star wars uses in the sense I want 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.290

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.970
 proud 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.140
 we will have to remove a bit of the fact 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:10.280
 let's do it here 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:18.110

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:19.490

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.140
 or do something like that 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:25.070
 practically a tower that goes far enough 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.840
 at the top and then a giant circle is made 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.020
 I don't know, I want to do something 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.300
 genre that you go to the other there is a 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.950
 casino if you had things like that 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:39.030
 jumper stuff like that 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:42.750
 there should be or at least people there 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:46.160
 the jetpack is the genoa I would say that 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.160

 makes an idea with a bat box but let's try to 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.349
 to do it 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.959
 the bat box as is done is done with delle 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:03.709
 pile and up and tintin cable must 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:08.250

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.540

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.910
 need so today guys will be 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.859
 soluble update to tell you more than that 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:24.720
 what else do I want to do 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:26.610
 here as I go I want 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.950
 I just wanted to tell you though that they are there 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.360
 more abandoned than many have 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.150
 you have written the article privately 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.760
 abandoned there is no more desire boys and 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.590
 from the school that I think anyway 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.900
 that for everyone it is quite difficult 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.940
 last two weeks is already so much that I am 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.490
 finding this hole to record 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.470
 because it really did not matter of 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.030
 reservations today now I do not know how long 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.240
 we will get render because 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.919
 obviously I will try not to make cuts 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.389
 for the purchase just upload the video 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.250
 tomorrow because sarah wouldn't make it 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:58.770
 physically 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.320
 I only tell you that Friday or too many bots 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.240
 things to do things like verification of 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.080
 in the English question check of 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.000
 ideology on a laboratory and what 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:16.970
 guys checking the computer science 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.970
 so true absolute zero I don't know which ones 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.840
 ok ok 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.850
 I would say that type of height of being 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:29.480
 roughly so it will do it type height 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:33.820
 let's see if I fall as it helps 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:37.790
 I want an idiot 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:41.480
 I'm an idiot I'd say I can finish 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:44.500
 the room because strafighe put some 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:48.880
 back to the side and we laugh a little 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:51.590
 many girls back here I made the house 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:55.760
 oh house I made this platform 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:57.440
 that you can consider home type I have 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.560
 made of the class points and fly at random 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:05.600
 but there is no problem then where 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:10.010
 promised mass promised with the where and the 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:12.320
 the theater picks up I can't find the pick 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:16.420
 in iron it goes well then this guys 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.420
 it will be an episode to which I wonder indeed 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.639
 for those I tell you that I want to change 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.620
 I want to call the package name 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:33.580
 dream kraft but I want to call it a star 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:35.560
 wars pax because I think it attracts more 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:38.169
 in the sense I like it even more is a 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.150
 name that green kraft is beautiful beautiful 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:42.699
 it is not beautiful it is not beautiful yes beautiful beautiful 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:46.479
 but not acts enabling poster moore 

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:48.460
 spaak to me and I must say I draw bad 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:51.550
 the truth I am happy because I have 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:54.310
 found this name that I really like 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.650
 then this will be the basis of us 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.900
 we will enter from below, I want to say 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:02.050
 such a thing here all open up 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:04.720
 facts we already remove all things too 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:07.120
 of three floors and then climb here with the 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.610
 hostile jetpack type 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:12.729
 I don't know if the star wars noster wars don't 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:14.410
 just in style in the sense that you 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:16.389
 poni I have to go over the base of 

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.699
 convince fantastic hopes there is of 

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:20.440
 burn with guys I know it comes 

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:22.030

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:28.210
 many of you are inquiring about a star 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:32.080
 wars monica and I am very happy with that 

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:34.210
 and I think we'll start the industry 

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.729

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:38.800
