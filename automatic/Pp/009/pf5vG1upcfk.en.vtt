00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
635 or 645 for a set of 4 reps and he

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.910 
635 or 645 for a set of 4 reps and he
gets<00:01:56.909> rounded<00:01:57.360> over<00:01:57.479> quite<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.869> bit<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.770> he's

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
gets rounded over quite a bit but he's

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.069

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
as he's going through the lift and he

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.280 
as he's going through the lift and he
still<00:02:03.000> does<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.180> great<00:02:03.360> job<00:02:03.390> locking<00:02:04.079> them<00:02:04.200> all

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290
