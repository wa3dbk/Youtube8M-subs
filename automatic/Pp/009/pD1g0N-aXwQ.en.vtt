 adams the mix mixes various rhythms and 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.600
 requires a lot of students here 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.840
 the calories go away lightly and 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.840
 funny 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.990
 The proposal of this lesson mix is a fun 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.380
 You have fun dancing. 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.180
 If you say otherwise you let go 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:05.780
 That's the truth, I do not know that it burns. 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:08.300

 encompasses all these items many of them 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.390
 nor is the dance really good 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.360
 alternative not to stand still in the 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.510
 moment is the student has the opportunity 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.060
 his 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.280
 let's say so travel by several rhythms 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.959
 not just the dance of the ballroom dance 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.880
 like forró meringue sauce that is also 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.370
 a very lively pace as well as the 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.459
 axé other modalities then the class 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:45.069
 very lively and you really end up 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.069
 getting loose and losing shyness 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.960

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.240

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.820
 adding class worry about 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.850

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.310
 rolling himself to him will go missing 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.520

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.860

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.310
 students are get that friendship one goes 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.500
