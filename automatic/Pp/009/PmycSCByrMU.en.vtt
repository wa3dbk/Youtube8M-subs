00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:11.790
 imagine an immense universe 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.570
 incredibly cold in constant 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.299
 expansion 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:20.039
 how it all began to understand 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.039
 let's go back in time 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.370
 imagine that you are at the beginning 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.370
 of the universe makes almost 14,000 million 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.350
 of years 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.140
 imagine all the energy of the universe 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.100
 compressed into a smaller space than 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.989
 the head of a pin 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.630
 imagine that you are inside this 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.150
 tiny space 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.460
 time is standing 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.090
 nothing we know or imagine 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.090
 exists 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:05.150
 everything is about to change 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:07.550
 forever the production has just 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.830
 big bang the big-bang has been 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.110
 released all the energy the temperature 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.510
 is extremely high and the space is 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.090
 expands at breakneck speed in 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.640
 a tiny fraction of a second has 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.950
 born our universe 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.180
 this is the deepest of all 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.670
 mysteries 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.370
 now part of the energy is condensed 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.380
 becoming mass all are created 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.590
 the fundamental particles of our 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.900
 universe some of them still do not 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.970
 we understand among those that do 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.430
 find the quarks the electrons the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.020
 neutrinos tiny particles that 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.060
 they will constitute everything we know 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.700
 including you and me 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.020
 Look carefully create a pair 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.540
 particle and its corresponding 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.670
 antiparticle 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.740
 but particles and antiparticles also 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.110
 they suffer a deadly attraction that makes 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.120
 they annihilate each other 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.520
 a part of the matter however 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.620
 survive this process fortunately 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.490
 for us it is the matter that forms 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.490
 everything we know 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.890
 as the universe cools the 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.280
 quarks are grouped in groups of three 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.850
 giving rise to neutrons and protons and 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.230
 these form the simplest nuclei 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.150
 all this happens in the first three 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.150
 minutes after the start of time 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.719
 but in the next thousands of years the 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.180
 heat and energy are still so 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:37.349
 intense that electrons can not 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.349
 combine with these nuclei 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.550
 let's advance 380 thousand years from the big band 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.020
 the universe has expanded and is already more 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.120
 cold 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.460
 now the electrons envelop the 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.830
 small nuclei giving rise to the 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.950
 first simple atoms those of 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.380
 hydrogen and helium and once the 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.270
 atoms the light particles that can 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.760
 traverse the space without impediment 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.680
 some what until now was a fog 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.800
 dense particle colliding 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.550
 between them it suddenly becomes visible 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.860
 let there be light 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.020
 this first light can be observed even in 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.580
 form of the so-called cosmic background of 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.880
 microwaves a fingerprint 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.640
 permanent of the universe 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.580
 let's continue our journey moving forward 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.380
 how many hundreds of millions of years 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.120
 now the force of gravity makes 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.590
 the clouds of hydrogen and helium are 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.160
 contract causing reactions 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.160
 nuclear 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.739
 everywhere they start doing the 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.739
 first stars 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.430
 some of them are very massive 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.640
 they deplete their fuel and collapse 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:54.140
 in the silent stadium they rub 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.140
 first super new giants 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:02.520
 but from all this destruction arise the 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.860
 heavy elements including carbon 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.530
 nitrogen oxygen oxygen iron 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.510
 even gold are the elements that 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.040
 will form the planets and will be the 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.040
 seeds that will lead to life 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.440
 generations and generations of stars 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:22.139
 live and die our universe before 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.350
 incredibly dense and hot is now 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:27.360
 cold and is practically empty after 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.030
 of nine billion years in the 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.740
 spiral arm of a distant galaxy is 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.370
 is starting to form a very 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.370
 important 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.650
 here in this infinite space between 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:43.099
 millions of galaxies there is a system 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.099
 solar 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.710
 in this solar system one of the 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.540
 planets has cooled enough 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.540
 so that life can arise 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:59.729
 our house is the planet earth 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.830
 and on this earth there are beings with the 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.169
 extraordinary ability to return the 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:08.180
 look back in time and reflect 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.180
 about the meaning of the universe
