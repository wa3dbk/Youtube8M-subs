 write your future on the fies 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.650
 when I had the information that the 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.460
 college had a guarantee fund of the 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.470
 fies 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.540
 because today, in fact, to be 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.320
 guarantor of another person very thing 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.240
 would be 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.380
 and then when I heard that fgf had a 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.510
 guarantor fund 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:02.260
 I did not waste time I was really picking up 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:05.140
 information and then I had the opportunity 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.960
 to do like today I'm doing the grid 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:12.330
 Full fgf is a very 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:16.090
 is a well-respected concept and 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:19.480
 There is a course that I wanted then. 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.180
 changed completely I'm doing 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.100
 Disciplines in the morning just for you 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.130
 be able to cover the disciplines that 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.230
 Pending one of the previous half 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.000
 entering the institution as a 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.080
 I am 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.880
 the a4 and a half today I'm seen until 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.490
 people around me as a person 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.910
 and has only good things to do. 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:45.130
 offer did not have an end of difficulty 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.230
 there was even the college was 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.780
 really open block doors 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.000
 block the girls way there always gave 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.860
 information about the fies 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.900
 problem and so I do not want to add 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.030
 very much in our life as the 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.640
 in the job market the picture already 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.780
 I was on fgf because I was close 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.140
 from my home 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:09.190
 I really like the campus is huge has a 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:11.740
 wonderful structure and by the fact 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.870
 I also know the value of lack, right? 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.910
 in the face of a research that I 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.549
 faculty that was really in the 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.200
 my fgf possibilities and neither 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.030
 had too much bureaucracy not to have much 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.130
 difficulty of movement with some 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.340
 friends who came from other institutions 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.260
 Right here for the faithful, right? 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.630
 a great tool you really have 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.700
 that to seek what you want and 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.650
 yes no, I did not let it go, I did it 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.900
 behind your dream now so do not lose 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.600
 Time, do not waste time, it's easy. 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:44.970
 income and especially in the institution 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.970
 fgf is sure to make it even easier
