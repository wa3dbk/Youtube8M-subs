00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.160
 The levers can have two adjustments that help both the safety of the pilot and also 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.480
 in identifying problems on the bike. 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.829
 These are the height and stroke adjustments. 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.240
 The height adjustment should refer to the position of the body when braking 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:00.370
 which is where you need more control in the piloting, is when you apply more force and for longer. 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:08.360
 The lever should be adjusted to align with the forearm extension with the body 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.670
 positioned for braking. In this way the strength of the hand is better applied, 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.170
 tires less when used repetitively and also keeps the pulse in a neutral position, that is, 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.800
 prevents tendonitis and other ergometric problems. 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.020
 On sports motorcycles when being "fairing" the levers are out of position. 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.340
 This is not a problem because in the clutch drive 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.030
 the movement is eventual, fast and light, and when it needs the brake it rises the body 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.420
 to the adjusted lever position. In addition to being able to apply force 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.229
 The brake lever also gains braking according to the 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:55.799
 body in the wind. 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.420
 It is worth remembering that on bikes the front wheel is responsible for 70 to 90% braking. 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:13.069
 The levers must be adjusted so that their stroke never ends with less than one finger. 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.520
 This clearance is necessary for you to have an aid 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.760
 to know when you have brake or clutch problems. 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.160
 When the front brake pads wear out or the brake fluid is 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.170
 will have to tighten the lever to brake. 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.160
 With that minimal slack of a finger, 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.599
 when it begins to invade this space or touch the handlebars, you will know that the brake needs 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:42.390
 maintenance. 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.700
 The same for the clutch as if it is necessary to push the throttle lever more or 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:57.450
 change gear, it will show you that you have a problem with the clutch cable or the system.
