if<00:02:32.260> a<00:02:32.380> surgeon<00:02:32.800> says<00:02:33.100> no<00:02:33.370> we<00:02:33.580> shouldn't<00:02:33.820> do

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
if a surgeon says no we shouldn't do

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.060 
if a surgeon says no we shouldn't do
this<00:02:34.110> should<00:02:35.110> you<00:02:35.230> go<00:02:35.260> for<00:02:35.380> a<00:02:35.590> second<00:02:35.980> opinion

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
this should you go for a second opinion

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.430 
this should you go for a second opinion
or<00:02:36.790> should<00:02:37.450> you<00:02:37.480> say<00:02:37.720> well<00:02:37.930> maybe<00:02:38.080> this<00:02:38.290> just

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
or should you say well maybe this just

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.860 
or should you say well maybe this just
doesn't<00:02:38.800> say<00:02:38.920> for<00:02:39.190> me<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:39.520> think<00:02:39.970> it's<00:02:40.510> always

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
doesn't say for me I think it's always

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.960 
doesn't say for me I think it's always
important<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:41.530> get<00:02:41.739> at<00:02:41.860> least<00:02:41.890> a<00:02:42.250> second

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
important to get at least a second

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.330 
important to get at least a second
opinion<00:02:43.060> okay<00:02:43.720> but<00:02:44.650> I<00:02:44.709> always<00:02:44.980> say<00:02:45.160> when

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
opinion okay but I always say when

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.800 
opinion okay but I always say when
there's<00:02:45.520> two<00:02:45.700> doctors<00:02:46.150> you<00:02:46.390> get<00:02:46.510> three

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
there's two doctors you get three

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.320 
there's two doctors you get three
opinions<00:02:47.080> so<00:02:47.560> then<00:02:47.709> it<00:02:47.830> gets<00:02:47.920> confusing<00:02:48.330> it's

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
opinions so then it gets confusing it's

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.420 
opinions so then it gets confusing it's
important<00:02:49.840> that<00:02:50.200> it<00:02:50.320> should<00:02:50.620> make<00:02:50.860> sense<00:02:50.920> to

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
important that it should make sense to

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.860 
important that it should make sense to
the<00:02:51.520> patient<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.360> there<00:02:52.600> are<00:02:52.690> a<00:02:52.750> lot<00:02:52.840> of

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
the patient and there are a lot of

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.150 
the patient and there are a lot of
things<00:02:53.080> that<00:02:53.350> could<00:02:53.500> potentially<00:02:53.680> have

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
things that could potentially have

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.830 
things that could potentially have
caused<00:02:54.370> their<00:02:54.580> death<00:02:54.760> there's<00:02:55.120> no<00:02:55.390> official

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
caused their death there's no official

caused their death there's no official
cause<00:02:56.620> yet<00:02:57.130> but<00:02:57.580> one<00:02:57.880> thing<00:02:58.180> that<00:02:58.209> people<00:02:58.810> can

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
cause yet but one thing that people can

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.470 
cause yet but one thing that people can
die<00:02:59.110> of<00:02:59.320> is<00:02:59.530> a<00:02:59.890> blood-clotting<00:03:00.340> write<00:03:01.270> the

die of is a blood-clotting write the

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.370 
die of is a blood-clotting write the
number<00:03:01.989> one<00:03:02.410> cause<00:03:03.310> of<00:03:03.370> death<00:03:03.910> after<00:03:04.510> major

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
number one cause of death after major

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.680 
number one cause of death after major
surgeries<00:03:06.130> our<00:03:06.670> blood<00:03:06.910> clots<00:03:07.180> and<00:03:07.510> that's

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
surgeries our blood clots and that's

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.210 
surgeries our blood clots and that's
with<00:03:07.870> any<00:03:08.080> surgery<00:03:08.410> it<00:03:08.680> doesn't<00:03:08.950> matter<00:03:09.100> if

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
with any surgery it doesn't matter if

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.130 
with any surgery it doesn't matter if
it's<00:03:09.280> plastic<00:03:09.730> surgery<00:03:10.120> or<00:03:10.540> if<00:03:10.870> you're<00:03:10.989> going

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
it's plastic surgery or if you're going

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.170 
it's plastic surgery or if you're going
in<00:03:11.320> for<00:03:11.440> something<00:03:11.650> else<00:03:11.950> correct<00:03:12.549> and<00:03:12.820> so

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
in for something else correct and so

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.570 
in for something else correct and so
there's<00:03:13.360> some<00:03:13.540> simple<00:03:14.049> avoidance<00:03:14.709> techniques

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
there's some simple avoidance techniques

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.940 
there's some simple avoidance techniques
we<00:03:15.790> can<00:03:15.820> use<00:03:16.000> okay<00:03:16.780> show<00:03:16.989> something<00:03:17.470> here<00:03:17.680> well

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
we can use okay show something here well

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.680 
we can use okay show something here well
we<00:03:18.130> brought<00:03:18.280> this<00:03:18.549> from<00:03:18.790> we<00:03:19.030> use<00:03:19.209> us<00:03:19.420> in<00:03:19.570> our

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
we brought this from we use us in our

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.810 
we brought this from we use us in our
office<00:03:20.170> is<00:03:20.350> he<00:03:20.500> it's<00:03:20.739> called<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.160> float<00:03:21.459> Ron

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
office is he it's called the float Ron

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.170 
office is he it's called the float Ron
ok<00:03:22.330> now<00:03:22.810> I'm<00:03:22.989> going<00:03:23.019> to<00:03:23.350> put<00:03:23.560> it<00:03:23.650> on<00:03:23.709> your<00:03:23.950> arm

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
ok now I'm going to put it on your arm

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.940 
ok now I'm going to put it on your arm
but<00:03:25.180> we<00:03:25.330> typically<00:03:25.840> will<00:03:26.110> put<00:03:26.380> it<00:03:26.500> around<00:03:26.590> the

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
but we typically will put it around the

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.550 
but we typically will put it around the
patient's<00:03:27.519> legs<00:03:27.989> because<00:03:28.989> if<00:03:29.140> they're<00:03:29.320> having

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
patient's legs because if they're having

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.729 
patient's legs because if they're having
a<00:03:29.830> four<00:03:30.160> or<00:03:30.340> five<00:03:30.640> hour<00:03:30.880> surgery<00:03:31.410> their<00:03:32.410> legs

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
a four or five hour surgery their legs

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.070 
a four or five hour surgery their legs
are<00:03:33.130> stationary<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.209> blood<00:03:34.480> isn't<00:03:34.660> flowing

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
are stationary the blood isn't flowing

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.560 
are stationary the blood isn't flowing
and<00:03:35.410> when<00:03:35.920> blood<00:03:36.220> doesn't<00:03:36.519> flow<00:03:36.700> you<00:03:37.360> get

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
and when blood doesn't flow you get

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.080 
and when blood doesn't flow you get
clots<00:03:37.930> I<00:03:38.230> see<00:03:38.560> okay<00:03:38.709> by<00:03:39.100> using<00:03:39.370> this<00:03:39.670> apparatus

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
clots I see okay by using this apparatus

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.199 
clots I see okay by using this apparatus
