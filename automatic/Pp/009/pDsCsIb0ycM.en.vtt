00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.899 

I've<00:00:01.620> been<00:00:01.860> doing<00:00:02.129> a<00:00:02.190> fair<00:00:02.460> amount<00:00:02.580> of

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
I've been doing a fair amount of

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.849 
I've been doing a fair amount of
speaking<00:00:03.540> and<00:00:03.689> writing<00:00:03.870> about<00:00:04.290> reading<00:00:04.770> the

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
speaking and writing about reading the

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.530 
speaking and writing about reading the
water<00:00:05.130> lately<00:00:05.640> and<00:00:05.910> I<00:00:06.000> thought<00:00:06.210> I'd<00:00:06.359> take<00:00:06.509> a

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
water lately and I thought I'd take a

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.960 
water lately and I thought I'd take a
couple<00:00:06.810> minutes<00:00:07.319> this<00:00:07.500> morning<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:08.220> talk

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
couple minutes this morning and talk

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.180 
couple minutes this morning and talk
about<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:10.290> main<00:00:10.530> idea<00:00:11.340> of<00:00:11.670> reading<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.630> water

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
about the main idea of reading the water

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.580 
about the main idea of reading the water
now<00:00:14.190> most<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.179> you<00:00:15.299> that<00:00:15.420> know<00:00:15.540> me<00:00:15.599> know<00:00:15.750> that<00:00:16.170> I

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
now most of you that know me know that I

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.140 
now most of you that know me know that I
call<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.220> typical<00:00:17.789> run<00:00:18.060> in<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.840> river<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:20.150> riffle

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
call a typical run in the river a riffle

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.740 
call a typical run in the river a riffle
to<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> shelf<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.949> pool<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.850> tale<00:00:24.150> out<00:00:24.390> to

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
to a shelf to a pool to a tale out to

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.570 
to a shelf to a pool to a tale out to
another<00:00:24.990> riffle<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:26.010> just<00:00:26.220> makes<00:00:26.400> it

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
another riffle and that just makes it

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.009 
another riffle and that just makes it
real<00:00:26.760> simple<00:00:26.789> for<00:00:27.449> me<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.720> there<00:00:27.840> can<00:00:27.990> be

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
real simple for me and there can be

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.840 
real simple for me and there can be
several<00:00:28.670> typical<00:00:29.670> runs<00:00:29.880> in<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.840> river

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
several typical runs in a river

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.740 
several typical runs in a river
horizontally<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:33.000> other<00:00:33.120> words<00:00:33.360> there<00:00:33.570> could

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
horizontally in other words there could

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.720 
horizontally in other words there could
be<00:00:33.780> one<00:00:34.050> over<00:00:34.230> here<00:00:34.530> on<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.800> left<00:00:35.070> there<00:00:35.579> could

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
be one over here on the left there could

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.040 
be one over here on the left there could
be<00:00:35.880> one<00:00:36.059> in<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.270> middle<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.750> there<00:00:36.870> could<00:00:37.020> be

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
be one in the middle and there could be

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
one in the right when I when I get to

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.830 
one in the right when I when I get to
bigger<00:00:40.920> water<00:00:41.190> like<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:41.520> I'll<00:00:42.450> break<00:00:42.690> it

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
bigger water like that I'll break it

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.420 
bigger water like that I'll break it
down<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.170> break<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.440> river<00:00:43.620> down<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.070> into

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
down and break the river down and into

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.900 
down and break the river down and into
into<00:00:45.000> longitudinal<00:00:45.809> sections<00:00:46.430> left<00:00:47.430> center

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
into longitudinal sections left center

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.940 
into longitudinal sections left center
right<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.390> then<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:48.899> can<00:00:49.200> go<00:00:49.320> ahead<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.739> pick

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
right and then I can go ahead and pick

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.689 
right and then I can go ahead and pick
apart<00:00:50.370> those<00:00:51.000> typical<00:00:51.510> runs<00:00:51.719> but<00:00:52.440> right<00:00:52.620> here

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
apart those typical runs but right here

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.389 
apart those typical runs but right here
you<00:00:53.699> can<00:00:53.879> see<00:00:53.910> we<00:00:54.120> have<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> riffle<00:00:54.600> up<00:00:54.809> above<00:00:55.110> us

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
you can see we have a riffle up above us

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.650 
you can see we have a riffle up above us
and<00:00:56.399> we<00:00:56.520> got<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.670> nice<00:00:56.850> little<00:00:57.090> island<00:00:57.210> here<00:00:57.449> two

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
and we got a nice little island here two

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.479 
and we got a nice little island here two
gives<00:00:57.840> us<00:00:57.960> two<00:00:58.170> seams<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:59.100> we've<00:00:59.280> got<00:00:59.399> an

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
gives us two seams and we've got an

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.220 
gives us two seams and we've got an
outside<00:00:59.789> island<00:01:00.210> theme<00:01:00.390> we've<00:01:00.629> got<00:01:00.750> an<00:01:00.870> inside

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
outside island theme we've got an inside

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.270 
outside island theme we've got an inside
island<00:01:01.649> scene<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:02.460> can<00:01:02.609> see<00:01:02.760> those<00:01:04.280> obviously

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
island scene you can see those obviously

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.950 
island scene you can see those obviously
right<00:01:05.430> below<00:01:05.670> islands<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.240> you've<00:01:06.570> got<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> lot

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
right below islands you you've got a lot

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.990 
right below islands you you've got a lot
of<00:01:07.110> bugs<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.619> are<00:01:07.710> compressed<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.610> it

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
of bugs that are compressed and it

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.120 
of bugs that are compressed and it
becomes<00:01:09.330> like<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.659> superhighway<00:01:10.260> for<00:01:10.650> bugs

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
becomes like a superhighway for bugs

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.200 
becomes like a superhighway for bugs
you're<00:01:11.280> going<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.460> have<00:01:11.549> fish<00:01:11.729> set<00:01:11.939> up<00:01:12.060> in

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
you're going to have fish set up in

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.660 
you're going to have fish set up in
those<00:01:12.390> but<00:01:12.720> for<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.710> purposes<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.460> what<00:01:14.580> I'm

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
those but for the purposes of what I'm

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.399 
those but for the purposes of what I'm
talking<00:01:15.000> about<00:01:15.060> here<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:16.020> see<00:01:16.170> we<00:01:16.290> have<00:01:16.380> a

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
talking about here you can see we have a

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.039 
talking about here you can see we have a
riffle<00:01:16.710> upstream<00:01:17.280> up<00:01:17.460> here<00:01:17.810> okay<00:01:18.810> that's

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
riffle upstream up here okay that's

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.380 
riffle upstream up here okay that's
that's<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.470> very<00:01:19.500> nice<00:01:20.159> long<00:01:20.490> riffle<00:01:21.000> section

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
that's a very nice long riffle section

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.359 
that's a very nice long riffle section
and<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:22.020> know<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.140> think<00:01:22.560> anything<00:01:23.130> under

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
and you know I think anything under

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.469 
and you know I think anything under
three<00:01:23.610> feet<00:01:23.750> in<00:01:24.750> depth<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:26.479> riffle

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
three feet in depth this is a riffle

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.090 
three feet in depth this is a riffle
section<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.140> can<00:01:28.259> see<00:01:28.409> it's<00:01:28.530> got<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.710> good<00:01:28.829> chop

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
section you can see it's got a good chop

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.730 
section you can see it's got a good chop
on<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.490> water<00:01:29.659> you<00:01:30.659> can<00:01:30.810> see<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.470> fish

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
on the water you can see that the fish

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.499 
on the water you can see that the fish
are<00:01:32.070> going<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.430> have<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.700> make<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> fairly<00:01:33.299> fast

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
are going to have to make a fairly fast

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.060 
are going to have to make a fairly fast
decision<00:01:34.049> on<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.259> whether<00:01:34.409> or<00:01:34.500> not<00:01:34.590> they<00:01:34.829> want

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
decision on the whether or not they want

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.490 
decision on the whether or not they want
to<00:01:35.220> eat<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.579> fish<00:01:36.450> typically<00:01:37.110> hold<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
to eat and fish typically hold in the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.740 
to eat and fish typically hold in the
riffle<00:01:37.799> sections<00:01:38.220> because<00:01:38.430> they're<00:01:39.420> there<00:01:39.630> to

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
riffle sections because they're there to

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.620 
riffle sections because they're there to
eat<00:01:39.900> or<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.320> spawn<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:41.939> find<00:01:42.270> fish<00:01:42.509> in

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
eat or to spawn so you find fish in

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.840 
eat or to spawn so you find fish in
those<00:01:42.750> riffle<00:01:43.079> sections<00:01:43.490> it's<00:01:44.490> pretty<00:01:44.700> much

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
those riffle sections it's pretty much

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.969 
those riffle sections it's pretty much
game<00:01:45.119> on<00:01:45.299> it's<00:01:46.049> pretty<00:01:46.259> much<00:01:46.380> game<00:01:46.619> on

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
game on it's pretty much game on

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.710 
game on it's pretty much game on
now<00:01:47.310> here<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.659> riffle<00:01:48.960> section<00:01:49.350> goes<00:01:49.560> into

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
now here the riffle section goes into

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.120 
now here the riffle section goes into
the<00:01:51.720> pool<00:01:51.899> section<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:52.890> kind<00:01:53.100> of

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
the pool section and you can kind of

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.469 
the pool section and you can kind of
tell<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.399> pool<00:01:53.579> section<00:01:53.939> because<00:01:54.090> it'll<00:01:54.299> slow

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
tell the pool section because it'll slow

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.760 
tell the pool section because it'll slow
down<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.689> little<00:01:54.899> bit<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.320> got<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.470> little<00:01:55.680> more

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
down a little bit it's got a little more

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.450 
down a little bit it's got a little more
depth<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.450> in<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.719> particular<00:01:58.079> case<00:01:58.710> this

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.459 
depth to it in this particular case this
pool<00:01:59.790> is<00:02:00.119> probably<00:02:00.689> three<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.079> half<00:02:01.259> feet

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.490 
pool is probably three and a half feet
deep<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.299> you<00:02:03.299> will<00:02:03.450> find<00:02:03.719> feeding<00:02:04.110> fish<00:02:04.290> in

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
deep and you will find feeding fish in

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.740 
deep and you will find feeding fish in
here<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:05.280> lot<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.729> times<00:02:05.939> when<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.210> get<00:02:06.329> deeper

here a lot of times when you get deeper

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.499 
here a lot of times when you get deeper

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
that's you're holding water the fish

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.780 
that's you're holding water the fish
you're<00:02:11.009> going<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.220> get<00:02:11.340> in<00:02:11.430> there<00:02:11.640> they're

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
in here and the riffle section is

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.199 
in here and the riffle section is
typically<00:02:43.040> a<00:02:43.070> shelf<00:02:43.400> now<00:02:43.580> this<00:02:43.760> is<00:02:43.910> kind<00:02:44.090> of<00:02:44.120> a

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
typically a shelf now this is kind of a

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.060 
typically a shelf now this is kind of a
long<00:02:44.420> sloping<00:02:45.020> shelf<00:02:45.290> which<00:02:45.470> makes<00:02:45.709> it<00:02:45.860> even

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
long sloping shelf which makes it even

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.160 
long sloping shelf which makes it even
much<00:02:46.220> more<00:02:46.459> fun<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:46.820> fish<00:02:47.030> but<00:02:47.540> a<00:02:47.600> lot<00:02:47.780> of<00:02:47.810> cases

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
much more fun to fish but a lot of cases

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.860 
much more fun to fish but a lot of cases
you'll<00:02:48.290> have<00:02:48.350> a<00:02:48.500> pretty<00:02:49.490> abrupt<00:02:49.820> shelf<00:02:50.600> and

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
you'll have a pretty abrupt shelf and

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.990 
you'll have a pretty abrupt shelf and
you'll<00:02:51.860> find<00:02:52.070> your<00:02:52.190> fish<00:02:52.430> will<00:02:52.610> just<00:02:52.820> stage

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
you'll find your fish will just stage

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.460 
you'll find your fish will just stage
right<00:02:53.239> up<00:02:53.330> on<00:02:53.480> that<00:02:53.630> shelf<00:02:53.810> because<00:02:54.080> that

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
right up on that shelf because that

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.160 
right up on that shelf because that
riffle<00:02:54.860> is<00:02:55.070> turning<00:02:55.760> up<00:02:55.910> all<00:02:56.209> those<00:02:56.420> bugs<00:02:56.750> and

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
riffle is turning up all those bugs and

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.460 
riffle is turning up all those bugs and
the<00:02:57.709> bugs<00:02:57.920> are<00:02:58.040> just<00:02:58.070> popping<00:02:58.910> floating<00:02:59.780> right

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
the bugs are just popping floating right

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.050 
the bugs are just popping floating right
over<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:00.830> shelf<00:03:01.100> section<00:03:01.489> so<00:03:01.640> you'll<00:03:01.790> find<00:03:01.940> a

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
over the shelf section so you'll find a

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.729 
over the shelf section so you'll find a
lot<00:03:02.209> of<00:03:02.330> fish<00:03:02.480> that<00:03:02.630> set<00:03:02.810> up<00:03:02.900> on<00:03:03.050> shelves<00:03:03.380> as

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
lot of fish that set up on shelves as

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.190 
lot of fish that set up on shelves as
well<00:03:04.150> so<00:03:05.150> we've<00:03:05.300> talked<00:03:05.540> about<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:06.050> ripple

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
well so we've talked about the ripple

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.500 
well so we've talked about the ripple
section<00:03:06.739> we've<00:03:07.610> talked<00:03:07.880> about<00:03:08.060> a<00:03:08.180> shelf

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
section we've talked about a shelf

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.660 
section we've talked about a shelf
section<00:03:08.930> and<00:03:09.110> we've<00:03:09.890> talked<00:03:10.130> about<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.489> pool

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
section and we've talked about the pool

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.150 
section and we've talked about the pool
section<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:11.330> now<00:03:11.780> this<00:03:11.959> particular<00:03:12.380> run<00:03:12.739> here

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
section and now this particular run here

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.180 
section and now this particular run here
if<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.850> look<00:03:13.970> down<00:03:14.180> river<00:03:14.510> there<00:03:14.950> it<00:03:15.950> goes

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
if you look down river there it goes

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.940 
if you look down river there it goes
into<00:03:16.549> another<00:03:16.790> riffle<00:03:17.360> section<00:03:17.750> I<00:03:17.930> don't<00:03:18.890> know

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
into another riffle section I don't know

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:19.930 
into another riffle section I don't know
if<00:03:19.040> you<00:03:19.100> can<00:03:19.220> see<00:03:19.310> that<00:03:19.459> but<00:03:19.580> it's<00:03:19.760> slightly

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
if you can see that but it's slightly

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.759 
if you can see that but it's slightly
around<00:03:20.299> the<00:03:20.420> bend<00:03:20.630> so<00:03:21.170> then<00:03:21.350> it<00:03:21.470> goes<00:03:21.590> to

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
around the bend so then it goes to

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.380 
around the bend so then it goes to
another<00:03:21.860> riffle<00:03:22.400> section<00:03:22.790> and<00:03:23.000> then<00:03:23.150> it<00:03:23.269> has

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
another riffle section and then it has

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.210 
another riffle section and then it has
another<00:03:23.510> pool<00:03:23.900> and<00:03:24.200> then<00:03:24.590> it<00:03:24.709> has<00:03:24.890> another

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
another pool and then it has another

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.949 
another pool and then it has another
riffle<00:03:25.730> so<00:03:25.850> that's<00:03:26.060> how<00:03:26.209> I<00:03:26.239> break<00:03:26.570> a<00:03:26.630> river

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
riffle so that's how I break a river

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.940 
riffle so that's how I break a river
down<00:03:27.820> now<00:03:28.820> don't<00:03:29.120> discount<00:03:29.600> the<00:03:29.870> tail<00:03:30.140> out<00:03:30.170> the

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
down now don't discount the tail out the

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.949 
down now don't discount the tail out the
tail<00:03:31.190> out<00:03:31.220> is<00:03:31.670> the<00:03:31.850> area<00:03:32.150> just<00:03:32.480> before<00:03:32.720> the

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
tail out is the area just before the

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.789 
tail out is the area just before the
next<00:03:33.610> riffle<00:03:34.610> section<00:03:35.030> and<00:03:35.239> that's<00:03:35.989> again<00:03:36.530> the

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
next riffle section and that's again the

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.380 
next riffle section and that's again the
bottom<00:03:37.160> is<00:03:37.280> kind<00:03:37.549> of<00:03:37.640> coming<00:03:37.850> up<00:03:38.000> is<00:03:38.150> starting

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
bottom is kind of coming up is starting

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.990 
bottom is kind of coming up is starting
to<00:03:38.450> get<00:03:38.510> shallower<00:03:39.190> obviously<00:03:40.190> to<00:03:40.580> go<00:03:40.730> to<00:03:40.790> that

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
to get shallower obviously to go to that

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.720 
to get shallower obviously to go to that
riffle<00:03:41.360> section<00:03:41.750> and<00:03:41.900> so<00:03:42.470> you'll<00:03:43.070> find<00:03:43.130> fish

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
riffle section and so you'll find fish

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.820 
riffle section and so you'll find fish
staging<00:03:44.570> up<00:03:44.720> in<00:03:44.870> there<00:03:45.019> because<00:03:45.380> again<00:03:45.500> the

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
staging up in there because again the

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.020 
staging up in there because again the
bugs<00:03:46.040> are<00:03:46.190> being<00:03:46.310> compressed<00:03:46.910> into<00:03:49.030> shallower

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
bugs are being compressed into shallower

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.789 
bugs are being compressed into shallower
water<00:03:50.390> and<00:03:50.630> you'll<00:03:51.019> find<00:03:51.230> your<00:03:51.350> fish<00:03:51.530> feed

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
water and you'll find your fish feed

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.320 
water and you'll find your fish feed
down<00:03:51.980> there<00:03:52.190> and<00:03:52.310> that's<00:03:52.400> sub<00:03:52.700> a<00:03:52.940> lot<00:03:53.209> of

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
down there and that's sub a lot of

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.880 
down there and that's sub a lot of
people<00:03:53.540> discount<00:03:53.720> those<00:03:54.110> tail<00:03:54.320> outs<00:03:54.530> but<00:03:54.709> keep

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
people discount those tail outs but keep

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:55.990 
people discount those tail outs but keep
an<00:03:55.010> eye<00:03:55.130> on<00:03:55.160> those<00:03:55.370> you<00:03:55.489> can<00:03:55.610> catch<00:03:55.760> a<00:03:55.850> pretty

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
an eye on those you can catch a pretty

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.699 
an eye on those you can catch a pretty
big<00:03:56.239> fish<00:03:56.510> down<00:03:56.690> in<00:03:56.840> those<00:03:56.900> tail<00:03:57.140> out<00:03:57.290> sections

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
big fish down in those tail out sections

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:03.870 
big fish down in those tail out sections
all<00:03:58.519> right<00:03:58.640> so<00:03:59.330> we've<00:03:59.870> got<00:04:01.180> riffle<00:04:02.290> to<00:04:03.290> a<00:04:03.320> shelf

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
all right so we've got riffle to a shelf

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.670 
all right so we've got riffle to a shelf
to<00:04:04.880> a<00:04:04.910> pool<00:04:07.000> to<00:04:08.000> another<00:04:08.030> riffle<00:04:08.720> to<00:04:09.320> the<00:04:09.440> tail

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
to a pool to another riffle to the tail

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.740 
to a pool to another riffle to the tail
out<00:04:09.709> then<00:04:10.100> to<00:04:10.250> another<00:04:10.489> ripple<00:04:10.700> and<00:04:10.970> you<00:04:11.510> fish

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
out then to another ripple and you fish

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.620 
out then to another ripple and you fish
them<00:04:12.160> all<00:04:13.160> accordingly<00:04:13.820> I<00:04:13.940> like<00:04:14.269> to<00:04:14.390> fish<00:04:14.600> a

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
them all accordingly I like to fish a

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.469 
them all accordingly I like to fish a
run<00:04:15.019> typically<00:04:15.890> from<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:16.130> bottom<00:04:16.940> to<00:04:17.329> the<00:04:17.359> top

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
run typically from the bottom to the top

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.890 
run typically from the bottom to the top
and<00:04:18.160> from<00:04:19.160> the<00:04:19.340> inside<00:04:19.549> to<00:04:20.150> the<00:04:20.180> out<00:04:20.390> so<00:04:20.780> I'll

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
and from the inside to the out so I'll

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.700 
and from the inside to the out so I'll
fish<00:04:21.080> my<00:04:21.289> way<00:04:21.470> up<00:04:21.799> and<00:04:22.570> in<00:04:23.570> on<00:04:23.750> a<00:04:24.470> riffle

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
fish my way up and in on a riffle

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:25.990 
fish my way up and in on a riffle
section<00:04:25.099> now<00:04:25.190> look<00:04:25.400> on<00:04:25.550> that

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
section now look on that

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.790 
section now look on that
our<00:04:26.060> bank<00:04:26.270> over<00:04:26.570> there<00:04:26.690> you<00:04:27.350> can<00:04:27.500> see<00:04:27.650> some

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
our bank over there you can see some

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.640 
our bank over there you can see some
softer<00:04:28.250> water<00:04:28.780> you<00:04:29.780> see<00:04:29.990> up<00:04:30.140> there's<00:04:30.440> kind<00:04:30.620> of

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
softer water you see up there's kind of

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.840 
softer water you see up there's kind of
a<00:04:30.770> foam<00:04:30.950> line<00:04:31.160> there<00:04:31.340> I<00:04:31.370> don't<00:04:31.460> think<00:04:31.550> you<00:04:31.730> can

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
a foam line there I don't think you can

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.640 
a foam line there I don't think you can
pick<00:04:31.970> it<00:04:32.090> up<00:04:32.150> on<00:04:32.300> the<00:04:32.420> camera<00:04:32.780> but<00:04:33.410> there's<00:04:33.590> a

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
pick it up on the camera but there's a

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.200 
pick it up on the camera but there's a
little<00:04:33.770> softer<00:04:34.190> section<00:04:34.550> along<00:04:34.760> that<00:04:34.940> that

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
little softer section along that that

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.970 
little softer section along that that
side<00:04:35.480> over<00:04:35.720> there<00:04:35.870> certainly<00:04:36.680> going<00:04:36.830> to<00:04:36.920> be

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
side over there certainly going to be

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.950 
side over there certainly going to be
some<00:04:37.220> fish<00:04:37.430> in<00:04:37.610> there<00:04:37.640> I<00:04:38.000> like<00:04:38.420> to<00:04:38.570> fish<00:04:38.750> those

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
some fish in there I like to fish those

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.170 
some fish in there I like to fish those
themes<00:04:39.320> I<00:04:39.650> like<00:04:40.190> to<00:04:40.310> find<00:04:40.520> any<00:04:40.730> place<00:04:40.790> where<00:04:41.120> I

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
themes I like to find any place where I

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.360 
themes I like to find any place where I
can<00:04:41.360> find<00:04:41.540> two<00:04:41.780> seams<00:04:42.110> or<00:04:42.590> three<00:04:42.860> seams<00:04:43.100> time

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
can find two seams or three seams time

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.910 
can find two seams or three seams time
coming<00:04:43.730> together<00:04:43.820> I<00:04:44.240> like<00:04:44.600> to<00:04:44.750> find<00:04:44.990> Bend<00:04:45.350> like

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
coming together I like to find Bend like

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.040 
coming together I like to find Bend like
that<00:04:45.980> Bend<00:04:46.370> up<00:04:46.550> there<00:04:46.820> all<00:04:47.210> that<00:04:47.630> food<00:04:47.840> a<00:04:47.870> lot

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
that Bend up there all that food a lot

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.450 
that Bend up there all that food a lot
of<00:04:48.140> that<00:04:48.230> foods<00:04:48.470> being<00:04:48.650> pushed<00:04:48.980> over<00:04:49.190> to<00:04:49.310> that

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
of that foods being pushed over to that

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.100 
of that foods being pushed over to that
Bend<00:04:49.730> and<00:04:50.000> there's<00:04:50.390> a<00:04:50.450> little<00:04:50.570> obstruction

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
Bend and there's a little obstruction

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.930 
Bend and there's a little obstruction
over<00:04:51.290> there<00:04:51.470> so<00:04:51.980> those<00:04:52.340> are<00:04:52.460> just<00:04:52.520> kind<00:04:52.700> of

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
over there so those are just kind of

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.670 
over there so those are just kind of
things<00:04:53.150> you<00:04:53.360> start<00:04:53.600> to<00:04:53.810> look<00:04:53.990> for<00:04:54.290> when<00:04:54.530> you

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
things you start to look for when you

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.070 
things you start to look for when you
read<00:04:54.860> the<00:04:55.010> water<00:04:55.220> and<00:04:55.550> if<00:04:56.360> people<00:04:56.510> ask<00:04:56.780> me<00:04:56.960> all

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
read the water and if people ask me all

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.470 
read the water and if people ask me all
the<00:04:57.110> time<00:04:57.200> how<00:04:57.860> did<00:04:58.040> you<00:04:58.190> see<00:04:58.400> that<00:04:58.550> fish<00:04:58.850> well

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
the time how did you see that fish well

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.659 
the time how did you see that fish well
I<00:04:59.750> got<00:05:00.110> to<00:05:00.200> tell<00:05:00.350> you<00:05:00.440> 50%<00:05:01.100> of<00:05:01.190> it<00:05:01.310> is<00:05:01.460> knowing

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
I got to tell you 50% of it is knowing

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.460 
I got to tell you 50% of it is knowing
where<00:05:01.970> to<00:05:02.000> look<00:05:02.270> there's<00:05:02.960> no<00:05:03.140> one<00:05:03.260> where<00:05:03.380> to

where to look there's no one where to
