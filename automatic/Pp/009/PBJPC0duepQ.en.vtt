00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.080
 Y 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.140
 Y 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.600
 all right 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.150
 hello everyone I'm shit we're in a 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.980
 new delivery of blues leaks in this 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.200
 occasion what we are going to do is the 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.779
 first link of a series of three lips 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.450
 that are going to make between the three 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.369
 twelve-measure full plus wheel 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.320
 we're going to build on the in the style of 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.720
 bikini and we will also rely on the 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.360
 wheel that many times almost always 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.030
 uses that has a small variation 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.700
 normally a normal blues wheel or 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.000
 the normal one is difficult we paste the most 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.350
 typical we have a seventh chord 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.860
 a compass 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.410
 a king's compass 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.970
 another compass now compatible 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.720
 that is the rule there will be a second 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:58.540
 King's compass and two of 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.660
 the in the last wonder we call 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.540
 cadence is my all seventh essence of 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.280
 king 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.820
 the ami 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.009
 Y 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.600
 then we are going to rely on a wheel 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.770
 of euros something varied that is the one 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.770
 uses viking that is 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:25.330
 we were the same as the second part 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.330
 it is also equal 2 of network 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.979
 when the cadence arrives instead of going 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:39.850
 syrup to minor 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.850
 seventh has been like this 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:50.350
 my 73 measures of the clear that comes a 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:53.439
 little bit of jazz doing a 251 that 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:59.079
 we call the 1 here the seventh as in the 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:02:02.369
 blues but it's yes - seventh that grade 2 and 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:02.369
 seventh which it is given a 5 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.729
 one two Three 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.340
 3 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.000
 you have to look at how you entered the 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.430
 silences between a sentence and in 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.500
 another then first of all is the 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.599
 entry between a cross means that 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.819
 entered before the time one of compass if 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.040
 I ship a compass header is what 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.870
 typical that makes the battery one two three 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.569
 and then everyone in between 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.209
 while in the 1 everyone not in 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.730
 this case on a cross we entered before 1 2 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:43.290
 3 for me we would enter the setback 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.060
 from 3 123 dad by then that's what 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.310
 first to have very clear marks those three 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.310
 times 1 2 3 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.210
 ok then the link is a very typical link 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.470
 that there is a lot of talk that belongs to 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:03.070
 bikini has also touched solve many 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.510
 bluesman then I make a grid in the 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.780
 fret fifth in second and first 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.050
 strings after two 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.580
 I do not need to do this turn 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.560
 so they do not overlap but normally 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.280
 does not take into account that is left 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.720
 injury in joints then all those two 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.400
 and then with finger three I go to 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.950
 eighth fret usually this note from 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.100
 we play the pentatonic with the little finger 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.870
 but here labrador where or three for 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:32.400
 make a very fast slide 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:35.170
 from the eighth to the tenth fret then 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.549
 when he arrived here I use a typical 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.549
 vibrato technique 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.280
 with enough intensity with the thumb what 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.280
 I can have loose 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.569
 always a little more complicated with the 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.840
 finger 3 than with the 2 1 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.540
 but 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.349
 but you will always see in living and as 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.349
 move your thumb 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.480
 ok and from here to the finger an eighth fret 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.960
 on the first string and I do the typical 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.810
 fourth detonated toco 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.850
 the toner room is a way of 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.660
 finish that I can be stop noticing 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:19.010
 that sounds 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.810
 and then throw it up 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.350
 we will cut it before but always 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.350
 to finish 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.760
 OK 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.750
 after here 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.680
 one two three story three times of 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.240
 silence 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.240
 1 2 3 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:46.699
 and I go to the next link between a 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.130
 setback of 31 23 then with the 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:51.370
 three fingers if possible with that of others 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.150
 on the 10th fret his point does not 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.150
 low 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.060
 the ocu love 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:02.699
 nadal was down one of three students 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.600
 and pretty fast 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.889
 then again from 23 and 21 33 18 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.719
 then 3 above 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:22.149
 after loss of the second and return 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:22.749
 back to the finger 1 in the conveyor 

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:25.349
 the first 

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:25.349
 then I have left 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.130
 in addition to space 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:40.220
 in total it would be like 23 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.290
 123 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.330
 it is not for me 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:57.320
 when I say 234 are those of the compass 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.320
 but after this 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:06.260
 234 here what we do to make it sound 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:09.180
 that's right we put finger 3 while 17 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.710
 It is the note 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.500
 one octave higher this does 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:16.620
 very much viking and then to be able 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:19.560
 touching is a more percussive we put the 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:23.250
 fingers 1 and 2 or 1 good is depended on each 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.900
 one over the six strings of form 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.920
 that we have everything mute maybe not 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.190
 it takes six but 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.550
 It was much more 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:35.010
 shocking and I play more strings surprises 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:38.529
 with the will be mute fairies that if 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:40.209
 I play alone at the first 

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:42.529
 the dough but to be too 

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:44.209
 pending 

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:47.539
 play alone the first time and he played it 

00:06:44.209 --> 00:06:49.280
 soft I do not know are not the same is a better 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:51.080
 what tape 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:56.230
 by then the total of the link I'm going to 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.230
 repeat another slow 1 2 3 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.860
 1 2 3 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:09.300
 2. 3. 4 

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:11.280
 and I always play and I go back to 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.020
 that would be the first four measures 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.700
 of the full wheel of the blues we're going 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.340
 to do in the next delivery 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:19.919
 we will continue with what comes next 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:23.180
 to complete a bar wheel like this 

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:23.180
 that nothing we see in the next
