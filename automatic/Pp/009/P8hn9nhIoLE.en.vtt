red yellow blue and you know even right

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.210 
red yellow blue and you know even right
there<00:03:24.690> that's<00:03:25.049> a<00:03:25.199> color<00:03:25.379> scheme<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.709> triadic

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.530 
color scheme red yellow and blue the
reason<00:03:29.549> it's<00:03:29.699> called<00:03:29.729> ik<00:03:29.970> try<00:03:30.150> out<00:03:30.299> a<00:03:30.329> color

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
reason it's called ik try out a color

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.030 
reason it's called ik try out a color
scheme<00:03:30.810> is<00:03:30.959> because<00:03:31.260> they're<00:03:31.439> in<00:03:31.530> a<00:03:31.620> triangle

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
scheme is because they're in a triangle

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.780 
scheme is because they're in a triangle
