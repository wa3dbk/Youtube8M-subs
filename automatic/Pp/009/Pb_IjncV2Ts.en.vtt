to a long life is good preventive
maintenance<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:12.389> for<00:00:12.420> example<00:00:13.230> we<00:00:13.650> have<00:00:14.070> this

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
maintenance and for example we have this

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.140 
maintenance and for example we have this
harley-davidson<00:00:16.160> motorcycle<00:00:17.160> that<00:00:17.310> has<00:00:17.490> one

hundred and thirteen thousand miles on
it<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.550> still<00:00:20.820> runs<00:00:21.630> almost<00:00:22.410> like<00:00:22.650> new<00:00:22.949> well

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
it and still runs almost like new well

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.490 
it and still runs almost like new well
it<00:00:24.029> took<00:00:24.240> this<00:00:24.539> amount<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:25.050> preventive

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
it took this amount of preventive

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.920 
it took this amount of preventive
maintenance<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:26.160> make<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.609> happen<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.300> to

thanks<00:00:36.750> Pat<00:00:36.960> alright<00:00:37.620> now<00:00:38.010> on<00:00:38.730> Harley's<00:00:39.620> you

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
thanks Pat alright now on Harley's you

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.970 
thanks Pat alright now on Harley's you
have<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.910> camp<00:00:41.910> or<00:00:42.180> chain<00:00:42.629> tensioner<00:00:43.290> yeah<00:00:43.590> so

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
have a camp or chain tensioner yeah so

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.119 
have a camp or chain tensioner yeah so
like<00:00:44.219> most<00:00:44.489> vehicles<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:46.129> harley-davidson

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
like most vehicles this harley-davidson

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.520 
like most vehicles this harley-davidson
this<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.340> camp<00:00:47.610> support<00:00:48.030> plate<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.570> this

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
this is a camp support plate and this

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.250 
this is a camp support plate and this
these<00:00:49.829> two<00:00:50.039> cams<00:00:50.340> are<00:00:50.579> driven<00:00:50.850> by<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.480> chain<00:00:51.960> and

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
these two cams are driven by a chain and

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.889 
these two cams are driven by a chain and
as<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.129> said<00:00:53.190> most<00:00:53.610> vehicles<00:00:54.030> have<00:00:54.120> something

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
as I said most vehicles have something

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.350 
as I said most vehicles have something
similar<00:00:55.379> right<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.100> they<00:00:56.219> need<00:00:56.430> tension

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
similar right and they need tension

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.689 
similar right and they need tension
provided<00:00:57.899> on<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.260> chain<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:59.190> case<00:00:59.430> it's

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
provided on this chain in this case it's

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.540 
provided on this chain in this case it's
spring-loaded<00:01:00.680> but<00:01:01.680> instead<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
spring-loaded but instead of the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.329 
spring-loaded but instead of the
tensioner<00:01:03.090> looking<00:01:03.480> about<00:01:03.719> like<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.470> where

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
tensioner looking about like this where

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.370 
tensioner looking about like this where
this<00:01:05.670> metal<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.119> running<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.720> metal<00:01:06.990> chain<00:01:07.229> is

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
this metal is running the metal chain is

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.109 
this metal is running the metal chain is
running<00:01:07.619> against<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.040> plastic<00:01:08.610> tensioner

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
running against this plastic tensioner

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.240 
running against this plastic tensioner
you<00:01:09.630> can<00:01:09.810> see<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.439> tensioner<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:10.979> worn

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
you can see that the tensioner is worn

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.700 
you can see that the tensioner is worn
completely<00:01:11.880> through<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.510> now<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:12.990> chain<00:01:13.500> is

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
completely through and now the chain is

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.520 
completely through and now the chain is
running<00:01:14.040> against<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.720> spring<00:01:15.720> itself<00:01:16.200> and

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
running against this spring itself and

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.950 
running against this spring itself and
it's<00:01:16.799> pulling<00:01:17.520> shrapnel<00:01:18.060> off<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.479> spring

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
it's pulling shrapnel off that spring

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.200 
it's pulling shrapnel off that spring
and<00:01:19.200> sending<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.040> through<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.369> motor<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:21.030> can

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
and sending it through the motor you can

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.999 
and sending it through the motor you can
see<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.570> it's<00:01:21.689> already<00:01:22.049> started<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.500> destroy

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
see that it's already started to destroy

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.800 
see that it's already started to destroy
the<00:01:23.220> cams<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.939> can<00:01:24.090> imagine<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.630> oil

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
the cams and you can imagine the oil

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.200 
the cams and you can imagine the oil
pump<00:01:25.080> look<00:01:25.320> similarly<00:01:25.950> poor<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.939> very

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
pump look similarly poor this is a very

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.649 
pump look similarly poor this is a very
bad<00:01:27.450> thing<00:01:27.509> okay<00:01:28.110> now<00:01:28.979> keep<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.180> mind<00:01:30.210> that

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
bad thing okay now keep in mind that

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.840 
bad thing okay now keep in mind that
virtually<00:01:31.200> all<00:01:31.259> engines<00:01:32.009> these<00:01:32.220> days<00:01:32.549> have

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
virtually all engines these days have

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.210 
virtually all engines these days have
some<00:01:33.299> type<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.750> chain<00:01:34.049> tensioner<00:01:34.710> like<00:01:34.920> this

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
some type of chain tensioner like this

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.840 
some type of chain tensioner like this
and<00:01:35.460> they<00:01:36.329> all<00:01:36.570> wear<00:01:37.380> their<00:01:37.860> like<00:01:38.310> brake<00:01:38.579> shoes

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
and they all wear their like brake shoes

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.200 
and they all wear their like brake shoes
or<00:01:39.119> tires<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.740> need<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.070> check<00:01:41.310> them<00:01:41.549> all

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
or tires so you need to check them all

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.840 
or tires so you need to check them all
right<00:01:42.329> upgrade<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.920> this<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.310> an<00:01:44.430> upgrade

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
right upgrade so this is an upgrade

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.330 
right upgrade so this is an upgrade
Harley<00:01:45.360> Davidson<00:01:45.960> switched<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.740> hydraulic

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
Harley Davidson switched to a hydraulic

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.460 
Harley Davidson switched to a hydraulic
tensioner<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.119> better<00:01:48.479> way<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.140> go

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
tensioner and this is a better way to go

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.090 
tensioner and this is a better way to go
because<00:01:49.979> at<00:01:50.310> lower<00:01:50.820> rpms<00:01:51.619> you<00:01:52.619> need<00:01:52.829> less

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
because at lower rpms you need less

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.490 
because at lower rpms you need less
pressure<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.939> chain<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.689> at<00:01:55.259> higher

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
pressure on that chain and at higher

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.920 
pressure on that chain and at higher
rpms<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.430> need<00:01:56.640> more<00:01:56.939> pressure<00:01:57.270> well<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.750> oil

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
rpms you need more pressure well the oil

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.770 
rpms you need more pressure well the oil
pump<00:01:58.290> delivers<00:01:59.280> greater<00:01:59.579> pressure<00:01:59.969> at<00:02:00.270> higher

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
pump delivers greater pressure at higher

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.410 
pump delivers greater pressure at higher
rpms<00:02:01.320> where<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.890> need<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.219> most<00:02:02.399> but<00:02:03.090> at<00:02:03.210> lower

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
rpms where you need it most but at lower

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.810 
rpms where you need it most but at lower
rpms<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.350> don't<00:02:04.740> have<00:02:04.920> as<00:02:05.009> much<00:02:05.189> pressure<00:02:05.579> on

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
rpms you don't have as much pressure on

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.819 
rpms you don't have as much pressure on
the<00:02:05.939> chain<00:02:06.180> which<00:02:06.390> means<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.840> get<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.200> longer

we're
okay<00:02:13.819> and<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:15.290> go<00:02:15.439> along<00:02:15.560> with<00:02:15.769> this<00:02:16.099> I<00:02:16.280> presume

oil pump provides not only the increased
oil<00:02:21.950> pressure<00:02:22.340> that<00:02:22.579> you<00:02:22.760> need<00:02:22.939> to<00:02:23.120> handle

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.329 
oil pressure that you need to handle

oil pressure that you need to handle
those<00:02:23.659> hydraulic<00:02:24.170> tensioners<00:02:24.650> but<00:02:25.099> also<00:02:25.280> an

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
those hydraulic tensioners but also an

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.910 
those hydraulic tensioners but also an
increase<00:02:26.150> beyond<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:27.019> your<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:27.769> will

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
increase beyond that so your you will

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.319 
increase beyond that so your you will
get<00:02:28.069> better<00:02:28.340> flow<00:02:28.700> better<00:02:29.030> pressure

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
get better flow better pressure

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.270 
get better flow better pressure
throughout<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.989> motor<00:02:30.200> as<00:02:30.409> well<00:02:30.620> as<00:02:31.010> better

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
throughout the motor as well as better

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.490 
throughout the motor as well as better
scavenging<00:02:32.180> out<00:02:32.359> of<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.689> case<00:02:32.930> which<00:02:33.260> will

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
scavenging out of the case which will

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.289 
scavenging out of the case which will
increase<00:02:33.799> performance<00:02:34.159> and<00:02:34.760> decrease

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
increase performance and decrease

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.319 
increase performance and decrease
