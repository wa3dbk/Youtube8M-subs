amazing but that is not something that
we<00:05:10.020> have<00:05:10.199> here<00:05:10.379> in<00:05:10.560> the<00:05:10.680> US<00:05:11.039> so<00:05:11.310> it's<00:05:11.490> kind<00:05:11.729> of<00:05:11.789> a

00:05:11.869 --> 00:05:11.879 
we have here in the US so it's kind of a

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:15.050 
we have here in the US so it's kind of a
different<00:05:12.449> way<00:05:12.569> of<00:05:13.550> its<00:05:14.550> kind<00:05:14.729> of<00:05:14.789> sports

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
different way of its kind of sports

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.189 
different way of its kind of sports
being<00:05:15.300> a<00:05:15.360> little<00:05:15.539> bit<00:05:15.689> different<00:05:16.020> you<00:05:16.050> know

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
being a little bit different you know

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:18.589 
being a little bit different you know
they<00:05:16.319> say<00:05:16.349> that<00:05:17.069> I'm<00:05:18.029> going<00:05:18.120> to<00:05:18.210> use<00:05:18.300> England

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:18.599 
they say that I'm going to use England

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:20.179 
they say that I'm going to use England
against<00:05:18.840> example<00:05:19.259> England's<00:05:19.560> the<00:05:19.680> size<00:05:19.889> of<00:05:20.099> a

00:05:20.179 --> 00:05:20.189 
against example England's the size of a

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:21.769 
against example England's the size of a
state<00:05:20.430> called<00:05:20.610> Mississippi<00:05:21.270> over<00:05:21.449> here<00:05:21.629> and

00:05:21.769 --> 00:05:21.779 
state called Mississippi over here and

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:25.459 
state called Mississippi over here and
Mississippi<00:05:22.469> isn't<00:05:23.069> even<00:05:23.430> one<00:05:24.330> of<00:05:24.479> our<00:05:24.629> bigger

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:25.469 
Mississippi isn't even one of our bigger

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:28.459 
Mississippi isn't even one of our bigger
states<00:05:25.949> like<00:05:26.250> not<00:05:26.669> even<00:05:26.909> probably<00:05:27.719> close<00:05:28.440> to

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:28.469 
states like not even probably close to

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:30.680 
states like not even probably close to
the<00:05:28.860> maybe<00:05:29.279> I<00:05:29.370> guess<00:05:29.669> it's<00:05:29.879> sort<00:05:30.150> no<00:05:30.360> I<00:05:30.419> don't

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
the maybe I guess it's sort no I don't

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.209 
the maybe I guess it's sort no I don't
think<00:05:30.750> close<00:05:31.139> to<00:05:31.349> the<00:05:31.469> top<00:05:31.680> five<00:05:31.919> biggest

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:32.219 
think close to the top five biggest

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:35.980 
think close to the top five biggest
states<00:05:32.580> not<00:05:33.120> even<00:05:33.389> maybe<00:05:33.659> in<00:05:33.810> the<00:05:33.930> top<00:05:34.199> ten<00:05:34.589> and

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
states not even maybe in the top ten and

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.420 
states not even maybe in the top ten and
now<00:05:36.990> I'm<00:05:37.139> trying<00:05:37.349> to<00:05:37.469> coerce<00:05:37.949> picture<00:05:38.310> this

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
now I'm trying to coerce picture this

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.950 
now I'm trying to coerce picture this
map<00:05:38.669> in<00:05:38.879> my<00:05:39.000> head<00:05:39.150> so<00:05:39.270> I'm<00:05:39.389> gonna<00:05:39.479> get<00:05:39.690> grief

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
map in my head so I'm gonna get grief

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.119 
map in my head so I'm gonna get grief
for<00:05:40.139> this<00:05:40.289> I'm<00:05:40.500> somebody's<00:05:40.830> going<00:05:40.949> to<00:05:41.009> say

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:41.129 
for this I'm somebody's going to say

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:42.529 
for this I'm somebody's going to say
japes<00:05:41.400> you<00:05:41.490> weren't<00:05:41.669> even<00:05:41.849> close<00:05:42.000> on<00:05:42.300> that<00:05:42.389> but

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 
japes you weren't even close on that but

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:43.939 
japes you weren't even close on that but
I<00:05:42.629> don't<00:05:42.779> even<00:05:42.960> think<00:05:43.080> it's<00:05:43.229> remotely<00:05:43.680> close

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:43.949 
I don't even think it's remotely close

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:46.369 
I don't even think it's remotely close
well<00:05:44.250> yeah<00:05:45.180> I<00:05:45.210> don't<00:05:45.449> it's<00:05:45.569> definitely<00:05:46.050> not<00:05:46.229> in

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:46.379 
well yeah I don't it's definitely not in

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:49.550 
well yeah I don't it's definitely not in
the<00:05:46.440> top<00:05:46.620> ten<00:05:46.889> so<00:05:47.300> the<00:05:48.300> US<00:05:48.479> is<00:05:48.719> a<00:05:48.750> very<00:05:49.110> very<00:05:49.289> big

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
the top ten so the US is a very very big

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.670 
the top ten so the US is a very very big
place<00:05:49.800> and<00:05:50.099> so<00:05:50.550> going<00:05:50.819> to<00:05:51.000> what<00:05:51.599> would<00:05:51.750> be<00:05:51.960> the

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
place and so going to what would be the

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.290 
place and so going to what would be the
closest<00:05:53.339> MLS<00:05:53.969> match<00:05:54.270> for<00:05:54.659> me<00:05:54.810> would<00:05:55.439> be<00:05:55.469> a

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
closest MLS match for me would be a

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.600 
closest MLS match for me would be a
significant<00:05:57.300> road<00:05:57.689> trip<00:05:58.080> and<00:05:58.319> tons<00:05:59.219> and<00:05:59.400> tons

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
significant road trip and tons and tons

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.269 
significant road trip and tons and tons
of<00:05:59.789> time<00:05:59.969> which<00:06:00.270> just<00:06:00.479> is<00:06:00.659> not<00:06:01.050> feasible<00:06:01.409> but

00:06:02.269 --> 00:06:02.279 
of time which just is not feasible but

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:04.579 
of time which just is not feasible but
I'm<00:06:02.550> able<00:06:02.729> to<00:06:02.879> catch<00:06:03.120> you<00:06:03.569> know<00:06:03.659> matches<00:06:04.110> on<00:06:04.259> TV

00:06:04.579 --> 00:06:04.589

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:06.350 
I'm able to catch you know matches on TV
I<00:06:04.620> don't<00:06:04.919> watch<00:06:05.039> the<00:06:05.279> MLS<00:06:05.669> as<00:06:05.849> much<00:06:06.120> as<00:06:06.270> I

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
I don't watch the MLS as much as I

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.290 
I don't watch the MLS as much as I
probably<00:06:06.719> should<00:06:07.370> the<00:06:08.370> league<00:06:08.550> is<00:06:08.580> growing

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
probably should the league is growing

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.709 
probably should the league is growing
and<00:06:09.419> getting<00:06:09.539> a<00:06:09.750> lot<00:06:10.020> better<00:06:10.069> however<00:06:11.719> it's

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:12.719 
and getting a lot better however it's

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:15.260 
and getting a lot better however it's
still<00:06:13.229> not<00:06:13.650> the<00:06:13.710> same<00:06:14.099> sort<00:06:14.789> of<00:06:14.849> quality<00:06:15.029> and

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
still not the same sort of quality and

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.390 
still not the same sort of quality and
so<00:06:15.659> I<00:06:15.689> watch<00:06:16.080> you<00:06:16.469> know<00:06:16.560> Bayern<00:06:16.889> is<00:06:17.099> the<00:06:17.219> team

like the teams it's that I kind of
didn't<00:07:17.369> support<00:07:17.759> them<00:07:18.029> so<00:07:18.389> the<00:07:18.990> BPL<00:07:19.589> team<00:07:19.979> that

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:20.699

I<00:07:21.259> most<00:07:22.849> support<00:07:23.849> I<00:07:24.059> think<00:07:25.369> will<00:07:26.369> be<00:07:27.360> given<00:07:27.929> out

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:28.019

I most support I think will be given out
at<00:07:28.259> a<00:07:28.289> different<00:07:28.830> time<00:07:28.979> because<00:07:29.369> they<00:07:29.699> really

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:30.419 
at a different time because they really

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:32.509 
at a different time because they really
no<00:07:30.629> need<00:07:30.839> to<00:07:31.050> get<00:07:31.229> a<00:07:31.259> big<00:07:31.589> fuss<00:07:31.830> about<00:07:32.009> that<00:07:32.339> at

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:32.519 
no need to get a big fuss about that at

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:34.339 
no need to get a big fuss about that at
this<00:07:32.699> point<00:07:32.909> in<00:07:33.029> time<00:07:33.149> anyways<00:07:33.539> we're<00:07:34.169> coming
