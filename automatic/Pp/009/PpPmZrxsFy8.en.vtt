00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.970
 hello welcome to a puntocom teacher 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.250
 today we are going to discover what are the 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.950
 differences between the nucleus and the nucleus 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.500
 the 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.720
 When I was little I thought it was what 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.970
 I was too lazy myself and learn me the 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.770
 differences between them but it's not like that 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.140
 the differences are many and you have to 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.720
 because they are important to remember the 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.970
 core surely you already know is a 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.860
 organ the membranous and is an organ what 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.860
 membranous that is fundamental to the 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.440
 life of any eukaryotic cell 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.790
 because it is what protects the DNA in its 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.320
 inside 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.940
 adn remember that is all the 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.890
 genetic information that I inherited from 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.010
 my parents and that I will pass it on to my 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.940
 descendants and it is also the base or the 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.840
 mold to make rn and protein with what 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.530
 which we are not talking about any 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.100
 thing 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.450
 therefore in the nucleus there are some 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.659
 processes that are given that are the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:14.990
 DNA replication and its transcription 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.990
 that is, the passage from DNA to er 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.030
 the expression is also very important 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.250
 genetic within the nucleus because 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.250
 It depends on how I read the DNA strand 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.360
 will produce one protein produce another or 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.360
 not produce at all 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.420
 here is the mother of the lamb in 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.340
 core is the core what is that 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.900
 little black spot that we see inside the 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.240
 nucleus 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.460
 so 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.430
 the core what it does is the great 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.759
 unknown the nucleus does not have 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.310
 membrane around is a structure 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.630
 supramolecular is a conglomerate of 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.280
 molecules 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.009
 but the core does not have a function 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.710
 super important is that it is the 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.710
 precursor of the nucleus rn lar 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.619
 so the core is not the 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.920
 who has the information to do the 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.920
 ribosomes 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.590
 because that is important day 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.770
 if in the nucleus we have the functions of 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.130
 replication and transcription and expression 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.730
 remember that the transcription makes the 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.390
 step of adn arn 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.760
 if the ribosomes sn is never translated to 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.269
 protein with which I need the 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.269
 core what 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.330
 other functions that are very important 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.920
 and in which the nucleus intervenes 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.130
 regulates the cell cycle 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.459
 regulates the response of the cell to its 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.069
 stress not mine as a human person 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.690
 but of the cell of each cell when 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.490
 is stressed 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.010
 cell you can express for example 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.530
 dehydrating it or putting too many 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.850
 toxic when that happens the core not 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.850
 it behaves in a concrete way 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.660
 and that response to stress has to do 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.250
 with cell aging 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.590
 cell aging is the process 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.960
 whereby a cell begins to lose 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.230
 capabilities that I had when I just 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:22.060
 had just been born 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.060
 all of that has to do with the core what 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.450
 aging there is also the 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.570
 activity of telomerase which is a 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.620
 important enzyme when fighting 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.970
 against cellular aging 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.010
 therefore those are the differences 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.080
 fundamental I hope it has been 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.790
 all clear and you have some exercises to 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.159
 continuation in this same web page 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.549
 to prove that happy connoisseurs 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:45.549
 study 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.090
 yes 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.370
 and
