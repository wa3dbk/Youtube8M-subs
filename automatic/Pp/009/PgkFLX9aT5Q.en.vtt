data<00:01:51.659> things<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.439> couldn't<00:01:52.680> do<00:01:52.829> on<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.159> old

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
data things you couldn't do on the old

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.420 
data things you couldn't do on the old
engines<00:01:53.850> stuff<00:01:54.810> like<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.020> also<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> lot<00:01:56.399> of

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
engines stuff like that also a lot of

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.069 
engines stuff like that also a lot of
its<00:01:56.640> we're<00:01:57.180> looking<00:01:57.420> back<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.750> what<00:01:57.960> were

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
its we're looking back and what were

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.690 
its we're looking back and what were
people<00:01:58.200> doing<00:01:58.469> or<00:01:58.680> not<00:01:58.710> doing<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.490> we<00:01:59.610> would

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
people doing or not doing so we would

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.910 
people doing or not doing so we would
see<00:02:00.030> things<00:02:00.210> like<00:02:00.360> people<00:02:00.810> stop<00:02:01.200> using<00:02:01.229> as

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
see things like people stop using as

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.039 
see things like people stop using as
teching<00:02:02.430> competitions<00:02:03.090> oh<00:02:03.329> there's<00:02:03.899> some

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
teching competitions oh there's some

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.959 
teching competitions oh there's some
problems<00:02:04.409> with<00:02:04.439> aztec<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:05.189> we<00:02:05.369> fix<00:02:05.729> those

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
problems with aztec so we fix those

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.590 
problems with aztec so we fix those
problems<00:02:06.020> to<00:02:07.020> make<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.259> competitive<00:02:07.530> again

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
problems to make it competitive again

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.810 
problems to make it competitive again
you<00:02:09.170> we<00:02:09.290> saw<00:02:09.440> them<00:02:09.680> doing<00:02:09.890> things<00:02:10.220> like<00:02:10.460> having

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
you we saw them doing things like having

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.420 
you we saw them doing things like having
shorter<00:02:11.240> round<00:02:11.540> timers<00:02:12.050> so<00:02:12.470> we've<00:02:12.650> shrunk<00:02:13.220> the

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
shorter round timers so we've shrunk the

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.030 
shorter round timers so we've shrunk the
round<00:02:13.760> timers<00:02:14.150> by<00:02:14.540> default<00:02:14.870> on<00:02:15.200> they're<00:02:15.890> doing

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
round timers by default on they're doing

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.440 
round timers by default on they're doing
this<00:02:16.130> thing<00:02:16.220> called<00:02:16.490> mid<00:02:16.670> model<00:02:17.120> where<00:02:17.300> they

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
this thing called mid model where they

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.820 
this thing called mid model where they
would<00:02:17.570> remove<00:02:17.810> all<00:02:17.990> the<00:02:18.110> models<00:02:18.380> except<00:02:18.620> for

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
would remove all the models except for

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.560 
would remove all the models except for
one<00:02:18.950> on<00:02:19.070> each<00:02:19.190> side<00:02:19.220> so<00:02:20.150> that<00:02:20.300> you<00:02:20.360> had<00:02:20.480> an

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
one on each side so that you had an

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.920 
one on each side so that you had an
easier<00:02:20.900> way<00:02:21.050> to<00:02:21.080> identify<00:02:22.000> enemy<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:23.240> we've

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
easier way to identify enemy and we've

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.540 
easier way to identify enemy and we've
done<00:02:24.080> that<00:02:24.230> here<00:02:24.500> where<00:02:24.650> it's<00:02:25.040> not<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:25.280> exact

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
done that here where it's not the exact

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.070 
done that here where it's not the exact
same<00:02:25.790> model<00:02:25.940> but<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.210> same<00:02:26.390> class<00:02:26.690> of<00:02:26.870> models

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
same model but the same class of models

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.680 
same model but the same class of models
leave<00:02:27.380> this<00:02:27.560> easier<00:02:27.920> identification<00:02:28.690> and

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
leave this easier identification and

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.360 
leave this easier identification and
you've<00:02:29.960> rebalance<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.590> various<00:02:30.830> weapons<00:02:31.220> as

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
you've rebalance the various weapons as

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.750 
you've rebalance the various weapons as
well<00:02:31.490> at<00:02:31.820> the<00:02:31.850> AWP<00:02:32.630> things<00:02:33.560> like<00:02:33.740> that<00:02:33.920> so<00:02:34.340> it

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
well at the AWP things like that so it

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.580 
well at the AWP things like that so it
was<00:02:34.880> funny<00:02:35.060> as<00:02:35.150> we<00:02:35.240> had<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.390> CSS<00:02:35.780> pros<00:02:36.080> in<00:02:36.320> and

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
was funny as we had the CSS pros in and

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.140 
was funny as we had the CSS pros in and
we<00:02:37.190> asked<00:02:37.490> them<00:02:37.550> for<00:02:37.640> feedback<00:02:37.880> in<00:02:38.120> the

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
we asked them for feedback in the

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.580 
we asked them for feedback in the
weapons<00:02:38.480> they<00:02:38.540> give<00:02:38.720> us<00:02:38.780> feedback<00:02:38.900> on<00:02:39.260> for

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
weapons they give us feedback on for

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.280 
weapons they give us feedback on for
weapons<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.130> only<00:02:40.400> for<00:02:40.610> weapons<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:41.290> we're

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
weapons and only for weapons and we're

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.460 
weapons and only for weapons and we're
like<00:02:42.410> wow<00:02:43.370> okay<00:02:43.760> that's<00:02:44.150> this<00:02:44.480> is<00:02:44.600> broken<00:02:45.020> but

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
like wow okay that's this is broken but

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.960 
like wow okay that's this is broken but
you<00:02:45.680> know<00:02:45.770> we've<00:02:45.920> rebalance<00:02:46.400> weapons<00:02:46.760> what<00:02:46.880> do

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
you know we've rebalance weapons what do

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.040 
you know we've rebalance weapons what do
you<00:02:47.030> not<00:02:47.360> use<00:02:47.710> the<00:02:48.710> off<00:02:48.890> don't<00:02:49.370> use<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:50.690> deagle

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
you not use the off don't use the deagle

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.000 
you not use the off don't use the deagle
don't<00:02:51.290> use<00:02:51.850> m4a1<00:02:52.850> don't<00:02:53.120> use<00:02:53.270> the<00:02:53.870> AK<00:02:54.260> and

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
don't use m4a1 don't use the AK and

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.770 
don't use m4a1 don't use the AK and
instead<00:02:55.400> use<00:02:55.880> all<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.180> other<00:02:56.270> weapons<00:02:56.630> and

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
instead use all the other weapons and

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.270 
instead use all the other weapons and
then<00:02:56.870> give<00:02:57.020> us<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.290> feedback<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:57.860> their<00:02:57.980> then

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
then give us the feedback and their then

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
then give us the feedback and their then
they<00:02:58.310> realize<00:02:58.760> oh<00:02:58.880> these<00:02:59.090> have<00:02:59.240> been

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
they realize oh these have been

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.760 
they realize oh these have been
rebalanced<00:02:59.570> and<00:02:59.960> these<00:03:00.050> are<00:03:00.200> value<00:03:00.560> in<00:03:00.680> these

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
rebalanced and these are value in these

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.980 
rebalanced and these are value in these
weapons<00:03:01.220> so<00:03:01.970> you<00:03:02.030> know<00:03:02.210> they<00:03:02.360> would<00:03:02.480> before<00:03:02.630> do

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
weapons so you know they would before do

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.780 
weapons so you know they would before do
these<00:03:03.140> eco<00:03:03.980> rounds<00:03:04.280> they<00:03:04.400> wouldn't<00:03:04.610> purchase

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
these eco rounds they wouldn't purchase

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.100 
these eco rounds they wouldn't purchase
anything<00:03:05.120> so<00:03:05.390> they<00:03:05.480> can<00:03:05.600> save<00:03:05.750> up<00:03:05.930> for<00:03:06.080> that

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
anything so they can save up for that

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.140 
anything so they can save up for that
next<00:03:06.410> level<00:03:07.100> of<00:03:07.310> weapon<00:03:07.610> they<00:03:07.670> want<00:03:07.880> and<00:03:08.060> now

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
next level of weapon they want and now

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.000 
next level of weapon they want and now
there's<00:03:08.360> gradations<00:03:09.050> of<00:03:09.170> and<00:03:09.470> tactics<00:03:09.950> that

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
there's gradations of and tactics that

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.730 
there's gradations of and tactics that
can<00:03:10.190> use<00:03:10.310> in<00:03:10.670> between<00:03:11.530> graphically<00:03:12.530> you're

can use in between graphically you're

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.380 
can use in between graphically you're

engine<00:03:14.690> but<00:03:15.440> you're<00:03:15.560> still<00:03:15.740> fairly<00:03:16.130> scalable

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760

for<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.090> old<00:03:17.240> systems<00:03:17.900> so<00:03:18.650> those<00:03:18.890> people

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
for the old systems so those people

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.740 
for the old systems so those people
still<00:03:19.370> holding<00:03:19.670> on<00:03:19.730> to<00:03:19.760> count<00:03:20.030> strike<00:03:20.270> 1.6

they<00:03:21.230> can<00:03:21.380> they<00:03:21.830> can<00:03:21.860> quite<00:03:22.190> easily<00:03:22.220> play<00:03:22.670> this

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
they can they can quite easily play this

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.700 
they can they can quite easily play this
on<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.120> same<00:03:23.300> machine<00:03:23.630> I<00:03:23.780> believe<00:03:23.990> well<00:03:24.680> I

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:24.710 
on the same machine I believe well I

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.490 
on the same machine I believe well I
think<00:03:25.070> a<00:03:25.520> lot<00:03:25.970> of<00:03:26.000> actually<00:03:26.780> this<00:03:26.900> is<00:03:27.230> weird

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
think a lot of actually this is weird

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.540 
think a lot of actually this is weird

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
so what we've done here though is we try

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.310 
so what we've done here though is we try
to<00:03:39.950> make<00:03:40.130> sure<00:03:40.160> that<00:03:40.550> um<00:03:40.930> you<00:03:41.930> don't<00:03:42.020> get<00:03:42.200> any

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
to make sure that um you don't get any

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.170 
to make sure that um you don't get any
advantage<00:03:42.470> running<00:03:43.010> a<00:03:43.070> lower<00:03:43.190> DX<00:03:43.610> level<00:03:44.060> you

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
advantage running a lower DX level you

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.720 
advantage running a lower DX level you
can<00:03:44.560> we<00:03:45.560> standardize<00:03:46.100> everything<00:03:46.520> so<00:03:46.700> that

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
can we standardize everything so that

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.110 
can we standardize everything so that
the<00:03:47.150> competitive<00:03:47.780> mode<00:03:48.620> is<00:03:49.100> the<00:03:49.640> good-looking

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
the competitive mode is the good-looking

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.120 
the competitive mode is the good-looking
mode<00:03:50.300> it's<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:51.020> one<00:03:51.140> you<00:03:51.260> can<00:03:51.410> live<00:03:51.650> in<00:03:51.800> and

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
not have to turn everything down and go

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.080 
not have to turn everything down and go
into<00:03:54.560> some<00:03:54.770> weird<00:03:54.950> mode<00:03:55.340> where<00:03:55.640> there's<00:03:55.940> no

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
into some weird mode where there's no

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.660 
into some weird mode where there's no
textures<00:03:56.720> and<00:03:57.050> it's<00:03:57.200> really<00:03:57.500> ugly<00:03:57.620> we<00:03:58.490> want

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
know we did that in portal 2 where we

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.380 
know we did that in portal 2 where we
had<00:04:17.410> crashed<00:04:17.860> platform<00:04:18.459> play<00:04:18.700> in<00:04:19.000> co-op

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
had crashed platform play in co-op

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.400

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
between PC and ps3 players will see as

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.110 
between PC and ps3 players will see as
we<00:04:23.440> go<00:04:23.680> through<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:23.950> beta<00:04:24.100> the<00:04:24.850> kind<00:04:25.030> of

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
the ps3 to see if that will work or not

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.920 
the ps3 to see if that will work or not
and<00:04:30.610> in<00:04:30.700> competitive<00:04:31.240> environment<00:04:31.690> we're<00:04:31.810> not

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
and in competitive environment we're not

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
worried about matching those two groups

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.090 
worried about matching those two groups
together<00:04:34.390> because<00:04:34.960> that's<00:04:35.110> skill<00:04:35.530> and<00:04:35.830> that

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100

and that's skill based matchmaking that

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.780 
and that's skill based matchmaking that
we<00:04:38.650> have<00:04:38.740> built<00:04:38.950> in<00:04:39.100> will<00:04:39.340> take<00:04:39.490> care<00:04:39.640> of<00:04:39.700> that

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
we have built in will take care of that

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.610 
we have built in will take care of that
part<00:04:40.120> of<00:04:40.300> it<00:04:40.360> it<00:04:40.600> really<00:04:40.780> is<00:04:40.960> making<00:04:41.320> sure<00:04:41.470> that

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
part of it it really is making sure that

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.730 
part of it it really is making sure that
one<00:04:41.920> platform<00:04:42.310> doesn't<00:04:42.730> hamstring<00:04:43.180> the<00:04:43.270> other

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
one platform doesn't hamstring the other

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.490 
one platform doesn't hamstring the other
its<00:04:44.740> ability<00:04:45.070> to<00:04:45.100> update<00:04:45.420> and<00:04:46.420> is<00:04:47.350> there

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
its ability to update and is there

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.020

do a lot of things so one of the
problems<00:05:01.450> we<00:05:01.510> have<00:05:01.540> with<00:05:01.990> counter-strike

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
problems we have with counter-strike

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.770 
problems we have with counter-strike
sources<00:05:03.130> if<00:05:03.250> we<00:05:03.370> want<00:05:03.550> to<00:05:03.610> make<00:05:03.820> it<00:05:04.030> where<00:05:04.660> the
