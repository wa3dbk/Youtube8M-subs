00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.709
 so we left this morning of the referrals 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.500
 from the south we went down the big glass on 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:18.500
 put the pots to go up during a 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.720
 little hour the glacier of Antwerp plane 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.939
 which brought us to a small corridor 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.410
 which is about 150 meters 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.019
 we had a little trouble getting back up 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.359
 because it was well snowed and then 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.949
 that led directly to the top 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.949
 the face is full of sugar 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.520

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.550
 arrived at the summit we realized 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.909

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.549
 then you have to m 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.920
 the recall of the top then down 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.280
 realized that it was 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.280
 exciting with that 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.730
 so we decided to arrange the agreement 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.000
 in the bag and then 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.000
 I was happy 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.190
 not good no 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.140

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.570

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:59.799
