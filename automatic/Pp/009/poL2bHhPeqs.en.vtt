00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.740
 in an atmosphere of joy and excitement the 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.719
 communities of the riverbanks 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.180
 Orinoco and the Minister of Environment Miguel 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.550
 leonardo rodríguez released this Saturday 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.940
 about 21,000 baby turtles take a 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.130
 year old and 140 adult turtles in the 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.230
 santamaría beach of the state hurry the 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.099
 commitment to a species that in the 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.070
 past 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.720
 speaking of the 19th century our football by 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.400
 here on this riverbank what else 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.770
 impressed in this country for example it was 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.050
 see spawn some 2 million turtles 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.330
 to say that there was not even a beach 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.000
 Orinoco in summer that was not 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.550
 spawning of the turtle arrau today is in 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.670
 danger needs everything and a program 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.040
 that started in 93 but that has been 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.840
 very vigorous of the year 2000 and good to 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.340
 some do not like us to do and 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.750
 let's establish these comparisons but 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.690
 it is certainly like that 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:00.110
 this program that I wish was strengthened is 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.760
 more robust since 2000 and of the 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.009
 releases that have been made in all 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.670
 these years true of the program of 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:09.700
 turtle conservation arrau 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.509
 that reaches about 650 thousand individuals 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.880
 released 90% have been done just 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.229
 from the year 2000 onwards that is to say 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.119
 we are committed this is not a 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.799
 We do this because we believe in 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.659
 nature because we believe the human being 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.970
 and of course we will do our best 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.920
 why human life is preserved in 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.170
 the planet so this release of 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.890
 today that is the first of the year the 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.750
 we also started with something very novel 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.729
 we are releasing adult turtles not what 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.130
 we had done within the program today 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.380
 they are releasing turtles of 20 30 and 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.799
 40 years is to say that in the next 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.330
 spawn we will have by the end of the year 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.610
 starting January and February 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.920
 we will have these turtles 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.539
 spawning on this same beach where the 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.369
 we are releasing the minister today
