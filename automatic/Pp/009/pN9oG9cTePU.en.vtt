00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.910
 hello people with you woodcutter and 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:36.900
 Today I will talk about fashion which 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:40.890
 changes the animation of our steve's movements 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.470
 in minecraft and so present to you the mod 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.590
 animated player 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.809
 as you have already noticed the changed animation 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.840
 flight let's take off 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:57.810
 and when flying we have such a few 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:02.220
 knees bent and arms yes let's remove 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:05.210
 anything anything that's 100 Bent 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.210
 knees and arms 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.040
 what else could be better but better with us 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.619
 there is an animation in this mod 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.380
 walk 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.869
 our movement is smoother more 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.920
 bent and and most importantly more 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:27.549
 realistic like real people 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:31.539
 changed run animation 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.539
 this is generally cool 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:42.500
 also changed the animation when we go 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.580
 hidden that is before that is when we 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:49.659
 squeezed shift 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:51.920
 go but it looks a little ridiculous 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.450
 because as if we were making our way 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.200
 through some 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:00.159
 thickets as you probably already noticed 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.590
 steve eyebrows appeared 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.409
 kind of which is not just a white stripe on 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.979
 face and it still opens 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:11.950
 thereby showing that steve is breathing 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.230
 By the way, no, I didnâ€™t know that Steve can 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.260
 breathe 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.450
 also changed the animation of his eyes you 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:24.480
 look we go one way a 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.480
 the eyes of the other here are the same 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.050
 such sly eyes that are not 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.940
 will issue no information under any 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.500
 torture also 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:42.990
 I probably did not say but eyebrows 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:46.740
 anime and properties change position then 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:52.459
 there are mimics here he is a skiff 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.459
 angry that's in a normal mood 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:03:00.420
 also changed the schedule when we like 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.600
 eat or drink a potion and bring it to your mouth 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.740
 post office 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:10.410
 wants to eat or drink and we drink it 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.410
 liquidy let's give an apple 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.330
 Who 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.880
 no they are not hungry now 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.700
 he doesn't want an apple 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.850
 also changed the animation when we 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.970
 archery it is generally cool about him 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.670
 he becomes threatening 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:34.260
 can be clearly seen as hand pulling the arrow 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:37.349
 look at his left hand 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.900
 he straight and and moves his hand away and 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.879
 pull the arrow 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.790
 also very epic is obtained when we 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:49.310
 time stretched arrows 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.310
 we sit it at all cool 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.610
 but if you heat up the sides a little ridiculous 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.690
 one leg in the air the other half 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.690
 under the ground 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:12.100
 also changed the animation when we 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.620
 defending ourselves with the sword is also quite epic 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:18.090
 but there is one bloop when we defend ourselves 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:21.640
 From the sword we press shift Steve's head 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:26.790
 leans back as if he wants to 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.790
 now slept it 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.370
 one of the equally important additions is 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.300
 the fact that 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:39.419
 changed graphics when we sail you 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.210
 just look steve waving 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:46.500
 hands in the water trying to be like 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:49.189
 as a living person, he also moves 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.189
 many 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:55.390
 arms and all the rest of the body and 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:59.620
 objects in the hands also saw this 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.620
 move with your hands 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:06.000
 schedule here this flight it is a little 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:09.210
 reminds graphics with jumps because 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.420
 when we jump but also like this 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:15.000
 we wander arms and legs and when we here 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:18.120
 so quickly with the tape you can not distinguish 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:23.390
 themes other players can not distinguish 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:28.750
 any repairs or just jump 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:33.050
 here is our steve inhales the air after 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.940
 tiring swimming is another one of 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:39.230
 features of this mod is 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:42.020
 the one with the father's leg and arm gena 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:45.230
 we sit on any animal here you are 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.330
 just look at how your legs are bent 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:51.430
 steve when sitting on a pig 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:55.320
 it's pretty cool and very realistic 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.320
 so where are you going me 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:05.930
 and the latest innovation in this fashion 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:10.169
 is as we climb the stairs 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:14.210
 now I will remove and suddenly this bow 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:14.210
 you look at it 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:20.260
 our legs and arms with genocide like those of the living 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.260
 people 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:28.919
 as if we really grab it 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:31.889
 shelves on the stairs but there are also cons like u 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:35.039
 all mods minuses without it is that 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:36.629
 if we maycroft fever old slippery 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:40.229
 then we will not see him 

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:45.710
 see my hand right now 

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:49.590
 and when i press f5 then steve's skin is 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:55.650
 one of these hybrid cons because 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:07:00.210
 that the skin is archived with the mod and 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:02.099
 there it should be specifically set up 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.470
 There is if you insert your skin then it does not 

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:07.530
 will be visible on you 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:11.790
 if i find out how to put my skin 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:14.070
 and mimicry change on it add eyes 

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:18.020
 and so on I will of course take off about it 

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:22.260
 Guide and a reference will be but if I do not recognize 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:25.430
 . will not be on this review of this mod 

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:28.760

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:36.530
