first<00:00:13.860> mistake<00:00:14.309> any<00:00:14.700> most<00:00:15.480> people<00:00:15.839> make<00:00:16.020> is

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
first mistake any most people make is

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.080 
first mistake any most people make is
that<00:00:16.289> they<00:00:16.529> roll<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:16.980> like<00:00:17.010> this<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.580> reduce<00:00:17.699> it

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
that they roll it like this to reduce it

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.710 
that they roll it like this to reduce it
and<00:00:19.279> that's<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.460> big<00:00:20.640> no-no<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:21.150> do<00:00:21.390> end<00:00:21.600> up

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720

it<00:02:56.710> out<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.870> I<00:02:59.290> know<00:02:59.380> I'm<00:02:59.710> leaving<00:03:00.010> I'm<00:03:00.220> 45<00:03:00.700> you

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
it out and I know I'm leaving I'm 45 you

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.000 
it out and I know I'm leaving I'm 45 you
were<00:03:00.970> asking<00:03:01.420> on<00:03:01.570> how<00:03:01.900> to<00:03:01.960> do<00:03:02.200> different<00:03:02.560> sizes

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
were asking on how to do different sizes

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.940 
were asking on how to do different sizes
that<00:03:03.040> was<00:03:03.370> one<00:03:03.550> of<00:03:03.670> your<00:03:04.050> questions<00:03:05.050> so<00:03:05.260> you

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
that was one of your questions so you

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.430 
that was one of your questions so you
just<00:03:06.130> keep<00:03:06.310> stretching<00:03:06.700> it<00:03:07.030> out<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:08.230> don't

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
just keep stretching it out you don't

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.410 
just keep stretching it out you don't
roll<00:03:08.620> it<00:03:08.680> too<00:03:09.010> much<00:03:09.190> because<00:03:09.460> it'll<00:03:09.820> distort

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
roll it too much because it'll distort

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.320 
roll it too much because it'll distort
it<00:03:10.740> so<00:03:11.740> you<00:03:11.830> just<00:03:11.980> keep<00:03:12.160> stretching<00:03:12.460> it<00:03:12.730> out

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.890 

stretch<00:03:16.330> it<00:03:16.630> enough<00:03:17.490> so<00:03:18.490> I'm<00:03:18.760> gonna<00:03:18.940> be<00:03:19.750> right

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
stretch it enough so I'm gonna be right

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.210

back<00:03:20.050> and<00:03:20.290> I'm<00:03:20.350> gonna<00:03:20.470> stretch<00:03:20.950> it<00:03:21.010> a<00:03:21.190> little

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
back and I'm gonna stretch it a little

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.510 
back and I'm gonna stretch it a little
bit<00:03:21.700> more<00:03:22.090> to<00:03:22.840> make<00:03:22.930> another<00:03:23.260> size<00:03:23.530> so<00:03:24.100> be<00:03:24.250> back

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.010 

okay<00:03:27.520> so<00:03:27.580> I'm<00:03:27.760> back<00:03:27.910> and<00:03:28.240> as<00:03:28.510> you<00:03:28.570> can<00:03:28.840> see<00:03:28.990> I

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
stretched it out a little more so I'm

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:37.280 
stretched it out a little more so I'm
gonna<00:03:30.700> cut<00:03:30.970> a<00:03:31.150> little<00:03:31.680> another<00:03:32.680> piece<00:03:33.040> off<00:03:33.220> and

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:45.960 

see<00:03:38.290> they're<00:03:38.890> two<00:03:39.100> different<00:03:39.280> sizes<00:03:39.670> now<00:03:44.970> and

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
see they're two different sizes now and

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.760 
see they're two different sizes now and
you<00:03:46.120> always<00:03:46.390> like<00:03:46.540> to<00:03:46.690> have<00:03:46.810> extra<00:03:47.380> because

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
you always like to have extra because

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.650 
you always like to have extra because
you<00:03:47.920> never<00:03:48.040> know<00:03:48.340> it<00:03:48.610> there's<00:03:49.120> lots<00:03:49.540> of

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
you never know it there's lots of

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.300 
you never know it there's lots of
different<00:03:49.960> projects<00:03:50.380> you<00:03:50.440> might<00:03:50.620> like<00:03:50.800> to<00:03:51.070> use

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
different projects you might like to use

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.680 
different projects you might like to use
it<00:03:51.610> for<00:03:51.820> later<00:03:52.000> on<00:03:52.860> and<00:03:53.910> so<00:03:54.910> when<00:03:55.510> it<00:03:55.630> gets

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
it for later on and so when it gets

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.150 
it for later on and so when it gets
really<00:03:55.960> long<00:03:56.200> and<00:03:56.470> you<00:03:56.530> can't<00:03:56.800> roll<00:03:56.980> it

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
really long and you can't roll it

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.720 
really long and you can't roll it
anymore<00:03:58.470> you're<00:03:59.470> gonna<00:03:59.620> cut<00:03:59.860> it<00:03:59.950> in<00:04:00.040> half<00:04:00.250> just

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.410 

like<00:04:03.730> so<00:04:03.940> and<00:04:05.700> that's<00:04:06.700> about<00:04:06.850> the<00:04:07.060> same<00:04:07.240> size

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
like so and that's about the same size

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.510 
like so and that's about the same size
so<00:04:07.630> I'm<00:04:07.840> gonna<00:04:08.050> probably<00:04:08.770> leave<00:04:08.920> this<00:04:09.160> one<00:04:09.340> for

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
so I'm gonna probably leave this one for

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.990 
so I'm gonna probably leave this one for
that<00:04:09.750> so<00:04:10.750> I'm<00:04:10.960> gonna<00:04:11.110> keep<00:04:11.290> rolling

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
that so I'm gonna keep rolling

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.320 
that so I'm gonna keep rolling
stretching<00:04:13.000> it<00:04:13.150> out<00:04:13.500> and<00:04:14.500> this<00:04:14.680> is<00:04:14.740> a<00:04:14.890> end<00:04:15.340> so

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
stretching it out and this is a end so

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.170 
stretching it out and this is a end so
the<00:04:16.480> end<00:04:16.630> always<00:04:16.900> gets<00:04:17.260> distorted<00:04:17.970> you<00:04:18.970> can't

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
the end always gets distorted you can't

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.140 
the end always gets distorted you can't
do<00:04:19.299> nothing<00:04:19.630> about<00:04:19.720> that<00:04:20.670> so<00:04:21.670> I'm<00:04:21.820> just<00:04:22.000> gonna

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
do nothing about that so I'm just gonna

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.860 
do nothing about that so I'm just gonna
keep<00:04:22.390> stretching<00:04:22.690> it<00:04:22.960> out<00:04:23.050> and<00:04:23.380> then<00:04:23.470> roll

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
keep stretching it out and then roll

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:31.380 
keep stretching it out and then roll
stretching<00:04:25.870> it<00:04:26.200> hand<00:04:26.890> rolling<00:04:29.490> all<00:04:30.490> right<00:04:30.670> so

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
stretching it hand rolling all right so

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:38.520 
stretching it hand rolling all right so
I'm<00:04:31.540> gonna<00:04:31.690> cut<00:04:32.020> again<00:04:36.000> and<00:04:37.110> another<00:04:38.110> small

usually leave this as scrap clay and and
I<00:05:14.800> just<00:05:14.830> keep<00:05:15.280> pulling<00:05:15.520> this<00:05:15.760> one<00:05:15.940> out<00:05:16.060> so<00:05:16.240> this

rolled it out and it's getting too long

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.020 
rolled it out and it's getting too long
for<00:05:29.320> me<00:05:29.440> to<00:05:29.470> keep<00:05:29.710> rolling<00:05:29.950> so<00:05:30.430> I'm<00:05:30.580> gonna<00:05:30.790> cut

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
for me to keep rolling so I'm gonna cut

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.190 
for me to keep rolling so I'm gonna cut
it<00:05:31.060> in<00:05:31.270> half<00:05:32.280> once<00:05:33.280> again<00:05:33.670> and<00:05:34.120> it's<00:05:34.390> getting

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
it in half once again and it's getting

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.120 
it in half once again and it's getting
pretty<00:05:35.410> small<00:05:35.590> but<00:05:36.190> I<00:05:36.220> want<00:05:36.490> it<00:05:36.580> even<00:05:36.730> similar

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
pretty small but I want it even similar

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.800 
pretty small but I want it even similar

00:05:59.970 --> 00:05:59.980 
really really small so there it is so

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.890 
really really small so there it is so
I'm<00:06:00.070> probably<00:06:00.280> gonna<00:06:00.490> this<00:06:01.330> is<00:06:01.390> probably<00:06:01.780> too

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
I'm probably gonna this is probably too

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.420 
I'm probably gonna this is probably too
long<00:06:02.140> so<00:06:02.530> I'm<00:06:02.620> gonna<00:06:02.800> cut<00:06:03.040> it<00:06:03.160> a<00:06:03.190> little

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
long so I'm gonna cut it a little

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.800 
long so I'm gonna cut it a little
shorter<00:06:03.900> um<00:06:04.900> cut<00:06:05.440> the<00:06:05.560> cane<00:06:05.800> in<00:06:06.010> off<00:06:06.460> and<00:06:07.060> I'll

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
shorter um cut the cane in off and I'll

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.840 
shorter um cut the cane in off and I'll
probably<00:06:08.050> do<00:06:08.230> this<00:06:08.380> one<00:06:08.560> later<00:06:08.770> but<00:06:09.070> um<00:06:09.370> it's

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:09.850 
probably do this one later but um it's

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.220 
probably do this one later but um it's
probably<00:06:10.000> gonna<00:06:10.240> be<00:06:10.330> the<00:06:10.540> same<00:06:10.720> size<00:06:10.930> as<00:06:11.080> this

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:11.230 
probably gonna be the same size as this

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.310 
probably gonna be the same size as this
one<00:06:11.410> so<00:06:12.280> as<00:06:12.640> you<00:06:12.820> can<00:06:13.000> see<00:06:13.060> we<00:06:13.780> have<00:06:13.960> all<00:06:14.140> sorts

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
one so as you can see we have all sorts

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:32.119 
one so as you can see we have all sorts
of<00:06:14.500> different<00:06:14.830> sizes<00:06:16.500> really<00:06:17.500> small

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:32.129 

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:33.619 

although<00:06:32.789> the<00:06:32.909> camera<00:06:33.089> doesn't<00:06:33.360> want<00:06:33.569> to

00:06:33.619 --> 00:06:33.629 
although the camera doesn't want to

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:37.309 
although the camera doesn't want to
focus<00:06:34.429> there<00:06:35.429> goes<00:06:35.639> really<00:06:36.300> small<00:06:36.749> and<00:06:37.169> then

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 
focus there goes really small and then

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:50.209 
focus there goes really small and then
small<00:06:39.619> medium<00:06:40.619> and<00:06:43.610> large<00:06:48.409> so<00:06:49.409> these<00:06:49.679> these

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:50.219 
small medium and large so these these

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:52.339 
small medium and large so these these
are<00:06:50.429> all<00:06:50.550> sorts<00:06:50.969> of<00:06:51.059> different<00:06:51.389> sizes<00:06:51.539> so<00:06:52.319> you

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:52.349 
are all sorts of different sizes so you

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:56.089 
are all sorts of different sizes so you
can<00:06:52.499> use<00:06:52.769> them<00:06:52.889> in<00:06:53.009> different<00:06:53.039> things<00:06:54.619> I<00:06:55.619> would

00:06:56.089 --> 00:06:56.099 
can use them in different things I would

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:58.909 
can use them in different things I would
let<00:06:56.309> them<00:06:56.519> rest<00:06:56.819> for<00:06:57.149> another<00:06:57.239> day<00:06:57.830> before<00:06:58.830> you

00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 
let them rest for another day before you

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:01.669 
let them rest for another day before you
slice<00:06:59.369> them<00:06:59.519> and<00:06:59.699> use<00:06:59.819> them<00:07:00.110> so<00:07:01.110> that's<00:07:01.409> how

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:01.679 
slice them and use them so that's how

00:07:01.679 --> 00:07:04.399 
slice them and use them so that's how
you<00:07:01.739> unreduced<00:07:02.550> a<00:07:02.839> round<00:07:03.839> cane

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:04.409 
you unreduced a round cane

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:06.889 
you unreduced a round cane
