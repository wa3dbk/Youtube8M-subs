00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
higher prices for energy and if we can

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.920 
higher prices for energy and if we can
lower<00:01:02.460> those<00:01:02.730> costs<00:01:03.270> through<00:01:03.809> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
lower those costs through the

development of clean energy and
increased<00:01:06.689> energy<00:01:06.990> efficiency<00:01:08.479> we<00:01:09.479> could

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
increased energy efficiency we could

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.810 
increased energy efficiency we could
unleash<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.650> think<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.189> whole<00:01:11.369> host<00:01:11.580> of

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
unleash I think a whole host of

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.020 
unleash I think a whole host of
additional<00:01:11.970> investment<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.650> growth<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.820> I

think there are going to be a whole host

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.230 
think there are going to be a whole host
of<00:01:16.290> areas<00:01:16.470> where<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.400> United<00:01:17.430> States<00:01:17.909> can<00:01:18.150> be

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
of areas where the United States can be

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.840 
of areas where the United States can be
helpful<00:01:18.950> we<00:01:19.950> also<00:01:20.130> address<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.520> issue<00:01:20.759> of
