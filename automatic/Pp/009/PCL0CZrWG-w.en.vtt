00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
about the axial 2.4 gigahertz ax 3 radio

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.620 
about the axial 2.4 gigahertz ax 3 radio
systems<00:00:08.790> this<00:00:09.630> came<00:00:09.900> stock<00:00:10.530> with<00:00:10.889> my<00:00:11.630> jeep

systems this came stock with my jeep
rubicon<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:13.700> believe<00:00:14.700> that<00:00:15.059> this<00:00:15.630> radio<00:00:16.400> comes

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
rubicon I believe that this radio comes

rubicon I believe that this radio comes
stock<00:00:17.789> with<00:00:17.820> all<00:00:18.779> their<00:00:19.050> RTR<00:00:19.500> kits<00:00:20.090> so

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
stock with all their RTR kits so

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.870 
stock with all their RTR kits so
starting<00:00:22.050> off<00:00:22.970> get<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.000> nice<00:00:24.330> look<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.880> hold

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
the antenna nice decals on there are

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.410 
the antenna nice decals on there are
decals<00:00:31.109> depending<00:00:31.560> on<00:00:31.679> where<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.949> live

not too much bounce and the foam here
pretty<00:00:36.750> nice<00:00:36.989> but<00:00:37.290> uh<00:00:37.430> that's<00:00:38.430> what<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.640> found

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
pretty nice but uh that's what I found

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.799 
pretty nice but uh that's what I found
happened<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.450> lot<00:00:39.950> but<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:40.980> quick<00:00:41.640> little<00:00:42.510> slide

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
happened a lot but a quick little slide

happened a lot but a quick little slide
back<00:00:43.050> into<00:00:43.260> place<00:00:43.640> fixes<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:45.000> to

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
back into place fixes that on to

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.049 
back into place fixes that on to
probably<00:00:46.079> glue<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.469> it's<00:00:47.399> got<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.579> drop<00:00:47.879> down

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
probably glue it it's got a drop down

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:59.479 
probably glue it it's got a drop down
feel<00:00:51.649> nice<00:00:52.649> trigger<00:00:52.949> feel<00:00:54.800> ok<00:00:58.129> some<00:00:59.129> ports

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
feel nice trigger feel ok some ports

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.920 
feel nice trigger feel ok some ports
right<00:00:59.699> there<00:01:01.309> alright<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
right there alright and this is the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.609 
right there alright and this is the
coolest<00:01:04.350> part<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.600> you<00:01:06.600> can<00:01:06.810> choose<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.170> use

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
coolest part of it you can choose to use

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.910 
coolest part of it you can choose to use
for<00:01:08.460> double<00:01:09.299> A's<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.409> just<00:01:10.560> take<00:01:10.740> this

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
for double A's so you just take this

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.240 
for double A's so you just take this
plug<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.340> into<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.850> little<00:01:12.710> jst<00:01:13.710> port<00:01:14.040> down

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
plug it into that little jst port down

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
plug it into that little jst port down
there<00:01:14.540> or<00:01:16.790> you<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:18.710> use<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:20.009> lipo<00:01:20.400> battery<00:01:20.729> this

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
there or you can use a lipo battery this

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.660 
there or you can use a lipo battery this
one<00:01:21.600> actually<00:01:21.990> fits<00:01:22.200> conveniently<00:01:22.530> right<00:01:23.400> in

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
one actually fits conveniently right in

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.109 
one actually fits conveniently right in
here

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
here

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.160 
here
so<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.630> use<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.020> as<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.229> storage<00:01:26.509> thing<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.990> I

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
so I use this as a storage thing and I

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.499 
so I use this as a storage thing and I
actually<00:01:28.320> use<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:28.920> lipo<00:01:29.900> just<00:01:30.900> because

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
actually use this lipo just because

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:38.480 
actually use this lipo just because
using<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:35.689> using<00:01:36.689> four<00:01:37.079> double<00:01:37.350> ace<00:01:37.500> gets<00:01:38.400> a

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
using a using four double ace gets a

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.340 
using a using four double ace gets a
little<00:01:38.610> old<00:01:38.850> but<00:01:39.150> what<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.840> really<00:01:40.140> like<00:01:40.320> about

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
little old but what I really like about

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.830 
little old but what I really like about
that<00:01:40.770> sure<00:01:41.579> it's<00:01:41.759> four<00:01:42.060> double-a<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.479> that

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
that sure it's four double-a so that

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.929 
that sure it's four double-a so that
cuts<00:01:43.110> your<00:01:44.070> fly<00:01:44.520> skies<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:45.030> half<00:01:45.270> versus<00:01:45.990> uh<00:01:46.939> FS

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
cuts your fly skies in half versus uh FS

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:54.649 
cuts your fly skies in half versus uh FS
gt2<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.509> gt3<00:01:49.290> B's<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.340> eight<00:01:51.799> so<00:01:53.659> getting

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
gt2 and gt3 B's and eight so getting

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.289 
gt2 and gt3 B's and eight so getting
into<00:01:55.049> it

dual<00:02:02.159> rates<00:02:02.490> binding<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:04.770> you've<00:02:05.040> got<00:02:05.219> your

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
dual rates binding and you've got your

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.820 
dual rates binding and you've got your
reversing<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.829> power<00:02:07.829> switch<00:02:09.560> that's<00:02:10.560> nice

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
reversing so power switch that's nice

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.250 
reversing so power switch that's nice
little<00:02:11.340> switch<00:02:12.120> here

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
little switch here

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.240 
little switch here
alright<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:15.730> I'm<00:02:15.909> gonna<00:02:16.620> get<00:02:17.620> a<00:02:17.650> card

alright so I'm gonna get a card

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.240 
alright so I'm gonna get a card
demonstrate<00:02:18.909> here<00:02:19.239> here's<00:02:19.659> my<00:02:20.099> micro<00:02:21.099> High

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
demonstrate here here's my micro High

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:36.190 
demonstrate here here's my micro High
Roller<00:02:21.459> I'm<00:02:21.730> currently<00:02:22.060> working<00:02:22.780> on<00:02:22.959> it

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:55.610 

okay<00:02:50.719> that's<00:02:51.719> actually<00:02:52.109> a<00:02:52.849> pretty<00:02:54.620> pretty

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
okay that's actually a pretty pretty

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.280 
okay that's actually a pretty pretty
accurate<00:02:56.129> and<00:02:57.739> right<00:02:58.739> in<00:02:58.980> here<00:02:59.810> that<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:01.079> the

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
accurate and right in here that is the

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.020 
accurate and right in here that is the
receiver<00:03:01.920> it's<00:03:02.069> actually<00:03:02.400> smaller<00:03:02.700> than<00:03:02.879> a

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
receiver it's actually smaller than a

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.720 
receiver it's actually smaller than a
fly<00:03:03.269> sky<00:03:03.510> receiver<00:03:03.920> so<00:03:04.920> that<00:03:05.129> I<00:03:05.159> find<00:03:05.579> very

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
fly sky receiver so that I find very

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.470 
fly sky receiver so that I find very
helpful<00:03:07.189> and<00:03:08.189> I<00:03:08.340> know<00:03:08.549> this<00:03:08.819> is<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.000> bunch<00:03:09.329> of

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
helpful and I know this is a bunch of

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.879 
helpful and I know this is a bunch of
wiring<00:03:10.439> mess<00:03:10.919> I<00:03:11.370> was<00:03:11.790> thinking<00:03:12.359> about<00:03:12.889> yeah

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
wiring mess I was thinking about yeah

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:17.089 
wiring mess I was thinking about yeah
I'm<00:03:14.069> definitely<00:03:14.579> gonna<00:03:14.639> redo<00:03:15.000> this<00:03:15.120> ESC<00:03:16.099> cut

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
I'm definitely gonna redo this ESC cut

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:18.830 
I'm definitely gonna redo this ESC cut
the<00:03:17.250> leaves<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.579> little<00:03:17.669> shorter<00:03:18.180> definitely<00:03:18.810> a

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
the leaves a little shorter definitely a

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.729 
the leaves a little shorter definitely a
lot<00:03:18.989> shorter<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:22.590> servo<00:03:24.409> so<00:03:25.409> that's<00:03:25.590> the

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
lot shorter and the servo so that's the

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.190 
lot shorter and the servo so that's the
ESC<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.579> that's<00:03:26.760> actually<00:03:27.719> no<00:03:27.959> I<00:03:27.989> think

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
ESC and that's actually no I think

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.420 
ESC and that's actually no I think
that's<00:03:28.469> the<00:03:28.620> servo<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:29.069> that's<00:03:29.219> the<00:03:29.730> ESC<00:03:31.430> and

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
that's the servo and that's the ESC and

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:41.050 
that's the servo and that's the ESC and
uh<00:03:32.459> ESC<00:03:33.389> I'm<00:03:33.569> running<00:03:33.959> a<00:03:34.200> hobby<00:03:34.769> King<00:03:38.449> 10<00:03:39.449> amp

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
uh ESC I'm running a hobby King 10 amp

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.500 
uh ESC I'm running a hobby King 10 amp
ESC<00:03:42.060> with<00:03:42.090> reverse<00:03:42.599> and<00:03:43.440> a<00:03:43.500> brushless<00:03:43.769> motor

my<00:03:45.510> only<00:03:45.690> one<00:03:45.810> that<00:03:45.989> works<00:03:46.199> by<00:03:46.889> the<00:03:46.919> way<00:03:47.540> these

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
my only one that works by the way these

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.920 
my only one that works by the way these
motors<00:03:49.129> don't<00:03:50.129> like<00:03:50.310> them<00:03:50.519> I've<00:03:51.510> said<00:03:51.780> in

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
motors don't like them I've said in

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.929 
motors don't like them I've said in
previous<00:03:52.169> videos<00:03:52.590> and<00:03:53.189> I<00:03:53.310> made<00:03:53.459> a<00:03:53.489> review<00:03:53.819> on

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:53.939 
previous videos and I made a review on

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.710 
previous videos and I made a review on
them<00:03:54.060> but<00:03:54.780> this<00:03:55.109> review<00:03:55.500> is<00:03:55.620> on<00:03:56.720> this

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
them but this review is on this

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:09.860 
them but this review is on this
transmitter<00:04:05.449> so<00:04:08.540> comments<00:04:09.540> questions

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
transmitter so comments questions

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.530 
transmitter so comments questions

section<00:04:12.900> below<00:04:13.400> this<00:04:14.400> is<00:04:14.549> actually<00:04:14.939> a<00:04:14.970> really

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
section below this is actually a really

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:18.110 
section below this is actually a really
nice<00:04:15.840> radio<00:04:16.229> I<00:04:16.289> mean<00:04:16.530> would<00:04:17.280> I<00:04:17.310> find<00:04:17.669> its<00:04:17.940> best

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
nice radio I mean would I find its best

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.939 
nice radio I mean would I find its best
uses<00:04:18.570> for<00:04:18.599> is<00:04:18.959> um<00:04:19.199> if<00:04:20.070> you've<00:04:20.220> got<00:04:20.400> just<00:04:20.729> one

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 
uses for is um if you've got just one

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:27.200 
uses for is um if you've got just one
one<00:04:22.949> RC<00:04:23.370> to<00:04:24.240> use<00:04:24.419> like<00:04:24.690> me<00:04:24.930> I<00:04:25.139> have<00:04:26.130> a<00:04:26.210> micro

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
one RC to use like me I have a micro

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.260 
one RC to use like me I have a micro
team<00:04:27.389> Micro<00:04:27.750> High<00:04:27.930> Roller<00:04:28.169> so<00:04:28.560> I<00:04:29.180> attended<00:04:30.180> to

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
team Micro High Roller so I attended to

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.029 
team Micro High Roller so I attended to
take<00:04:30.509> the<00:04:30.659> micros<00:04:31.169> over<00:04:31.440> to<00:04:31.530> a<00:04:31.560> friend's<00:04:31.919> house

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
take the micros over to a friend's house

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:33.529 
take the micros over to a friend's house
and<00:04:32.070> then<00:04:32.280> I'll<00:04:32.400> just<00:04:32.550> bash<00:04:33.030> them<00:04:33.240> around<00:04:33.360> a

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
and then I'll just bash them around a

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.649 
and then I'll just bash them around a
bit<00:04:33.860> and<00:04:34.860> I<00:04:35.310> found<00:04:35.759> that<00:04:35.849> it's<00:04:36.000> really<00:04:36.300> useful

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:36.659 
bit and I found that it's really useful

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:39.379 
bit and I found that it's really useful
having<00:04:37.020> two<00:04:37.409> transmitters<00:04:38.180> because<00:04:39.180> you<00:04:39.270> know

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
having two transmitters because you know

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:45.110 
having two transmitters because you know
one<00:04:39.659> guy<00:04:39.780> can't<00:04:40.050> control<00:04:40.500> both<00:04:40.650> cars<00:04:40.979> and<00:04:44.120> yeah

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
one guy can't control both cars and yeah

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.119 
one guy can't control both cars and yeah
I<00:04:45.150> mean<00:04:45.300> it's<00:04:45.870> actually

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:47.129 
I mean it's actually

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:49.070 
I mean it's actually
my<00:04:47.249> opinion<00:04:47.669> better<00:04:47.969> than<00:04:48.149> the<00:04:48.270> fly<00:04:48.479> sky<00:04:48.689> FS

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
my opinion better than the fly sky FS

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.399 
my opinion better than the fly sky FS
gt2<00:04:49.849> for<00:04:50.849> the<00:04:50.969> sole<00:04:51.569> fact<00:04:51.869> that<00:04:52.080> you<00:04:52.199> know<00:04:52.349> you

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:52.409 
gt2 for the sole fact that you know you

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:57.290 
gt2 for the sole fact that you know you
can<00:04:52.649> attach<00:04:53.069> a<00:04:53.249> lipo<00:04:53.550> battery<00:04:53.879> and<00:04:56.089> there<00:04:57.089> can

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
can attach a lipo battery and there can

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.159 
can attach a lipo battery and there can
also<00:04:57.419> be<00:04:57.689> just<00:04:58.050> four<00:04:58.379> double<00:04:58.679> ace<00:04:58.879> so<00:04:59.879> that<00:05:00.330> by

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
also be just four double ace so that by

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.129 
also be just four double ace so that by
itself<00:05:01.199> is<00:05:01.739> a<00:05:02.179> major<00:05:03.179> plus<00:05:03.539> that's<00:05:03.749> probably

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
itself is a major plus that's probably

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.259 
itself is a major plus that's probably
why<00:05:04.469> I<00:05:04.830> think<00:05:05.249> it's<00:05:05.369> better<00:05:05.580> in<00:05:05.759> plus<00:05:05.969> the

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:06.269 
why I think it's better in plus the

00:05:06.269 --> 00:05:10.249 
why I think it's better in plus the
wheel<00:05:07.159> doesn't<00:05:08.159> have<00:05:08.249> a<00:05:08.279> lot<00:05:08.459> of<00:05:08.489> bounce<00:05:09.259> but

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259 
wheel doesn't have a lot of bounce but

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:12.969 
wheel doesn't have a lot of bounce but
then<00:05:10.469> again<00:05:10.559> the<00:05:11.209> trims<00:05:12.209> and<00:05:12.300> everything

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
then again the trims and everything

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.859 
then again the trims and everything
reversing<00:05:13.979> it's<00:05:14.309> all<00:05:14.550> like<00:05:14.759> the<00:05:14.909> fly<00:05:15.059> sky<00:05:15.330> like

00:05:15.859 --> 00:05:15.869 
reversing it's all like the fly sky like

00:05:15.869 --> 00:05:18.290 
reversing it's all like the fly sky like
everybody's<00:05:16.289> seen<00:05:16.469> the<00:05:16.499> fly<00:05:16.739> sky<00:05:16.979> before<00:05:17.300> and

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
everybody's seen the fly sky before and

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.399 
everybody's seen the fly sky before and
I<00:05:19.199> actually<00:05:19.649> sold<00:05:20.009> my<00:05:20.309> flat<00:05:20.699> sky<00:05:20.939> on<00:05:21.539> eBay

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:22.409 
I actually sold my flat sky on eBay

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:24.469 
I actually sold my flat sky on eBay
because<00:05:22.919> you<00:05:23.159> know<00:05:23.279> this<00:05:23.759> transmitter<00:05:24.419> is

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
because you know this transmitter is

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.469 
because you know this transmitter is
better<00:05:24.659> than<00:05:24.869> the<00:05:25.199> fly<00:05:25.379> sky<00:05:25.619> FS<00:05:25.889> gt2<00:05:26.479> so

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
better than the fly sky FS gt2 so

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:30.229 
better than the fly sky FS gt2 so
