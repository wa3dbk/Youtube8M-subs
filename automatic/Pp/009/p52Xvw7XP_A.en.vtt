00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
using select fire which I think we could

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.880 
using select fire which I think we could
all<00:02:35.610> agree<00:02:35.640> needed<00:02:36.329> need<00:02:36.569> it<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.750> happen<00:02:36.900> the

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
all agree needed need it to happen the

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.850 
all agree needed need it to happen the
mtar<00:02:38.400> was<00:02:38.760> also<00:02:39.150> given<00:02:39.750> increased<00:02:40.200> auto<00:02:40.530> aim

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
mtar was also given increased auto aim

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.740 
mtar was also given increased auto aim
so<00:02:41.519> when<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:41.760> lock<00:02:41.940> on<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.150> target<00:02:42.540> from<00:02:42.599> a

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
so when you lock on a target from a

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.660 
so when you lock on a target from a
distance<00:02:43.140> makes<00:02:43.739> it<00:02:43.860> easier<00:02:44.190> so<00:02:44.370> basically

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
distance makes it easier so basically

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.250 
distance makes it easier so basically

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
rifles more maybe it definitely is a

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.550
