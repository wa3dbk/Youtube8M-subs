there's some wrinkles and then to ein in

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.529 
there's some wrinkles and then to ein in
the<00:05:33.750> direction<00:05:35.030> if<00:05:36.030> the<00:05:36.180> wrinkle<00:05:36.510> goes

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
the direction if the wrinkle goes

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:39.439 
the direction if the wrinkle goes
through<00:05:36.960> this<00:05:37.139> way<00:05:37.380> I<00:05:37.590> will<00:05:38.400> find<00:05:38.910> this<00:05:39.180> way<00:05:39.389> to

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:39.449 
through this way I will find this way to

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:49.930 
through this way I will find this way to
stretch<00:05:39.960> the<00:05:40.199> paper<00:05:40.470> a<00:05:40.800> little<00:05:41.550> bit

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:56.200 

just<00:05:50.940> I<00:05:51.090> have<00:05:51.300> to<00:05:51.330> go<00:05:52.290> very<00:05:52.320> slow<00:05:53.010> firm<00:05:54.260> this

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
just I have to go very slow firm this

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.740 
just I have to go very slow firm this
the<00:05:57.210> iron<00:05:58.310> you<00:05:59.310> see<00:05:59.370> like<00:05:59.640> it<00:05:59.790> brush<00:06:00.150> remember

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
the iron you see like it brush remember

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.220 
the iron you see like it brush remember
i<00:06:00.780> use<00:06:01.290> the<00:06:01.980> brush<00:06:02.310> to<00:06:02.390> get<00:06:03.390> wrinkle<00:06:03.840> up<00:06:03.990> in

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.230 
i use the brush to get wrinkle up in

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:08.810 
i use the brush to get wrinkle up in
this<00:06:04.410> kind<00:06:05.190> of<00:06:05.340> same<00:06:06.800> idea<00:06:07.800> to<00:06:08.160> stretch<00:06:08.580> the

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
this kind of same idea to stretch the

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:14.800 
this kind of same idea to stretch the
paper<00:06:09.380> in<00:06:10.380> the<00:06:10.590> direction<00:06:13.130> vertical<00:06:14.130> to<00:06:14.580> the

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
paper in the direction vertical to the

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.090 
paper in the direction vertical to the
wrinkle<00:06:15.810> direction<00:06:16.230> if<00:06:16.380> the<00:06:16.530> wrinkle<00:06:16.890> is

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 
wrinkle direction if the wrinkle is

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:24.280 
wrinkle direction if the wrinkle is
horizontal<00:06:17.790> you<00:06:17.940> put<00:06:18.770> this<00:06:19.770> way<00:06:21.080> stretch<00:06:22.080> it

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:24.290 
horizontal you put this way stretch it

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.020 
horizontal you put this way stretch it
no<00:06:25.290> root<00:06:25.500> norinco<00:06:26.160> guy<00:06:26.340> there's<00:06:26.610> a<00:06:26.700> little

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.030 
no root norinco guy there's a little

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:36.670 
no root norinco guy there's a little
more<00:06:27.210> you<00:06:28.170> see<00:06:28.410> it<00:06:30.470> ok<00:06:31.470> just<00:06:33.320> stretch

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.780 

horizontal<00:06:37.680> and<00:06:38.070> vertical<00:06:38.930> winkers<00:06:39.930> work<00:06:40.230> on

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:40.790 
horizontal and vertical winkers work on

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:57.570 
horizontal and vertical winkers work on
so<00:06:41.790> i'm<00:06:41.910> going<00:06:42.090> to<00:06:45.620> first

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:57.580 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.659 

that's<00:06:58.580> about<00:06:59.000> it<00:06:59.379> coming<00:07:00.379> to<00:07:00.560> work<00:07:01.219> on<00:07:01.460> some

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:01.669 
that's about it coming to work on some

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:04.809 
that's about it coming to work on some
particular<00:07:01.969> areas<00:07:02.569> to<00:07:03.319> get<00:07:03.500> it<00:07:03.680> Rita<00:07:04.370> all<00:07:04.669> the
