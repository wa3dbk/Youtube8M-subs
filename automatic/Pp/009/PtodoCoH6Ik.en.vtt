00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
through 162 it's got the hybrid camber

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.950 
through 162 it's got the hybrid camber
rocker<00:00:29.920> a<00:00:30.310> little<00:00:30.730> different<00:00:31.330> camber<00:00:31.720> rocker

story than most other boards this one's
got<00:00:34.239> a<00:00:34.899> camber<00:00:35.859> in<00:00:36.129> between<00:00:36.519> the<00:00:36.640> bindings

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
got a camber in between the bindings

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.180 
got a camber in between the bindings
like<00:00:37.329> basically<00:00:37.660> here<00:00:38.019> and<00:00:38.050> here<00:00:38.410> and<00:00:38.499> then

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
like basically here and here and then

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.369 
like basically here and here and then
rocker<00:00:39.579> underneath<00:00:40.300> the<00:00:40.539> bindings<00:00:40.690> here<00:00:41.170> so

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
rocker underneath the bindings here so

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.709 
rocker underneath the bindings here so
it's<00:00:41.559> still<00:00:41.739> got<00:00:41.920> that<00:00:42.190> float<00:00:42.640> overall<00:00:43.539> it's

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:43.719 
it's still got that float overall it's

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.139 
it's still got that float overall it's
still<00:00:43.929> got<00:00:44.050> like<00:00:44.230> a<00:00:44.260> rocker<00:00:44.589> shape<00:00:44.980> to<00:00:45.280> it<00:00:45.309> but

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
still got like a rocker shape to it but

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.599 
still got like a rocker shape to it but
the<00:00:46.809> big<00:00:47.019> the<00:00:47.379> cool<00:00:47.559> thing<00:00:47.800> that<00:00:47.980> the<00:00:48.100> camber

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:48.609 
the big the cool thing that the camber

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:50.819 
the big the cool thing that the camber
puts<00:00:49.300> into<00:00:49.480> the<00:00:49.659> board<00:00:49.899> is<00:00:50.170> just<00:00:50.530> a<00:00:50.649> nice

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
puts into the board is just a nice

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.250 
puts into the board is just a nice
snappy<00:00:51.399> ollie<00:00:51.609> and<00:00:52.019> plenty<00:00:53.019> of<00:00:53.050> edge<00:00:53.230> hold

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
snappy ollie and plenty of edge hold

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.139 
snappy ollie and plenty of edge hold
when<00:00:53.679> you<00:00:53.769> need<00:00:53.949> it<00:00:54.100> because<00:00:54.399> middle<00:00:54.999> of<00:00:55.059> the

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
when you need it because middle of the

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:56.939 
when you need it because middle of the
board<00:00:55.359> wants<00:00:55.719> to<00:00:55.809> put<00:00:56.019> the<00:00:56.170> contact<00:00:56.379> points

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
board wants to put the contact points

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.250 
board wants to put the contact points
down<00:00:57.210> but<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:58.300> rest<00:00:58.479> of<00:00:58.569> the<00:00:58.659> board<00:00:58.870> wants<00:00:59.140> to

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
down but the rest of the board wants to

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.779 
down but the rest of the board wants to
lift<00:00:59.409> them<00:00:59.589> up<00:00:59.710> so<00:00:59.949> it<00:01:00.069> just<00:01:00.249> creates<00:01:00.550> like<00:01:00.760> a

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
lift them up so it just creates like a

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:02.879 
lift them up so it just creates like a
really<00:01:00.999> cool<00:01:01.300> kind<00:01:01.989> of<00:01:02.079> hybrid<00:01:02.229> feeling<00:01:02.800> it

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:02.889 
really cool kind of hybrid feeling it

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:04.619 
really cool kind of hybrid feeling it
really<00:01:03.129> is<00:01:03.249> best<00:01:03.579> of<00:01:03.729> both<00:01:03.879> worlds<00:01:04.300> I<00:01:04.449> can

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
really is best of both worlds I can

speak from experience this is one of my
favorite<00:01:07.180> boards<00:01:07.479> that<00:01:07.600> I<00:01:07.689> rode<00:01:07.930> last<00:01:08.170> year

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
favorite boards that I rode last year

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.969 
favorite boards that I rode last year
got<00:01:09.909> to<00:01:10.060> test<00:01:10.270> it<00:01:10.450> out<00:01:10.540> and<00:01:10.750> is<00:01:10.810> amazing<00:01:11.110> it

another<00:01:21.520> cool<00:01:21.789> thing<00:01:21.820> that<00:01:22.240> this<00:01:22.360> board<00:01:22.659> has

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
another cool thing that this board has

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.080 
another cool thing that this board has
that<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:23.259> other<00:01:23.409> ones<00:01:23.619> don't<00:01:23.890> is<00:01:24.159> the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
that the other ones don't is the

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.770 
that the other ones don't is the
ultimate<00:01:25.659> grip<00:01:26.460> serrated<00:01:27.460> edges<00:01:27.780> so

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
ultimate grip serrated edges so

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.870 
ultimate grip serrated edges so
basically<00:01:29.200> it's<00:01:29.829> hard<00:01:30.039> to<00:01:30.130> see<00:01:30.310> but<00:01:30.610> there's

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
basically it's hard to see but there's

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.270 
basically it's hard to see but there's
really<00:01:31.539> small<00:01:31.990> serrations<00:01:32.770> on<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.100> metal

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
really small serrations on the metal

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.319 
really small serrations on the metal
edge<00:01:33.520> and<00:01:33.820> what<00:01:34.000> that<00:01:34.180> does<00:01:34.479> is<00:01:36.030> just<00:01:37.030> helps

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
edge and what that does is just helps

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.389 
edge and what that does is just helps
the<00:01:37.450> edge<00:01:37.600> bite<00:01:38.020> into<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.469> ice<00:01:38.619> it's<00:01:39.250> like<00:01:39.369> a

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
the edge bite into the ice it's like a

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.700 
the edge bite into the ice it's like a
serrated<00:01:39.880> blade<00:01:40.240> cutting<00:01:40.659> through<00:01:40.899> bread<00:01:41.200> you

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
serrated blade cutting through bread you

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:42.959 
serrated blade cutting through bread you
know<00:01:41.859> that<00:01:42.039> works<00:01:42.219> a<00:01:42.369> lot<00:01:42.490> better<00:01:42.549> than<00:01:42.939> a

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969 
know that works a lot better than a

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.270 
know that works a lot better than a
straight<00:01:43.329> blade<00:01:43.479> so<00:01:44.140> basically<00:01:44.680> whenever<00:01:44.979> you

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
straight blade so basically whenever you

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.669 
straight blade so basically whenever you
get<00:01:45.399> into<00:01:45.670> nasty<00:01:45.880> conditions<00:01:46.210> this<00:01:46.960> just<00:01:47.289> digs

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
get into nasty conditions this just digs

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:49.919 
get into nasty conditions this just digs
in<00:01:47.950> helps<00:01:48.609> the<00:01:48.700> edges<00:01:49.000> bite<00:01:49.179> and<00:01:49.479> gives<00:01:49.719> you

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
in helps the edges bite and gives you

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.020 
in helps the edges bite and gives you
all<00:01:50.170> the<00:01:50.320> edge<00:01:50.439> hold<00:01:50.679> that<00:01:50.859> you<00:01:50.950> need<00:01:51.159> this

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
all the edge hold that you need this

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.539 
all the edge hold that you need this
