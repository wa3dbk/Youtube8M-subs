00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello all of you from this porch 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.810
 video will be some clips 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.300
 dedicated and technical component 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.219
 good photos will talk about 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.679
 camera settings but again you need 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.830
 start pines because many who 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.640
 buys SLR cameras they watch 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.250
 on the instruction they understand that something is there 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.080
 everything is very difficult to put off and take off 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.029
 on auto mode i have of course 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.170
 cruel truth formation I already 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.460
 unlearned human language 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.290
 tell and explain 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.540
 but I will try to start with such concepts as 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.910
 aperture excerpt of a not sure what 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.070
 it will work out in one video for these 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.840
 the basics of running but even if 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.730
 two parts okay i think that 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.260
 such a camera is inherently it 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.940
 dark box on one of the faces 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.590
 which has a hole and on 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.149
 opposite face 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.309
 mounted photosensitive sensor 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.039
 which is called the model between the matrix 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.320
 and the lens that clings to 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.329
 our hole in the box is located 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.649
 shutter actually the lens is 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.809
 optical device 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.130
 roughly speaking the tub in which are located 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:11.159
 certain lenses are also located there 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.799
 the diaphragm is such a circular partition 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.500
 in the form of petals in the chamber which can 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.960
 how to open so out already regulates something 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.360
 how much light our matrix will receive 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.840
 on camera than aperture value 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.580
 less so light-sensitive your 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.860
 the lens will be in such lenses 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.259
 the diaphragm can open up very 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.540
 broadly accordingly it can more 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.900
 light project to the matrix more 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.420
 the lights incorporate into the camera also 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.000
 it is responsible for a very important for the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.740
 very important parameter like the flu is 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.119
 depth of field 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.100
 depicted object object but oh well 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.180
 overall depth of field but i think that 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.420
 all seen before 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.540
 the difference between the portrait that shoot 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.219
 with background blur and portrait 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.009
 which is shot without blurring the background 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.469
 all in sharpness here it is 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.930
 the diaphragm is directly responsible for this 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.940
 the aperture is indicated by the letter f and it 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.569
 usually indicated by numbers on the 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.319
 the lens 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.680
 Well, for example 1.0 1.21 then 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:20.209
 to 41. here's the smallest number is 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:24.450
 the most open and large aperture 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:26.569
 the biggest number is the narrowest and 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.650
 closed diaphragm here such here 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.769
 photographers have this ratio 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.299
 expression will open the tag this is just 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.920
 still belongs to the diaphragm 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.230
 Here I assume that with the film 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.450
 times there is such a mechanical lens 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.959
 chick so the most open diaphragm 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.159
 It looks like this the most closed 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.500
 going back to portrait shooting i 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.120
 almost always take off on the most 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.799
 minimum aperture values 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.159
 that is, if my lens allows 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:56.370
 I will take pictures on 1.8 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:58.739
 taking pictures at 18 is almost always 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.959
 if it is a group portrait a little bit 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.090
 raise the aperture value to all of you 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.519
 turned out in thread mode and because 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.469
 depth of field has its limits that 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.439
 we need to do in order to do 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:13.379
 all sharp raise the aperture value 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:16.530
 raise it by a few stacks that is 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:19.769
 well let's say if we had a lens 18 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.389
 you probably should put 2 and 8 all 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.609
 cases then we need to shoot 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:25.859
 some landscape aperture we 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.900
 naturally we raise even much higher 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.239
 because in the landscape is very often important 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.849
 so that everything is in sharpness foreground 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.549
 and background and background but to 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.379
 It was all the most clear and on this I 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.439
 I say goodbye to you I hope you have been helpful 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:42.180
 you understand what a diaphragm is 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:45.049
 thank you so much for your attention and bye 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.049
 to new meetings
