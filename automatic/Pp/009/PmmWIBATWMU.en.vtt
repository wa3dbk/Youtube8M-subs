the first in a series of videos in which

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.179 
the first in a series of videos in which
we<00:00:06.180> will<00:00:06.270> be<00:00:06.359> looking<00:00:06.629> at<00:00:06.779> algebra<00:00:07.049> first<00:00:08.040> of

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
we will be looking at algebra first of

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.749 
we will be looking at algebra first of
all<00:00:08.630> what<00:00:09.630> exactly<00:00:09.660> is<00:00:10.260> algebra<00:00:10.800> in<00:00:10.920> math<00:00:11.130> well

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
all what exactly is algebra in math well

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:12.830 
all what exactly is algebra in math well
let's<00:00:12.059> start<00:00:12.330> with<00:00:12.480> some<00:00:12.599> very<00:00:12.719> simple

questions

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.660 

two<00:00:19.710> plus<00:00:19.980> what<00:00:20.340> equals<00:00:20.600> seven<00:00:22.340> well<00:00:23.340> many<00:00:23.580> of

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
two plus what equals seven well many of

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.529 
two plus what equals seven well many of
you<00:00:23.789> can<00:00:24.000> already<00:00:24.330> tell<00:00:24.480> that<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.590> five

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
you can already tell that this is five

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.870 
you can already tell that this is five
and<00:00:27.539> what<00:00:27.720> you've<00:00:27.869> just<00:00:27.900> done<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:29.279> algebra<00:00:31.880> you

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
and what you've just done is algebra you

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.900 
and what you've just done is algebra you
have<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.600> answer<00:00:33.989> but<00:00:34.770> you're<00:00:34.950> looking<00:00:35.550> for

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
have the answer but you're looking for

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.190 
have the answer but you're looking for
the<00:00:36.000> question<00:00:36.360> sort<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.469> backwards<00:00:38.989> kind<00:00:39.989> of

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
the question sort of a backwards kind of

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.319 
the question sort of a backwards kind of
work<00:00:40.940> sometimes<00:00:41.940> you're<00:00:42.059> gonna<00:00:42.149> see

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
work sometimes you're gonna see

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.010 
work sometimes you're gonna see
questions<00:00:42.719> written<00:00:42.989> like<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:44.719> put<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> square

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
questions written like this put a square

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.110 
questions written like this put a square
box<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.680> indicate<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.370> number<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:48.000> you

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
box to indicate the number that you

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.610 
box to indicate the number that you
don't<00:00:48.300> know<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.719> then<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.960> can<00:00:49.110> write<00:00:49.440> your

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
don't know and then you can write your

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.189 
don't know and then you can write your
answer<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.010> here<00:00:50.390> but<00:00:51.390> when<00:00:51.539> we<00:00:51.660> really<00:00:52.050> get

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
answer in here but when we really get

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.150 
answer in here but when we really get
into<00:00:52.320> algebra<00:00:53.930> what<00:00:54.930> we<00:00:55.079> use<00:00:55.410> for<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.770> number

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
into algebra what we use for a number

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.660 
into algebra what we use for a number
that<00:00:56.460> we<00:00:56.610> don't<00:00:56.879> know<00:00:57.090> or<00:00:57.469> what<00:00:58.469> sometimes<00:00:59.190> can

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
that we don't know or what sometimes can

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.119 
that we don't know or what sometimes can
be<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.850> number<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.570> will<00:01:00.719> change<00:01:01.320> which<00:01:01.980> we'll

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
be a number that will change which we'll

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.280 
be a number that will change which we'll
learn<00:01:02.280> more<00:01:02.550> about<00:01:02.609> later<00:01:02.910> on<00:01:03.090> we<00:01:03.930> use<00:01:04.080> what's

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
learn more about later on we use what's

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.960 
learn more about later on we use what's
called<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.530> variable<00:01:04.830> something<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.790> either

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
called a variable something the either

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.570 
called a variable something the either
we<00:01:06.150> don't<00:01:06.450> know<00:01:06.720> or<00:01:07.200> something<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.280> can

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
we don't know or something that can

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.440 
we don't know or something that can
change<00:01:10.610> so<00:01:11.610> use<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> symbol<00:01:12.090> for<00:01:12.299> that

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
change so use a symbol for that

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.750 
change so use a symbol for that
mathematicians<00:01:13.380> have<00:01:13.860> agreed<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.580> use

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.289 
for those of you in the United States
you<00:01:29.759> can<00:01:29.790> call<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.240> Z<00:01:30.420> if<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.659> want<00:01:31.909> X<00:01:32.909> Y

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
you can call that a Z if you want X Y

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.399 
you can call that a Z if you want X Y
and<00:01:33.659> Zed<00:01:34.009> those<00:01:35.009> are<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.280> most<00:01:35.430> common<00:01:35.549> ones

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409

couple<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.119> things<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.390> want<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.659> point<00:01:48.720> out<00:01:48.990> to

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
couple of things I want to point out to

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.740 
couple of things I want to point out to
you<00:01:49.170> though<00:01:49.350> you'll<00:01:49.590> notice<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:50.040> X<00:01:50.689> that<00:01:51.689> I

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
you though you'll notice this X that I

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.560 
you though you'll notice this X that I
didn't<00:01:52.079> go<00:01:52.170> like<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:53.240> think<00:01:54.240> for<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.479> moment

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
didn't go like this think for a moment

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.819 
didn't go like this think for a moment
why<00:01:55.320> would<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.070> make<00:01:56.340> my<00:01:56.490> X<00:01:56.700> like<00:01:56.969> this<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:58.590> not

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
why would I make my X like this and not

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.609 
why would I make my X like this and not
like<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.719> by<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.750> way<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:00.960> some<00:02:01.259> people<00:02:01.500> like

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
like this by the way I some people like

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.530 
like this by the way I some people like
to<00:02:01.649> do<00:02:01.799> their<00:02:01.950> their<00:02:02.399> cursive<00:02:02.850> X<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.180> more<00:02:03.329> like

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
to do their their cursive X is more like

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.399 
to do their their cursive X is more like
this<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:04.530> can<00:02:04.680> do<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:04.979> way<00:02:05.100> too

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
this you can do it that way too

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.900 
this you can do it that way too
why<00:02:07.409> don't<00:02:07.619> they<00:02:07.740> want<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:08.069> use<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:08.459> because

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
why don't they want to use this because

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.690 
why don't they want to use this because
this<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:10.170> multiplication<00:02:11.009> symbol<00:02:11.220> and

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
this is the multiplication symbol and

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.730 
this is the multiplication symbol and
it'll<00:02:12.510> be<00:02:12.569> very<00:02:12.900> easy<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.319> get

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
it'll be very easy to get

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.990 
it'll be very easy to get
that<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.220> mixed<00:02:15.150> up<00:02:15.590> so<00:02:16.760> one<00:02:17.760> way<00:02:17.880> or

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
that and that mixed up so one way or
