learned and what I saw dr. Pelt oh we're

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.120 
learned and what I saw dr. Pelt oh we're
standing<00:00:21.810> over<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.310> huge<00:00:23.310> Basin<00:00:23.880> here<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:25.130> up

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
standing over a huge Basin here and up

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.109 
standing over a huge Basin here and up
above<00:00:26.340> us<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:27.769> the<00:00:28.769> eastern<00:00:29.160> glacier<00:00:29.580> where<00:00:30.000> we

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
above us is the eastern glacier where we

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.530 
above us is the eastern glacier where we
spent<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.449> good<00:00:30.570> part<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.019> day<00:00:31.170> today<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:32.540> a

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
spent a good part of the day today and a

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.630 
spent a good part of the day today and a
lot<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:34.020> open<00:00:34.440> space<00:00:34.710> here<00:00:34.739> was<00:00:35.340> once

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
lot of this open space here was once

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.410 
lot of this open space here was once
filled<00:00:35.969> with<00:00:36.420> ice<00:00:36.860> can<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.980> give<00:00:38.160> us<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.489> just

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
filled with ice can you give us a just

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.979 
filled with ice can you give us a just
kind<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.879> concept<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:42.090> just<00:00:42.390> how<00:00:42.540> much<00:00:42.750> ice

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
kind of a concept of just how much ice

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.100 
kind of a concept of just how much ice
was<00:00:43.320> here<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.829> how<00:00:44.190> long<00:00:44.250> ago

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
was here and how long ago

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.590 
was here and how long ago
so<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.289> Basin<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:47.520> really<00:00:47.820> confined<00:00:48.210> by<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
so this Basin is really confined by the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.660 
so this Basin is really confined by the
big<00:00:48.989> dirty<00:00:49.410> ridge<00:00:51.079> skyline<00:00:52.190> but<00:00:53.190> also<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
big dirty ridge skyline but also the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.260 
big dirty ridge skyline but also the
skyline<00:00:54.149> immediately<00:00:54.750> behind<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:56.190> that

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
skyline immediately behind you and that

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.340 
skyline immediately behind you and that
represents<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.390> lateral<00:00:57.750> moraine<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
represents the lateral moraine and the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.240 
represents the lateral moraine and the
glacier<00:00:58.770> building<00:00:59.640> at<00:01:00.320> that<00:01:01.320> level<00:01:01.649> now<00:01:02.070> it

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
glacier building at that level now it

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.450 
glacier building at that level now it
was<00:01:02.570> back<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.989> mid<00:01:04.530> nineteenth<00:01:04.979> century

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
was back in the mid nineteenth century

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.390 
was back in the mid nineteenth century
and<00:01:06.270> even<00:01:06.390> up<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.810> 1880<00:01:07.320> people<00:01:07.799> were

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
and even up to 1880 people were

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.789 
and even up to 1880 people were
commenting<00:01:09.240> how<00:01:09.659> they<00:01:09.840> could<00:01:10.049> climb<00:01:10.619> up

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
commenting how they could climb up

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.770 
commenting how they could climb up
through<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.040> forest<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.670> step<00:01:11.939> right<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.540> to

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
through the forest and step right on to

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.420 
through the forest and step right on to
the<00:01:12.869> Easton<00:01:13.229> glacier<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:15.180> glacier<00:01:15.420> was

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
the Easton glacier so the glacier was

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.490 
the Easton glacier so the glacier was
that<00:01:17.430> much<00:01:17.670> above<00:01:18.060> what<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.900> can<00:01:19.049> see<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.350> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
that much above what you can see is the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.219 
that much above what you can see is the
valley<00:01:19.710> floor<00:01:20.130> now<00:01:20.540> we<00:01:21.540> hiked<00:01:21.750> up<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:21.960> valley

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
valley floor now we hiked up the valley

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.679 
valley floor now we hiked up the valley
floor<00:01:22.560> yesterday<00:01:23.000> and<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.090> can<00:01:24.240> see<00:01:24.479> how

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
floor yesterday and you can see how

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.780 
floor yesterday and you can see how
there's<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.049> big<00:01:25.200> change<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.950> forests<00:01:26.610> of

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
there's a big change in the forests of

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.520 
there's a big change in the forests of
this<00:01:26.970> valley

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
this valley

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.109 
this valley
you've<00:01:28.530> got<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.829> mature<00:01:29.159> forests<00:01:29.700> up<00:01:29.850> above

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
you've got the mature forests up above

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.700 
you've got the mature forests up above
the<00:01:30.240> lateral<00:01:30.450> moraine<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.350> distance

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
the lateral moraine and in the distance

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.249 
the lateral moraine and in the distance
and<00:01:32.640> we<00:01:32.729> got<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.000> prominent<00:01:33.420> knob<00:01:33.750> a

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
and we got this prominent knob a

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.649 
and we got this prominent knob a
prominent<00:01:35.159> knob<00:01:35.310> really<00:01:35.820> came<00:01:36.090> out<00:01:38.659> right

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
prominent knob really came out right

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.100 
prominent knob really came out right
vonda<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.170> 1916<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:42.390> forest<00:01:42.780> was<00:01:42.899> fairly

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
vonda in 1916 and the forest was fairly

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.960 
vonda in 1916 and the forest was fairly
well<00:01:43.350> developed<00:01:43.530> there<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.700> then<00:01:44.850> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
well developed there and then the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.580 
well developed there and then the
glacier<00:01:45.329> retreated<00:01:45.720> up<00:01:45.899> onto<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.290> flat<00:01:46.560> area

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
glacier retreated up onto this flat area

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.420 
glacier retreated up onto this flat area
by<00:01:47.299> the<00:01:48.299> late<00:01:48.479> 20s<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.829> retreated<00:01:50.159> pretty

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
by the late 20s and retreated pretty

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.649 
by the late 20s and retreated pretty
fast<00:01:50.670> up<00:01:50.909> for<00:01:51.090> we<00:01:51.299> were<00:01:51.509> we<00:01:51.960> are<00:01:51.990> by<00:01:52.409> 1935<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.700> as

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
fast up for we were we are by 1935 so as

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.120 
fast up for we were we are by 1935 so as
a<00:01:54.930> lot<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.320> people<00:01:55.409> know<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.860> nineteen

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
a lot of people know the nineteen

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.090 
a lot of people know the nineteen
thirties<00:01:56.159> world<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.939> warm<00:01:57.299> decade<00:01:57.860> so<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.950> base

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
thirties world a warm decade so the base

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.320 
thirties world a warm decade so the base
retreated<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.670> great<00:01:59.850> deal

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
retreated a great deal

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.010 
retreated a great deal
and<00:02:02.200> then<00:02:02.670> retreat<00:02:03.670> continued<00:02:04.210> right<00:02:04.750> up<00:02:04.780> the

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
and then retreat continued right up the

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.800 
and then retreat continued right up the
valley<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:07.570> then<00:02:07.720> in<00:02:07.870> 1944<00:02:08.820> in<00:02:09.820> this<00:02:10.030> area<00:02:10.390> the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
valley and then in 1944 in this area the

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.340 
valley and then in 1944 in this area the
climate<00:02:11.170> got<00:02:11.290> cooler<00:02:11.650> and<00:02:11.800> wetter<00:02:11.950> and<00:02:12.670> by

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
climate got cooler and wetter and by

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.930 
climate got cooler and wetter and by
1949<00:02:14.350> some<00:02:14.800> of<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:14.950> glazes<00:02:15.280> were<00:02:15.400> advancing

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
1949 some of the glazes were advancing

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.340 
1949 some of the glazes were advancing
an<00:02:16.090> Eastern<00:02:16.480> glacier<00:02:16.810> here<00:02:16.990> started

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
an Eastern glacier here started

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.030 
an Eastern glacier here started
advancing<00:02:17.800> in<00:02:17.890> 56<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:20.020> came<00:02:20.350> down<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.830> right

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
advancing in 56 and came down to right

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.280 
advancing in 56 and came down to right
where<00:02:21.220> our<00:02:21.340> tents<00:02:21.610> are<00:02:21.880> just<00:02:22.810> behind<00:02:22.990> our

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
where our tents are just behind our

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.490 
where our tents are just behind our
tents<00:02:23.560> there's<00:02:23.830> a<00:02:24.280> little<00:02:24.760> marine<00:02:25.060> Ridge<00:02:25.500> and

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
tents there's a little marine Ridge and

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.700 
tents there's a little marine Ridge and
that<00:02:28.050> represented<00:02:29.050> where<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.230> glacier<00:02:29.560> was

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
that represented where the glacier was

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.980 
that represented where the glacier was
in<00:02:29.890> 1990<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:31.150> that's<00:02:31.300> what<00:02:31.420> I<00:02:31.480> began<00:02:31.780> my

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
in 1990 and that's what I began my

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.430 
in 1990 and that's what I began my
annual<00:02:32.380> survey<00:02:32.830> so<00:02:33.040> since<00:02:33.310> then<00:02:33.490> I<00:02:33.580> spent

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
annual survey so since then I spent

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.710 
annual survey so since then I spent
three<00:02:35.440> or<00:02:35.470> four<00:02:35.710> days<00:02:35.920> here<00:02:36.190> every<00:02:36.430> year<00:02:36.720> and

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
three or four days here every year and

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.520 
three or four days here every year and
of<00:02:38.410> course<00:02:38.680> now<00:02:38.920> we<00:02:39.820> can<00:02:40.000> see<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.750> very

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
of course now we can see the the very

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.020 
of course now we can see the the very
terminus<00:02:42.070> the<00:02:42.100> glaciers<00:02:42.580> covered<00:02:42.790> by<00:02:43.000> a

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
terminus the glaciers covered by a

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.430 
terminus the glaciers covered by a
little<00:02:43.150> bit<00:02:43.300> of<00:02:43.360> snow<00:02:43.480> but<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.870> blue<00:02:44.020> ice<00:02:44.200> is

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
little bit of snow but the blue ice is

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.520 
little bit of snow but the blue ice is
very<00:02:44.500> close<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.310> end<00:02:45.430> or<00:02:46.020> within<00:02:47.020> five<00:02:47.350> to

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
very close to the end or within five to

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.050 
very close to the end or within five to
ten<00:02:47.710> meters<00:02:48.040> of<00:02:48.070> where<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.520> true<00:02:48.730> end<00:02:48.910> of<00:02:49.000> the

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
ten meters of where the true end of the

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.870 
ten meters of where the true end of the
glacier<00:02:49.210> is<00:02:49.630> and<00:02:50.280> that's<00:02:51.280> a<00:02:51.460> good<00:02:51.610> three

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
glacier is and that's a good three

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.480 
glacier is and that's a good three
hundred<00:02:52.180> meters<00:02:52.480> above<00:02:52.810> camp<00:02:53.320> and<00:02:54.220> where<00:02:54.370> we

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
hundred meters above camp and where we
