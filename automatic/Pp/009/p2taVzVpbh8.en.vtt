definitely two things I'm going to use a
lot<00:02:03.790> now<00:02:04.270> that<00:02:04.510> I<00:02:04.540> actually<00:02:04.750> know<00:02:05.080> those<00:02:05.490> let

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
lot now that I actually know those let

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.800 
lot now that I actually know those let
me<00:02:06.580> see<00:02:06.760> what<00:02:06.910> else<00:02:07.030> I<00:02:07.180> want<00:02:07.330> to<00:02:07.390> talk<00:02:07.480> I<00:02:07.630> got<00:02:07.780> a

little<00:02:07.990> list<00:02:08.230> here<00:02:08.350> because<00:02:08.649> I've<00:02:08.740> not<00:02:09.369> I'm

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
little list here because I've not I'm

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.550 
little list here because I've not I'm
afraid<00:02:09.880> I<00:02:09.910> would<00:02:10.149> forget<00:02:10.690> what<00:02:11.020> I<00:02:11.050> wanted<00:02:11.380> to

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
afraid I would forget what I wanted to

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.940 
afraid I would forget what I wanted to
show<00:02:12.160> you<00:02:12.190> guys<00:02:12.400> so<00:02:12.760> um<00:02:13.030> what<00:02:13.990> was<00:02:14.140> next<00:02:14.320> okay

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
show you guys so um what was next okay

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.580 
show you guys so um what was next okay
this<00:02:15.160> one's<00:02:15.540> not<00:02:16.540> really<00:02:16.990> too<00:02:17.140> big<00:02:17.290> of<00:02:17.380> a<00:02:17.470> deal

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
this one's not really too big of a deal

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.970 
this one's not really too big of a deal
unless<00:02:17.800> your<00:02:18.130> your<00:02:19.140> say<00:02:20.140> your<00:02:20.350> sound<00:02:20.650> is<00:02:20.800> all

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
unless your your say your sound is all

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.540 
unless your your say your sound is all
the<00:02:21.100> way<00:02:21.220> up<00:02:21.510> when<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:22.600> turn<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:23.320> down<00:02:26.490> kind<00:02:27.490> of

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
the way up when you turn it down kind of

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.370 
the way up when you turn it down kind of
loud<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:28.360> can<00:02:28.540> hold<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.930> shift<00:02:29.110> key<00:02:29.260> down

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
loud so you can hold the shift key down

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.920 
loud so you can hold the shift key down
and<00:02:29.620> actually<00:02:30.210> adjust<00:02:31.210> your<00:02:31.330> volume<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:31.840> it

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
and actually adjust your volume and it

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.750 
and actually adjust your volume and it
won't<00:02:32.080> make<00:02:32.230> that<00:02:32.410> really<00:02:32.740> loud<00:02:32.950> like

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
won't make that really loud like

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.400 
won't make that really loud like
confirmation<00:02:34.210> sounded<00:02:34.930> let<00:02:35.020> you<00:02:35.110> know<00:02:35.230> how

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
confirmation sounded let you know how

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.130 
confirmation sounded let you know how
high<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.739> volume<00:02:36.220> is<00:02:36.570> that<00:02:37.570> one's<00:02:37.750> one<00:02:37.959> that

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
high the volume is that one's one that

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.400 
high the volume is that one's one that
probably<00:02:38.290> most<00:02:38.680> people<00:02:38.860> know<00:02:39.160> but<00:02:40.410> option

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
probably most people know but option

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.400 
probably most people know but option
shift<00:02:41.709> actually<00:02:42.520> gives<00:02:42.760> you<00:02:43.000> options<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:44.200> can

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
shift actually gives you options you can

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.220 
shift actually gives you options you can
fine-tune<00:02:45.190> it<00:02:45.730> a<00:02:45.850> little<00:02:46.060> bit<00:02:46.270> better<00:02:46.420> instead

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
fine-tune it a little bit better instead

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.020 
fine-tune it a little bit better instead
of<00:02:47.260> going<00:02:47.470> up<00:02:47.709> a<00:02:47.800> full<00:02:48.040> knock<00:02:48.280> you<00:02:48.580> can<00:02:48.760> do<00:02:48.880> it

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
of going up a full knock you can do it

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.520 
of going up a full knock you can do it
in<00:02:49.150> thirds<00:02:51.239> so<00:02:52.239> it's<00:02:52.780> just<00:02:52.989> a<00:02:53.080> way<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.230> get<00:02:53.410> your

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
in thirds so it's just a way to get your

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.620 
in thirds so it's just a way to get your
audio<00:02:53.860> a<00:02:53.950> little<00:02:54.459> more<00:02:54.610> precise<00:02:55.000> using<00:02:55.510> the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
audio a little more precise using the

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.810 
audio a little more precise using the
keyboard<00:02:55.870> shortcuts<00:02:56.590> as<00:02:56.980> opposed<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:57.550> going

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
keyboard shortcuts as opposed to going

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.420 
keyboard shortcuts as opposed to going
up<00:02:58.060> here<00:02:58.270> and<00:02:58.480> scrolling<00:02:58.840> up<00:02:59.020> and<00:02:59.340> sliding<00:03:00.340> it

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
up here and scrolling up and sliding it

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.759 
up here and scrolling up and sliding it
and<00:03:00.580> doing<00:03:00.760> all<00:03:00.880> that<00:03:01.030> so<00:03:01.330> that's<00:03:02.260> why<00:03:02.470> I<00:03:02.500> don't

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
and doing all that so that's why I don't

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.440 
and doing all that so that's why I don't
really<00:03:02.980> use<00:03:03.130> too<00:03:03.310> much<00:03:03.459> but<00:03:03.850> it<00:03:04.000> was<00:03:04.120> one<00:03:04.300> that

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
really use too much but it was one that

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.810 
really use too much but it was one that
I<00:03:04.570> thought<00:03:05.260> I<00:03:05.560> would<00:03:05.950> probably<00:03:06.130> tell<00:03:06.550> you<00:03:06.580> guys

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
I thought I would probably tell you guys

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.370 
I thought I would probably tell you guys
just<00:03:08.459> um<00:03:09.459> and<00:03:09.820> then<00:03:10.510> this<00:03:10.720> is<00:03:10.900> probably<00:03:11.140> the

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
just um and then this is probably the

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.410 
just um and then this is probably the
one<00:03:11.620> that<00:03:11.860> I<00:03:11.910> like<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:12.940> most<00:03:13.209> you<00:03:14.200> hold<00:03:14.500> down

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
one that I like the most you hold down

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.500 
one that I like the most you hold down
ctrl<00:03:16.420> shift<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:17.530> eject<00:03:18.280> and<00:03:18.519> it<00:03:19.120> shuts<00:03:19.360> your

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
ctrl shift and eject and it shuts your

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.270 
ctrl shift and eject and it shuts your
screen<00:03:19.780> off<00:03:19.930> for<00:03:20.170> some<00:03:20.350> reason<00:03:20.739> even<00:03:20.920> with<00:03:21.160> the

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
screen off for some reason even with the

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.100 
screen off for some reason even with the
hot<00:03:21.459> corners<00:03:21.880> where<00:03:22.090> I<00:03:22.150> go<00:03:22.330> up<00:03:22.420> in<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.930> top

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
hot corners where I go up in the top

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.050 
hot corners where I go up in the top
left<00:03:23.350> corner<00:03:23.590> when<00:03:24.370> I<00:03:24.400> go<00:03:24.550> to<00:03:24.580> bed<00:03:24.760> at<00:03:24.820> night

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
left corner when I go to bed at night

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.780 
left corner when I go to bed at night
and<00:03:25.090> do<00:03:25.269> this<00:03:25.450> for<00:03:26.440> whatever<00:03:26.920> reason<00:03:27.459> it<00:03:27.760> just

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
and do this for whatever reason it just

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.600 
and do this for whatever reason it just
doesn't<00:03:28.660> shut<00:03:29.019> off<00:03:29.260> it<00:03:29.620> just<00:03:29.890> keeps<00:03:30.160> popping

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
doesn't shut off it just keeps popping

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.759 
doesn't shut off it just keeps popping
back<00:03:30.760> on<00:03:30.940> by<00:03:31.120> itself<00:03:31.390> so<00:03:31.660> when<00:03:31.810> I<00:03:31.840> use<00:03:32.080> this<00:03:32.350> the

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
back on by itself so when I use this the

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.650 
back on by itself so when I use this the
keyboard<00:03:32.950> shortcut<00:03:33.190> it<00:03:33.760> keeps<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.360> screen

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
keyboard shortcut it keeps the screen

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.020 
keyboard shortcut it keeps the screen
off<00:03:34.930> so<00:03:35.590> just<00:03:35.739> put<00:03:35.950> your<00:03:36.070> screen<00:03:36.370> to<00:03:36.519> sleep<00:03:36.760> and

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
off so just put your screen to sleep and

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.790 
off so just put your screen to sleep and
you<00:03:37.630> don't<00:03:37.810> worry<00:03:38.050> about<00:03:38.260> accidentally

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
you don't worry about accidentally

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.200 
you don't worry about accidentally
moving<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:39.280> mouse<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:39.490> stuff<00:03:40.000> like<00:03:40.150> that

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.210 
moving the mouse and stuff like that

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.940 
moving the mouse and stuff like that
because<00:03:40.450> I<00:03:40.630> it<00:03:40.990> takes<00:03:41.200> me<00:03:41.350> five<00:03:41.560> minutes<00:03:41.770> to

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
because I it takes me five minutes to

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.760 
because I it takes me five minutes to
get<00:03:42.100> my<00:03:42.160> stupid<00:03:43.150> monitor

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
get my stupid monitor

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.070 
get my stupid monitor
shut<00:03:43.920> off<00:03:43.950> at<00:03:44.250> night<00:03:44.630> because<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:45.870> mouse<00:03:46.050> is

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
shut off at night because the mouse is

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.880 
shut off at night because the mouse is
just<00:03:46.590> so<00:03:46.740> sensitive<00:03:47.130> but<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:49.530> last<00:03:49.680> one<00:03:49.830> I
