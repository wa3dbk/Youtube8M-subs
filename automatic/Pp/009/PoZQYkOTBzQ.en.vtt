the<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.310> low<00:01:17.670> damage<00:01:18.450> multiplier<00:01:18.930> making<00:01:19.439> it

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
the this low damage multiplier making it

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.670 
the this low damage multiplier making it
a<00:01:19.590> two-shot<00:01:20.009> kill<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.909> remain<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:22.470> vain

a two-shot kill to the remain the vain

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.940 
a two-shot kill to the remain the vain
body<00:01:23.009> mass<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:24.030> really<00:01:24.420> becomes<00:01:24.720> more<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
body mass it really becomes more of the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.950 
body mass it really becomes more of the
defensive<00:01:26.549> sniper<00:01:26.820> rifle<00:01:27.270> you're<00:01:27.509> really<00:01:27.840> up

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
defensive sniper rifle you're really up

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.020 
defensive sniper rifle you're really up
chewable<00:01:28.320> being<00:01:28.590> on<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.280> offensive<00:01:29.670> with<00:01:29.729> it

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
chewable being on the offensive with it

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.420 
chewable being on the offensive with it
with<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.329> one<00:01:30.540> like<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:31.320> can<00:01:31.500> kind<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.920> go<00:01:32.340> on

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
with this one like you can kind of go on

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.950 
with this one like you can kind of go on
the<00:01:32.549> offense<00:01:32.759> with<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.000> allied<00:01:33.360> sixes<00:01:33.930> you

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
the offense with the allied sixes you

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.670 
the offense with the allied sixes you
can<00:01:34.140> get<00:01:34.369> one<00:01:35.369> shot<00:01:35.579> kills<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.909> lot<00:01:35.970> more<00:01:36.240> often

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
can get one shot kills a lot more often

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.410 
can get one shot kills a lot more often
so<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:38.009> Dragunov<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.700> definitely<00:01:39.119> one<00:01:39.240> where

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
so the Dragunov is definitely one where

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.899 
so the Dragunov is definitely one where
you<00:01:39.509> need<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.840> sell<00:01:40.590> foot<00:01:40.740> position<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.430> make

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
you need to sell foot position and make

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.429 
you need to sell foot position and make
like<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.150> traditional<00:01:42.689> sniper<00:01:42.960> way<00:01:43.200> just

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
like a traditional sniper way just

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.960 
like a traditional sniper way just
picking<00:01:43.710> people<00:01:43.920> on<00:01:44.130> from<00:01:44.369> afar

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
picking people on from afar

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.910 
picking people on from afar
and<00:01:45.150> I've<00:01:45.900> had<00:01:46.020> quite<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.260> lot<00:01:46.440> of<00:01:46.530> fun<00:01:46.650> with<00:01:46.830> it

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
and I've had quite a lot of fun with it

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.160 
and I've had quite a lot of fun with it
