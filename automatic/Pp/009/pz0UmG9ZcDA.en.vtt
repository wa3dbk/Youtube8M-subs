00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:04.660
 do you hear i drew an order or check 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.000
 I've done better and I'm white some 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.720
 fly on which I won't get to myself 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.250
 ok i'm going to the crash site 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.680
 if we succeed then we can jacket 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.460
 bargain with an agent 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.180
 Well, this is one of my starts. 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:25.479
 most favorite missions 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:31.110
 this mission on the train enters understands 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:34.270
 pacific 101 some kind of freight train 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:38.830
 why is this mission cool because 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:42.790
 we are on the search for moving we 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:46.270
 we will fight on it and by the standards of 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:51.030
 the standards of the games of that time I donâ€™t know 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:53.890
 which letter is super cool in such 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.500
 interactive levels that time would be fights 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.640
 little did I really need 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:07.410
 strongly liked that was not flying he was 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.410
 made for it turns out almost 10 years 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.709
 now the benchmark level on the train wolf cubs 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:18.310
 silent co2 subsequently action stealth 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:23.290
 action from a third party adopted this 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:26.739
 find and detect was paul shoust 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:31.090
 no pandora tomorrow sprinter sat on by 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:33.970
 single stealth when comparing bite with 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:38.190
 modern games who most it 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:42.040
 It seems to rush the Pancha-tattva 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:49.209
 I made a comparison soar recently 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:52.980
 started playing during the tour for the benefit 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:58.690
 was it was just 500 by the way here 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:00.250
 hidden here such periodically possible with 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:07.110
 left or right hand side there is full 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:10.239
 only arrows come down and new fluffs 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.090
 or bulletproof vest and need to gaze 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.549
 and I do not remember eating from the right side 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.100
 but if memory serves me only 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.209
 left 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.230
 all laws must be tried 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:25.870
 try from this level by the way on 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:30.579
 the train is divided into 2 parts and do not know 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:33.070
 why did so but be the 2nd stage 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:37.060
 to the benefit of the next stage it will be by 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.950
 time to answer that we have 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:44.370
 there will be a restriction so approximately 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.370
 same length trimming 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:50.410
 Well, the goal of this mission is not 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.010
 the simplest is just to get to 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.140
 the main car of decades is not so 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.510
 many checkpoints and sometimes I will 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:08.370
 knocking is quite problematic 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:12.930
 problematic areas of two eyes night 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.930
 in that along the way we are what 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:20.670
 by the way i'm here all the core watering times once 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.960
 I water but I want to tell you 1 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:26.190
 nonsense but it is not that silly 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.800
 rather a strange moment 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.110
 it concerns durability and logan if 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.810
 remember the end of the first together and he 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.700
 will jump off there dodging rockets 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.140
 helicopter and survived and somehow 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:42.870
 whale was not clear how we feel better 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:46.660
 return that is milk 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:51.340
 not to pay that moment special attention 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:54.130
 then at the end of the mission on the bridge where the bridge on 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.090
 which he will well just undermined 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.630
 rockets 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:01.390
 there was such a noticeable height and below 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.760
 somewhere a train was passing it landed here 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.010
 I am not quite horses 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.290
 quite a strange moment and that myself what 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.350
 the funniest thing is this salutary 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.490
 jump to gomonov help out more than one 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.030
 times along the way 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:19.590
 under our passage with you 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:24.820
 found then we descend now 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:27.540
 I found even the passing game 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:32.590
 time drew early zero 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:36.010
 really countries but of course if 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:39.280
 did not find fault with the realism you can on 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:42.760
 It generally does not pay attention to me 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.770
 in general, Tunisia adored for the fact that she told me 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.840
 reminded me of one of my favorite 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:51.190
 movies at the time with steven signal 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:55.690
 he was called in siege 2 or for pay and not 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:06:00.610
 knowing we have it on TV channels strange 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:04.660
 title tired in my opinion in the original he 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:09.580
 called siege 2 a cool movie about 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:11.040
 the seizure of train terrorists is one of the most 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:16.000
 cool movies 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:21.640
 which I watched 90 occupation revision 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.710
 need to be revised somehow and not 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.870
 I know I just reminded me of this movie 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:28.590
 because logan also 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.960
 in its appearance is somewhat similar to 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:33.940
 read except that he has 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:38.680
 hair is not long, some seem 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:41.680
 stylish and here it is all well and first 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:44.200
 the stage was wonderful level we passed 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:49.170
 the next stage will be complications 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:49.170
 How to contemplate now cut scenes q
