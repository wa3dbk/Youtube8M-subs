testing out on the flight
I'm<00:04:31.000> actually<00:04:31.120> in<00:04:31.330> the<00:04:31.390> same<00:04:31.570> flight

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
I'm actually in the same flight

connecting flight with Eric Froelich

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.630 
connecting flight with Eric Froelich
and<00:04:35.350> we<00:04:35.500> were<00:04:35.590> talking<00:04:35.710> about<00:04:35.890> making<00:04:36.370> sure

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
and we were talking about making sure

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.100 
and we were talking about making sure
our<00:04:36.670> seats<00:04:37.030> were<00:04:37.120> near<00:04:37.330> each<00:04:37.480> other<00:04:37.570> next<00:04:38.050> to

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
our seats were near each other next to

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.130 
our seats were near each other next to
each<00:04:38.200> other<00:04:38.290> so<00:04:38.680> we<00:04:38.860> can<00:04:38.890> potentially<00:04:39.100> play

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
each other so we can potentially play

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.690 
each other so we can potentially play
shockingly<00:04:41.140> I<00:04:41.320> also<00:04:41.590> like<00:04:41.920> green<00:04:42.250> decks<00:04:42.460> for

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
shockingly I also like green decks for

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.450 
shockingly I also like green decks for
that<00:04:42.820> so<00:04:43.150> far<00:04:43.390> at<00:04:43.630> least<00:04:43.660> theoretically<00:04:44.460> I've

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
that so far at least theoretically I've

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.650 
that so far at least theoretically I've
been<00:04:45.580> talking<00:04:45.790> about<00:04:45.850> articles<00:04:46.300> about<00:04:46.510> how<00:04:46.630> I

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
been talking about articles about how I

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.780 
been talking about articles about how I
think<00:04:46.780> that<00:04:47.260> elvish<00:04:47.620> mystic<00:04:47.800> it's<00:04:48.490> a<00:04:48.550> huge

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
think that elvish mystic it's a huge

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.610 
think that elvish mystic it's a huge
deal<00:04:49.000> for<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:49.240> format<00:04:49.570> the<00:04:50.110> combination<00:04:50.560> of

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
deal for the format the combination of

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.800 
deal for the format the combination of
elvish<00:04:50.920> mystic<00:04:51.040> and<00:04:51.400> Arbor<00:04:51.670> elf<00:04:51.850> lets<00:04:52.660> you

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
elvish mystic and Arbor elf lets you

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.410 
elvish mystic and Arbor elf lets you
play<00:04:53.080> a<00:04:53.470> lot<00:04:53.830> of<00:04:54.070> just<00:04:54.340> you<00:04:54.730> know<00:04:54.820> fast<00:04:55.030> greens

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
play a lot of just you know fast greens

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.840 
play a lot of just you know fast greens
stuff<00:04:55.900> I<00:04:56.440> think<00:04:56.920> scavenge<00:04:57.250> news<00:04:57.400> is<00:04:57.490> awesome

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
stuff I think scavenge news is awesome

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.210 
stuff I think scavenge news is awesome
in<00:04:57.910> that<00:04:58.030> format<00:04:58.330> -<00:04:58.510> I<00:04:59.230> think<00:04:59.590> predator<00:05:00.070> whose

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
in that format - I think predator whose

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.700 
in that format - I think predator whose
might<00:05:00.430> be<00:05:00.550> a<00:05:00.970> time<00:05:01.810> for<00:05:01.840> resurgence<00:05:02.440> of<00:05:02.530> that

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
might be a time for resurgence of that

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.190 
might be a time for resurgence of that
so<00:05:03.400> the<00:05:03.940> deck<00:05:04.060> that<00:05:04.090> I'm<00:05:04.300> I<00:05:04.330> want<00:05:04.840> to<00:05:04.900> try<00:05:05.080> out

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
so the deck that I'm I want to try out

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.690 
so the deck that I'm I want to try out
the<00:05:05.320> most<00:05:05.590> is<00:05:05.860> actually<00:05:05.950> one<00:05:06.490> that<00:05:06.580> I've<00:05:06.670> been

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
the most is actually one that I've been

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.970 
the most is actually one that I've been
