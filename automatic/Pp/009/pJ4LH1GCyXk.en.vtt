00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
even know that fake exists but they

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.100 
even know that fake exists but they
actually<00:00:09.000> do<00:00:11.330> so<00:00:12.330> let's<00:00:12.660> go<00:00:12.809> over<00:00:12.990> the

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
actually do so let's go over the

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.609 
actually do so let's go over the
differences<00:00:14.480> the<00:00:15.480> left<00:00:15.719> pair<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.109> actually

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
differences the left pair is actually

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
fake and the right pair is authentic

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.679 
fake and the right pair is authentic
fake<00:00:19.710> pairs<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.160> size<00:00:20.340> 9<00:00:20.580> real<00:00:20.939> pairs<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.510> size

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
fake pairs of size 9 real pairs of size

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.849 
fake pairs of size 9 real pairs of size
11<00:00:23.570> from<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.660> font<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.109> can<00:00:25.260> easily<00:00:25.470> tell

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
11 from the font you can easily tell

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.439 
11 from the font you can easily tell
that<00:00:26.750> there's<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.810> black<00:00:28.109> spot<00:00:28.439> on<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.740> toe<00:00:28.920> box

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
that there's a black spot on the toe box

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.089 
that there's a black spot on the toe box
and<00:00:30.449> all<00:00:30.570> on<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.019> authentic<00:00:31.439> pair<00:00:31.650> it's

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
and all on the authentic pair it's

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.220 
and all on the authentic pair it's
actually<00:00:32.489> slightly<00:00:33.030> black<00:00:33.450> but<00:00:33.719> primarily

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
actually slightly black but primarily

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:42.830 
actually slightly black but primarily
red<00:00:40.190> from<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.309> side<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.850> authentic<00:00:42.360> pair<00:00:42.570> has

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
red from the side the authentic pair has

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.479 
red from the side the authentic pair has
a<00:00:42.870> solid<00:00:43.500> black<00:00:43.710> swoosh<00:00:45.559> fake<00:00:46.559> pair<00:00:46.860> has<00:00:47.250> some

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
a solid black swoosh fake pair has some

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.520 
a solid black swoosh fake pair has some
specks<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:48.000> swoosh<00:00:48.920> both<00:00:49.920> pairs<00:00:50.250> are<00:00:50.460> unpadded

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
specks in swoosh both pairs are unpadded

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.529 
specks in swoosh both pairs are unpadded
honestly<00:00:52.530> they're<00:00:52.800> pretty<00:00:53.039> similar<00:00:53.309> if<00:00:54.300> you

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
honestly they're pretty similar if you

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.150 
honestly they're pretty similar if you
didn't<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.930> right<00:00:55.140> pair<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.530> compare<00:00:55.890> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
didn't have a right pair to compare the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.889 
didn't have a right pair to compare the
fake<00:00:56.520> with<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.969> wouldn't<00:00:57.270> even<00:00:57.360> really<00:00:57.660> know

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
fake with you wouldn't even really know

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.040 
fake with you wouldn't even really know
that<00:00:58.170> they're<00:00:58.320> fake<00:00:59.270> bottoms<00:01:00.270> are<00:01:00.449> pretty

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
that they're fake bottoms are pretty

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:12.380 
that they're fake bottoms are pretty
identical

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.000 

one<00:01:13.390> of<00:01:13.480> the<00:01:13.570> other<00:01:13.720> differences<00:01:13.960> is<00:01:14.410> that<00:01:14.440> the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
one of the other differences is that the

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.270 
one of the other differences is that the
laces<00:01:15.400> on<00:01:15.550> the<00:01:15.640> real<00:01:15.820> pair<00:01:16.030> are<00:01:16.210> actually

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
laces on the real pair are actually

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:25.830 
laces on the real pair are actually
fake<00:01:18.280> pair<00:01:18.580> it<00:01:18.760> seems<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.180> be<00:01:19.300> gray<00:01:24.690> from<00:01:25.690> the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
fake pair it seems to be gray from the

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.590 
fake pair it seems to be gray from the
back<00:01:26.020> they're<00:01:26.290> pretty<00:01:26.500> much<00:01:26.650> identical

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
back they're pretty much identical

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.790 
back they're pretty much identical
another<00:01:28.600> one<00:01:28.810> of<00:01:28.900> the<00:01:28.960> differences<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.560> red

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
another one of the differences the red

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:49.889 
another one of the differences the red
is<00:01:30.010> slightly<00:01:30.460> brighter<00:01:30.850> on<00:01:31.150> the<00:01:31.180> real<00:01:31.450> pair

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.810 

so<00:01:50.469> there's<00:01:50.679> not<00:01:50.799> that<00:01:50.859> many<00:01:51.100> fake<00:01:51.399> pairs<00:01:51.640> out

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
so there's not that many fake pairs out

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.340 
so there's not that many fake pairs out
there<00:01:52.030> but<00:01:52.329> you<00:01:52.659> just<00:01:52.780> got<00:01:52.960> to<00:01:52.990> be<00:01:53.109> careful

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
there but you just got to be careful

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:09.169 
there but you just got to be careful
main<00:01:54.039> way<00:01:54.219> to<00:01:54.250> spot<00:01:54.700> it<00:01:54.909> is<00:01:55.119> the<00:01:55.420> toe<00:01:55.600> box

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.070 

again<00:02:10.039> authentic<00:02:11.039> pair<00:02:11.220> right<00:02:11.370> there<00:02:12.080> take
