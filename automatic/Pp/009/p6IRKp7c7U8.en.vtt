down this baby slides right into it

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.650 
down this baby slides right into it
perfectly<00:00:56.809> so<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:58.079> found<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.620> way<00:00:58.649> around<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:59.250> but

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
perfectly so I found a way around it but

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.150 
perfectly so I found a way around it but
this<00:01:00.660> thing<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.379> awesome

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
this thing is awesome

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.759 
this thing is awesome
it's<00:01:02.910> not<00:01:03.210> necessarily<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.899> survival<00:01:04.379> final<00:01:04.650> if

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
it's not necessarily a survival final if

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.380 
it's not necessarily a survival final if
you<00:01:04.830> wanna<00:01:05.100> boil<00:01:05.369> water<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.240> whatever

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
you wanna boil water in it and whatever

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.020 
you wanna boil water in it and whatever
is<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.320> double<00:01:07.710> old<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.760> think<00:01:08.939> they

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
is it is double old and I think they

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.429 
is it is double old and I think they
suggest<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.510> don't<00:01:09.600> even<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.260> don't

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
suggest you don't even that you don't

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.760 
suggest you don't even that you don't
put<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.799> fire<00:01:11.010> but<00:01:12.110> I've<00:01:13.110> had<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> firm<00:01:13.560> I
