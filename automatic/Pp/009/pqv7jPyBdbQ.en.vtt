 i 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.049
 hello how welcome are you to the channel 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.599
 luisa craft by luisa paper's blog 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.220
 cuts and from the first video where I 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.529
 I would like to explain to you the system of 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.110
 measurement in inches since most 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.939
 of my work are in this measure the 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.580
 inches are marked by their 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.200
 number one inch 2 inches 3 inches 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.480
 in the middle of what are the inches 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.399
 comes a slightly longer line 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.610
 that is being half an inch 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:43.370
 we count an inch one 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.370
 inch and a half two inches and so 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.860
 between the inch and a half flea 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.160
 we have what the rooms are 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.400
 the kilo 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:59.540
 I have it marked if it can be appreciated 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.840
 with a white acrylic paint spot 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.300
 because because it's done for me 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.820
 makes it easier to identify because it is 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.280
 of a size that the eighths 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.690
 so I decided to put a little dot 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:17.700
 make it easier for me 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:20.579
 we here have an inch 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.909
 1 inch and a quarter an inch and 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:26.060
 half an inch three quarters and two 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.290
 inches 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.390
 now in the middle of the inch and the test 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.470
 of a quarter we have the eighths that 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:40.360
 this is another line here 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:43.630
 when measuring we count a 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.450
 inch an inch and an eighth an 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.980
 inch and a quarter an inch three 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:54.970
 eighths an inch and a half an inch 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:02:00.840
 and five eighths an inch three quarters 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.840
 one inch seven eighths and two inches 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.110
 good and the youngest was being 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.600
 the sixteenth prisoners do not use them 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.720
 a lot then 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.580
 we would spend those 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.280
 usually what they are in the 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.150
 measurements I use more what are the 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.940
 inches in whole 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.270
 in the half inch 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.060
 the quarters of an inch very rarely 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.790
 he used the eighth and the sixteenth 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:35.130
 I almost do not have two cards 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.130
 these two cards are letter size 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:44.480
 his measures comes being eight and a half 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.480
 wide by 11 of the hoop 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.150
 what I'm going to do is that I'm going to 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.250
 divide into 2 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.870
 then I will do what is being 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.360
 the line 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.459
 to what are four and a quarter of 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.209
 inch since it's being half of 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.209
 eight and a half 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.330
 and the buoy 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.330
 cut out in a way 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.610
 the other carton will divide it from 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.730
 its 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:28.030
 in a horizontal way what has been 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:31.860
 the 11 inches I'm going to divide it to 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.860
 that is 5 and a half inches 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.220
 if they set decade 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:49.010
 of each card sheet also 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.010
 letters leaves for 22 cards 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.879
 Now what I'm going to do is double 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.879
 half 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:14.069
 although these are what the measure is 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:16.859
 standard of our base cards 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:19.389
 which is four and a quarter times 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.609
 five and a half 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.840
 same on this side 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:27.630
 4 and 1 4% and I've seen 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:32.330
 just that it changes a bit here 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.330
 structure of the base of the agents 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:39.750
 well I hope you have served them this 

00:04:36.489 --> 00:04:42.900
 mini introduction to what is 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.420
 this craft struggle channel and see you in 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.990
 the next video already with a project of 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.990
 card
