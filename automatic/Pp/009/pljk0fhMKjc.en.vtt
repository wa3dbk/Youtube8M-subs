00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.650
 good morning to the friends of auto moto.it mi 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.360
 I call Federica deledda and I am the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.800
 manager of the traffic police section 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.020
 of cremona 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.090
 we are here today to present you a new one 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.189
 road safety heading 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.199
 we will take you on the roads with us for 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.260
 show me the most dangerous behaviors 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.279
 to the guide and to give you advice on how 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.279
 travel safely 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.710
 This third lane hands machine 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:48.620
 despite having two other free lanes 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.620
 on the right you decide to move 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.390
 why 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:57.329
 yes i would say he needs a check 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.420
 and we can't explain 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.530
 I have to see myself 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.530
 the strange aventine 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.859
 we are not close to the service area 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.380
 so we can stop them and insecurity 

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:15.979
 for 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.979
 orlandi 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.860
 the sea that is reflux 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.530
 45 really a 6 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.170
 we are near the area of 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.299
 service in the direction of Brescia 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.409
 we carry out the control held during 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.409
 people on board 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.900
 good morning we proceed to a check 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.320
 please give me the license and the card 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.320
 of circulation 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.830
 we stopped it because it looked like it 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.759
 strange that he kept marching on 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.190
 third lane 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.890
 she knows that on the highway when she has one 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:00.509
 free lane to the right must hold the 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.509
 clearest lane to the right 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:16.630
 45 verona 543 and therefore this is one 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.360
 very frequent maneuver a car that 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.390
 travels in the fast lane he has paraded 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.620
 on the right this other one traveling in 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.640
 third lane 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.410
 in reality it is not a 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.960
 misconduct is not a 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.820
 overtaking 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.560
 and the behavior of 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.830
 this car is engaging 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.230
 the third lane despite having one 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.349
 in fact I would say two more to live on his 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.349
 right 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.070
 attention to this maneuver 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.050
 very dangerous has made a 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.550
 absolutely risky overtaking 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.530
 moving to the right lane 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.530
 this machine must be checked
