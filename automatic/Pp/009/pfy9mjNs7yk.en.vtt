hi<00:00:04.470> guys<00:00:04.770> it's<00:00:05.220> me<00:00:05.310> Brennan<00:00:05.880> and<00:00:06.180> Marissa<00:00:06.810> and

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
hi guys it's me Brennan and Marissa and

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.499 
hi guys it's me Brennan and Marissa and
today<00:00:07.890> we're<00:00:08.189> going<00:00:08.370> to<00:00:08.580> be<00:00:08.700> drawing<00:00:09.030> alum

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:09.509 
today we're going to be drawing alum

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:14.390 
today we're going to be drawing alum
crystals<00:00:10.249> this<00:00:11.249> is<00:00:11.400> what<00:00:12.410> you<00:00:13.410> will<00:00:13.650> need<00:00:13.889> Aloe

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
crystals this is what you will need Aloe

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.839 
crystals this is what you will need Aloe
you<00:00:15.389> can<00:00:15.599> find<00:00:15.809> this<00:00:15.990> at<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.470> grocery<00:00:17.130> store<00:00:17.340> in

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:17.849 
you can find this at a grocery store in

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:23.140 
you can find this at a grocery store in
the<00:00:17.880> spice<00:00:18.300> section<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:19.519> glass<00:00:20.519> jar<00:00:21.090> or<00:00:21.509> cup<00:00:21.900> and

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
the spice section a glass jar or cup and

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.300 
the spice section a glass jar or cup and
top<00:00:24.150> boiling<00:00:24.750> water

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.339 

so<00:00:29.310> we're<00:00:30.029> pouring<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.839> hot<00:00:31.050> boiling

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
so we're pouring in the hot boiling

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:43.860 
so we're pouring in the hot boiling
water<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.250> glass<00:00:32.460> door

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:56.060 

now<00:00:44.870> we're<00:00:45.530> going<00:00:45.679> to<00:00:45.769> pour<00:00:46.039> the<00:00:46.250> element

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.319 

I'm<00:00:57.070> sterile<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:59.530> stir<00:00:59.829> until<00:01:00.010> it<00:01:00.550> dissolves

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
I'm sterile and stir until it dissolves

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.649 
I'm sterile and stir until it dissolves
and<00:01:01.540> when<00:01:02.110> it<00:01:02.260> dissolves<00:01:02.590> add<00:01:03.100> more<00:01:03.879> until<00:01:04.390> it

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
and when it dissolves add more until it

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:17.609 
and when it dissolves add more until it
stops<00:01:05.229> dissolving<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:16.600> these<00:01:17.200> are<00:01:17.409> see

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
stops dissolving so these are see

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.700 
stops dissolving so these are see
crystals<00:01:18.159> we<00:01:18.940> threw<00:01:19.180> them<00:01:19.360> from<00:01:19.780> our<00:01:20.020> previous

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
crystals we threw them from our previous

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.100 
crystals we threw them from our previous
experiment<00:01:21.369> and<00:01:21.970> this<00:01:22.540> is<00:01:22.659> the<00:01:22.750> one<00:01:22.900> we're

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
experiment and this is the one we're

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.090 
experiment and this is the one we're
gonna<00:01:23.259> be<00:01:23.530> using<00:01:23.740> so<00:01:24.130> we<00:01:24.280> tie<00:01:24.490> a<00:01:24.520> string<00:01:25.150> to<00:01:25.210> it

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.430 

we<00:01:30.100> put<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.369> seed<00:01:30.970> crystal<00:01:31.240> on<00:01:31.690> the<00:01:31.810> string<00:01:32.170> in

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
we put the seed crystal on the string in

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.550 
we put the seed crystal on the string in
the<00:01:32.680> supersaturated<00:01:33.450> solution<00:01:34.450> and<00:01:35.229> now

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
the supersaturated solution and now

00:01:35.560 --> 00:02:07.219 
the supersaturated solution and now
we're<00:01:35.890> gonna<00:01:36.070> watch

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.529 

this<00:02:08.229> is<00:02:08.410> our<00:02:08.560> seed<00:02:08.830> crystal<00:02:09.310> and<00:02:09.610> it<00:02:10.330> is

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
this is our seed crystal and it is

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:33.320 
this is our seed crystal and it is
really<00:02:11.260> big<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.280> it's<00:02:13.150> been<00:02:13.420> four<00:02:13.780> hours

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.250 

this<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:34.200> our<00:02:34.400> seed<00:02:35.400> crystal<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.270> it<00:02:36.360> grew<00:02:36.630> and

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
this is our seed crystal and it grew and

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:52.630 
this is our seed crystal and it grew and
it's<00:02:37.860> really<00:02:38.100> pretty<00:02:40.100> looks<00:02:41.100> like<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.310> time

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.960 

these<00:02:53.640> are<00:02:53.820> some<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.210> crystals<00:02:54.660> you<00:02:54.810> made

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
these are some of the crystals you made

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.510 
these are some of the crystals you made
thanks<00:02:56.970> for<00:02:57.090> watching<00:02:57.890> don't<00:02:58.890> forget<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.190> rate
