00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.470
 I love the night but at night nothing is visible 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.609
 so let's just come on 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.369
 fine fine gentlemen so mean here 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.099
 this is our drink 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.070
 Croft drinks machine from he 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.120
 as follows inexpensive in principle 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.600
 there is nothing here dear and here it is 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.149
 food machine with crackers 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.600
 chopsi chips komi other sorts 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.420
 pieces 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.590
 Kravtz he like so almost the same but with 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.520
 dyes and cheaper dyes cheaper 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.340
 it's just flowers 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.230
 here but unfortunately we are nothing of them 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.609
 we can not get as much as we would not like me 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.940
 value itself come on until we have 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:06.080
 money and we included music I do not 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.030
 I understand why they understand why here 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:13.650
 music no money money 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.299
 crafting with help means this is how 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.590
 would be iron money and they have value 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:22.979
 low their low value is not lower than 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:27.810
 they are painted gold from four iron 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.600
 ingots of 10 pieces 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.740
 gold coins have much value 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.680
 much higher 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.119
 and they seem out of gold bullion for sure 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:43.020
 just like from iron means take in 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:48.479
 hands iron coins and turn off the game 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:51.409
 mod I pressed the wrong button we are all without gay 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.159
 mods as you see and let's start with 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.649
 food meal 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.380
 we start buying everything we buy 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.990
 the choice is very literally flies exactly 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:08.250
 in front there is a video about ap chocolate 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.720
 what's that gum about candy about chocolate 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.970

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.320
 about lollipop up 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.330
 what kind of sasisa are i 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.700
 I understand that this is well then sweets should 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.570
 to be that's why the sausage was taken away 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:29.280
 this is some kind of crap that this jelly dome is not 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:31.890
 I know so there are chocolates everything is so 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.740
 overall it's a bunch of food in fact they 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.650
 differ from each other only in that 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.950
 She as if they throw such here 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.280
 effects and speed and jumping ability and 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:48.110
 they all cover the same objects 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:53.630
 speed jumping ability speed jumping ability 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:56.459
 speed jumping ability speed jumping ability 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:00.540
 speed jump ability well you understood me yes 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:03.480
 that is, here we are all fixed remember 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.370
 recorded went further and you try 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.520
 use gold money here's how 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.650
 see on them is designated and the number 5 she 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.740
 iron number one this value then 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.989
 there are gold five times more valuable 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:22.650
 than iron so they are cooler 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:25.290
 click gold coins over this 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.160
 about the food and we do not get anything 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.310
 well it 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.459
 it is understandable because yes how would such 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.930
 there is no food well such as some noob in 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.090
 fashion at least not the other way 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.450
 food and there is only usually these all 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.350
 chocolate candy all that means 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.910
 now come to the machine with 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.840
 carbonated drinks and begin 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:52.560
 buy everything 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:55.620
 what can we mean we fall here 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.890
 all the same club soda ordinary soda 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:03.870
 we drink a little water like that 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:07.049
 we just throw ourselves in riga 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.810
 how we gorge so let's say remove the feeling 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:12.660
 hunger here as if everything is clear but 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.000
 now we can use gold 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.680
 our coins are the most 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.609
 valuable 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:23.560
 try coca cola 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:26.620
 glad it was like how about well how would I 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.090
 I won't hold you long here because 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.840
 that there are only 3 news I will not 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:34.960
 jump a lot just three kinds of here michael 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:39.069
 whitehall here each of these drinks 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:42.580

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:44.830
 properties yes here we drink the Mongols and we 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:48.580
 speed 2 speed 2 and all 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.169
 we quickly run as much as 50 seconds 50 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.659
 seconds speed i will tell you 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.879
 not too expensive 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:57.310
 headquarters here speak very hemorrhagic legs 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:05:01.000
 as you know, the potion is not just brewed 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:04.810
 But if you put brightened up 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.210
 myself here is such a machine and and did 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.029
 imagine a few gold coins with that 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.800
 five drops immediately 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:15.759
 profitable much more profitable than cooking 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.240
 more rarely in the red cow well red 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:18.639
 bull 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.729
 it is rare and this analogy but just to 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:25.990
 copyright not clear 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:29.259
 up the volume and we have this 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.400
 Here is such a jumping ability 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:33.909
 know jumping gives 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.960
 hopping we we jump and everything is cool u 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:38.349
 we are jumping 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.820
 ok go ahead probably need 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:44.100

 drink on a long-awaited and knocked on the Russian Federation 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.230
 we have nothing but we have 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.160
 written clement effect and david it 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:04.560
 mean we can climb walls 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:07.710
 such things people climb the walls right 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:12.060

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.460
 insects 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:24.930
 so this skill is developed 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:26.910
 sticky here 30 seconds later we flew off 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.170
