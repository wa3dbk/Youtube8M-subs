00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.649
 m 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.280
 all right 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.280
 yes 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.250
 welcome to this third video today 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.050
 sebastián salinas I thank you for all 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.880
 the comments in the previous video 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.980
 If you did not see it yet, I recommend that you 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.080
 you see just like the first video of no 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.000
 miss this next Saturday it 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.640
 will be opening the quotas so that 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.490
 participate in this speed course in 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.710
 six weeks this is an effective program 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.870
 and entertaining where you will learn the 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.320
 different playing techniques so 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.620
 fast using alternet picking swift 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.100
 picking tapping strings peeping 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.450
 pedal note sequences and many more 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.560
 You can even develop your own 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.060
 ideas for your solos and compositions 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.880
 I want to tell you that this is not a course 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.490
 of boring exercises and routines 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.710
 fingering you're used to 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.619
 in this program you will see exercises 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.210
 fun with a musical sense and that 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.520
 You can include in your solos 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.200
 quickly today we're going to see the technique 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.810
 tapping is a technique that consists of 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.210
 in percussing with the right hand or 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.890
 left if you are left handed on the ropes 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.220
 what results 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:14.140
 simple and sounds virtuous 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.140
 and visually also striking 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:33.200
 ok let's see the tapping technique 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:36.530
 which is to strike a note 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.930
 of the fingerboard with the right hand you can 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.330
 using the index or middle finger you 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.230
 I recommend using the middle finger so I can 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.390
 hold the pick 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.269
 if I need to use it in the next 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.319
 passage well the tapping technique 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:53.360
 consists as we said percutir 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.450
 a fret with the right hand 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:01.030
 for example this exercise is going to start 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.030
 tapping on the fret 17 the note 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.750
 but obviously we are going to have tight 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:11.230
 the 8th fret of the first string 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.700
 we were going to do zapping 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.180
 we have to climb the rope a little 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.180
 down 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.840
 it's not just touching and lifting because 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.610
 it's not going to sound completely touching and 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.280
 make a small pull of rope towards 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.440
 down 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.120
 that the trust note sounds good and 8 that 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.120
 we have previously pressed 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.190
 well we tap 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.590
 18 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.050
 and we are going to do after a hammer on 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.680
 bound ascending before pasteur the 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.680
 fret 10 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:56.370
 up there you go 17 tapping 8 and 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.750
 and now we're going to do from the 10 a 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.750
 tied to the fret 12 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.400
 and this would be the idea 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.990
 this is going to be the idea that we are going to 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.400
 move throughout the entire 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.019
 exercise 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.639
 it is important that the practice is 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.770
 slowly memorize each of the 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:27.539
 movements that would be mechanics 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:30.949
 tapping pu lof hammer and hummer tapping 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.949
 kulov hammer hammer 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.760
 well this would be the first figure that 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:41.520
 let's do four times 17 8 10 12 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:47.840
 the rhythmic figure is semicorcheas 4 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.840
 pulse notes with 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:54.440
 four times we go to the next compass 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.600
 we are going to zap now on the 15th 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.160
 note sun 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.340
 obviously we are going to have tight the 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:05.889
 fret 7 the note well 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.889
 15 7 8 and 10 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.420
 ok now let's tap on the 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.110
 fret 13 and the note f 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.110
 from the first agreement 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:23.570
 pu lof up to 5 7 and 8 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.570
 13 57 and others 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.970
 four times also and the last measure 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:32.449
 or are we going to zap on the 12th fret? 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:39.729
 min 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:39.729
 4 5 and 7 12 4 5 and 7 also four times 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:46.110
 well and the last note is going to be a note 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:48.639
 of the fret 5 that we are going to do with the 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.849
 right hand 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:53.069
 télam 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:55.729
 slowly all the tapping exercise 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:55.729
 it would be like this 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.690
 well I hope you liked this 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.940
