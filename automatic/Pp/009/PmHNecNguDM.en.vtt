00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.809 

so<00:00:01.290> here<00:00:01.530> the<00:00:01.770> MTF<00:00:02.870> 2011<00:00:03.870> at<00:00:04.549> genesee<00:00:05.549> you<00:00:05.759> are

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
so here the MTF 2011 at genesee you are

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.379 
so here the MTF 2011 at genesee you are
launching<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.629> new<00:00:07.080> board<00:00:07.620> with<00:00:07.890> amex<00:00:08.280> 53<00:00:08.910> yes

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
launching a new board with amex 53 yes

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.200 
launching a new board with amex 53 yes
so<00:00:10.170> what's<00:00:10.320> new<00:00:10.469> with<00:00:10.650> this<00:00:10.849> well<00:00:11.849> for<00:00:12.059> one

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
so what's new with this well for one

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.959 
so what's new with this well for one
size<00:00:12.540> this<00:00:12.929> is<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.200> old<00:00:13.320> 51<00:00:13.889> for<00:00:14.160> this<00:00:14.700> is<00:00:14.849> the

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
size this is the old 51 for this is the

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.890 
size this is the old 51 for this is the
53<00:00:15.480> board<00:00:15.750> so<00:00:16.170> you<00:00:16.230> can<00:00:16.379> see<00:00:16.590> its<00:00:17.580> third<00:00:18.359> maybe

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
53 board so you can see its third maybe

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.830 
53 board so you can see its third maybe
in<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.199> fourth<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.770> size<00:00:20.010> we<00:00:20.840> integrated

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
in the fourth of the size we integrated

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.650 
in the fourth of the size we integrated
everything<00:00:22.320> very<00:00:22.529> very<00:00:22.769> much<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.760> at<00:00:24.570> the

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
everything very very much and at the

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.000 
everything very very much and at the
same<00:00:24.810> time<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.199> reason<00:00:25.439> for<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.769> to

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
same time the reason for that is to

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.700 
same time the reason for that is to
reduce<00:00:26.130> costs<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.689> actually<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.320> PCP

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
reduce costs so this is actually the PCP

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.700 
reduce costs so this is actually the PCP
of<00:00:28.800> an<00:00:28.890> entire<00:00:29.130> netbook<00:00:30.380> everything<00:00:31.380> runs

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
of an entire netbook everything runs

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.889 
of an entire netbook everything runs
here<00:00:31.980> yes<00:00:32.399> before<00:00:33.149> did<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.360> have<00:00:33.540> stuff<00:00:33.780> on

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
here yes before did you have stuff on

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.500 
here yes before did you have stuff on
both<00:00:33.960> sides<00:00:34.350> or<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.800> as<00:00:34.920> yours<00:00:35.370> yes<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.300> it's

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
both sides or is it as yours yes so it's

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.600 
both sides or is it as yours yes so it's
also<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.050> complexity<00:00:37.829> has<00:00:37.950> been<00:00:38.160> decreased

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
also the complexity has been decreased

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.450 
also the complexity has been decreased
in<00:00:38.850> order<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.180> minimize<00:00:39.750> costs<00:00:40.190> you<00:00:41.190> have<00:00:41.309> to

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
in order to minimize costs you have to

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.790 
in order to minimize costs you have to
remember<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.910> we're<00:00:42.180> targeting<00:00:42.800> developing

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
remember that we're targeting developing

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.209 
remember that we're targeting developing
countries<00:00:44.160> with<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:45.800> although<00:00:46.800> they<00:00:47.070> will

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
countries with this although they will

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.160 
countries with this although they will
be<00:00:47.340> available<00:00:47.579> for<00:00:47.820> example<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.899> States

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
be available for example in the States

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.830 
be available for example in the States
and<00:00:49.350> Europe<00:00:49.620> as<00:00:49.770> well<00:00:50.120> but<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.210> main<00:00:51.390> target

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
and Europe as well but the main target

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.389 
and Europe as well but the main target
is<00:00:51.930> developing<00:00:52.379> countries<00:00:52.770> we<00:00:53.010> have<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.280> get

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
is developing countries we have to get

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.340 
is developing countries we have to get
the<00:00:53.520> costs<00:00:53.879> as<00:00:53.969> well<00:00:54.059> as<00:00:54.239> possible<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:55.199> that's

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
the costs as well as possible so that's

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.900 
the costs as well as possible so that's
what<00:00:55.469> we<00:00:55.590> try<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.770> do<00:00:55.949> with<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.160> board<00:00:56.430> I'm

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
what we try to do with this board I'm

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.400 
what we try to do with this board I'm
pretty<00:00:57.239> sure<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.690> there's<00:00:57.840> no<00:00:58.020> cheaper

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
pretty sure that there's no cheaper

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.319 
pretty sure that there's no cheaper
version<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:58.980> one<00:00:59.219> anyway<00:00:59.460> so<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:00.270> is

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
version and this one anyway so this is

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.540 
version and this one anyway so this is
GS<00:01:00.960> as<00:01:01.230> cheap<00:01:01.469> as<00:01:01.590> we<00:01:01.710> can<00:01:01.859> possibly<00:01:01.890> make<00:01:02.370> it

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
GS as cheap as we can possibly make it

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.080 
GS as cheap as we can possibly make it
the<00:01:03.510> cheapest<00:01:03.899> I'm<00:01:04.110> x53<00:01:04.830> baseboard<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:05.909> the

the cheapest I'm x53 baseboard in the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.710 
the cheapest I'm x53 baseboard in the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
is it going to be targets we don't have

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.210 
is it going to be targets we don't have
any<00:01:30.689> official<00:01:30.930> targets<00:01:31.380> yet<00:01:31.530> they'll<00:01:32.189> be

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
any official targets yet they'll be

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.670 
any official targets yet they'll be

one<00:04:03.100> right<00:04:03.400> you<00:04:03.700> also<00:04:03.820> have<00:04:04.090> a<00:04:04.120> higher<00:04:04.300> clock

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
one right you also have a higher clock

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.440 
one right you also have a higher clock
frequency<00:04:05.500> at<00:04:05.980> least<00:04:06.220> one<00:04:06.459> gr<00:04:06.790> are<00:04:06.940> you<00:04:07.239> up<00:04:07.330> to

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
frequency at least one gr are you up to

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.370 
frequency at least one gr are you up to
1.2<00:04:07.870> gigahertz<00:04:08.200> in<00:04:08.980> certain<00:04:09.340> applications

1.2 gigahertz in certain applications

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.830 
1.2 gigahertz in certain applications
yeah<00:04:11.380> so<00:04:12.040> a<00:04:12.310> little<00:04:12.640> bit<00:04:12.760> faster<00:04:13.209> well<00:04:13.630> better

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
yeah so a little bit faster well better

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.409 
yeah so a little bit faster well better
bandwidth<00:04:14.319> for<00:04:14.709> features<00:04:15.489> and<00:04:15.880> you<00:04:16.000> point<00:04:16.329> to

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
bandwidth for features and you point to

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.370 
bandwidth for features and you point to
some<00:04:16.840> things<00:04:16.989> that<00:04:17.169> were<00:04:17.410> cut<00:04:17.620> out<00:04:17.739> some<00:04:18.519> power

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
some things that were cut out some power

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.960 
some things that were cut out some power
well<00:04:20.380> first<00:04:20.829> of<00:04:20.919> all<00:04:20.950> to<00:04:21.100> kind<00:04:21.280> of<00:04:21.340> compare<00:04:21.609> our

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
well first of all to kind of compare our

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.120 
well first of all to kind of compare our
go<00:04:22.270> just<00:04:22.570> better<00:04:22.930> integration<00:04:23.470> a<00:04:23.770> better

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
go just better integration a better

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.950 
go just better integration a better
everything<00:04:24.850> that's<00:04:25.090> here<00:04:25.300> is<00:04:25.510> kind<00:04:25.690> of<00:04:25.750> here

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
everything that's here is kind of here

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.610 
everything that's here is kind of here
and<00:04:26.310> well<00:04:27.510> of<00:04:28.510> course<00:04:28.780> we<00:04:28.840> removed<00:04:29.260> some<00:04:29.380> of

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
and well of course we removed some of

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.760 
and well of course we removed some of
the<00:04:29.740> stuff<00:04:30.270> but<00:04:31.270> by<00:04:32.169> using<00:04:32.200> higher

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
the stuff but by using higher

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.560 
the stuff but by using higher
integration<00:04:33.550> you<00:04:33.700> can<00:04:33.729> scale<00:04:34.270> the<00:04:34.450> whole

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
integration you can scale the whole

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.500 
integration you can scale the whole
thing<00:04:34.780> now<00:04:34.960> of<00:04:35.530> course<00:04:35.770> serial<00:04:36.760> features<00:04:37.210> on

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
thing now of course serial features on

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.270 
thing now of course serial features on
this<00:04:37.660> one<00:04:37.870> are<00:04:37.990> still<00:04:38.200> missing<00:04:38.410> like<00:04:38.740> hdmi

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
this one are still missing like hdmi

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.980 
this one are still missing like hdmi
output<00:04:39.729> because<00:04:40.180> because<00:04:40.450> this<00:04:40.600> one<00:04:40.750> is<00:04:40.870> a

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
output because because this one is a

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.570 
output because because this one is a
better<00:04:41.260> than<00:04:41.410> that<00:04:41.470> we're<00:04:41.830> on<00:04:42.070> a<00:04:42.160> chronic

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
better than that we're on a chronic

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.240 
better than that we're on a chronic
problems<00:04:43.030> right<00:04:43.360> so<00:04:44.050> you<00:04:44.140> can<00:04:44.350> see<00:04:44.560> this<00:04:45.070> is

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
problems right so you can see this is

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.240 
problems right so you can see this is
where<00:04:45.460> it's<00:04:45.580> going<00:04:45.700> to<00:04:45.789> fit<00:04:45.970> something<00:04:46.419> is<00:04:47.250> the

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
where it's going to fit something is the

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.350 
where it's going to fit something is the
rest<00:04:48.400> is<00:04:48.550> going<00:04:48.700> to<00:04:48.760> be<00:04:48.820> a<00:04:48.850> flood

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
rest is going to be a flood

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.170 
rest is going to be a flood
the<00:04:52.229> guard<00:04:53.229> why<00:04:53.740> don't<00:04:53.889> you<00:04:53.979> add<00:04:54.129> a<00:04:54.159> hdmi<00:04:54.969> does

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
the guard why don't you add a hdmi does

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.179 
the guard why don't you add a hdmi does
that<00:04:55.330> add<00:04:55.509> too<00:04:55.659> much<00:04:55.780> past<00:04:56.080> or<00:04:56.319> we<00:04:57.069> have

00:04:57.179 --> 00:04:57.189 
that add too much past or we have

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:58.830 
that add too much past or we have
another<00:04:57.400> board<00:04:57.759> that<00:04:57.969> is<00:04:58.090> basically<00:04:58.389> ready<00:04:58.689> to

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
another board that is basically ready to

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.809 
another board that is basically ready to
go<00:04:58.990> that<00:04:59.169> has<00:04:59.289> all<00:04:59.469> those<00:04:59.590> features<00:04:59.949> on<00:05:00.099> it<00:05:00.129> so

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:00.819 
go that has all those features on it so

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:03.059 
go that has all those features on it so
this<00:05:01.060> is<00:05:01.180> just<00:05:01.300> a<00:05:01.449> very<00:05:01.629> low<00:05:01.840> cost<00:05:01.870> curve<00:05:02.379> we

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:03.069 
this is just a very low cost curve we

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.159 
this is just a very low cost curve we
have<00:05:03.219> a<00:05:03.250> more<00:05:03.550> advanced<00:05:04.300> version<00:05:04.449> that<00:05:04.930> can<00:05:05.050> be

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
have a more advanced version that can be

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:06.570 
have a more advanced version that can be
used<00:05:05.319> in<00:05:05.469> other<00:05:05.590> things<00:05:05.919> but<00:05:06.039> this<00:05:06.189> one<00:05:06.400> would

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
used in other things but this one would

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.999 
used in other things but this one would
fit<00:05:06.789> in<00:05:07.150> or<00:05:07.569> netbook<00:05:08.259> and<00:05:08.409> a<00:05:08.500> tablet<00:05:08.680> for

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:09.009 
fit in or netbook and a tablet for

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:11.999 
fit in or netbook and a tablet for
example<00:05:09.550> nice<00:05:10.120> so<00:05:10.840> we<00:05:10.990> in<00:05:11.050> June<00:05:11.319> and<00:05:11.650> July

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:12.009 
example nice so we in June and July

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:14.520 
example nice so we in June and July
August<00:05:12.400> they<00:05:13.240> might<00:05:13.449> actually<00:05:13.629> be<00:05:13.960> finalized

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
August they might actually be finalized

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.820 
August they might actually be finalized
design<00:05:15.280> that<00:05:15.729> somewhere<00:05:16.210> right<00:05:17.169> now<00:05:17.379> in<00:05:17.560> China

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
design that somewhere right now in China

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.119 
design that somewhere right now in China
being<00:05:18.159> put<00:05:18.370> together<00:05:18.520> so<00:05:18.990> well<00:05:19.990> yeah<00:05:20.740> you<00:05:20.949> can

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:21.129 
being put together so well yeah you can

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:24.269 
being put together so well yeah you can
say<00:05:21.340> many<00:05:21.580> niggas<00:05:22.560> and<00:05:23.560> what<00:05:23.770> we<00:05:23.860> gonna<00:05:24.039> call

00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:24.279 
say many niggas and what we gonna call

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:26.730 
say many niggas and what we gonna call
it<00:05:24.310> their<00:05:25.060> names<00:05:25.330> this<00:05:26.020> now<00:05:26.169> right<00:05:26.409> now<00:05:26.560> it's

it their names this now right now it's

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.439 
it their names this now right now it's
called<00:05:26.889> epica<00:05:27.370> MX<00:05:27.729> so<00:05:28.029> we<00:05:28.270> were<00:05:28.419> thinking

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 
called epica MX so we were thinking

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:30.749 
called epica MX so we were thinking
about<00:05:28.930> something<00:05:29.560> like<00:05:29.830> well<00:05:30.159> it's<00:05:30.370> not<00:05:30.490> set

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759 
about something like well it's not set
