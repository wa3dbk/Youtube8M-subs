planned
it's<00:02:12.750> going<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:12.989> be<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.290> core<00:02:13.680> game<00:02:13.980> but<00:02:14.670> with

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.309 
it's going to be the core game but with
just<00:02:15.569> carbot<00:02:16.470> at<00:02:16.950> eyes<00:02:17.190> i<00:02:17.989> guess<00:02:18.989> is<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.170> best

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
just carbot at eyes i guess is the best

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.920 
just carbot at eyes i guess is the best
word<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.860> put<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.569> but<00:02:21.569> yeah<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:21.900> is

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.970 
know if it's possible what we can create
and<00:03:14.220> it's<00:03:14.519> very<00:03:14.910> possible<00:03:15.239> and<00:03:15.750> it's<00:03:16.739> very

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
and it's very possible and it's very

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.030 
and it's very possible and it's very
