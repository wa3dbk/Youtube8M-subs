00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
and so it took a lot of back and forth

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.100

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
all the characters in the game I think

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.359 
all the characters in the game I think
the<00:01:32.420> two<00:01:32.659> that<00:01:32.899> I<00:01:32.960> am<00:01:33.799> most<00:01:33.979> looking<00:01:34.189> forward

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369
