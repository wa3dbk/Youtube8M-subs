00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.240
 like ok 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.040
 well this tutorial the truth is 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.520
 very simple and the only thing that we have to 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.010
 to do is an u inverted towards us 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.930
 with any block of well with 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.640
 any block and then what 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.520
 we have to do is simply put 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.640
 a block in the middle of the uv put a 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.940
 rail and put a vague chest a 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.740
 wagon with a chest ok this the crafter 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.420
 it's very simple the trolley is made with 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.160
 iron and then the chest is made with 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.640
 wood and craft were where they are 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.740
 the wagons and then this is done 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.970
 this object not after what we have 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.710
 what to do is simply break the 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.920
 block below where is the 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.750
 the wagon will fall and what 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.970
 we have to do is push not 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.610
 just push the wagon ok there 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.810
 is at the top then we have to cover what 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.450
 which is being this side d 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.970
 of the wagon and we break what comes 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.130
 being the corners already having broken the 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.239
 corners we have to see where it is 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:15.630
 it was left this left the wagon 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:19.110
 to be able to cover it and then this 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.319
 what we have to do is raise the 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.260
 walls so you can not see the 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.700
 same trolley and then what we have 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.640
 what to do is simply look for 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.459
 shore or the corner of the wagon to 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.049
 to open it and hide anything 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.840
 or any object or any mineral 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.430
 as I told you at the beginning of the video 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.040
 you can choose the diamonds so that 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.630
 Some friend who goes to his world and does not 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.910
 I know then, do not steal it 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.420
 what we do is we look for the little bank 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.250
 here to search here is 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.480
 and exactly as we can say that 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.080
 the gray dye are diamonds and 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.360
 we hide there not this because this 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.510
 I say that nothing else is a small one 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.610
 small based 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.460
 how to hide chests this in the 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.770
 next video then to bring one more 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.500

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.660

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.950
 trick to hide your chest not 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:19.330
 this is like to say take out a 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:22.180
 to put them an advance and that 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.709
 see about this, and well, I think that 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.830
