00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:49.659 
talking about for a long time we said

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:51.299 
talking about for a long time we said
that<00:00:49.899> we<00:00:50.019> wouldn't<00:00:50.289> have<00:00:50.469> ground<00:00:50.739> information

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309

in<00:00:51.429> world<00:00:51.609> conflict<00:00:52.089> but<00:00:52.420> with<00:00:52.629> our<00:00:52.749> focus<00:00:53.050> on

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
in world conflict but with our focus on

in world conflict but with our focus on
realistic<00:00:53.530> destruction<00:00:54.219> and<00:00:54.429> intensity<00:00:54.940> we

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
realistic destruction and intensity we

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.270 
realistic destruction and intensity we
eventually<00:00:55.659> decided<00:00:56.260> that<00:00:56.350> we<00:00:56.469> simply<00:00:56.769> had<00:00:57.069> to

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
eventually decided that we simply had to

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.059 
eventually decided that we simply had to
add<00:00:57.429> some<00:00:57.730> real<00:00:57.909> damage<00:00:58.149> to<00:00:58.329> mother<00:00:58.690> earth

00:00:59.059 --> 00:00:59.069

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.350 

notice<00:01:07.250> how<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:07.400> ground<00:01:07.670> takes<00:01:07.970> just<00:01:08.210> as<00:01:08.330> much

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
notice how the ground takes just as much

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.260 
notice how the ground takes just as much
damage<00:01:08.840> as<00:01:09.050> everything<00:01:09.560> else<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:10.880> tanks<00:01:11.210> that

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
damage as everything else the tanks that

follow will now have to drive down into
the<00:01:13.070> crater<00:01:13.280> and<00:01:13.640> then<00:01:13.790> up<00:01:13.940> again<00:01:14.210> on<00:01:14.330> the
