00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
to be quite gentle with it because it

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.319

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
if you don't have a fondant roller you

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.930 
if you don't have a fondant roller you
can<00:04:37.680> use<00:04:37.890> a<00:04:37.920> standard<00:04:38.220> roller<00:04:38.640> but<00:04:38.850> the

can use a standard roller but the
fondant<00:04:39.330> roller<00:04:39.510> will<00:04:39.750> just<00:04:39.960> be<00:04:40.620> a<00:04:40.650> little<00:04:40.830> bit

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
fondant roller will just be a little bit

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
an exact thickness for this it doesn't

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.850 
an exact thickness for this it doesn't
really<00:04:49.050> matter

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.590 

hold<00:04:52.860> my<00:04:53.040> not<00:04:54.080> about<00:04:55.080> that<00:04:55.290> thick<00:04:55.560> is<00:04:55.710> is<00:04:55.920> good
