them planted I think I might move one of

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.569 
them planted I think I might move one of
these<00:02:03.540> into<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.170> 10<00:02:04.649> gallon<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.100> see<00:02:05.280> how<00:02:05.430> it

these into the 10 gallon and see how it

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.320

so I really like these plants they look
really<00:02:41.380> cool<00:02:41.650> so<00:02:42.870> not<00:02:43.870> really<00:02:43.900> sure<00:02:44.320> how<00:02:44.410> to

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
really cool so not really sure how to

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.110 
really cool so not really sure how to
handle<00:02:44.950> this<00:02:45.100> other<00:02:45.430> than<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:45.700> remove<00:02:45.910> more

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
handle this other than to remove more

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.050 
handle this other than to remove more
duckweed<00:02:46.600> I<00:02:47.500> think<00:02:48.040> those<00:02:48.550> plants<00:02:48.940> are

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
duckweed I think those plants are

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.820 
duckweed I think those plants are
definitely<00:02:49.480> gonna<00:02:49.630> take<00:02:50.050> up<00:02:50.230> quite<00:02:50.410> a<00:02:50.500> bit<00:02:50.709> of

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
definitely gonna take up quite a bit of

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.250 
definitely gonna take up quite a bit of
light<00:02:51.130> but<00:02:52.090> I<00:02:52.180> think<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.420> duck<00:02:52.630> weeds<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.050> big

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
light but I think the duck weeds the big

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.850 
light but I think the duck weeds the big
culprit<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:54.040> I<00:02:54.310> think<00:02:54.700> what<00:02:54.850> I'm<00:02:54.940> gonna<00:02:55.060> do<00:02:55.270> is

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
culprit so I think what I'm gonna do is

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.560 
culprit so I think what I'm gonna do is
probably<00:02:56.860> move<00:02:57.040> half<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.520> duck<00:02:57.730> weed<00:02:57.940> even

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
probably move half the duck weed even

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.440 
probably move half the duck weed even
though<00:02:58.630> I<00:02:58.660> do<00:02:58.780> that<00:02:58.990> every<00:02:59.200> frickin<00:02:59.590> week<00:02:59.740> and

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
though I do that every frickin week and

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.050 
though I do that every frickin week and
see<00:03:01.450> how<00:03:01.480> these<00:03:01.690> plants<00:03:01.990> do<00:03:02.760> if<00:03:03.760> they<00:03:04.000> do

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
see how these plants do if they do

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.360 
see how these plants do if they do
phenomenal<00:03:04.390> in<00:03:04.990> here<00:03:05.320> I<00:03:05.440> think<00:03:06.070> I<00:03:06.100> might<00:03:06.250> just

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
phenomenal in here I think I might just

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.340 
phenomenal in here I think I might just
end<00:03:06.520> up<00:03:06.670> removing<00:03:06.970> all<00:03:07.240> the<00:03:07.630> duck<00:03:07.810> weed<00:03:08.050> and

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
end up removing all the duck weed and

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.310 
end up removing all the duck weed and
eventually<00:03:09.070> I'll<00:03:09.190> trim<00:03:09.490> these<00:03:09.670> plants<00:03:10.320> trim

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
eventually I'll trim these plants trim

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.350 
eventually I'll trim these plants trim
them<00:03:11.440> and<00:03:11.620> plant<00:03:12.490> new<00:03:12.670> ones<00:03:12.880> and<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.209> whole

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
them and plant new ones and the whole

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.910 
them and plant new ones and the whole
background<00:03:13.630> will<00:03:14.020> be<00:03:14.050> like<00:03:14.290> that<00:03:14.500> just<00:03:14.530> full

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
background will be like that just full

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
in this corner he was in the middle of

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.220 
in this corner he was in the middle of
tank<00:03:47.950> swimming<00:03:48.280> around<00:03:48.459> and<00:03:49.019> since<00:03:50.019> I've<00:03:50.140> been

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
tank swimming around and since I've been

tank swimming around and since I've been
out<00:03:50.380> here<00:03:50.410> he's<00:03:50.830> been<00:03:50.950> kind<00:03:51.190> of<00:03:51.220> in<00:03:51.370> that

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
out here he's been kind of in that

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.880 
out here he's been kind of in that
corner<00:03:51.850> reason<00:03:52.630> I<00:03:52.660> moved<00:03:52.870> them<00:03:53.110> to<00:03:53.380> this<00:03:53.560> tank

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
corner reason I moved them to this tank

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.610 
corner reason I moved them to this tank
is<00:03:54.190> because<00:03:55.150> he<00:03:55.780> was<00:03:55.900> getting<00:03:55.989> the<00:03:56.590> beat

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
is because he was getting the beat

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.880 
is because he was getting the beat
out<00:03:56.860> of<00:03:56.980> him<00:03:57.130> because<00:03:57.910> I<00:03:57.940> got<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.180> pair<00:03:58.450> I<00:03:59.140> don't

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
out of him because I got a pair I don't

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.280 
out of him because I got a pair I don't
have<00:04:00.010> a<00:04:00.120> confirmed<00:04:01.120> pair<00:04:01.450> but<00:04:01.780> I<00:04:01.810> got<00:04:02.019> a<00:04:02.049> pair

have a confirmed pair but I got a pair
I'm<00:04:02.380> in<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.530> process<00:04:02.890> of<00:04:02.980> doing<00:04:03.070> the<00:04:03.190> water

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
I'm in the process of doing the water

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.789 
I'm in the process of doing the water
change<00:04:03.700> trying<00:04:04.030> to<00:04:04.090> get<00:04:04.209> them<00:04:04.360> to<00:04:04.410> spawn<00:04:05.410> and

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
change trying to get them to spawn and

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.600 
change trying to get them to spawn and
get<00:04:05.920> jiggy<00:04:06.130> with<00:04:06.280> it<00:04:07.440> so<00:04:08.440> that<00:04:09.280> is<00:04:09.400> definitely

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
get jiggy with it so that is definitely

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.000 
get jiggy with it so that is definitely
a<00:04:10.030> pair<00:04:11.820> they've<00:04:12.820> been<00:04:13.060> cleaning<00:04:13.330> like<00:04:13.600> crazy

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
a pair they've been cleaning like crazy

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.620 
a pair they've been cleaning like crazy
just<00:04:15.010> clean<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:15.430> clean<00:04:15.670> and<00:04:15.820> cleaning<00:04:16.180> I'll

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
just clean and clean and cleaning I'll

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.390 
just clean and clean and cleaning I'll
remove<00:04:16.959> one<00:04:17.260> of<00:04:17.290> my<00:04:17.380> angelfish<00:04:17.919> lights<00:04:18.250> in

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
remove one of my angelfish lights in

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.080 
remove one of my angelfish lights in
here<00:04:18.580> and<00:04:18.760> see<00:04:18.880> if<00:04:18.970> that<00:04:19.180> helps<00:04:19.630> and<00:04:20.820> just<00:04:21.820> do

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
here and see if that helps and just do

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.520 
here and see if that helps and just do
more<00:04:22.270> water<00:04:22.479> changes<00:04:22.870> and<00:04:22.990> see<00:04:23.140> if<00:04:23.229> that<00:04:23.380> gets

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
more water changes and see if that gets

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.480 
more water changes and see if that gets
them<00:04:23.680> stimulated<00:04:23.979> doing<00:04:24.490> a<00:04:24.550> spawn<00:04:24.820> so

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
them stimulated doing a spawn so

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.629 
them stimulated doing a spawn so
but<00:04:26.120> that's<00:04:26.449> basically<00:04:26.810> what's<00:04:27.050> going<00:04:27.229> on<00:04:27.639> no

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
do this so I just kind of want to learn

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.620 
do this so I just kind of want to learn
about<00:05:05.930> different<00:05:06.590> types<00:05:06.770> of<00:05:06.889> plants<00:05:07.130> and<00:05:07.630> this

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
about different types of plants and this

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.150 
about different types of plants and this
is<00:05:08.810> supposed<00:05:09.139> to<00:05:09.199> be<00:05:09.349> a<00:05:09.380> little<00:05:09.620> bit<00:05:09.740> harder

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
is supposed to be a little bit harder

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.640 
is supposed to be a little bit harder
plant<00:05:10.460> a<00:05:10.820> lot<00:05:11.150> more<00:05:11.419> highlight<00:05:11.900> type<00:05:12.289> of<00:05:12.440> plant

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
plant a lot more highlight type of plant

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.710 
plant a lot more highlight type of plant
so<00:05:13.310> I'm<00:05:13.370> gonna<00:05:13.490> give<00:05:13.669> it<00:05:13.699> a<00:05:13.849> go<00:05:14.000> and<00:05:14.030> see<00:05:14.389> how<00:05:14.570> it

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
so I'm gonna give it a go and see how it

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.300 
so I'm gonna give it a go and see how it
does<00:05:14.750> because<00:05:15.259> if<00:05:15.380> it<00:05:15.500> is<00:05:15.590> a<00:05:15.620> harder<00:05:16.039> plant

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
does because if it is a harder plant

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.890 
does because if it is a harder plant
then<00:05:16.580> it's<00:05:16.759> a<00:05:16.849> harder<00:05:17.120> plane<00:05:17.330> if<00:05:17.539> it's<00:05:17.690> not

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
then it's a harder plane if it's not

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.950 
then it's a harder plane if it's not
then<00:05:18.199> it's<00:05:18.320> not<00:05:18.380> so<00:05:18.949> and<00:05:19.669> I've<00:05:20.419> never<00:05:20.690> had<00:05:20.930> that

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
then it's not so and I've never had that

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.580 
then it's not so and I've never had that
