the<00:02:01.550> blades<00:02:01.790> available<00:02:02.330> these<00:02:02.750> are<00:02:02.810> a<00:02:02.990> few

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
the blades available these are a few

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.170 
the blades available these are a few
here<00:02:03.380> that<00:02:03.440> I've<00:02:03.650> been<00:02:03.770> using<00:02:04.040> coupla<00:02:05.000> doors

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
here that I've been using coupla doors

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.040 
here that I've been using coupla doors
need<00:02:05.390> been<00:02:05.570> in<00:02:05.720> I've<00:02:06.620> got<00:02:06.860> metal<00:02:07.040> cutting

need been in I've got metal cutting

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.270 
need been in I've got metal cutting

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
demolition board metal metal and water

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.530 
demolition board metal metal and water
you'll<00:02:13.280> notice<00:02:13.639> that<00:02:13.760> all<00:02:13.939> the<00:02:14.090> blades<00:02:14.329> here

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
you'll notice that all the blades here

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.640 
you'll notice that all the blades here
with<00:02:14.719> the<00:02:14.840> waltz<00:02:15.200> and

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
with the waltz and

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.710 
with the waltz and
also<00:02:15.829> got<00:02:15.950> some<00:02:15.980> Bosch<00:02:16.310> blades<00:02:16.640> because<00:02:17.510> they

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
also got some Bosch blades because they

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.350 
also got some Bosch blades because they
actually<00:02:18.110> fit<00:02:18.319> in<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.650> DeWalt<00:02:19.010> machine<00:02:19.519> and

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
actually fit in the DeWalt machine and

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.449 
actually fit in the DeWalt machine and
that<00:02:20.510> particular<00:02:20.810> blade<00:02:21.290> is<00:02:21.530> awesome<00:02:22.040> if<00:02:22.250> you

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
that particular blade is awesome if you

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.330 
that particular blade is awesome if you
need<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.730> cut<00:02:22.970> any<00:02:23.299> branches<00:02:23.810> off<00:02:24.110> trees<00:02:24.500> that

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
need to cut any branches off trees that

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
need to cut any branches off trees that
is<00:02:25.459> extremely<00:02:25.939> useful<00:02:27.909> so<00:02:28.909> I'm<00:02:29.000> not<00:02:29.120> going<00:02:29.299> to

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
is extremely useful so I'm not going to

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.360 
is extremely useful so I'm not going to
fix<00:02:29.569> a<00:02:29.840> blade<00:02:30.409> in<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.680> machine<00:02:30.980> I'm<00:02:31.159> going<00:02:31.220> to

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
fix a blade in the machine I'm going to

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.670 
fix a blade in the machine I'm going to
give<00:02:31.489> you<00:02:31.670> a<00:02:31.849> couple<00:02:32.150> of<00:02:32.299> demonstrations<00:02:32.989> so

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
give you a couple of demonstrations so

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.170 
give you a couple of demonstrations so
before<00:02:34.010> you<00:02:34.129> use<00:02:34.250> a<00:02:34.280> machine<00:02:34.609> like<00:02:34.760> this<00:02:34.819> it's

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
before you use a machine like this it's

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.369 
before you use a machine like this it's
always<00:02:35.390> good<00:02:35.510> idea<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:35.870> put<00:02:35.989> some<00:02:36.019> safety

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
always good idea to put some safety

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:40.780 
always good idea to put some safety
gloves<00:02:36.680> on<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.220> some<00:02:37.609> safety<00:02:37.819> glasses<00:02:39.790> and

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
gloves on and some safety glasses and

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.119 
gloves on and some safety glasses and
then<00:02:40.939> we<00:02:41.060> can<00:02:41.209> get<00:02:41.329> to<00:02:41.390> work<00:02:41.739> so<00:02:42.739> I'll<00:02:42.859> put<00:02:43.099> a

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
then we can get to work so I'll put a

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.399 
then we can get to work so I'll put a
blood-clotting<00:02:43.909> blade<00:02:44.689> in<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:44.930> machine<00:02:45.230> here

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
blood-clotting blade in the machine here

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.680 
blood-clotting blade in the machine here
and<00:02:46.040> I'm<00:02:46.280> going<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.489> give<00:02:46.579> you<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:46.700> demo<00:02:47.060> on<00:02:47.269> this

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
and I'm going to give you a demo on this

00:02:47.690 --> 00:03:17.670 
and I'm going to give you a demo on this
fairly<00:02:48.260> substantial<00:02:48.829> piece<00:02:49.040> of<00:02:49.190> bald

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.900 

and<00:03:18.680> as<00:03:18.800> you<00:03:18.860> could<00:03:18.950> see<00:03:19.190> cut<00:03:19.520> through<00:03:19.730> the

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
and as you could see cut through the

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.740 
and as you could see cut through the
matter<00:03:20.569> of<00:03:20.750> seconds<00:03:21.910> so<00:03:22.910> I'll<00:03:23.180> put<00:03:23.360> a<00:03:23.390> metal

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
matter of seconds so I'll put a metal

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.600 
matter of seconds so I'll put a metal
cutting<00:03:23.930> blade<00:03:24.080> in<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.560> machine<00:03:24.890> and<00:03:25.550> I'm

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
cutting blade in the machine and I'm

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.370 
cutting blade in the machine and I'm
going<00:03:25.670> to<00:03:25.819> cut<00:03:26.000> through<00:03:26.239> this<00:03:26.390> inch<00:03:27.140> and

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
going to cut through this inch and

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.550 
going to cut through this inch and
enough<00:03:27.620> metal<00:03:28.400> steam<00:03:28.760> pipe<00:03:29.140> when<00:03:30.140> you<00:03:30.230> do<00:03:30.349> this

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
enough metal steam pipe when you do this

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.680 
enough metal steam pipe when you do this
you<00:03:30.830> do<00:03:30.980> also<00:03:31.160> need<00:03:31.519> even<00:03:31.790> protection<00:03:32.420> because

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
you do also need even protection because

00:03:32.690 --> 00:04:30.870 
you do also need even protection because
it<00:03:32.810> is<00:03:32.930> very<00:03:33.140> noisy

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.430 

so<00:04:31.880> that's<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.180> demonstration<00:04:32.840> of<00:04:32.990> a<00:04:33.230> tall

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
so that's the demonstration of a tall

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.440 
so that's the demonstration of a tall
metal<00:04:33.640> so<00:04:34.640> I'm<00:04:34.790> not<00:04:34.880> going<00:04:35.000> to<00:04:35.090> change<00:04:35.270> the

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
metal so I'm not going to change the

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.140 
metal so I'm not going to change the
blade<00:04:35.660> again<00:04:38.500> we're<00:04:39.500> going<00:04:39.620> to<00:04:39.680> put<00:04:39.830> the<00:04:39.920> lodge

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
blade again we're going to put the lodge

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:50.590 
blade again we're going to put the lodge
Bosch<00:04:41.150> blade<00:04:41.420> in<00:04:41.630> this<00:04:41.780> zone<00:04:49.360> so<00:04:50.360> we're<00:04:50.540> not

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
Bosch blade in this zone so we're not

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.250 
Bosch blade in this zone so we're not
going<00:04:50.780> to<00:04:50.810> cut<00:04:51.020> this<00:04:51.490> part<00:04:52.490> of<00:04:52.730> a<00:04:52.820> tree<00:04:53.260> this

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
going to cut this part of a tree this

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.990 
going to cut this part of a tree this
was<00:04:54.470> actually<00:04:54.710> a<00:04:54.920> tree<00:04:55.160> going<00:04:55.400> in<00:04:55.550> the<00:04:55.640> garden

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
was actually a tree going in the garden

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.400 
was actually a tree going in the garden
that<00:04:56.090> I<00:04:56.150> trimmed<00:04:56.540> off<00:04:56.690> a<00:04:56.720> couple<00:04:56.930> of<00:04:57.050> weeks<00:04:57.260> by

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
that I trimmed off a couple of weeks by

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.470 
that I trimmed off a couple of weeks by
using<00:04:57.710> the<00:04:57.920> chainsaw<00:04:58.400> because<00:04:59.150> unfortunately

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
using the chainsaw because unfortunately

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.290 
using the chainsaw because unfortunately
I<00:05:00.200> couldn't<00:05:00.530> find<00:05:00.650> these<00:05:01.460> blades<00:05:01.760> if<00:05:02.030> it<00:05:02.120> about

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
I couldn't find these blades if it about

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.470 
I couldn't find these blades if it about
these<00:05:02.480> blades<00:05:02.780> I<00:05:03.110> could<00:05:03.800> have<00:05:03.890> used<00:05:04.070> these<00:05:04.480> not

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
these blades I could have used these not

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.220 
these blades I could have used these not
want<00:05:05.630> to<00:05:05.690> see<00:05:05.840> me<00:05:06.020> using<00:05:06.230> the<00:05:06.470> chainsaw<00:05:08.230> so

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
want to see me using the chainsaw so

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.170 
want to see me using the chainsaw so
we're<00:05:09.380> now<00:05:09.470> going<00:05:09.620> to<00:05:09.710> cost<00:05:09.950> a<00:05:10.250> section<00:05:10.970> of

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
we're now going to cost a section of

00:05:11.180 --> 00:06:14.760 
we're now going to cost a section of
this<00:05:11.420> log<00:05:11.690> using<00:05:12.260> this<00:05:12.500> song

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:26.469 

you

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:29.179 

so<00:06:27.479> you<00:06:27.539> can<00:06:27.719> see<00:06:27.870> that<00:06:28.020> that<00:06:28.139> eventually<00:06:28.979> cut

00:06:29.179 --> 00:06:29.189 
so you can see that that eventually cut

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:32.089 
so you can see that that eventually cut
through<00:06:29.430> there<00:06:29.669> that's<00:06:30.659> a<00:06:30.779> considerable<00:06:31.259> size

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:32.099 
through there that's a considerable size

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:34.670 
through there that's a considerable size
long<00:06:32.430> that's<00:06:32.639> probably<00:06:32.999> six<00:06:33.330> inches<00:06:33.680> in

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
long that's probably six inches in

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.589 
long that's probably six inches in
diameter<00:06:36.379> so<00:06:37.379> these<00:06:37.979> machines<00:06:38.219> are<00:06:38.789> extremely

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:39.599 
diameter so these machines are extremely

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:41.989 
diameter so these machines are extremely
and<00:06:39.840> they<00:06:40.139> once<00:06:41.099> you<00:06:41.219> borrow<00:06:41.490> one<00:06:41.610> you<00:06:41.849> will

00:06:41.989 --> 00:06:41.999 
and they once you borrow one you will

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:43.760
