00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
hydrating the plant here you could see

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.490 
hydrating the plant here you could see
the<00:00:21.480> leaves<00:00:21.720> are<00:00:22.080> starting<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:23.359> dehydrate<00:00:24.500> so

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
the leaves are starting to dehydrate so

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.580 
the leaves are starting to dehydrate so
I<00:00:25.529> removed<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.099> media<00:00:26.430> which<00:00:26.880> was<00:00:27.090> very<00:00:27.590> soggy

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
I removed the media which was very soggy

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.189 
I removed the media which was very soggy
and<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.640> hadn't<00:00:29.910> been<00:00:30.150> too<00:00:30.359> long<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:30.929> had

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
and it hadn't been too long that I had

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.250 
and it hadn't been too long that I had
repotted<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:32.520> fell<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:33.930> one<00:00:34.110> right

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
repotted this fell and this one right

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.560 
repotted this fell and this one right
here<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.390> here<00:00:36.390> again<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:37.200> top<00:00:37.410> roots<00:00:38.570> seemed

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
here and here again the top roots seemed

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.990 
here and here again the top roots seemed
okay<00:00:40.020> but<00:00:40.320> inside<00:00:41.070> were<00:00:41.820> not<00:00:42.420> good<00:00:42.890> I<00:00:44.000> removed

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
okay but inside were not good I removed

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.970 
okay but inside were not good I removed
all<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.390> dead<00:00:45.629> media<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.320> sprayed<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.829> down

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
all the dead media I sprayed it down

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.600 
all the dead media I sprayed it down
with<00:00:47.309> peroxide<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:49.110> will<00:00:49.379> allow<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:50.070> to

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
with peroxide and I will allow this to

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.490 
with peroxide and I will allow this to
air<00:00:50.879> dry<00:00:51.420> for<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> couple<00:00:51.930> days<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:54.320> I'm<00:00:55.320> going

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.740 
air dry for a couple days and I'm going
to<00:00:55.530> start<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.860> water<00:00:56.010> culture<00:00:56.520> on<00:00:56.789> these<00:00:57.449> two

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
to start the water culture on these two

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.709 
to start the water culture on these two
files<00:00:58.050> right<00:00:58.350> here<00:00:59.329> I'll<00:01:00.329> show<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.840> media

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
files right here I'll show you the media

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.780 
files right here I'll show you the media
here<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.049> media<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:05.100> were<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.580> roots

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
here is the media this were the roots

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.980 
here is the media this were the roots
that<00:01:06.320> were<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.890> recently<00:01:08.070> repotted<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
that were just recently repotted and the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.940 
that were just recently repotted and the
media<00:01:10.320> just<00:01:10.680> did<00:01:10.890> not<00:01:12.170> help<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.740> had<00:01:13.920> a

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
media just did not help and I had a

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.320 
media just did not help and I had a
combination<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.700> clay<00:01:14.939> pellets<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.710> bark<00:01:16.710> and

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
combination of clay pellets and bark and

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.100 
combination of clay pellets and bark and
styrofoam<00:01:18.330> peanuts<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.110> still<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:20.100> just<00:01:21.110> did

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
styrofoam peanuts and still it just did

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.410 
styrofoam peanuts and still it just did
not<00:01:22.229> do<00:01:22.470> well<00:01:22.700> sometimes<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.880> see<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.210> top

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
not do well sometimes you see the top

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.289 
not do well sometimes you see the top
roots<00:01:24.780> doing<00:01:25.229> well<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.860> underneath<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.700> is

the water and you can see all these
little<00:01:41.130> air<00:01:41.310> bubbles<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:44.670> level

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
little air bubbles and the level

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.679 
little air bubbles and the level
is<00:01:46.079> not<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.460> base<00:01:47.640> but<00:01:48.180> took<00:01:48.479> at<00:01:48.630> the

bottom her base is above water and you
can<00:01:54.659> see<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:56.159> root<00:01:58.130> okay<00:01:59.130> look<00:01:59.520> at<00:01:59.610> all<00:01:59.759> those

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
can see the root okay look at all those

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.230 
can see the root okay look at all those
air<00:02:00.090> bubbles<00:02:01.159> and<00:02:02.159> her<00:02:02.369> flowers<00:02:02.850> are<00:02:03.030> still

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
air bubbles and her flowers are still

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.370 
air bubbles and her flowers are still
good<00:02:03.479> she<00:02:04.289> has<00:02:05.090> this<00:02:06.090> fluff<00:02:06.600> owl<00:02:06.899> had<00:02:07.110> been<00:02:07.289> a

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
good she has this fluff owl had been a

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.630 
good she has this fluff owl had been a
bud<00:02:08.069> or<00:02:08.310> in<00:02:08.519> bloom<00:02:08.789> since<00:02:09.360> January<00:02:10.349> February

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
bud or in bloom since January February

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.309 
bud or in bloom since January February
so<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.700> course<00:02:11.880> you<00:02:12.510> know<00:02:12.630> they're<00:02:13.019> gonna<00:02:13.110> lose

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
so of course you know they're gonna lose

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.170 
so of course you know they're gonna lose
some<00:02:14.180> are<00:02:15.180> going<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.480> fade<00:02:15.840> away<00:02:16.080> eventually

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
some are going to fade away eventually

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.340 
some are going to fade away eventually
but<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.209> want<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.420> show<00:02:18.569> you<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.870> bet<00:02:19.049> the

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
but I want to show you the bet the

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.640 
but I want to show you the bet the
results<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.040> how<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.340> can<00:02:20.700> see<00:02:21.530> then<00:02:22.530> in

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
results and how you can see then in

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.170 
results and how you can see then in
growth<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:24.630> you<00:02:24.720> can<00:02:24.810> see<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.080> roots<00:02:26.180> here's

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
growth and you can see the roots here's

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.500 
growth and you can see the roots here's
another<00:02:28.069> and<00:02:29.069> another<00:02:30.830> and<00:02:32.180> that's<00:02:33.180> done

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
another and another and that's done

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.300 
another and another and that's done
quite<00:02:34.049> well<00:02:36.530> so<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:37.590> highly<00:02:37.860> recommend<00:02:37.890> this

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
quite well so I highly recommend this

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.960 
quite well so I highly recommend this
technique<00:02:39.470> if<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:41.100> notice<00:02:41.459> that<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.760> roots

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
technique if you notice that the roots

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.690 
technique if you notice that the roots
