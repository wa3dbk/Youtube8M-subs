what I always say the eye holes are very
very<00:02:16.950> large<00:02:17.160> so<00:02:17.489> you<00:02:17.520> can<00:02:17.670> read<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:17.970> eyebrows

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
very large so you can read the eyebrows

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.990 
very large so you can read the eyebrows
and<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.840> expression<00:02:19.379> in<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.560> eyes<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:20.670> idea

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
and the expression in the eyes the idea

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.640 
and the expression in the eyes the idea
so<00:02:21.209> that<00:02:21.239> I<00:02:21.390> can<00:02:21.599> see<00:02:21.810> what's<00:02:21.989> going<00:02:22.080> on<00:02:22.410> and

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
so that I can see what's going on and

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.600 
so that I can see what's going on and

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
putting the blood on there can also just

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.020 
putting the blood on there can also just
see<00:02:25.470> emotionally<00:02:26.099> what<00:02:26.250> was<00:02:26.400> going<00:02:26.700> on<00:02:26.819> during

the performance he wears that he modes

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.729 
the performance he wears that he modes
he<00:02:30.420> does<00:02:30.569> everything<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.080> then<00:02:31.170> we<00:02:31.290> take<00:02:31.680> it

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
he does everything and then we take it

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.350 
he does everything and then we take it
back<00:02:32.040> into<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.430> shop<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:32.670> we<00:02:33.000> track<00:02:33.239> the

back into the shop and we track the
tracking<00:02:33.629> markers<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.230> we<00:02:34.319> replace

different<00:02:47.160> hero<00:02:47.910> patterns<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:49.350> know<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:49.560> I

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
different hero patterns you know and I

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.110 
different hero patterns you know and I
think<00:02:49.770> it's<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:50.010> way<00:02:50.160> in<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.400> graphic<00:02:51.090> novel

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
think it's that way in the graphic novel

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.720 
think it's that way in the graphic novel
as<00:02:51.600> well<00:02:51.630> if<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.350> kind<00:02:52.590> of<00:02:52.680> look<00:02:53.280> at<00:02:53.460> the

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
as well if you kind of look at the

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.080 
as well if you kind of look at the
various<00:02:54.210> blots<00:02:55.140> it's<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.280> is<00:02:56.430> tied<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.880> what's

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
various blots it's it is tied to what's

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.000 
various blots it's it is tied to what's
going<00:02:57.390> on<00:02:57.540> with<00:02:57.750> them<00:02:57.930> we<00:02:58.320> realized<00:02:58.500> well

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
going on with them we realized well

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.770 
going on with them we realized well
we're<00:02:59.880> going<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.030> be<00:03:00.150> faithful<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.570> the

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
we're going to be faithful to the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.150 
we're going to be faithful to the
graphic<00:03:01.140> novel<00:03:01.500> we<00:03:01.620> should<00:03:01.800> look<00:03:01.920> at<00:03:02.040> what

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
graphic novel we should look at what

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.680 
graphic novel we should look at what
Dave<00:03:02.370> Gibbons<00:03:02.640> drew<00:03:03.000> because<00:03:03.180> he<00:03:03.510> was

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
Dave Gibbons drew because he was

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.960 
Dave Gibbons drew because he was
actually<00:03:03.990> pretty<00:03:04.320> specific<00:03:04.950> about<00:03:05.670> what

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
actually pretty specific about what

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.240 
actually pretty specific about what
blots<00:03:06.510> he<00:03:06.750> would<00:03:06.900> put<00:03:07.110> into<00:03:07.440> each<00:03:07.590> panel<00:03:08.100> and

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
blots he would put into each panel and

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.130 
blots he would put into each panel and
how<00:03:08.400> they<00:03:08.610> would<00:03:08.730> change<00:03:09.000> sometimes<00:03:09.570> we

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
how they would change sometimes we

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.900 
how they would change sometimes we
wanted<00:03:10.380> to<00:03:10.500> get<00:03:10.650> that<00:03:10.710> level<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.220> detail<00:03:11.460> into

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
wanted to get that level of detail into

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.160 
wanted to get that level of detail into
the<00:03:12.120> film<00:03:12.360> as<00:03:12.660> well<00:03:14.510> we<00:03:15.510> actually<00:03:15.780> go<00:03:15.930> through

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
the film as well we actually go through

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.910 
the film as well we actually go through
a<00:03:16.400> hand-drawn<00:03:17.400> 2d<00:03:17.640> process<00:03:18.450> first<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:19.080> those

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
a hand-drawn 2d process first and those

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.310 
a hand-drawn 2d process first and those
are<00:03:20.160> all<00:03:20.310> animated<00:03:20.760> flat<00:03:21.270> they<00:03:21.630> give<00:03:21.840> us<00:03:22.050> back

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
are all animated flat they give us back

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.290 
are all animated flat they give us back
a<00:03:22.350> sequence<00:03:22.950> and<00:03:23.610> we<00:03:23.730> look<00:03:23.910> at<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.060> high

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
a sequence and we look at a high

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.840 
a sequence and we look at a high
conversion<00:03:24.990> of<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.680> sequence<00:03:26.130> once<00:03:26.520> we<00:03:26.640> buy

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
conversion of the sequence once we buy

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.910 
conversion of the sequence once we buy
off<00:03:27.030> on<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.360> animation<00:03:27.720> we<00:03:28.500> already<00:03:28.740> know

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
off on that animation we already know

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.010 
off on that animation we already know
how<00:03:29.190> it<00:03:29.700> gets<00:03:29.880> rendered<00:03:30.210> and<00:03:30.600> then<00:03:30.810> it's<00:03:30.930> just

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
how it gets rendered and then it's just

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.530 
how it gets rendered and then it's just
all<00:03:31.200> lighting<00:03:31.710> for<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.640> actual<00:03:33.000> textured

all lighting for the actual textured

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.070 
all lighting for the actual textured
head<00:03:33.720> that<00:03:33.900> we're<00:03:33.990> replacing<00:03:34.230> in<00:03:34.770> the<00:03:34.860> scene
