00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
unlimited starter deck anywhere that I

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.540 
unlimited starter deck anywhere that I
could<00:06:29.730> find<00:06:30.000> so<00:06:30.690> this<00:06:31.440> would<00:06:31.650> be<00:06:31.740> cool<00:06:31.950> you

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870 
and maybe just maybe we have a 1 in 60

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.070 
and maybe just maybe we have a 1 in 60
chance<00:06:40.140> of<00:06:40.380> maybe<00:06:40.590> it's<00:06:40.830> just<00:06:41.010> being

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
chance of maybe it's just being

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.120 
chance of maybe it's just being
incredible<00:06:43.080> and<00:06:43.230> even<00:06:43.410> if<00:06:43.500> we<00:06:43.620> don't<00:06:43.800> get<00:06:43.980> it

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.130 
incredible and even if we don't get it

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.750 
incredible and even if we don't get it
that's<00:06:44.310> okay<00:06:44.700> it's<00:06:44.880> still<00:06:45.150> amazing<00:06:46.520> so<00:06:47.520> I
