back and has four on top of the tower

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.699 
back and has four on top of the tower
case<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.250> two<00:02:15.240> of<00:02:15.360> them<00:02:15.480> are<00:02:15.660> USB<00:02:16.140> 3<00:02:16.380> pointers

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
case and two of them are USB 3 pointers

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.949 
case and two of them are USB 3 pointers
and<00:02:16.920> two<00:02:17.520> of<00:02:17.610> them<00:02:17.819> on<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.030> top<00:02:18.239> as<00:02:18.510> well<00:02:18.780> are

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
and two of them on the top as well are

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.390 
and two of them on the top as well are
three<00:02:19.110> USB<00:02:19.319> three<00:02:19.560> pointers<00:02:19.860> so<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.040> has<00:02:20.160> ten

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
three USB three pointers so it has ten

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.330 
three USB three pointers so it has ten
USB<00:02:20.760> ports<00:02:21.540> in<00:02:21.720> total<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.260> four<00:02:22.860> of<00:02:22.950> them<00:02:23.099> are

USB ports in total and four of them are
USB<00:02:23.610> 3.0<00:02:24.180> so<00:02:24.750> here's<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.230> actual<00:02:25.580> case

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780
