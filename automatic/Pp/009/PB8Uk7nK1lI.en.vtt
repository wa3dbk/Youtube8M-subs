with glitter polishes and maybe it's an

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.010 
with glitter polishes and maybe it's an
indie<00:01:29.939> maybe<00:01:30.150> it's<00:01:30.360> not<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.659> does<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.869> doesn't

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
indie maybe it's not it does it doesn't

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
indie maybe it's not it does it doesn't
matter<00:01:31.229> but<00:01:31.500> I'm<00:01:32.369> gonna<00:01:32.490> use<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.939> one<00:01:33.210> and

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
matter but I'm gonna use this one and

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.569 
matter but I'm gonna use this one and
I'm<00:01:35.040> just<00:01:35.280> going<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.520> apply<00:01:36.619> one<00:01:37.619> coat<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.280> this

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
I'm just going to apply one coat of this

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.899 
I'm just going to apply one coat of this
because<00:01:39.150> it's<00:01:39.329> super<00:01:39.869> opaque<00:01:40.250> as<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.460> can<00:01:41.610> see

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
because it's super opaque as you can see

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.639 
because it's super opaque as you can see
you<00:01:42.420> just<00:01:42.630> have<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.869> kind<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.140> stipple<00:01:43.409> it

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
you just have to kind of stipple it

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.819 
you just have to kind of stipple it
though<00:01:44.000> onto<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.090> nail<00:01:45.270> because<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.259> very

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
though onto the nail because it is very

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.200 
though onto the nail because it is very
chunky<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.579> it's<00:01:47.790> hard<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.590> it's<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.770> little

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
chunky and it's hard to it's a little

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.460 
chunky and it's hard to it's a little
it's<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.240> little<00:01:51.270> difficult<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.899> work<00:01:51.990> with<00:01:52.290> but

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
it's a little difficult to work with but

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.170 
it's a little difficult to work with but
that's<00:01:52.649> just<00:01:52.979> because<00:01:53.369> there's<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:53.640> much

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
that's just because there's so much

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.520 
that's just because there's so much
glitter<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.659> it's<00:01:54.750> really<00:01:54.960> densely<00:01:55.380> packed

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
glitter and it's really densely packed

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.330 
glitter and it's really densely packed
and<00:01:55.890> fit<00:01:56.159> into<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.969> bottle<00:01:57.890> mmm<00:01:58.920> there<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.159> go

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
and fit into the bottle mmm there you go

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:12.490 
and fit into the bottle mmm there you go
then<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.210> next<00:02:00.689> one<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:02.810> just<00:02:03.810> keep<00:02:04.020> going

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:25.320 

you

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.450 

now<00:02:25.990> that<00:02:26.170> I've<00:02:26.260> done<00:02:26.440> this<00:02:26.680> I'm<00:02:26.980> going<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.220> use

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
now that I've done this I'm going to use

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.580 
bubble bath and go over with one coat of
that<00:02:31.150> over<00:02:32.110> top<00:02:32.320> of<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.940> first<00:02:34.350> let<00:02:35.350> me<00:02:35.380> take

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
that over top of the first let me take

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:43.580 
that over top of the first let me take
it

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:53.530 

you

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.690 

so<00:02:54.319> the<00:02:54.439> glitter<00:02:54.620> is<00:02:54.799> just<00:02:55.069> sandwiched<00:02:55.459> in

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
so the glitter is just sandwiched in

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.960 
so the glitter is just sandwiched in
between<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:56.330> jelly<00:02:57.319> or<00:02:57.500> Crowley<00:02:57.799> polish<00:02:58.280> so

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
between the jelly or Crowley polish so

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.240 
between the jelly or Crowley polish so
that<00:02:59.120> way<00:02:59.269> it<00:02:59.450> looks<00:02:59.480> like<00:03:00.019> it's<00:03:00.769> kind<00:03:01.010> of<00:03:01.099> like

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
that way it looks like it's kind of like

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.039 
that way it looks like it's kind of like
floating<00:03:01.700> on<00:03:02.000> your<00:03:02.209> nails<00:03:02.450> and<00:03:02.870> looks

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
floating on your nails and looks

interesting you'll be able to see in
photos<00:03:05.510> that<00:03:05.900> I<00:03:05.930> put<00:03:06.170> up<00:03:06.319> exactly<00:03:07.280> what<00:03:07.489> didn't

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
photos that I put up exactly what didn't

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.180 
photos that I put up exactly what didn't
what<00:03:07.939> I'm<00:03:08.090> talking<00:03:08.450> about<00:03:08.510> but<00:03:09.500> that's<00:03:10.010> the

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
what I'm talking about but that's the

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.619 
what I'm talking about but that's the
overall<00:03:10.489> effect<00:03:12.730> I'll<00:03:13.730> definitely<00:03:14.150> have<00:03:14.329> a

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
overall effect I'll definitely have a

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.229 
overall effect I'll definitely have a
post<00:03:14.900> on<00:03:15.079> my<00:03:15.140> blog<00:03:15.260> about<00:03:15.860> this<00:03:16.220> so<00:03:17.000> that<00:03:17.120> we

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
post on my blog about this so that we

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.259 
post on my blog about this so that we
can<00:03:17.510> see<00:03:17.810> of<00:03:18.200> more<00:03:18.620> a<00:03:19.010> more<00:03:19.640> close-up<00:03:20.060> detail

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
can see of more a more close-up detail

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.500 
can see of more a more close-up detail
of<00:03:20.659> the<00:03:21.560> polish<00:03:22.040> and<00:03:22.370> exactly<00:03:22.909> how<00:03:23.120> it<00:03:23.269> looks

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
of the polish and exactly how it looks

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.399 
of the polish and exactly how it looks
so<00:03:24.290> yeah<00:03:24.650> that's<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.670> main<00:03:25.909> idea<00:03:25.940> of<00:03:26.480> a<00:03:26.780> jelly

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:27.409 
so yeah that's the main idea of a jelly

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.699 
so yeah that's the main idea of a jelly
sandwich<00:03:28.629> for<00:03:29.629> the<00:03:29.690> most<00:03:29.930> part<00:03:30.200> it's<00:03:30.500> pretty

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709

simple
the<00:03:32.450> only<00:03:32.569> tricky<00:03:32.989> part<00:03:33.019> is<00:03:33.379> just<00:03:33.590> making<00:03:33.739> sure

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
the only tricky part is just making sure

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.789 
the only tricky part is just making sure
that<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.670> glitter<00:03:35.510> is<00:03:35.750> placed<00:03:36.079> really<00:03:36.650> well

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
on the nail and that just depends on the

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.710 
on the nail and that just depends on the
glitter<00:03:39.470> polish<00:03:39.859> itself<00:03:40.250> but<00:03:41.030> yes<00:03:41.480> that's
