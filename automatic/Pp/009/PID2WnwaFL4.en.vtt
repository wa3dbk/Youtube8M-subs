source ultra class Optimus Primal I

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.750 
source ultra class Optimus Primal I
mentioned<00:00:07.710> that<00:00:07.799> I<00:00:07.859> took<00:00:08.160> them<00:00:08.280> apart<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:08.700> I

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
mentioned that I took them apart and I

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.120 
mentioned that I took them apart and I
took<00:00:08.849> out<00:00:09.090> some<00:00:09.120> gears<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.590> reason<00:00:10.860> I<00:00:10.920> did

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
took out some gears and the reason I did

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.180 
took out some gears and the reason I did
that<00:00:11.160> is<00:00:11.670> because<00:00:12.059> um<00:00:12.480> normally<00:00:13.380> this<00:00:13.799> figure

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
that is because um normally this figure

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.790 
that is because um normally this figure
the<00:00:14.759> arms<00:00:15.150> are<00:00:15.389> linked<00:00:15.719> together<00:00:15.839> inside<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.710> a

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
the arms are linked together inside of a

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.950 
the arms are linked together inside of a
chest<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.430> what<00:00:17.970> that<00:00:18.090> caused<00:00:18.270> was<00:00:18.630> if<00:00:18.869> you

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
chest and what that caused was if you

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.599 
chest and what that caused was if you
say<00:00:19.199> move<00:00:19.439> this<00:00:19.710> arm<00:00:19.980> out<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.369> would<00:00:20.460> cause

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
say move this arm out it would cause

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.790 
say move this arm out it would cause
this<00:00:21.270> arm<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:22.160> move<00:00:23.160> also<00:00:23.730> cause<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.600> bicep<00:00:25.170> to

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
this arm to move also cause the bicep to

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.470 
this arm to move also cause the bicep to
swivel<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.189> being<00:00:26.369> on<00:00:26.460> high<00:00:26.609> at<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.880> arm<00:00:27.060> setup

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
swivel to being on high at the arm setup

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.089 
swivel to being on high at the arm setup
there's<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.230> little<00:00:28.439> switch<00:00:28.590> inside<00:00:28.920> I'll

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
there's a little switch inside I'll

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.710 
there's a little switch inside I'll
explain<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.519> later<00:00:29.699> now<00:00:30.029> it's<00:00:30.539> really

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
explain that later now it's really

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.089 
explain that later now it's really
annoying<00:00:30.960> problem<00:00:31.380> because<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.619> meant<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:31.949> to

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
annoying problem because I meant that to

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.680 
annoying problem because I meant that to
get<00:00:32.250> him<00:00:32.399> his<00:00:32.640> arms<00:00:33.000> into<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> very<00:00:33.480> specific

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
get him his arms into a very specific

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.959 
get him his arms into a very specific
pose<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.590> had<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.800> hold<00:00:35.070> one<00:00:35.309> still<00:00:35.640> while<00:00:35.880> you

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
pose you had to hold one still while you

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.630 
pose you had to hold one still while you
did<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.300> other<00:00:36.510> one<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.920> was<00:00:38.399> just<00:00:38.579> a

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
did the other one and it was just a

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.330 
did the other one and it was just a
really<00:00:38.790> uncomfortable<00:00:39.629> process<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.469> it

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
really uncomfortable process and it

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.520 
really uncomfortable process and it
really<00:00:41.610> dragged<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.149> figure<00:00:42.390> down<00:00:42.600> now<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
really dragged the figure down now the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.139 
really dragged the figure down now the
modification<00:00:43.800> for<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.489> really<00:00:44.820> simple

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
modification for this is really simple

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.110 
modification for this is really simple
all<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.450> need<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.750> do<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.610> well<00:00:47.610> first<00:00:47.910> make

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
all you need to do is well first make

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.340 
all you need to do is well first make
sure<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.270> he<00:00:48.600> doesn't<00:00:48.870> have<00:00:48.989> any<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.260> his

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
sure that he doesn't have any of his

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.869 
sure that he doesn't have any of his
missiles<00:00:49.770> or<00:00:49.950> as<00:00:50.070> accessories<00:00:50.550> attached

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
missiles or as accessories attached

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.060 
missiles or as accessories attached
because<00:00:51.120> don't<00:00:51.270> get<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.510> way<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.070> probably

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
because don't get in a way and probably

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.040 
because don't get in a way and probably
fall<00:00:53.579> off<00:00:53.610> if<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.180> don't<00:00:54.360> take<00:00:54.539> them<00:00:54.690> off<00:00:54.840> and

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
fall off if you don't take them off and

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.459 
fall off if you don't take them off and
then<00:00:55.969> swing<00:00:56.969> its<00:00:57.120> missiles<00:00:57.480> forward<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.020> then

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
then swing its missiles forward and then

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.779 
then swing its missiles forward and then
there<00:00:58.620> are<00:00:58.680> four<00:00:58.890> screws<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.309> need<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.489> take

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
there are four screws you need to take

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.270 
there are four screws you need to take
out<00:00:59.940> there's<00:01:00.780> one<00:01:01.020> right<00:01:01.199> here<00:01:01.260> one<00:01:02.250> right

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
out there's one right here one right

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.010 
out there's one right here one right
here<00:01:03.210> one<00:01:04.140> right<00:01:04.170> here<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:04.979> one<00:01:05.430> right<00:01:05.460> here

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
here one right here and one right here

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.179 
here one right here and one right here
and<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.200> take<00:01:07.380> out<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> screws<00:01:07.830> make<00:01:08.040> sure

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
and you take out the screws make sure

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.859 
and you take out the screws make sure
you<00:01:08.250> put<00:01:08.400> them<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.610> safe<00:01:08.790> place<00:01:08.820> because<00:01:09.630> if

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
you put them in a safe place because if

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.840 
you put them in a safe place because if
you<00:01:09.990> lose<00:01:10.229> them<00:01:10.560> then<00:01:11.159> replacing<00:01:11.640> there<00:01:11.760> will

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
you lose them then replacing there will

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.660 
you lose them then replacing there will
be<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.450> bitch<00:01:13.170> because<00:01:13.619> if<00:01:13.860> they're<00:01:14.430> too<00:01:14.640> long

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
be a bitch because if they're too long

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.910 
be a bitch because if they're too long
then<00:01:15.450> they<00:01:15.540> won't<00:01:15.720> actually<00:01:15.930> hold<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.530> torso

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
then they won't actually hold the torso

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.609 
then they won't actually hold the torso
together<00:01:17.659> there<00:01:18.659> will<00:01:18.720> be<00:01:18.780> some<00:01:19.080> wiggle<00:01:19.380> play

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
together there will be some wiggle play

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.200 
together there will be some wiggle play
in<00:01:19.740> there<00:01:19.890> or<00:01:20.009> if<00:01:20.250> they're<00:01:20.369> too<00:01:20.520> short<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:21.060> run

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
in there or if they're too short you run

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.289 
in there or if they're too short you run
a<00:01:21.240> risk<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.920> stripping<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.100> screw<00:01:23.280> holes<00:01:23.580> so

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
a risk of stripping the screw holes so

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.609 
a risk of stripping the screw holes so
after<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.720> take<00:01:24.840> those<00:01:25.049> out<00:01:25.200> I've<00:01:25.350> already

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
after you take those out I've already

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.440 
after you take those out I've already
taken<00:01:25.830> them<00:01:25.920> out<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.549> keep<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.060> video<00:01:27.210> from

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
taken them out to keep this video from

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.980 
taken them out to keep this video from
running<00:01:27.780> too<00:01:27.900> long<00:01:28.110> then<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.310> will<00:01:29.780> pull<00:01:30.780> him

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
running too long then you will pull him

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.609 
running too long then you will pull him
apart<00:01:31.460> like<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.119> be<00:01:34.079> careful<00:01:34.409> when<00:01:34.560> you

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
apart like this and be careful when you

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.210 
apart like this and be careful when you
reassemble<00:01:34.860> him<00:01:35.400> because<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.920> this<00:01:37.920> part

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
reassemble him because the this part

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.550 
reassemble him because the this part
right<00:01:38.369> here<00:01:38.430> comes<00:01:38.970> out<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.689> does<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.140> do

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
right here comes out and so does the do

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.850 
right here comes out and so does the do
the<00:01:40.680> arms<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.610> waist<00:01:42.409> so<00:01:43.409> make<00:01:43.649> sure<00:01:43.680> that

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
the arms and the waist so make sure that

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.929 
the arms and the waist so make sure that
everything<00:01:44.729> stays<00:01:44.899> set<00:01:45.899> in<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.320> just<00:01:46.560> right

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
everything stays set in it just right

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.160 
everything stays set in it just right
but<00:01:47.939> when<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.149> want<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.360> take<00:01:48.509> out<00:01:48.689> our<00:01:48.869> three

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
but when you want to take out our three

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.319 
but when you want to take out our three
gears<00:01:49.649> there's<00:01:50.189> one<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.850> will<00:01:50.970> go<00:01:51.090> right

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
gears there's one that will go right

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.330 
gears there's one that will go right
here<00:01:51.659> one<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.380> went<00:01:52.649> right<00:01:52.770> here<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.250> one

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
here one that went right here and one

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.139 
here one that went right here and one
that<00:01:53.430> went<00:01:53.610> right<00:01:53.759> here

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
that went right here

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.969 
that went right here
technically<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.170> only<00:01:55.290> need<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.619> take<00:01:55.829> out

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
technically you only need to take out

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.050 
technically you only need to take out
the<00:01:56.130> one<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.340> goes<00:01:56.490> out<00:01:56.640> along<00:01:56.850> right<00:01:57.030> here

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
the one that goes out along right here

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.910 
the one that goes out along right here
but<00:01:57.509> there's<00:01:58.110> no<00:01:58.259> reason<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.560> have<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.799> other

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
but there's no reason to have the other

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.359 
but there's no reason to have the other
ones<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.579> figure<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.860> it's<00:02:01.860> possible<00:02:02.280> for

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
ones in the figure and it's possible for

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.109 
ones in the figure and it's possible for
them<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.490> come<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:04.729> come<00:02:05.729> out<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.969> where

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
them to come on to come out of where

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.150 
them to come on to come out of where
they're<00:02:06.240> set<00:02:06.540> in<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.869> figure<00:02:07.140> while<00:02:07.950> you're

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
they're set in the figure while you're

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.350 
they're set in the figure while you're
putting<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.610> back<00:02:08.670> together<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.179> can

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
putting it back together and that can

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.089 
putting it back together and that can
leave<00:02:09.509> parts<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:10.020> rally<00:02:10.200> around<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:10.979> it's

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
leave parts that rally around so it's

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.619 
leave parts that rally around so it's
just<00:02:11.160> easy<00:02:11.400> it's<00:02:11.610> it's<00:02:11.730> easy<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.270> take<00:02:12.420> them

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
just easy it's it's easy to take them

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.250 
just easy it's it's easy to take them
all<00:02:12.750> out

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
all out

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.479 
all out
and<00:02:14.150> these<00:02:15.150> are<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.599> gears<00:02:15.840> right<00:02:16.170> here<00:02:16.489> now

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
and these are the gears right here now

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:18.800 
and these are the gears right here now
if<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.640> know<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:17.909> I'm<00:02:18.120> not<00:02:18.299> touching<00:02:18.690> these

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
if you know this I'm not touching these

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.289 
if you know this I'm not touching these
gears<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.440> my<00:02:19.590> hands<00:02:20.069> that's<00:02:20.730> because<00:02:21.120> they

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
gears of my hands that's because they

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.630 
gears of my hands that's because they
are<00:02:21.420> disgusting<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.319> can<00:02:22.769> see<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:22.950> big<00:02:23.280> glob<00:02:23.610> of

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
are disgusting you can see a big glob of

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.809 
are disgusting you can see a big glob of
grease<00:02:24.060> on<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.569> big<00:02:24.780> one<00:02:24.930> right<00:02:24.959> there<00:02:25.140> and

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
grease on that big one right there and

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.100 
grease on that big one right there and
that<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:29.819> gimmick<00:02:30.150> needs<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.810> grease

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
that the gimmick needs the grease

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.500 
that the gimmick needs the grease
because<00:02:31.610> even<00:02:32.610> with<00:02:32.760> this<00:02:32.940> much<00:02:33.120> grease

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
because even with this much grease

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.630 
because even with this much grease
there's<00:02:33.810> still<00:02:34.019> so<00:02:34.200> much<00:02:34.290> friction<00:02:34.650> because

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
there's still so much friction because

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.949 
there's still so much friction because
of<00:02:35.760> how<00:02:35.849> many<00:02:35.940> gears<00:02:36.330> are<00:02:36.540> in<00:02:36.569> this<00:02:36.750> gimmick

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
of how many gears are in this gimmick

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.270 
of how many gears are in this gimmick
right<00:02:37.200> here<00:02:37.470> that<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:39.060> still<00:02:39.860> sometimes<00:02:40.860> will

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
right here that it still sometimes will

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.319 
right here that it still sometimes will
skip<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.879> gear<00:02:42.420> rather<00:02:42.690> than<00:02:43.129> cause<00:02:44.129> the<00:02:44.489> arms

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
skip a gear rather than cause the arms

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:46.670 
skip a gear rather than cause the arms
to<00:02:45.569> move<00:02:45.720> how<00:02:45.870> they're<00:02:46.019> supposed<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.379> and<00:02:46.590> the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
to move how they're supposed to and the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.470 
to move how they're supposed to and the
way<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:46.890> gimmick<00:02:47.160> would<00:02:47.340> work<00:02:47.549> is<00:02:47.760> you<00:02:48.329> can

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
way the gimmick would work is you can

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.089 
way the gimmick would work is you can
see<00:02:48.629> a<00:02:48.660> gear<00:02:48.989> inside<00:02:49.290> of<00:02:49.500> there<00:02:49.680> you<00:02:50.400> lift<00:02:50.760> this

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
see a gear inside of there you lift this

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.770 
see a gear inside of there you lift this
lever<00:02:53.099> right<00:02:53.340> here<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:54.209> move<00:02:54.299> it<00:02:54.450> up<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.660> down

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
lever right here and move it up and down

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.599 
lever right here and move it up and down
and<00:02:55.140> that<00:02:55.200> would<00:02:55.470> cause<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.859> arms<00:02:56.129> are<00:02:56.250> linked

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
and that would cause the arms are linked

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.050 
and that would cause the arms are linked
to<00:02:57.180> how<00:02:57.359> to<00:02:57.870> perform<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.829> motion<00:02:59.459> in<00:02:59.609> tandem

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
to how to perform a motion in tandem

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.300 
to how to perform a motion in tandem
although<00:03:00.870> getting<00:03:01.049> this<00:03:01.349> lever<00:03:01.620> back<00:03:01.980> into

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
although getting this lever back into

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.770 
although getting this lever back into
place<00:03:02.549> is<00:03:02.849> kind<00:03:03.480> of<00:03:03.690> a<00:03:03.840> pain<00:03:07.430> there<00:03:08.430> we<00:03:08.579> go

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
place is kind of a pain there we go

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.300 
place is kind of a pain there we go
anyway<00:03:09.780> after<00:03:10.109> you<00:03:10.140> remove<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.440> gears<00:03:10.769> what

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
anyway after you remove the gears what

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.670 
anyway after you remove the gears what
you<00:03:11.400> want<00:03:11.579> to<00:03:11.670> do<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.940> reassemble<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.540> is<00:03:12.750> like

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
you want to do to reassemble it is like

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.979 
you want to do to reassemble it is like
I<00:03:13.709> said<00:03:13.950> make<00:03:14.099> sure<00:03:14.280> that<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.609> waist<00:03:14.849> the<00:03:15.510> arms

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
I said make sure that the waist the arms

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.690 
I said make sure that the waist the arms
including<00:03:16.560> these<00:03:16.680> two<00:03:16.950> gears<00:03:17.250> right<00:03:17.519> here

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
including these two gears right here

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.520 
including these two gears right here
which<00:03:17.849> are<00:03:18.030> linked<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.870> mechanism<00:03:19.440> inside

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
which are linked to the mechanism inside

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.379 
which are linked to the mechanism inside
the<00:03:19.769> arms<00:03:20.099> want<00:03:20.280> to<00:03:20.340> make<00:03:20.430> sure<00:03:20.579> those<00:03:20.880> are<00:03:21.120> set

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
the arms want to make sure those are set

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:22.819 
the arms want to make sure those are set
right<00:03:21.569> and<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:22.169> want<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.380> make<00:03:22.470> sure<00:03:22.500> that

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
right and you want to make sure that

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.039 
right and you want to make sure that
this<00:03:23.069> gorilla<00:03:23.489> head<00:03:23.880> that<00:03:24.120> is<00:03:24.269> set<00:03:24.599> right<00:03:24.750> -

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
this gorilla head that is set right -

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:31.129 
this gorilla head that is set right -
then<00:03:25.980> you<00:03:26.220> will<00:03:26.340> bring<00:03:26.609> this<00:03:26.760> down<00:03:30.019> bring<00:03:31.019> it

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
then you will bring this down bring it

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:36.740 
then you will bring this down bring it
together<00:03:34.730> bring<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.819> missile<00:03:36.120> pods<00:03:36.269> forward

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
together bring the missile pods forward

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.509 
together bring the missile pods forward
and<00:03:36.900> that<00:03:37.470> won't<00:03:37.620> give<00:03:37.769> you<00:03:37.859> access<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.250> the

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
and that won't give you access to the

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.849 
and that won't give you access to the
screw<00:03:38.730> holes<00:03:38.910> again<00:03:39.209> and<00:03:39.450> I'm<00:03:40.079> going<00:03:40.349> to<00:03:40.500> put

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
screw holes again and I'm going to put

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.059 
screw holes again and I'm going to put
two<00:03:41.160> screws<00:03:41.459> in<00:03:41.669> this<00:03:41.819> just<00:03:42.239> so<00:03:42.450> that<00:03:42.630> you<00:03:42.780> can

two screws in this just so that you can

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.879 
two screws in this just so that you can
see<00:03:44.069> what<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.310> final<00:03:44.430> product<00:03:44.940> is<00:03:45.060> like<00:03:45.299> and

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
see what the final product is like and

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:48.020 
see what the final product is like and
because<00:03:46.889> I<00:03:46.980> want<00:03:47.130> to<00:03:47.190> talk<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.519> you<00:03:47.609> about<00:03:47.730> how

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
because I want to talk to you about how

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.330 
because I want to talk to you about how
to<00:03:48.060> make<00:03:48.780> sure<00:03:49.290> they<00:03:49.530> have<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.859> arms<00:03:50.099> set

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
to make sure they have the arms set

00:03:50.340 --> 00:04:02.220 
to make sure they have the arms set
right<00:03:50.519> for<00:03:50.730> this<00:03:50.819> mod

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.430 

one<00:04:03.230> screw<00:04:03.560> in<00:04:04.000> and<00:04:05.000> the<00:04:05.270> next<00:04:05.420> screw<00:04:05.720> one

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
one screw in and the next screw one

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.930 
one screw in and the next screw one
thing<00:04:06.560> that's<00:04:06.710> nice<00:04:06.890> about<00:04:06.950> this<00:04:07.340> is<00:04:07.520> that<00:04:07.700> the

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
thing that's nice about this is that the

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.180 
thing that's nice about this is that the
all<00:04:08.630> four<00:04:08.960> screws<00:04:09.140> are<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.470> same<00:04:09.740> size<00:04:09.980> so<00:04:10.130> you

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
all four screws are the same size so you

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.340 
all four screws are the same size so you
don't<00:04:10.340> need<00:04:10.520> to<00:04:10.730> segregate<00:04:11.540> them<00:04:11.960> based<00:04:12.170> on

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
don't need to segregate them based on

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.660 
don't need to segregate them based on
where<00:04:12.560> they<00:04:12.680> come<00:04:12.860> from<00:04:12.890> like<00:04:13.190> don't<00:04:13.400> need<00:04:13.550> to

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
where they come from like don't need to

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.180 
where they come from like don't need to
keep<00:04:14.330> these<00:04:14.540> two<00:04:14.960> screws<00:04:15.740> separate<00:04:16.040> from

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
keep these two screws separate from

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.210 
keep these two screws separate from
these<00:04:16.340> two<00:04:16.640> screws<00:04:17.000> so<00:04:17.980> once<00:04:18.980> you<00:04:19.070> get<00:04:19.160> your

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
these two screws so once you get your

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.720 
these two screws so once you get your
screws<00:04:19.610> back<00:04:19.790> in<00:04:21.040> again<00:04:22.040> I'm<00:04:22.190> only<00:04:22.340> putting<00:04:22.550> in

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
screws back in again I'm only putting in

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.490 
screws back in again I'm only putting in
to<00:04:22.940> keep<00:04:23.360> the<00:04:23.540> running<00:04:23.810> time<00:04:23.960> of<00:04:23.990> this<00:04:24.200> video

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
to keep the running time of this video

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.690 
to keep the running time of this video
from<00:04:24.650> being<00:04:24.890> too<00:04:25.130> long<00:04:27.250> now<00:04:28.250> what<00:04:28.370> you<00:04:28.460> want<00:04:28.610> to

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
from being too long now what you want to

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:37.230 
from being too long now what you want to
do<00:04:28.820> for<00:04:29.120> the<00:04:29.210> arms<00:04:30.100> oops

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.930 

when<00:04:38.240> you<00:04:38.300> want<00:04:38.450> to<00:04:38.510> do<00:04:38.630> for<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:38.840> arms<00:04:39.110> is<00:04:39.940> on

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
when you want to do for the arms is on

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.310 
when you want to do for the arms is on
the<00:04:41.120> arms<00:04:41.360> there<00:04:41.540> is<00:04:41.630> a<00:04:41.660> little<00:04:41.930> button<00:04:42.290> right

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
the arms there is a little button right

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.710 
the arms there is a little button right
here<00:04:42.800> this<00:04:43.640> button<00:04:43.820> right<00:04:43.970> here<00:04:44.090> determines

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
here this button right here determines

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.450 
here this button right here determines
whether<00:04:44.900> the<00:04:45.140> gimmick<00:04:45.650> would<00:04:45.890> have<00:04:46.130> caused

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
whether the gimmick would have caused

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.150 
whether the gimmick would have caused
the<00:04:46.700> arms<00:04:47.000> to<00:04:47.330> move<00:04:48.080> in<00:04:48.440> and<00:04:48.590> out<00:04:48.800> when<00:04:49.100> you

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
the arms to move in and out when you

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.340 
the arms to move in and out when you
move<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:49.400> lever<00:04:49.550> or<00:04:49.880> cause<00:04:50.150> the<00:04:50.480> risk<00:04:50.930> to<00:04:51.080> spin

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
move the lever or cause the risk to spin

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.500 
move the lever or cause the risk to spin
the<00:04:51.920> reason<00:04:52.190> if<00:04:52.280> that<00:04:52.400> is<00:04:52.610> a<00:04:52.640> monkey<00:04:53.030> mode<00:04:53.330> it

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
the reason if that is a monkey mode it

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.900 
the reason if that is a monkey mode it
would<00:04:53.690> hewitt<00:04:54.260> bangus<00:04:54.680> just<00:04:55.100> like<00:04:55.340> this<00:04:55.610> and

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
would hewitt bangus just like this and

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.150 
would hewitt bangus just like this and
in<00:04:56.900> the<00:04:57.050> robot<00:04:57.320> mode<00:04:57.350> you<00:04:57.650> would<00:04:57.770> twist<00:04:58.010> his

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
in the robot mode you would twist his

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.770 
in the robot mode you would twist his
arm<00:04:58.280> so<00:04:58.550> if<00:04:58.670> yeah<00:04:58.820> this<00:04:59.090> swords<00:04:59.420> I<00:04:59.510> mean<00:04:59.630> like

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
arm so if yeah this swords I mean like

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.850 
arm so if yeah this swords I mean like
yet<00:05:00.020> a<00:05:00.050> spinning<00:05:00.890> arm<00:05:01.130> gimmick<00:05:01.520> and<00:05:02.650> the<00:05:03.650> way

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
yet a spinning arm gimmick and the way

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.320 
yet a spinning arm gimmick and the way
you<00:05:03.920> said<00:05:04.250> that<00:05:04.280> is<00:05:04.520> there's<00:05:04.730> a<00:05:04.790> button<00:05:05.030> on<00:05:05.180> the

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
you said that is there's a button on the

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.570 
you said that is there's a button on the
side<00:05:05.510> right<00:05:05.690> here<00:05:05.750> when<00:05:06.500> it's<00:05:06.650> up<00:05:06.860> it<00:05:07.310> causes

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
side right here when it's up it causes

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.150 
side right here when it's up it causes
the<00:05:08.000> arms<00:05:08.360> have<00:05:08.600> a<00:05:08.630> ratchet<00:05:09.140> when<00:05:09.770> it's<00:05:09.890> down

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
the arms have a ratchet when it's down

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.640 
the arms have a ratchet when it's down
it<00:05:10.520> causes<00:05:10.880> the<00:05:10.990> bicep<00:05:11.990> to<00:05:12.110> have<00:05:12.200> a<00:05:12.230> ratchet

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
it causes the bicep to have a ratchet

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.380 
it causes the bicep to have a ratchet
but<00:05:12.830> this<00:05:13.010> would<00:05:13.160> be<00:05:13.250> free<00:05:13.490> what<00:05:14.090> you<00:05:14.120> want<00:05:14.300> to

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
but this would be free what you want to

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.150 
but this would be free what you want to
do<00:05:14.480> is<00:05:14.570> make<00:05:14.750> sure<00:05:14.780> it<00:05:14.990> sets<00:05:15.290> up<00:05:15.560> so<00:05:15.890> that<00:05:16.040> the

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
do is make sure it sets up so that the

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.400 
do is make sure it sets up so that the
upper<00:05:16.280> arms<00:05:16.700> have<00:05:16.880> a<00:05:16.910> ratchet<00:05:17.390> gear<00:05:17.600> you<00:05:18.260> want

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
upper arms have a ratchet gear you want

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.900 
upper arms have a ratchet gear you want
to<00:05:18.500> do<00:05:18.590> that<00:05:18.740> because<00:05:18.890> this<00:05:19.310> is<00:05:19.370> going<00:05:19.640> to<00:05:19.760> bear

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
to do that because this is going to bear

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.030 
to do that because this is going to bear
far<00:05:20.150> more<00:05:20.330> weight<00:05:20.570> than<00:05:20.990> this<00:05:21.290> will<00:05:21.530> and<00:05:21.740> this

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
far more weight than this will and this

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.970 
far more weight than this will and this
is<00:05:22.100> already<00:05:22.460> kind<00:05:22.820> of<00:05:22.880> tight<00:05:23.090> enough<00:05:23.360> for<00:05:24.170> how

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
is already kind of tight enough for how

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.070 
is already kind of tight enough for how
much<00:05:25.130> weight<00:05:25.340> it's<00:05:25.580> going<00:05:25.790> to<00:05:25.940> hold<00:05:26.150> so<00:05:27.050> you

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
much weight it's going to hold so you

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.540 
much weight it's going to hold so you
want<00:05:27.470> to<00:05:27.530> make<00:05:27.650> sure<00:05:27.680> it's<00:05:27.920> set<00:05:28.130> like<00:05:28.310> that

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
want to make sure it's set like that

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.850 
want to make sure it's set like that
also<00:05:28.970> because<00:05:29.300> this<00:05:29.480> ratchet<00:05:29.900> here<00:05:30.140> sounds<00:05:30.800> a

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
also because this ratchet here sounds a

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.240 
also because this ratchet here sounds a
lot<00:05:31.070> less<00:05:31.340> scary<00:05:31.640> than<00:05:32.380> this<00:05:33.380> reg<00:05:33.650> right<00:05:33.920> here

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
lot less scary than this reg right here

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.520 
lot less scary than this reg right here
yeah<00:05:35.180> I<00:05:35.210> feel<00:05:35.420> like<00:05:35.570> I'm<00:05:35.870> going<00:05:36.050> to<00:05:36.140> break<00:05:36.290> it

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
yeah I feel like I'm going to break it

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.590 
yeah I feel like I'm going to break it
when<00:05:36.590> I<00:05:36.680> use<00:05:36.920> the<00:05:37.340> ratchet<00:05:37.490> of<00:05:37.790> the<00:05:37.970> bicep

swivel but this ratchet sounds fine I

mean<00:05:42.320> it<00:05:42.590> might<00:05:42.830> still<00:05:43.130> break<00:05:43.400> but<00:05:43.669> I<00:05:44.030> haven't

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:44.480

actually<00:05:44.690> opened<00:05:44.900> up<00:05:45.200> the<00:05:45.290> mechanism<00:05:45.440> to<00:05:45.890> see

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
actually opened up the mechanism to see

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.400 
actually opened up the mechanism to see
how<00:05:46.190> it<00:05:46.310> works<00:05:46.550> I'm<00:05:47.270> just<00:05:47.570> basing<00:05:47.870> it<00:05:47.960> on<00:05:48.080> how

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
how it works I'm just basing it on how

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.170 
how it works I'm just basing it on how
it<00:05:48.590> feels<00:05:48.860> now<00:05:49.490> you<00:05:49.580> know<00:05:49.669> once<00:05:49.850> you<00:05:49.970> have<00:05:50.090> it

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
it feels now you know once you have it

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.000 
it feels now you know once you have it
set<00:05:50.390> like<00:05:50.450> that<00:05:50.780> then<00:05:51.080> the<00:05:51.260> arms<00:05:51.590> are<00:05:51.830> really

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
set like that then the arms are really

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.250 
set like that then the arms are really
nice<00:05:52.310> easy<00:05:52.730> to<00:05:53.090> use<00:05:53.300> and<00:05:53.570> they're<00:05:54.140> not

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
nice easy to use and they're not

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.670
