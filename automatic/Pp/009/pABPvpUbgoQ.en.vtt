like a big pizza the ceiling came down

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.840 
like a big pizza the ceiling came down
and<00:02:55.100> which<00:02:56.100> probably<00:02:56.340> meant<00:02:56.549> up<00:02:56.610> being<00:02:56.760> the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
and which probably meant up being the

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.190 
and which probably meant up being the
best<00:02:57.000> thing<00:02:57.150> because<00:02:57.569> I<00:02:57.720> got<00:02:57.870> hit<00:02:58.019> with<00:02:58.049> the

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
best thing because I got hit with the

best thing because I got hit with the
big<00:02:58.410> piece<00:02:58.680> but<00:02:58.980> then<00:02:59.100> I<00:02:59.160> thought<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.519> smaller

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
big piece but then I thought the smaller

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.160 
big piece but then I thought the smaller
stuff<00:03:00.090> was<00:03:00.209> falling<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.690> would<00:03:00.810> land<00:03:00.959> on<00:03:01.110> the
