00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.210
 hi guys do you hear the voice of evil 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.739
 borscht and today tell you something 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.669
 interesting about very thick very 

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:22.169
 Slow American Fri ninth 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:22.169
 level t95 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.449
 so a piece of history development machine 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.070
 was started back in the distant forty-third 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.159
 was based on a friend 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.390
 american under osago exactly t28 and in 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:57.339
 the result was manufactured but only 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.710
 a couple of copies of which did not have time 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:00.729
 war yeah no rich story either 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.129
 give nor take but are you right now 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:05.440
 You can see for yourself that t95 is 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.299
 nothing like 28 with a couple 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.190
 welded extra caterpillar is very 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.020
 heavily thickened and forehead and huge 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.140
 a bunch of faucet but let's talk about everything 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.440
 order first booking 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.890
 important part of this fri sau 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.750
 at 305 millimeters strongly and even under 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.970
 corners and even a huge mask 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.780
 in the middle just like a thick hull 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.700
 terminator 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.380
 every time I see fat in sight 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.080
 forehead this turtles imagine gender 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.850
 on which yelling you do not drink 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.130
 and after all, really fuck you punch yes 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.830
 there certainly is a much weaker one 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.540
 NLD and another pen style which is also possible 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.210
 reach they too have much more 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.280
 weak booking but it is very difficult 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.470
 do at a distance get it right a 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.880
 cover the same nld on t95 not at all 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.040
 is no labor enough 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.570
 find only a tiny pebble okay i already 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.430
 talked a lot about frontal armor 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.160
 now let's see what's in there 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.260
 and in the boards we have 152 millimeters 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.690
 would be a little if it comes to 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.000
 shooting at right angles but there is 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.370
 screens and they can sometimes play evil 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.229
 a joke but in the stern the armor is very nice 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.149
 only 51 millimeter 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.340
 but yes it does not matter that the most important thing to 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.830
 Laba about it as protected as possible 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.630
 many of you already know what you will 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.750
 pay for what armor up 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.000
 speed and it seems the whole 95 is not so 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.739
 and Incredibly many mouse really does nothing 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.360
 not even worth it as it is below 5 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.700
 about eighty eight tons 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.010
 but due to the fact that our dear Western 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.260
 partners stinted on a powerful engine 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.610
 and not just stingy and just planted 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.530
 engine power here is 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.480
 only 510 horsepower that 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.870
 frankly little for such a huge mass 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.120
 and in the end we have a speed which 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.120
 depresses yes it is the right word 13 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.950
 kilometers per hour whenever you 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.180
 you will press the w button you will 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.180
 take about that sound 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:59.100
 Perhaps this is just creepiness 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.170
 spinning is also bad 18 degrees in 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.030
 second but understandably that of course 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.070
 strong armor must be something to hang these 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.380
 if it were a motor like an e50m 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.420
 then this accelerated kilometers to 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.430
 45 per hour, oh, how I would like to 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.800
 look but then it would be 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.750
 absolute cheat im balance and so all 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.010
 normally got strong armor and your 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.959
 pay with speed 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.150
 Well, now it's time to talk about 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.640
 rent is quite a fit 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.340
 five millimeter cannon with good 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.819
 750 damage with a good break in two hundred 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.200
 seventy six millimeters gold 320 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.390
 three to four shots 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.510
 per minute with accuracy 036 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.430
 and a data rate of 2.4 seconds per 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.980
 Generally quite adequate gun for pt 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.469
 Level 9 there is nothing more to add 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.689
 now about the equipment classic 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:46.700
 rammer and mixing to on it 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:48.799
 important and the third module I would of course 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.980
 put all the same fan because 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:54.409
 with the Brotherhood but at least for a little bit but 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.109
 percentile slightly improved mobility 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:59.209
 because it's hard to handle 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.889
 Of course, it would be possible to improve and review in 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.889
 in the end he is not so good here 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:06.109
 for the ninth level only 380 meters 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:07.159
 in my opinion improve the dynamics of dpm yes 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:10.340
 everything else 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:12.530
 weapon as for the gameplay on t95 then 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.569
 here everything is possible simply choose 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.000
 direction where do you get there and 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.829
 Fight direction preferably 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.660
 so that you are not easy to get around from the flanks 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.580
 yes and some kind of shelter 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.530
 need to art not got in urban 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.169
 maps is not a problem himmelsdorf 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.240
 banana and what you need but unfortunately 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.770
 on open maps such as steppe 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.270
 not very sweet in 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.220
 features if there are our dear ones 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.659
 gunners not one and not two 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.340
 if you get to the top then you 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:38.750
 virtually no one is able to pierce 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.270
 except perhaps some object 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.490
 704 and that is, it will fall into the NLD 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.560
 blah blah blah he gets lucky and so on etc. 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.449
 tenths of course already powerful cannons 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.310
 more but honestly from this your 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:52.370
 the gameplay is not and how absolutely does not change 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.349
 beware you can except that in 215 then 83 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.030
 who charges a landmine he can just 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:58.280
 on the ball shoot there pick you up i 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.080
 hope somewhere 400 or 300 and so on 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.880
 Gadget on gadget look and disassemble though 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.490
 Of course in his place I would be afraid much 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.740
 more because to punch a in 215 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.620
 183 you don't need to apply so much 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.099
 effort and steadily take from him 750 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.370
 hp 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:17.120
 well now let's summarize t95 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.759
 very slowly very armored with 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.740
 quite a very specific gun 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:24.199
 gameplay is not everyone is ready to endure such 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.880
 but the speed is sometimes super thick 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:28.729
 armor is still able to play a decisive 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.930
 the role and then further down the branch is waiting for you 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.090
 t110 e3 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.430
 here really good pt sake 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.620
 it can and be tolerated 13 kilometers 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.849
 an hour well and i'm finishing my 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.680
 wishes and suggestions about 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:41.510
 the following reviews you can leave in 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.030
