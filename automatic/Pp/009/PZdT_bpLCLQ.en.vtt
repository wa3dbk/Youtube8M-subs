00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.919 

so<00:00:01.709> this<00:00:02.159> is<00:00:02.370> a<00:00:02.399> video<00:00:02.939> response<00:00:03.120> for<00:00:03.689> a<00:00:03.720> nearby

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
so this is a video response for a nearby

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.730 
so this is a video response for a nearby
gamer<00:00:04.259> and<00:00:04.790> use<00:00:05.930> cobblestone<00:00:06.930> generators<00:00:07.410> and

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
gamer and use cobblestone generators and

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.749 
gamer and use cobblestone generators and
so<00:00:08.280> forth<00:00:08.690> now<00:00:09.690> this<00:00:10.530> is<00:00:10.590> in<00:00:11.160> front<00:00:11.429> of<00:00:11.490> me<00:00:11.580> here

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
so forth now this is in front of me here

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.060 
so forth now this is in front of me here
is<00:00:11.910> your<00:00:12.420> basic<00:00:12.929> cobblestone<00:00:13.530> generator<00:00:13.559> and

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
is your basic cobblestone generator and

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.189 
is your basic cobblestone generator and
so<00:00:14.670> you've<00:00:15.030> built<00:00:15.360> at<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.780> very<00:00:16.109> beginning

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
so you've built at the very beginning

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.859 
so you've built at the very beginning
and<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:17.010> have<00:00:17.190> there<00:00:17.460> because<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:18.720> have

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
and you have there because that you have

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.019 
and you have there because that you have
you<00:00:19.080> put<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.320> block<00:00:20.010> breaker<00:00:20.310> under<00:00:20.730> this

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
you put a block breaker under this

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.210 
you put a block breaker under this
section<00:00:21.600> right<00:00:21.779> here<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.260> constantly<00:00:22.949> break

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
section right here to constantly break

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.370 
section right here to constantly break
that<00:00:23.430> block<00:00:23.730> which<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.750> know<00:00:24.779> works<00:00:25.140> just

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
that block which is you know works just

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.179 
that block which is you know works just
fine<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:25.949> forth<00:00:26.779> now<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.590> designs<00:00:29.070> that

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
fine and so forth now the designs that

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.849 
fine and so forth now the designs that
you've<00:00:29.400> been<00:00:29.490> going<00:00:29.789> with<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:30.330> far<00:00:30.750> are<00:00:31.529> kind

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
you've been going with so far are kind

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.979 
you've been going with so far are kind
of<00:00:31.890> putting<00:00:32.099> them<00:00:32.460> all<00:00:32.880> around<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:33.750> forth

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
of putting them all around and so forth

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.240 
of putting them all around and so forth
and<00:00:34.170> then<00:00:34.320> stacking<00:00:35.040> them<00:00:35.940> up<00:00:36.090> now<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:37.500> it

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
and then stacking them up now it it

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.520 
and then stacking them up now it it
works<00:00:38.550> well<00:00:39.030> well<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.809> works<00:00:39.960> ok<00:00:40.230> because<00:00:40.350> it

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
works well well it works ok because it

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.229 
works well well it works ok because it
only<00:00:40.680> what<00:00:40.860> uses<00:00:41.250> one<00:00:41.430> source<00:00:41.700> block<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.120> so

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
only what uses one source block and so

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.720 
only what uses one source block and so
forth<00:00:42.480> but<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:42.960> does<00:00:43.110> what<00:00:43.290> look<00:00:43.440> look<00:00:44.370> rather

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
forth but it does what look look rather

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.240 
forth but it does what look look rather
large<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.270> clunky<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.530> kinda<00:00:46.739> uses<00:00:46.829> quite

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
large and clunky and it kinda uses quite

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.490 
large and clunky and it kinda uses quite
a<00:00:47.280> few<00:00:47.610> resources<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:48.930> forth<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.469> I

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
a few resources and so forth so I

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.380 
a few resources and so forth so I
thought<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.860> might<00:00:49.950> show<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.520> another<00:00:50.910> design

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
thought I might show you another design

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.740 
thought I might show you another design
that<00:00:52.199> would<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:53.460> know<00:00:53.550> look<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.360> little<00:00:54.510> bit

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
that would you know look a little bit

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.099 
that would you know look a little bit
better<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.289> use<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.250> few<00:00:56.579> less<00:00:56.789> resources<00:00:57.390> now

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
better and use a few less resources now

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.220 
better and use a few less resources now
this<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:59.329> essentially<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.480> exact<00:01:00.960> same

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
this is essentially that exact same

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.100 
this is essentially that exact same
pattern<00:01:01.530> except<00:01:02.219> mirrored<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.870> would<00:01:04.019> be

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
pattern except mirrored so that would be

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.020 
pattern except mirrored so that would be
your<00:01:04.170> lab<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> source<00:01:04.650> lock<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.129> that's<00:01:05.880> your

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
your lab a source lock and that's your

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.399 
your lab a source lock and that's your
water<00:01:06.210> there<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.630> that's<00:01:06.750> where<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
water there and that's where the the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.010 
water there and that's where the the
cobblestone<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:07.979> made<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.750> you<00:01:09.750> know<00:01:09.840> you've

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
cobblestone is made and you know you've

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.690 
cobblestone is made and you know you've
got<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.170> block<00:01:10.799> breaker<00:01:11.010> there<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.520> block

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
got a block breaker there and a block

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.940 
got a block breaker there and a block
breaker<00:01:11.880> there<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.390> then<00:01:13.049> another<00:01:13.320> set<00:01:13.860> of

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
breaker there and then another set of

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.350 
breaker there and then another set of
water<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.460> makes<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.729> on<00:01:14.850> both<00:01:15.000> sides<00:01:15.240> of

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
water so it makes it on both sides of

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.190 
water so it makes it on both sides of
the<00:01:15.479> lava<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:17.270> you<00:01:18.270> just<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.630> know<00:01:18.750> turn<00:01:19.080> it

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
the lava and you just you know turn it

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.999 
the lava and you just you know turn it
on<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:19.680> forth<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.340> it'll<00:01:21.299> will<00:01:22.259> make

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
on and so forth and it'll will make

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.980 
on and so forth and it'll will make
cobblestone<00:01:23.610> now<00:01:24.180> cool<00:01:24.509> thing<00:01:24.689> about<00:01:24.780> this

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
cobblestone now cool thing about this

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.190 
cobblestone now cool thing about this
one<00:01:25.200> as<00:01:25.290> well<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.759> can<00:01:26.939> lay<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.390> out<00:01:27.509> just

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
one as well is you can lay it out just

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.620 
one as well is you can lay it out just
like<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.409> track<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.400> can<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:30.060> know<00:01:30.390> it's

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
like a track so you can you know it's

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.810 
like a track so you can you know it's
infinitely<00:01:31.020> expandable<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:32.579> one<00:01:32.729> is

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
infinitely expandable and this one is

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.280 
infinitely expandable and this one is
actually<00:01:32.970> currently<00:01:33.270> running<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.780> single

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
actually currently running on a single

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.350 
actually currently running on a single
source<00:01:34.530> block<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.979> lava<00:01:35.159> as<00:01:35.340> well<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:36.030> puts

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
source block of lava as well this puts

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.679 
source block of lava as well this puts
out<00:01:36.570> six<00:01:37.020> cobblestone<00:01:37.650> per<00:01:37.860> tick<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.689> here's

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
out six cobblestone per tick and here's

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.140 
out six cobblestone per tick and here's
the<00:01:40.259> makings<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.829> another<00:01:40.920> one<00:01:41.369> for<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.850> I

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
the makings of another one for you I

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.149 
the makings of another one for you I
kind<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.600> made<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.320> part<00:01:43.590> way<00:01:43.649> through<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.130> you

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
kind of made it part way through so you

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.280 
kind of made it part way through so you
would<00:01:44.340> put<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.610> water<00:01:44.820> here<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.840> would<00:01:45.990> flow

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
would put the water here it would flow

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.080 
would put the water here it would flow
and<00:01:46.590> into<00:01:47.009> this<00:01:47.130> channel<00:01:47.490> here<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:47.820> we<00:01:47.939> would

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
and into this channel here so we would

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.359 
and into this channel here so we would
never<00:01:48.210> go<00:01:48.450> forward<00:01:48.899> then<00:01:49.470> you'd<00:01:49.619> have<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
never go forward then you'd have the the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.190 
never go forward then you'd have the the
lava<00:01:50.579> here<00:01:50.909> which<00:01:51.329> would<00:01:51.479> flow<00:01:51.720> out<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.020> touch

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
lava here which would flow out and touch

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.719 
lava here which would flow out and touch
the<00:01:52.380> water<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.710> then<00:01:52.829> turn<00:01:53.040> into<00:01:53.220> cobblestone

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
the water and then turn into cobblestone

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.240 
the water and then turn into cobblestone
and<00:01:54.140> I'll<00:01:55.140> show<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.470> what<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.710> looks<00:01:55.829> like

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
and I'll show you what that looks like

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.940 
and I'll show you what that looks like
from<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.640> edge<00:01:56.790> there<00:01:57.439> just<00:01:58.439> in<00:01:58.560> front<00:01:58.740> so

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
from the edge there just in front so

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.010 
from the edge there just in front so
kind<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.520> have<00:01:59.610> an<00:01:59.700> idea<00:01:59.759> on<00:01:59.969> how<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.270> lay<00:02:00.869> out

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
kind of have an idea on how to lay out

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.389 
kind of have an idea on how to lay out
the<00:02:01.170> bricks<00:02:01.469> if<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.799> wanted<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.130> build<00:02:02.310> one

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
the bricks if you wanted to build one

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.219 
the bricks if you wanted to build one
like<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.850> that's<00:02:03.570> kind<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.840> what<00:02:03.960> looks<00:02:04.170> like

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
like that that's kind of what looks like

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.319 
like that that's kind of what looks like
yeah<00:02:04.680> so<00:02:04.890> you've<00:02:05.040> got<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.219> diagonal<00:02:05.939> bear<00:02:06.149> a

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
yeah so you've got a diagonal bear a

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.479 
yeah so you've got a diagonal bear a
diagonal<00:02:06.930> there<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.500> then<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:07.979> one<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.399> the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
diagonal there and then that one in the

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.729 
diagonal there and then that one in the
middle<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.819> then<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.869> put<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.379> block

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
middle and then you put the block

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.170 
middle and then you put the block
breakers<00:02:11.220> along<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.180> middle<00:02:12.480> stretch

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
breakers along that middle stretch

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.960 
breakers along that middle stretch
and<00:02:14.180> just<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.319> show<00:02:15.349> you<00:02:15.530> it<00:02:15.860> in<00:02:16.189> action<00:02:16.580> with<00:02:16.939> a

these<00:03:42.739> crafting<00:03:43.609> benches<00:03:43.910> you<00:03:44.780> don't<00:03:45.109> have<00:03:45.349> to

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
these crafting benches you don't have to

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.439 
these crafting benches you don't have to
worry<00:03:45.739> about<00:03:45.889> putting<00:03:46.400> them<00:03:46.609> like<00:03:46.760> this<00:03:46.970> it's

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:47.449 
worry about putting them like this it's

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:48.970 
worry about putting them like this it's
only<00:03:47.629> when<00:03:47.720> you<00:03:47.840> chain<00:03:48.230> them<00:03:48.440> that<00:03:48.769> there's

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
only when you chain them that there's

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.800 
only when you chain them that there's
there's<00:03:49.519> an<00:03:49.669> issue<00:03:49.819> of<00:03:50.030> them<00:03:50.239> possibly

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
there's an issue of them possibly

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.119 
there's an issue of them possibly
blowing<00:03:51.169> up<00:03:51.260> or<00:03:51.410> anything<00:03:51.470> like<00:03:51.680> that<00:03:51.829> and

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
blowing up or anything like that and

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:53.699 
blowing up or anything like that and
redstone<00:03:52.579> engines<00:03:53.000> will<00:03:53.150> never<00:03:53.299> blow<00:03:53.540> up

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
redstone engines will never blow up

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.649 
redstone engines will never blow up
unless<00:03:54.709> you<00:03:54.919> have<00:03:54.949> like<00:03:55.699> a<00:03:55.730> combustion<00:03:56.120> engine

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:56.659 
unless you have like a combustion engine

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:00.039 
unless you have like a combustion engine
or<00:03:56.930> steam<00:03:57.590> engine<00:03:57.919> behind<00:03:58.389> the<00:03:59.389> redstone

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
or steam engine behind the redstone

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.069 
or steam engine behind the redstone
engine<00:04:00.379> and<00:04:00.530> that<00:04:01.129> would<00:04:01.310> be<00:04:01.340> an<00:04:01.549> issue<00:04:01.669> and

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
engine and that would be an issue and

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.770 
engine and that would be an issue and
also<00:04:03.079> you<00:04:03.440> don't<00:04:03.739> have<00:04:03.889> to<00:04:04.280> have<00:04:04.310> any<00:04:04.819> pieces

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
also you don't have to have any pieces

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.550 
also you don't have to have any pieces
between<00:04:06.079> these<00:04:07.000> so<00:04:08.000> you<00:04:08.419> don't<00:04:08.840> as<00:04:09.290> long<00:04:09.530> as

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
between these so you don't as long as

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.280 
between these so you don't as long as
the<00:04:09.829> the<00:04:10.340> dark<00:04:10.669> side<00:04:11.000> is<00:04:11.389> from<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:11.900> chest<00:04:12.169> that

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
the the dark side is from the chest that

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.379 
the the dark side is from the chest that
you<00:04:12.379> want<00:04:12.530> to<00:04:12.590> pull<00:04:12.799> from<00:04:13.010> and<00:04:13.280> the<00:04:13.940> light<00:04:14.120> side

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
you want to pull from and the light side

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:15.879 
you want to pull from and the light side
is<00:04:14.629> to<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:15.019> chest<00:04:15.199> that<00:04:15.349> you<00:04:15.440> want<00:04:15.560> to<00:04:15.590> push<00:04:15.769> it

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
is to the chest that you want to push it

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.089 
is to the chest that you want to push it
into<00:04:16.150> your<00:04:17.150> totally<00:04:17.599> cool<00:04:17.810> so<00:04:18.650> you<00:04:18.739> could<00:04:18.949> make

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
into your totally cool so you could make

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:22.060 
into your totally cool so you could make
it<00:04:19.220> a<00:04:19.280> little<00:04:19.400> bit<00:04:20.120> shorter<00:04:20.419> there<00:04:20.690> and<00:04:20.900> so<00:04:21.799> as

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
it a little bit shorter there and so as

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.649 
it a little bit shorter there and so as
you<00:04:22.190> can<00:04:22.280> see<00:04:22.400> I've<00:04:22.520> made<00:04:22.669> like<00:04:22.820> 59<00:04:23.150> diamonds

00:04:23.649 --> 00:04:23.659 
you can see I've made like 59 diamonds

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:25.610 
you can see I've made like 59 diamonds
from<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:23.870> set<00:04:24.169> up<00:04:24.260> already<00:04:24.409> and

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
from the set up already and

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.140 
from the set up already and
that's<00:04:25.830> just<00:04:26.010> to<00:04:26.160> show<00:04:26.340> you<00:04:26.370> that<00:04:26.490> these<00:04:26.820> these

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
that's just to show you that these these

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.870 
that's just to show you that these these
Pistons<00:04:27.990> will<00:04:28.139> never<00:04:28.410> ever<00:04:29.040> blow<00:04:29.520> up<00:04:29.729> or

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
Pistons will never ever blow up or

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.030 
Pistons will never ever blow up or
anything<00:04:30.000> like<00:04:30.240> that<00:04:30.360> as<00:04:30.750> long<00:04:30.900> as<00:04:31.139> no<00:04:31.860> they're

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
anything like that as long as no they're

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.000 
anything like that as long as no they're
in<00:04:32.130> that<00:04:32.190> sort<00:04:32.490> of<00:04:32.520> a<00:04:32.610> configuration<00:04:32.850> there

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
in that sort of a configuration there

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.159 
in that sort of a configuration there
and<00:04:35.120> so<00:04:36.120> yeah<00:04:36.240> that's<00:04:36.360> basically<00:04:36.720> I<00:04:37.020> might

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
and so yeah that's basically I might

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:38.270 
and so yeah that's basically I might
have<00:04:37.260> it<00:04:37.350> setup<00:04:37.530> I've<00:04:37.680> got<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:37.919> pneumatic

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
have it setup I've got the pneumatic

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.620 
have it setup I've got the pneumatic
tubes<00:04:38.490> and<00:04:38.669> so<00:04:38.760> forth<00:04:39.000> but<00:04:39.120> I<00:04:39.180> don't<00:04:39.389> have<00:04:39.510> them

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
tubes and so forth but I don't have them

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.689 
tubes and so forth but I don't have them
in<00:04:39.690> saw<00:04:39.900> red<00:04:40.199> stone<00:04:40.500> mag<00:04:40.710> pneumatic<00:04:41.370> tubes<00:04:41.550> I

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
in saw red stone mag pneumatic tubes I

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:43.310 
in saw red stone mag pneumatic tubes I
just<00:04:41.880> have<00:04:42.000> a<00:04:42.030> readout<00:04:42.540> way<00:04:42.780> a<00:04:42.810> wire<00:04:43.139> in

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
just have a readout way a wire in

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.590 
just have a readout way a wire in
between<00:04:43.590> them<00:04:43.740> just<00:04:44.400> because<00:04:44.669> it<00:04:45.060> uses<00:04:45.389> less

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
between them just because it uses less

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.010 
between them just because it uses less
redstone<00:04:46.229> this<00:04:46.440> way<00:04:47.210> so<00:04:48.210> yeah<00:04:48.360> that's<00:04:48.780> pretty

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
redstone this way so yeah that's pretty

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.590 
redstone this way so yeah that's pretty
much<00:04:49.500> it<00:04:49.650> now<00:04:50.250> this<00:04:50.729> system<00:04:51.030> is<00:04:51.150> a<00:04:51.210> lot<00:04:51.449> faster

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
much it now this system is a lot faster

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.400 
much it now this system is a lot faster
than<00:04:51.990> a<00:04:52.760> logistics<00:04:53.760> pipe<00:04:53.970> system<00:04:54.410> just

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
than a logistics pipe system just

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.390 
than a logistics pipe system just
because<00:04:55.820> it<00:04:56.820> doesn't<00:04:57.180> have<00:04:57.210> to<00:04:57.479> call<00:04:57.960> the<00:04:58.830> the

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
because it doesn't have to call the the

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.670 
because it doesn't have to call the the
cobblestone<00:04:59.850> out<00:05:00.020> the<00:05:01.020> logistics<00:05:01.169> pipe

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
cobblestone out the logistics pipe

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.710 
cobblestone out the logistics pipe
systems<00:05:02.039> call<00:05:02.310> them<00:05:02.490> rather<00:05:02.639> slowly<00:05:03.060> or<00:05:03.449> is

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
systems call them rather slowly or is

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.029 
systems call them rather slowly or is
this<00:05:03.810> one<00:05:03.870> just<00:05:04.169> you<00:05:04.470> know<00:05:04.560> like<00:05:04.710> i<00:05:04.800> said<00:05:04.949> it

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
this one just you know like i said it

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:07.340 
this one just you know like i said it
pulls<00:05:05.550> it<00:05:05.729> right<00:05:05.760> out<00:05:06.120> and<00:05:06.270> it<00:05:06.930> pulls<00:05:07.169> it<00:05:07.289> a

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
pulls it right out and it pulls it a

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.580 
pulls it right out and it pulls it a
quite<00:05:07.680> a<00:05:07.710> good<00:05:07.919> speed<00:05:08.280> once<00:05:08.610> you<00:05:08.760> have<00:05:08.970> the

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
quite a good speed once you have the

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
quite a good speed once you have the
system<00:05:10.590> going<00:05:10.889> and<00:05:11.039> so<00:05:11.160> forth<00:05:11.430> so<00:05:11.669> that<00:05:11.900> is<00:05:12.900> a

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
system going and so forth so that is a

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.360 
system going and so forth so that is a
my<00:05:14.610> take<00:05:15.000> on<00:05:15.150> the<00:05:15.270> cobblestone<00:05:15.690> generator<00:05:16.370> now

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
my take on the cobblestone generator now

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.029 
my take on the cobblestone generator now
I<00:05:17.400> got<00:05:17.639> the<00:05:17.760> actual<00:05:18.000> plan<00:05:18.210> itself<00:05:18.600> from

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
I got the actual plan itself from

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.710 
I got the actual plan itself from
someone<00:05:20.039> else<00:05:20.220> I<00:05:20.610> don't<00:05:21.030> remember<00:05:21.180> when<00:05:21.479> I<00:05:21.510> got

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
someone else I don't remember when I got

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.330 
someone else I don't remember when I got
it<00:05:21.870> or<00:05:21.990> anything<00:05:22.169> like<00:05:22.289> that<00:05:22.410> but<00:05:22.680> it's<00:05:22.919> it's

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
it or anything like that but it's it's

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.420 
it or anything like that but it's it's
the<00:05:23.430> one<00:05:23.610> I<00:05:23.639> use<00:05:23.970> and<00:05:24.210> I<00:05:25.169> think<00:05:25.949> it<00:05:26.039> works<00:05:26.220> quite

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
the one I use and I think it works quite

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.199 
the one I use and I think it works quite
well<00:05:26.490> so<00:05:26.850> it's<00:05:27.449> hopeless<00:05:27.900> helps
