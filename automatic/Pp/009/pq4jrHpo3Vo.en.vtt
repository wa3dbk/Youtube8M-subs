you<00:01:59.430> know<00:01:59.689> lately<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.780> seems<00:02:00.960> like<00:02:01.020> there's<00:02:01.229> a

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
you know lately it seems like there's a

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.380 
you know lately it seems like there's a
different<00:02:01.590> trend<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:01.979> NFL<00:02:02.430> where<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.939> lot<00:02:03.270> of

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
different trend in NFL where a lot of

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.480 
different trend in NFL where a lot of
teams<00:02:03.600> are<00:02:03.810> going<00:02:03.930> with<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.350> two<00:02:04.590> back<00:02:04.740> set<00:02:05.040> but

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
teams are going with a two back set but

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.920 
teams are going with a two back set but
we've<00:02:06.030> been<00:02:06.149> seeing<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.390> lot<00:02:06.540> more<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.780> the

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
we've been seeing a lot more of the

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.330 
we've been seeing a lot more of the
smaller<00:02:07.380> faster<00:02:08.129> fact

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
smaller faster fact

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.010 
smaller faster fact
which<00:02:09.520> I<00:02:09.849> would<00:02:10.330> think<00:02:10.420> would<00:02:10.569> increase<00:02:10.840> your

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
which I would think would increase your

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.600 
which I would think would increase your
value<00:02:11.170> because<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:11.709> bigger<00:02:11.950> stronger<00:02:12.250> backs

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
value because the bigger stronger backs

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.339 
value because the bigger stronger backs
have<00:02:13.180> really<00:02:13.420> been<00:02:13.569> out<00:02:13.690> there<00:02:13.900> what's<00:02:14.290> your

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
have really been out there what's your

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.420 
have really been out there what's your
thoughts<00:02:14.620> on<00:02:14.800> that

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
thoughts on that

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.080 
thoughts on that
well<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.330> definitely<00:02:17.260> want<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.680> be<00:02:17.830> above<00:02:18.489> 220

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
was a bigger bet that maybe didn't had
