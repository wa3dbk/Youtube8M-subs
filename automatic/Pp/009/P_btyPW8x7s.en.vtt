nice to keep it extra cool now looking

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.889 
nice to keep it extra cool now looking
at<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.530> drive<00:00:58.800> itself<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.640> mean<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.420> takes<00:01:00.690> the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
at the drive itself I mean it takes the

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.540 
at the drive itself I mean it takes the
air<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:01.260> from<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> side<00:01:01.829> where<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.129> fan<00:01:02.340> is

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
air in from the side where the fan is

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.520 
air in from the side where the fan is
and<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.910> spits<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.270> out<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.570> back<00:01:03.750> ok<00:01:04.350> there's

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
and it spits it out the back ok there's

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.950 
and it spits it out the back ok there's
some<00:01:04.589> ventilation<00:01:05.280> there<00:01:05.460> happening<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.479> open

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
some ventilation there happening to open

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.390 
some ventilation there happening to open
it<00:01:07.049> up<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.439> take<00:01:07.590> out<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.890> two<00:01:08.040> screws

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
it up you just take out the two screws

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.630 
it up you just take out the two screws
and<00:01:08.610> you'll<00:01:08.760> obviously<00:01:09.450> see<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.369> LED<00:01:11.369> fan

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
and you'll obviously see the LED fan

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.969 
and you'll obviously see the LED fan
there<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.119> then<00:01:12.750> if<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.990> flip<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.470> up<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
there and then if you flip it up on the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.770 
there and then if you flip it up on the
other<00:01:14.070> side<00:01:14.189> that's<00:01:15.090> where<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.420> hard<00:01:15.600> drive

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
other side that's where the hard drive

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.620 
other side that's where the hard drive
goes<00:01:16.020> ok<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:16.680> install<00:01:17.220> up<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.580> 2<00:01:17.880> terabyte

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
goes ok so install up to a 2 terabyte

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.840 
goes ok so install up to a 2 terabyte

in mind that in order to use a 3.0
device<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.310> need<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.579> motherboard<00:01:57.180> that

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
device you need a motherboard that

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.370 
device you need a motherboard that
supports<00:01:57.990> USB<00:01:58.860> 3.0<00:01:59.520> also<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.930> need<00:02:01.110> the

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
supports USB 3.0 also and you need the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.340 
supports USB 3.0 also and you need the
USB<00:02:01.829> cable<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.219> supports<00:02:02.729> 3.0<00:02:03.270> first<00:02:04.110> things

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
USB cable that supports 3.0 first things

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.289 
USB cable that supports 3.0 first things
first<00:02:04.439> do<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.159> have<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.490> drivers<00:02:05.880> installed

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
first do you have the drivers installed

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.779 
first do you have the drivers installed
in<00:02:06.420> Windows<00:02:06.780> if<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.439> don't<00:02:07.619> have<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.950> USB<00:02:08.190> 3.0

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
in Windows if you don't have the USB 3.0

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.729 
in Windows if you don't have the USB 3.0
drivers<00:02:09.209> installed<00:02:09.690> then<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.170> will<00:02:10.319> not<00:02:10.500> work

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
drivers installed then it will not work

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.530 
drivers installed then it will not work
so<00:02:11.340> make<00:02:11.550> sure<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.790> have<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.090> installed

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
so make sure you have that installed

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.790 
so make sure you have that installed
then<00:02:13.140> once<00:02:13.530> this

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
then once this

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.040 
then once this
detect<00:02:14.070> it<00:02:14.220> properly<00:02:14.730> then<00:02:15.300> you'll<00:02:15.600> see<00:02:15.810> J

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
detect it properly then you'll see J

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.740 
detect it properly then you'll see J

talk about USB 3.0 we're thinking about
10<00:03:02.370> times<00:03:02.610> faster<00:03:03.300> than<00:03:03.450> USB<00:03:03.810> 2.0<00:03:04.620> well<00:03:05.010> it's

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
10 times faster than USB 2.0 well it's

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.850 
10 times faster than USB 2.0 well it's
not<00:03:05.280> really<00:03:05.460> 10<00:03:05.820> times<00:03:06.060> faster<00:03:06.630> but<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.620> burst

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
not really 10 times faster but the burst

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.480 
not really 10 times faster but the burst

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
speed on a USB 2.0 device okay so a USB

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
30 Meg's per second okay so this one's

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.910 
30 Meg's per second okay so this one's
way<00:03:18.209> faster<00:03:18.810> than<00:03:18.840> 30<00:03:19.170> minutes<00:03:19.470> per<00:03:19.590> second

quick test I'm copying a 260 Meg file it

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.670 
quick test I'm copying a 260 Meg file it
took<00:03:27.239> about<00:03:27.330> three<00:03:27.690> seconds<00:03:28.110> to<00:03:28.170> copy<00:03:28.440> that

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
took about three seconds to copy that

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.020 
took about three seconds to copy that
from<00:03:29.520> my<00:03:29.970> C<00:03:30.239> to<00:03:30.450> my<00:03:30.600> D<00:03:30.660> okay<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:31.910> here's<00:03:32.910> some

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
from my C to my D okay and here's some

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.449 
from my C to my D okay and here's some
more<00:03:33.060> tests<00:03:33.600> creating<00:03:34.020> a<00:03:34.110> file<00:03:34.290> only<00:03:34.590> on<00:03:35.040> the

really really fast performance you're

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.940 
really really fast performance you're
getting<00:03:44.700> on<00:03:44.820> USB<00:03:45.060> 3.0<00:03:45.660> for<00:03:45.959> sure<00:03:46.200> it<00:03:46.470> is<00:03:46.530> worth

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
getting on USB 3.0 for sure it is worth

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.640 
getting on USB 3.0 for sure it is worth
it<00:03:47.190> I<00:03:47.340> did<00:03:47.880> notice<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.300> difference<00:03:48.780> reading<00:03:49.560> a

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
it I did notice the difference reading a

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.770 
it I did notice the difference reading a
file<00:03:49.860> from<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.130> drive<00:03:50.459> as<00:03:50.640> well<00:03:50.790> very<00:03:51.150> fast<00:03:51.420> as

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
file from the drive as well very fast as

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.530 
file from the drive as well very fast as
you<00:03:52.320> can<00:03:52.470> see<00:03:52.620> there<00:03:52.860> for<00:03:53.280> a<00:03:53.310> 260<00:03:54.090> Meg<00:03:54.239> file

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
you can see there for a 260 Meg file

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.070 
you can see there for a 260 Meg file
really<00:03:55.470> really<00:03:56.040> fast<00:03:56.310> speeds<00:03:56.700> and<00:03:57.000> I<00:03:57.690> ran<00:03:58.050> the

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
really really fast speeds and I ran the

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.520 
really really fast speeds and I ran the
software<00:03:58.860> Sandra<00:03:59.310> here<00:03:59.790> benchmarks<00:04:00.720> on<00:04:00.959> this

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
software Sandra here benchmarks on this

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.310 
software Sandra here benchmarks on this
and<00:04:01.739> compared<00:04:02.190> this<00:04:02.850> drive<00:04:03.570> running<00:04:03.959> up<00:04:04.080> that

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
and compared this drive running up that

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.550 
and compared this drive running up that

USB 2.0 and also firewire and you can
see<00:04:10.739> here<00:04:10.920> what<00:04:11.040> I'm<00:04:11.130> comparing<00:04:11.519> it<00:04:11.700> against

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180

it into a USB 2.0 and that's really what

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.390 
it into a USB 2.0 and that's really what
you<00:04:36.599> want<00:04:36.750> to<00:04:36.840> see<00:04:36.960> is<00:04:37.080> how<00:04:37.470> much<00:04:37.650> faster<00:04:37.949> is<00:04:38.250> at

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
you want to see is how much faster is at

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.390 
you want to see is how much faster is at
the<00:04:38.490> USB<00:04:38.879> 2.0<00:04:39.389> is<00:04:39.599> it<00:04:40.050> still<00:04:40.289> fast<00:04:40.560> enough<00:04:40.830> well

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
the USB 2.0 is it still fast enough well

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.850 
the USB 2.0 is it still fast enough well

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
2.0 for this same drive so I took out

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.490 
2.0 for this same drive so I took out
the<00:04:47.550> cable<00:04:47.849> plugged<00:04:48.090> it<00:04:48.210> in<00:04:48.300> and<00:04:48.449> still<00:04:49.199> beat

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
the cable plugged it in and still beat

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.080 
the cable plugged it in and still beat
all<00:04:49.740> of<00:04:49.889> those<00:04:49.979> drives<00:04:50.280> just<00:04:50.400> by<00:04:50.699> app<00:04:50.849> by<00:04:51.060> a

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
all of those drives just by app by a

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.909 
all of those drives just by app by a
little<00:04:51.360> bit<00:04:51.479> there<00:04:51.720> but<00:04:52.259> you<00:04:52.379> can<00:04:52.530> see<00:04:52.710> that

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
little bit there but you can see that

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.700 
little bit there but you can see that
the<00:04:53.310> score<00:04:53.669> is<00:04:53.819> now<00:04:53.849> less<00:04:54.539> okay<00:04:55.229> it's<00:04:55.379> not<00:04:55.560> as

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
the score is now less okay it's not as

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.029 
the score is now less okay it's not as
high<00:04:55.979> as<00:04:56.310> USB<00:04:56.759> 3.0<00:04:57.270> definitely<00:04:58.169> much<00:04:58.409> faster

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
high as USB 3.0 definitely much faster

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:00.800 
high as USB 3.0 definitely much faster
I<00:04:59.069> noticed<00:04:59.729> it<00:04:59.879> for<00:05:00.090> example<00:05:00.360> you<00:05:00.539> know<00:05:00.690> when

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
I noticed it for example you know when

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.390 
I noticed it for example you know when
you<00:05:00.900> plug<00:05:01.110> in<00:05:01.139> your<00:05:01.319> hard<00:05:01.500> drive<00:05:01.740> and<00:05:01.949> if<00:05:02.250> it's

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
you plug in your hard drive and if it's

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.029 
you plug in your hard drive and if it's
got<00:05:02.550> video<00:05:02.819> files<00:05:03.060> how<00:05:03.330> how<00:05:04.050> it<00:05:04.560> will<00:05:04.740> show<00:05:04.889> the

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
got video files how how it will show the

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:07.580 
got video files how how it will show the
thumbnails<00:05:05.460> of<00:05:05.699> all<00:05:05.819> your<00:05:06.000> video<00:05:06.240> files<00:05:06.590> those

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
thumbnails of all your video files those

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.189 
thumbnails of all your video files those
thumbnails<00:05:07.979> loaded<00:05:08.699> really<00:05:09.270> really<00:05:09.509> quick<00:05:09.810> it

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
thumbnails loaded really really quick it

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.680 
thumbnails loaded really really quick it
got<00:05:10.500> the<00:05:10.680> frame<00:05:10.979> and<00:05:11.250> and<00:05:11.699> you<00:05:12.030> could<00:05:12.210> see<00:05:12.479> the

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
got the frame and and you could see the

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.409 
got the frame and and you could see the
thumbnail<00:05:13.289> of<00:05:13.469> each<00:05:13.620> video<00:05:13.919> really<00:05:14.909> really

fast in the Windows Explorer so you
could<00:05:18.090> tell<00:05:18.330> the<00:05:18.599> difference<00:05:18.629> just<00:05:19.050> by

00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:19.379 
could tell the difference just by

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:21.339 
could tell the difference just by
looking<00:05:20.069> at<00:05:20.159> the<00:05:20.310> stuff<00:05:20.580> loading
