00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:10.740
 Yes , this creature 26 led mounted 1600 lm hand light 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:17.160
 For example, I would like to attach it to a bicycle and run it 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.640
 I'm a writer bicycle distribution here in the not compared it to is the here in Japan 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.070
 But 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.130
 It is considered to be very bright as a bicycle light 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.900
 I 'm attached to the bike at this mount but 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:32.410
 We sell in Ebetsu first 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:35.360
 It is very convenient without fear of break because it can be Velcro and Oh bar 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.680
 First on the left is general 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.680
 The light is attached 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.910
 It looks like this 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.720
 On the right side you will receive a chestnut 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.500
 please 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.640
 I think if you narrow down and tell 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.640
 Please take it as a omen 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.960
 At first we irradiate from general light 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.930
 It looks like this 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:14.080
 Women's moat is attached and it is Zaizu, but this is the widest state 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:18.159
 Now it's a cycling road but it's a bit weird 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:21.280
 Until about 4 meters in the Keizan meter 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:25.659
 I think it is light that you know the landlord 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.259
 By Please do not to have got crowded Ballmer is a little cable of this gear Gaoki 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.450
 Well 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:31.110
 Try to go off Kuritsu 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.400
 This is it ぇ 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.920
 This sugar 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.610
 It is a successful person 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.720
 I think you can understand that it is completely different from Takimoto 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:48.200
 When Since it has with diaphragm function I mean Ii' without the other is a little far away Toka war 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.200
 I think it would be fine if you adjust it like this 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:55.439
 It is this brightness in low mode in high mode in 

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:55.439
 In the flash 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:05.340
 Then I would like to actually run First of all, because it is not common here 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.340
 Please come a little polish behind Well 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.520
 It's a light but still light time, but still it's still 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.510
 It is quite easy to learn 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.480
 In front of you 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:24.610
 It is feeling that we do not understand that we went to meter ahead 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.610
 So it 's a bit scary if it's speed 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.980
 No, at 3:00 of 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.940
 I if without another at all scary things 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.780
 Huh 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.100
 I also want to show you how much it is actually held in the riders eyes 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.760
 I will 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.549
 It is Henn 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.549
 First of all, it's a general light, so let's go a little 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.850
 Vaguely 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.310
 There is a white line on the left to feel a bit ahead 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:16.659
 In this way 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:18.730
 I think that it is a level that you can understand that there is a little understanding 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:21.000
 Now I am wearing Clie 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:25.460
 It is also Yes it is this 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.570
 It is so wide that everything from the end of the road to the end 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.570
 It tells Sera 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.450
 It becomes like this 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.710
 The basic art of gear is 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.710
 You'll know better In the photo with the beautiful 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.900
 I think there is no fear that it is scary and dark even at night if it is this 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:03.520
 I will finish the explanation above It is a very bright light, so even a crepe can be irradiated to people 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:07.860
 Do not look with your own eyes 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.860
 Thank you for your attention
