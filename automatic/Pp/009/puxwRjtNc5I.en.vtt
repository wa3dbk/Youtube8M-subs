00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
the overall design on these is really

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.589 
the overall design on these is really
good<00:02:27.719> I<00:02:30.799> think<00:02:31.799> I<00:02:31.859> eat<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.159> dog<00:02:32.430> let<00:02:33.359> me<00:02:33.450> put

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.610 
good I think I eat the dog let me put
another<00:02:33.629> dog<00:02:34.049> in<00:02:34.260> prayer<00:02:34.530> for<00:02:34.799> you<00:02:35.000> see<00:02:36.000> that

another dog in prayer for you see that

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.830 
another dog in prayer for you see that

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
so wouldn't you say you get a lot of

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.569 
so wouldn't you say you get a lot of
gummies<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.469> mean<00:02:40.859> the<00:02:40.980> shapes<00:02:41.219> are<00:02:41.370> just

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
gummies I mean the shapes are just

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.330 
gummies I mean the shapes are just
really<00:02:41.849> odd<00:02:42.349> we're<00:02:43.349> not<00:02:43.530> what<00:02:43.709> you<00:02:43.859> see<00:02:44.069> on<00:02:44.219> the

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
really odd we're not what you see on the

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.420 
really odd we're not what you see on the
box<00:02:44.549> so<00:02:45.389> I'm<00:02:45.480> gonna<00:02:45.629> say<00:02:45.810> for<00:02:46.049> these<00:02:46.430> you're

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
box so I'm gonna say for these you're

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.390 
box so I'm gonna say for these you're
getting<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:47.790> I'm<00:02:48.780> gonna<00:02:48.930> eat<00:02:49.109> an<00:02:49.340> orange<00:02:50.340> one

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
getting it I'm gonna eat an orange one

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.149 
getting it I'm gonna eat an orange one
so<00:02:53.400> now<00:02:53.519> I'm<00:02:53.609> holding<00:02:53.939> up<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.180> card<00:02:55.159> because

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
so now I'm holding up the card because

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.089 
so now I'm holding up the card because
there<00:02:56.459> is<00:02:56.579> a<00:02:56.609> code<00:02:56.939> on<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.530> I'm<00:02:58.530> not<00:02:58.590> gonna<00:02:58.859> show

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
there is a code on it I'm not gonna show

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.770 
there is a code on it I'm not gonna show
you<00:02:59.129> but<00:02:59.639> I'm<00:02:59.760> gonna<00:02:59.939> actually<00:03:00.150> go<00:03:00.329> try<00:03:00.719> to

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
you but I'm gonna actually go try to

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.589 
you but I'm gonna actually go try to
enter<00:03:01.169> it<00:03:01.370> okay<00:03:02.370> so<00:03:02.760> let's<00:03:02.939> do<00:03:03.060> that<00:03:03.180> now<00:03:03.329> okay

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
enter it okay so let's do that now okay

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.050 
enter it okay so let's do that now okay
so<00:03:04.319> step<00:03:04.739> one<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.010> guess<00:03:05.310> is<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.639> create<00:03:05.939> an

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
so step one I guess is to create an

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.729 
so step one I guess is to create an
account<00:03:06.299> so<00:03:06.449> I<00:03:06.540> have<00:03:06.659> all<00:03:06.840> my<00:03:06.870> information<00:03:07.230> put

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
account so I have all my information put

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.709 
account so I have all my information put
in<00:03:07.889> and<00:03:08.310> wants<00:03:08.609> to<00:03:08.669> know<00:03:08.790> if<00:03:08.849> you're<00:03:08.969> 13<00:03:09.480> years

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:09.719 
in and wants to know if you're 13 years

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:11.330 
in and wants to know if you're 13 years
or<00:03:09.780> older<00:03:10.169> so<00:03:10.290> you<00:03:10.319> have<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.680> check<00:03:10.919> that<00:03:10.949> box

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
or older so you have to check that box

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.539 
or older so you have to check that box
and<00:03:11.790> unless<00:03:12.329> you<00:03:12.510> choose<00:03:12.840> your<00:03:13.199> favorite
