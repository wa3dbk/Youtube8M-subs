them<00:01:38.640> in<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.820> back<00:01:40.040> so<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.070> have<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.610> be

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700

your partner that you can't get revived

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.850 
your partner that you can't get revived

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
or that they're gonna get killed before

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.880 
or that they're gonna get killed before
they<00:01:47.189> get<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.399> chance<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.759> revive<00:01:48.090> you

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
so the first I don't know 10 minutes or

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.060 
so the first I don't know 10 minutes or
so<00:01:52.480> it's<00:01:52.930> just<00:01:53.110> basically<00:01:53.740> taking<00:01:54.520> it<00:01:54.640> slow

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
so it's just basically taking it slow

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.230

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
but you can use the sniper rifle as much

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.470 
but you can use the sniper rifle as much
as<00:02:32.090> you<00:02:32.240> want<00:02:32.480> really<00:02:32.780> like<00:02:34.120> but<00:02:35.120> just<00:02:35.330> be<00:02:35.450> sure

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.280 
to save enough to take out those
juggernauts<00:02:37.490> it's<00:02:37.760> I<00:02:38.030> think<00:02:38.330> for<00:02:38.690> headshots

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
juggernauts it's I think for headshots

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.170 
juggernauts it's I think for headshots
or<00:02:39.800> three<00:02:40.010> head<00:02:40.130> shots<00:02:40.370> to<00:02:40.610> kill<00:02:40.760> one<00:02:40.940> of<00:02:40.970> them

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
or three head shots to kill one of them

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.900 
or three head shots to kill one of them
and<00:02:41.360> when<00:02:41.840> when<00:02:42.260> both<00:02:43.100> you<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:43.760> your<00:02:43.850> partner

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
and when when both you and your partner

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.280 
and when when both you and your partner

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.010 
are just unloading on one of the
juggernauts<00:02:45.710> they<00:02:46.700> go<00:02:47.270> down<00:02:47.450> pretty<00:02:47.690> quick

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
juggernauts they go down pretty quick

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.310

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
cut it want to get to it because I

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.520 
cut it want to get to it because I
should<00:03:59.360> do<00:03:59.630> that<00:03:59.810> just<00:04:00.020> to<00:04:00.080> make<00:04:00.200> it<00:04:00.230> easier

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
should do that just to make it easier

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.380 
should do that just to make it easier
anyway<00:04:03.190> but<00:04:04.190> the<00:04:04.310> second<00:04:04.700> checkpoint<00:04:05.030> is

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
anyway but the second checkpoint is

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.150 
anyway but the second checkpoint is
going<00:04:05.570> to<00:04:05.660> include<00:04:05.989> or<00:04:06.380> the<00:04:06.470> second<00:04:06.830> video<00:04:07.010> and

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
going to include or the second video and

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.390 
going to include or the second video and
this<00:04:07.220> is<00:04:07.400> going<00:04:07.640> to<00:04:07.730> be<00:04:07.910> the<00:04:08.150> majority<00:04:08.440> of<00:04:09.440> the

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
this is going to be the majority of the

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.100 
this is going to be the majority of the
difficulty<00:04:10.940> of<00:04:11.060> this<00:04:11.180> level<00:04:11.540> like<00:04:11.780> all<00:04:11.989> the

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
difficulty of this level like all the

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.800 
difficulty of this level like all the
juggernauts<00:04:12.880> that<00:04:13.880> the<00:04:14.209> area<00:04:14.480> where<00:04:14.600> you're

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
juggernauts that the area where you're

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.870 
juggernauts that the area where you're
sniping<00:04:15.080> out<00:04:15.500> of<00:04:15.830> the<00:04:16.520> broken<00:04:16.940> plane<00:04:17.450> and

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
sniping out of the broken plane and

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.320 
sniping out of the broken plane and
getting<00:04:19.880> down<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.330> hill<00:04:20.510> hmm<00:04:22.090> so<00:04:23.090> check<00:04:23.300> that

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
getting down the hill hmm so check that

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.640 
getting down the hill hmm so check that
out<00:04:23.450> if<00:04:23.600> that's<00:04:23.870> the<00:04:23.990> part<00:04:24.169> that<00:04:24.320> you're<00:04:24.440> stuck

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
out if that's the part that you're stuck

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:33.370 
out if that's the part that you're stuck
on

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.930 

so<00:04:34.380> just<00:04:34.560> keep<00:04:34.740> slowly<00:04:35.220> inching<00:04:35.760> your<00:04:35.790> way

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
so just keep slowly inching your way

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.540 
so just keep slowly inching your way
around<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.330> corners<00:04:36.720> just<00:04:36.900> kind<00:04:37.080> of<00:04:37.550> taking

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
around the corners just kind of taking

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.820 
around the corners just kind of taking
your<00:04:38.669> time<00:04:38.820> the<00:04:39.660> radar<00:04:39.870> result<00:04:40.230> yeah

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
your time the radar result yeah

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.350 
your time the radar result yeah
the<00:04:41.010> radar<00:04:41.310> was<00:04:41.430> kind<00:04:41.669> of<00:04:41.729> weird<00:04:41.910> on<00:04:42.000> this<00:04:42.150> one

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
the radar was kind of weird on this one

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.980 
the radar was kind of weird on this one
it<00:04:43.490> it<00:04:44.490> seems<00:04:44.760> to<00:04:44.790> be<00:04:44.940> much<00:04:45.150> more<00:04:45.180> zoomed<00:04:45.780> out

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
it it seems to be much more zoomed out

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.490 
it it seems to be much more zoomed out
than<00:04:46.830> it<00:04:46.919> normally<00:04:47.040> is<00:04:47.449> like<00:04:48.449> on<00:04:48.630> multiplayer

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
than it normally is like on multiplayer

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.620 
than it normally is like on multiplayer
or<00:04:49.530> anything<00:04:50.250> like<00:04:50.550> even<00:04:51.240> though<00:04:51.330> that<00:04:51.419> red

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
or anything like even though that red

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.170 
or anything like even though that red
dot<00:04:51.810> looks<00:04:52.229> very<00:04:52.620> close<00:04:52.949> he's<00:04:53.669> actually<00:04:53.880> not

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
dot looks very close he's actually not

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.430 
dot looks very close he's actually not
too<00:04:54.419> close<00:04:54.750> and<00:04:55.110> it<00:04:56.100> just<00:04:56.430> felt<00:04:56.580> a<00:04:56.669> little<00:04:56.699> bit

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
too close and it just felt a little bit

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.560 
too close and it just felt a little bit
not<00:04:58.440> harder<00:04:58.800> just<00:04:59.010> different<00:04:59.850> to<00:05:00.060> just<00:05:00.090> oh

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
not harder just different to just oh

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.330 
not harder just different to just oh
where<00:05:00.870> where<00:05:01.260> isn't<00:05:01.560> it<00:05:01.620> yeah<00:05:01.860> like<00:05:02.160> you'd

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
where where isn't it yeah like you'd

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.740 
where where isn't it yeah like you'd
think<00:05:02.580> that<00:05:02.820> that<00:05:02.850> red<00:05:03.210> dot<00:05:03.389> would<00:05:03.570> just

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
think that that red dot would just

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.450 
think that that red dot would just
pinpoint<00:05:04.050> him<00:05:04.470> on<00:05:04.560> the<00:05:04.650> map<00:05:04.830> considering<00:05:05.370> how

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
pinpoint him on the map considering how

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.460 
pinpoint him on the map considering how
close<00:05:05.669> he<00:05:05.910> looks<00:05:06.120> but<00:05:06.330> it's<00:05:06.510> just<00:05:06.600> it's<00:05:07.169> harder

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
close he looks but it's just it's harder

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:15.640 
close he looks but it's just it's harder
to<00:05:07.560> judge<00:05:07.800> on<00:05:07.979> this<00:05:08.100> map<00:05:08.310> for<00:05:08.520> some<00:05:08.639> reason

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.990 

every<00:05:16.650> fucker<00:05:16.950> on<00:05:17.280> the<00:05:17.340> other<00:05:17.610> team<00:05:17.850> has

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
every fucker on the other team has

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.050 
every fucker on the other team has
helmets<00:05:18.389> too<00:05:18.650> so<00:05:19.650> one<00:05:20.220> headshot<00:05:20.639> won't<00:05:20.820> kill

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
helmets too so one headshot won't kill

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.300 
helmets too so one headshot won't kill
him<00:05:21.260> what<00:05:22.260> about<00:05:22.320> face<00:05:22.710> shot<00:05:23.930> what<00:05:25.310> the

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
him what about face shot what the

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.850 
him what about face shot what the
helmets<00:05:26.610> have<00:05:26.729> visors<00:05:27.180> -<00:05:27.419> no<00:05:27.600> I<00:05:27.900> haven't

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
helmets have visors - no I haven't

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.730 
helmets have visors - no I haven't
gotten<00:05:29.070> close<00:05:29.370> enough<00:05:29.669> to<00:05:29.820> the<00:05:29.880> subject

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.920 

you<00:05:33.580> think<00:05:33.789> you<00:05:34.120> know<00:05:34.240> one<00:05:34.449> right<00:05:34.599> through<00:05:34.840> the

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
you think you know one right through the

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.409 
you think you know one right through the
nose<00:05:35.169> that<00:05:35.410> do<00:05:35.590> the<00:05:35.740> same<00:05:35.949> trick<00:05:37.080> pull<00:05:38.080> a<00:05:38.110> JFK

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
nose that do the same trick pull a JFK

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:46.890 
nose that do the same trick pull a JFK
yeah<00:05:40.419> I<00:05:40.630> don't<00:05:40.810> know<00:05:45.449> so<00:05:46.449> we're<00:05:46.569> getting<00:05:46.690> real

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
yeah I don't know so we're getting real

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.100 
yeah I don't know so we're getting real
close<00:05:47.139> to<00:05:47.349> the<00:05:47.470> Intel<00:05:48.389> don't<00:05:49.389> pick<00:05:49.900> up<00:05:49.990> the

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
close to the Intel don't pick up the

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.420 
close to the Intel don't pick up the
Intel<00:05:50.440> as<00:05:50.590> soon<00:05:50.740> as<00:05:50.830> you<00:05:50.889> get<00:05:51.009> to<00:05:51.160> it<00:05:51.280> there's

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
Intel as soon as you get to it there's

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.240 
Intel as soon as you get to it there's
usually<00:05:51.720> four<00:05:52.720> or<00:05:52.870> five<00:05:53.050> guys<00:05:53.289> kind<00:05:53.740> of<00:05:53.800> behind

usually four or five guys kind of behind

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.770 
usually four or five guys kind of behind
the<00:05:54.460> Intel<00:05:54.970> and<00:05:56.819> usually<00:05:57.819> we<00:05:57.940> wait<00:05:58.150> to<00:05:58.419> snipe

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780 
the Intel and usually we wait to snipe

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.439 
the Intel and usually we wait to snipe
like<00:05:59.110> I<00:05:59.289> I<00:05:59.560> try<00:05:59.830> to<00:05:59.889> snipe<00:06:00.160> as<00:06:00.340> many<00:06:00.520> guys<00:06:00.759> out

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:01.449 
like I I try to snipe as many guys out

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:03.480 
like I I try to snipe as many guys out
of<00:06:01.479> the<00:06:01.630> next<00:06:01.960> area<00:06:02.259> before<00:06:02.979> I<00:06:03.009> pick<00:06:03.250> up<00:06:03.280> the

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
of the next area before I pick up the

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:04.409 
of the next area before I pick up the
Intel<00:06:03.819> as<00:06:03.940> well

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
Intel as well

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.620 
Intel as well
this<00:06:05.050> isn't<00:06:05.349> collectible<00:06:05.949> Intel<00:06:06.250> is<00:06:06.430> it<00:06:06.630> no

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630

out<00:06:20.460> so<00:06:21.460> this<00:06:21.849> is<00:06:21.909> like<00:06:22.210> the<00:06:22.330> easiest<00:06:22.449> way<00:06:22.720> to

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750 
out so this is like the easiest way to

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.270 
out so this is like the easiest way to
get<00:06:22.900> to<00:06:22.960> the<00:06:23.259> Intel<00:06:23.560> but<00:06:23.590> on<00:06:23.949> the<00:06:24.039> other<00:06:24.159> side

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 
get to the Intel but on the other side

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.620 
get to the Intel but on the other side
of<00:06:24.460> that<00:06:24.610> plane<00:06:24.880> this<00:06:25.060> is<00:06:25.150> what<00:06:25.330> I<00:06:25.360> was<00:06:25.449> just

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
of that plane this is what I was just

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.300 
of that plane this is what I was just
talking<00:06:25.930> about<00:06:25.990> a<00:06:26.110> second<00:06:26.470> ago<00:06:26.530> there's

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
talking about a second ago there's

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.180 
talking about a second ago there's
usually<00:06:27.520> a<00:06:27.940> few<00:06:28.360> guys<00:06:28.539> running<00:06:28.990> around<00:06:29.190> back

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.190 
usually a few guys running around back

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.559 
usually a few guys running around back
there<00:06:31.590> so<00:06:32.590> be<00:06:32.710> sure<00:06:32.740> to<00:06:32.860> take<00:06:33.069> them<00:06:33.280> all<00:06:33.430> out

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:33.569 
there so be sure to take them all out

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:36.029 
there so be sure to take them all out
then<00:06:34.569> you<00:06:34.720> can<00:06:34.870> usually<00:06:34.990> flank<00:06:35.620> them<00:06:35.800> pretty

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:36.039 
then you can usually flank them pretty

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:38.820 
then you can usually flank them pretty
easy<00:06:36.250> if<00:06:36.550> your<00:06:36.759> other<00:06:36.940> teammate<00:06:37.330> is<00:06:37.830> it's

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 
easy if your other teammate is it's

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.610 
easy if your other teammate is it's
coming<00:06:39.039> from<00:06:39.130> the<00:06:39.250> main<00:06:39.370> road
