00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
it's pretty overpowered what he does but

it's pretty overpowered what he does but
he<00:00:57.300> gets<00:00:57.480> just<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:57.870> much<00:00:58.079> money<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
he gets just so much money in the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.650 
he gets just so much money in the
beginning<00:00:59.129> no<00:00:59.309> like<00:00:59.609> it's<00:00:59.760> not<00:01:00.030> even<00:01:00.090> right

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
beginning no like it's not even right

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.710 
beginning no like it's not even right
like<00:01:01.050> watch<00:01:01.320> what<00:01:01.500> he<00:01:01.590> puts<00:01:01.800> down<00:01:01.890> right<00:01:02.309> here

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:13.250 

it's<00:01:08.299> awesome

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:24.520 

wait<00:01:13.920> for<00:01:14.340> it

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.490 

so<00:01:25.070> he<00:01:25.190> does<00:01:25.400> he<00:01:26.210> upgrades<00:01:26.600> that<00:01:26.810> all<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:27.380> way

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
so he does he upgrades that all the way

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.240 
so he does he upgrades that all the way
to<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:28.100> very<00:01:28.220> top

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.840 

see<00:01:34.850> there<00:01:35.180> we<00:01:35.360> go<00:01:35.540> that<00:01:35.870> is<00:01:36.260> the<00:01:37.160> hacker<00:01:37.430> right

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
see there we go that is the hacker right

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:45.400 
see there we go that is the hacker right
there<00:01:42.520> there<00:01:43.520> is<00:01:43.640> no<00:01:43.910> way<00:01:44.270> that<00:01:44.300> he<00:01:44.900> could<00:01:45.200> get

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
there there is no way that he could get

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:53.470 
there there is no way that he could get
that<00:01:45.620> in<00:01:45.979> that<00:01:46.400> amount<00:01:46.700> of<00:01:46.820> time<00:01:47.920> no<00:01:48.920> way

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.640 

so<00:01:54.110> I'm<00:01:54.470> basically<00:01:54.710> just<00:01:56.140> like<00:01:57.140> right<00:01:57.470> now

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
so I'm basically just like right now

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.530 
so I'm basically just like right now
just<00:01:57.890> kind<00:01:58.130> of<00:01:58.160> stunned<00:01:58.730> when<00:01:59.060> i<00:01:59.120> was<00:01:59.330> playing

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
just kind of stunned when i was playing

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.390 
just kind of stunned when i was playing
this<00:01:59.780> game<00:02:00.020> I<00:02:00.080> was<00:02:00.350> like<00:02:00.560> whoa<00:02:00.800> wait<00:02:01.160> what's

going on here how do you get that so
quick<00:02:03.410> and<00:02:03.590> then<00:02:03.710> I<00:02:03.740> realized<00:02:04.220> he<00:02:04.490> might<00:02:04.640> have

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
quick and then I realized he might have

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.780

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
he also puts down a whole bunch of those

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.590 
he also puts down a whole bunch of those
starting<00:02:18.480> monkeys<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:20.670> what<00:02:21.180> did<00:02:21.300> they<00:02:21.360> call

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
starting monkeys the what did they call

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.550 
starting monkeys the what did they call
the<00:02:21.810> dirt<00:02:22.020> monkeys<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:23.120> he<00:02:24.120> just<00:02:24.330> puts<00:02:25.290> all

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
the dirt monkeys and he just puts all

those<00:02:25.950> two<00:02:26.130> juggernaut<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.910> it's<00:02:27.660> just

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
those two juggernaut and it's just

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:37.890 
those two juggernaut and it's just
impossible<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:30.060> beat<00:02:30.240> this<00:02:30.510> guy

guess<00:03:00.280> that's<00:03:00.310> his<00:03:00.670> choice<00:03:03.569> so<00:03:04.569> as<00:03:04.629> you<00:03:04.750> can

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
guess that's his choice so as you can

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.780 
guess that's his choice so as you can
see<00:03:05.019> now<00:03:05.200> he<00:03:05.260> has<00:03:05.530> one<00:03:05.769> juggernaut<00:03:06.280> down<00:03:06.549> now

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
see now he has one juggernaut down now

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
see now he has one juggernaut down now
just<00:03:07.209> gonna<00:03:07.540> get<00:03:07.750> a<00:03:07.780> whole<00:03:08.049> bunch<00:03:08.079> of<00:03:08.530> them

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.240 

so<00:03:19.410> I'm<00:03:19.560> doing<00:03:20.400> pretty<00:03:20.760> well<00:03:20.910> actually<00:03:21.450> but<00:03:22.319> at

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
so I'm doing pretty well actually but at

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.140 
so I'm doing pretty well actually but at
this<00:03:23.550> point<00:03:23.819> I<00:03:24.030> realized<00:03:24.510> that<00:03:24.660> this<00:03:24.840> guy<00:03:25.080> is

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
this point I realized that this guy is

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.449 
this point I realized that this guy is
for<00:03:27.150> sure<00:03:27.390> a<00:03:27.420> hacker<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.319> there's<00:03:28.770> no<00:03:29.190> way

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
for sure a hacker and there's no way

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.190 
for sure a hacker and there's no way
that<00:03:29.760> I'm<00:03:29.910> going<00:03:30.360> to<00:03:30.480> pull<00:03:30.660> off<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.840> win

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
that I'm going to pull off the win

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:41.660 
that I'm going to pull off the win
against<00:03:31.680> him

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.760 

Oh<00:03:41.730> in<00:03:42.390> case<00:03:42.630> you<00:03:42.780> guys<00:03:42.870> were<00:03:43.050> wondering<00:03:43.530> how

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
Oh in case you guys were wondering how

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.080 
Oh in case you guys were wondering how
this<00:03:44.040> game<00:03:44.340> turns<00:03:44.760> out<00:03:45.500> he<00:03:46.550> regrow<00:03:47.550> rainbow

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
this game turns out he regrow rainbow

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.720 
this game turns out he regrow rainbow
rushes<00:03:48.510> me<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:49.020> I<00:03:49.380> don't<00:03:49.620> even<00:03:49.739> try<00:03:50.099> to<00:03:50.130> speed

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
rushes me and I don't even try to speed

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.020 
rushes me and I don't even try to speed
my<00:03:50.910> things<00:03:51.180> up<00:03:51.360> because<00:03:51.569> I<00:03:52.319> know<00:03:53.160> that<00:03:53.730> even<00:03:53.880> if

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
my things up because I know that even if

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.170 
my things up because I know that even if
I<00:03:54.150> defended<00:03:54.599> that<00:03:54.660> he'll<00:03:55.140> just<00:03:55.760> most<00:03:56.760> likely

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
I defended that he'll just most likely

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:08.490 
I defended that he'll just most likely
kill<00:03:58.080> me<00:03:58.260> in<00:03:58.350> another<00:03:58.620> way<00:03:58.800> so

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.550 

now<00:04:09.130> he's<00:04:09.370> trying<00:04:09.700> to<00:04:10.120> I'm<00:04:10.600> not<00:04:10.870> sure<00:04:11.020> why<00:04:11.260> he's

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
now he's trying to I'm not sure why he's

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.950 
now he's trying to I'm not sure why he's
sending<00:04:12.070> these<00:04:12.250> on<00:04:12.520> me<00:04:12.760> he<00:04:13.060> will<00:04:13.390> he<00:04:13.540> probably

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
sending these on me he will he probably

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.300 
sending these on me he will he probably
could<00:04:14.530> just<00:04:14.890> send<00:04:15.130> like<00:04:16.170> some<00:04:17.170> Moab<00:04:17.620> on<00:04:17.920> me<00:04:18.250> or

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
could just send like some Moab on me or

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.740 
could just send like some Moab on me or
anything<00:04:18.640> like<00:04:18.850> that<00:04:19.000> something<00:04:19.359> like<00:04:19.510> that

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
anything like that something like that

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.150 
anything like that something like that
but<00:04:21.690> looks<00:04:22.690> like<00:04:22.870> this<00:04:23.050> guy<00:04:23.260> will<00:04:23.500> finish<00:04:23.800> me

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
but looks like this guy will finish me

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.630 
but looks like this guy will finish me
um<00:04:24.430> I<00:04:25.320> don't<00:04:26.320> think<00:04:26.560> it's<00:04:26.830> until<00:04:27.130> later<00:04:27.400> in<00:04:27.520> the

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
um I don't think it's until later in the

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.790 
um I don't think it's until later in the
round<00:04:27.970> I<00:04:28.240> does<00:04:28.810> it<00:04:29.050> or<00:04:29.260> maybe<00:04:29.440> 14<00:04:31.620> as<00:04:32.620> you<00:04:32.740> can

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
round I does it or maybe 14 as you can

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.130 
round I does it or maybe 14 as you can
see<00:04:33.010> his<00:04:33.130> soul<00:04:33.490> he<00:04:33.940> sold<00:04:34.210> his<00:04:34.390> mortar<00:04:34.870> and

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
see his soul he sold his mortar and

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.910 
see his soul he sold his mortar and
basically<00:04:36.130> it's<00:04:36.460> over<00:04:36.940> I<00:04:37.530> don't<00:04:38.530> know<00:04:38.620> why<00:04:38.740> he

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
basically it's over I don't know why he

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.530 
basically it's over I don't know why he
made<00:04:39.070> those<00:04:39.250> camo<00:04:39.900> but<00:04:40.900> yeah<00:04:41.080> as<00:04:41.380> you<00:04:41.500> can<00:04:41.620> see

basically my first encounter with a
hacker<00:04:53.590> and<00:04:54.010> I<00:04:54.520> just<00:04:55.180> happened<00:04:55.480> to<00:04:55.510> be

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
hacker and I just happened to be

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.600 
hacker and I just happened to be
recording<00:04:56.260> well<00:04:56.860> I<00:04:56.890> would<00:04:57.100> have<00:04:57.190> recorded

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610

recording well I would have recorded
that<00:04:57.730> anyways<00:04:58.060> but<00:04:58.390> I<00:04:58.770> did<00:04:59.770> happen<00:05:00.040> to<00:05:00.190> be

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
that anyways but I did happen to be

recording from the very start of the
match<00:05:02.320> which<00:05:02.770> is<00:05:03.010> pretty<00:05:03.400> good<00:05:03.640> and<00:05:04.560> it's<00:05:05.560> not

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
match which is pretty good and it's not

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.200 
match which is pretty good and it's not
something<00:05:06.160> you<00:05:06.190> guys<00:05:06.400> get<00:05:06.640> to<00:05:06.730> see<00:05:06.880> every<00:05:07.090> day

so I'm just gonna go ahead and just like
talk<00:05:11.860> about<00:05:12.130> how<00:05:12.340> like<00:05:12.610> hackers<00:05:13.270> are<00:05:13.510> like

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
talk about how like hackers are like

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.240 
talk about how like hackers are like
kind<00:05:13.900> of<00:05:13.990> cheap<00:05:14.200> to<00:05:14.380> the<00:05:14.500> game<00:05:14.680> and<00:05:14.890> stuff<00:05:15.100> like

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
kind of cheap to the game and stuff like

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.969 
kind of cheap to the game and stuff like
that<00:05:15.310> and<00:05:15.780> will<00:05:16.780> I<00:05:16.810> just<00:05:17.200> have<00:05:17.380> some<00:05:17.710> other

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
that and will I just have some other

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:19.920 
that and will I just have some other
game<00:05:18.280> play<00:05:18.550> in<00:05:18.790> the<00:05:18.880> background<00:05:19.090> just<00:05:19.570> for

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
game play in the background just for

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.540 
game play in the background just for
like<00:05:20.080> a<00:05:20.110> couple<00:05:20.410> rounds<00:05:20.710> or<00:05:21.100> maybe<00:05:21.280> even<00:05:21.370> just

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
like a couple rounds or maybe even just

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.110 
like a couple rounds or maybe even just
round<00:05:21.970> one<00:05:22.090> or<00:05:22.540> something<00:05:22.960> like<00:05:23.050> that<00:05:23.110> but

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
round one or something like that but

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.210 
round one or something like that but
yeah<00:05:25.120> I<00:05:25.150> think<00:05:25.390> that<00:05:25.900> that's<00:05:26.169> pretty<00:05:26.680> unfair

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
yeah I think that that's pretty unfair

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.890 
yeah I think that that's pretty unfair
than<00:05:27.610> that<00:05:28.860> somebody<00:05:29.860> well<00:05:30.850> actually<00:05:31.000> I<00:05:31.510> think

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
than that somebody well actually I think

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.170 
than that somebody well actually I think
this<00:05:32.530> games<00:05:32.800> actually<00:05:32.979> pretty<00:05:33.430> easy<00:05:33.520> to<00:05:33.970> hack

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
this games actually pretty easy to hack

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.719 
this games actually pretty easy to hack
if<00:05:34.330> no<00:05:34.479> record<00:05:34.780> tried<00:05:35.110> it<00:05:35.350> but<00:05:35.650> it<00:05:36.430> seems

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
if no record tried it but it seems

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.530 
if no record tried it but it seems
pretty<00:05:36.970> easy<00:05:37.090> so<00:05:38.310> that's<00:05:39.310> kind<00:05:40.060> of<00:05:40.180> a<00:05:40.240> flawed

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
pretty easy so that's kind of a flawed

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.080 
pretty easy so that's kind of a flawed
of<00:05:40.780> this<00:05:40.900> game<00:05:41.169> which<00:05:41.530> I<00:05:41.740> don't<00:05:42.250> really<00:05:42.550> like
