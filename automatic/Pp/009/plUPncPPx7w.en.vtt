00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
this before the reason you probably

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.969 
this before the reason you probably
haven't<00:01:41.159> heard<00:01:41.310> about<00:01:41.549> them<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.909> because<00:01:42.090> I'm

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
haven't heard about them is because I'm

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
vaginas and so vaginal exercise is not

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.300 
vaginas and so vaginal exercise is not
something<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.590> we<00:01:49.680> talked<00:01:49.860> about<00:01:49.890> very

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
often that we probably should be because

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.740 
often that we probably should be because
