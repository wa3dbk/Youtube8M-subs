00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.759 

demonstrate<00:00:25.800> very<00:00:26.009> thoroughly<00:00:26.279> go

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:29.769 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:31.900 

immediately<00:00:30.769> drop<00:00:31.039> the<00:00:31.220> middle<00:00:31.460> think<00:00:31.669> about

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
immediately drop the middle think about

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.430 
immediately drop the middle think about
bombs<00:00:32.119> the<00:00:32.239> strict<00:00:32.509> one<00:00:32.570> stop<00:00:32.930> it<00:00:33.050> sounding

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
bombs the strict one stop it sounding

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.939 
bombs the strict one stop it sounding
the<00:00:33.980> upper<00:00:34.250> of<00:00:34.309> the<00:00:34.370> two<00:00:34.460> notes<00:00:34.820> should<00:00:35.780> be<00:00:36.050> cut

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:36.949 
the upper of the two notes should be cut

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:42.900 
the upper of the two notes should be cut
off<00:00:37.160> so<00:00:38.090> it<00:00:38.300> doesn't<00:00:38.329> over<00:00:38.840> rings<00:00:39.050> oh<00:00:39.350> okay

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.780 

it's<00:00:43.910> very<00:00:44.090> quick

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.350 

and<00:00:48.940> faster<00:00:49.480> so<00:00:50.140> you<00:00:50.170> see<00:00:50.410> i'm<00:00:50.500> cutting<00:00:50.860> the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
and faster so you see i'm cutting the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.060 
and faster so you see i'm cutting the
sound<00:00:52.360> of<00:00:52.600> the<00:00:52.690> top<00:00:53.230> string<00:00:53.470> occupy<00:00:53.830> let<00:00:53.980> it

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
sound of the top string occupy let it

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.020 
sound of the top string occupy let it
over<00:00:54.340> it

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
over it

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.049 
over it
we<00:00:56.570> get<00:00:56.719> that<00:00:56.899> chewed<00:00:57.199> up<00:00:57.289> pretty<00:00:57.350> well<00:00:58.000> so<00:00:59.000> we

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
we get that chewed up pretty well so we

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.670 
we get that chewed up pretty well so we
stop<00:00:59.270> it<00:00:59.390> something<00:00:59.780> like<00:00:59.930> that<00:01:00.110> that's<00:01:00.530> how

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
stop it something like that that's how

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:21.359 
stop it something like that that's how
we<00:01:00.739> should<00:01:01.010> do<00:01:01.129> it<00:01:01.250> anyway

involves an extra shift simply bring two
and<00:03:30.080> four<00:03:30.470> over<00:03:30.890> means<00:03:31.459> you<00:03:31.550> don't<00:03:31.760> have<00:03:31.819> to

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
and four over means you don't have to

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.110 
and four over means you don't have to
ship<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.300> hand<00:03:32.510> again<00:03:32.920> and<00:03:33.920> then<00:03:34.849> come<00:03:35.090> down

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
ship the hand again and then come down

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.260 
ship the hand again and then come down
with<00:03:35.510> a<00:03:35.540> second<00:03:35.870> finger

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.520 

right<00:03:42.270> for<00:03:42.420> this<00:03:42.510> next<00:03:42.920> chord<00:03:43.920> bar<00:03:44.190> five<00:03:45.530> we're

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
right for this next chord bar five we're

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.070 
right for this next chord bar five we're
going<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.740> cut<00:03:46.980> get<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.480> cheese<00:03:48.480> on<00:03:48.870> the

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
going to cut get the cheese on the

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.820 
going to cut get the cheese on the
bottom<00:03:49.230> of<00:03:49.530> that<00:03:49.680> cord<00:03:50.210> on<00:03:51.210> string<00:03:51.660> too<00:03:51.960> now

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
bottom of that cord on string too now

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.870 
bottom of that cord on string too now
that's<00:03:53.040> a<00:03:53.190> threat<00:03:53.550> eight<00:03:53.850> and<00:03:55.430> I'll<00:03:56.430> get<00:03:56.700> that

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
that's a threat eight and I'll get that

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.750 
that's a threat eight and I'll get that
with<00:03:57.240> the<00:03:57.990> third<00:03:58.230> finger<00:03:58.710> you<00:03:59.370> don't<00:03:59.580> actually

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
with the third finger you don't actually

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.320 
with the third finger you don't actually
have<00:04:00.000> to<00:04:00.590> although<00:04:01.590> see<00:04:02.190> when<00:04:03.000> you're<00:04:03.120> playing

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
have to although see when you're playing

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.090 
have to although see when you're playing
it<00:04:03.510> without<00:04:03.600> the<00:04:03.930> harmonics<00:04:04.380> it<00:04:04.590> will<00:04:04.890> come

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
it without the harmonics it will come

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.190 
it without the harmonics it will come
out<00:04:05.190> right<00:04:05.400> but<00:04:05.610> you<00:04:06.090> don't<00:04:06.300> actually<00:04:06.420> when

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
out right but you don't actually when

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.410 
out right but you don't actually when
you<00:04:07.260> do<00:04:07.620> with<00:04:07.770> the<00:04:07.860> harmonics<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.970> harmonics

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
you do with the harmonics the harmonics

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.740 
you do with the harmonics the harmonics
in<00:04:09.630> both<00:04:10.020> of<00:04:10.260> those<00:04:10.320> chords<00:04:10.800> in<00:04:10.920> bar<00:04:11.130> five

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
in both of those chords in bar five

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.630 
in both of those chords in bar five
cells<00:04:12.750> without<00:04:13.020> actually<00:04:13.620> fingering<00:04:14.220> it<00:04:14.370> with

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
cells without actually fingering it with

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.570 
cells without actually fingering it with
the<00:04:14.760> left<00:04:14.970> hand<00:04:15.240> so<00:04:16.230> we<00:04:16.350> get<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.650> beyond

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
the left hand so we get the beyond

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.199 
the left hand so we get the beyond
string<00:04:17.940> 1<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.720> D<00:04:19.140> on<00:04:19.560> string<00:04:20.280> 3<00:04:20.610> without

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
string 1 the D on string 3 without

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.570 
string 1 the D on string 3 without
actually<00:04:21.750> doing<00:04:22.080> anything<00:04:22.260> on<00:04:23.010> the<00:04:23.190> left<00:04:23.340> hand

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
actually doing anything on the left hand

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.660 
actually doing anything on the left hand
so<00:04:24.560> just<00:04:25.560> putting<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:25.890> harmonics<00:04:26.400> in<00:04:26.520> on

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
so just putting the harmonics in on

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.030 
so just putting the harmonics in on
those<00:04:26.850> of<00:04:27.120> the<00:04:27.180> loan<00:04:27.360> we<00:04:28.020> can<00:04:28.140> get<00:04:28.320> get<00:04:28.830> away

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
those of the loan we can get get away

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.680 
those of the loan we can get get away
with<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.280> third<00:04:29.520> finger<00:04:29.880> just<00:04:30.090> being<00:04:30.360> at<00:04:30.570> the

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
with the third finger just being at the

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.190 
with the third finger just being at the
8th<00:04:30.990> fret<00:04:31.380> for<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.650> g<00:04:31.860> and<00:04:32.660> no<00:04:33.660> other<00:04:33.840> fingers

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
8th fret for the g and no other fingers

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.790 
8th fret for the g and no other fingers
need<00:04:34.410> to<00:04:34.500> be<00:04:34.590> down<00:04:34.830> and<00:04:35.070> then<00:04:35.910> for<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.240> next

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
need to be down and then for the next

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.290 
need to be down and then for the next
chord<00:04:37.800> we<00:04:38.250> simply<00:04:38.550> put<00:04:38.700> the<00:04:38.760> fourth<00:04:39.000> finger

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
chord we simply put the fourth finger

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.240 
chord we simply put the fourth finger
down<00:04:39.480> on<00:04:39.720> string<00:04:40.380> 4<00:04:40.890> for<00:04:41.820> the<00:04:41.850> B<00:04:42.150> and<00:04:42.630> we<00:04:43.530> can<00:04:43.710> we

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
down on string 4 for the B and we can we

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.190 
down on string 4 for the B and we can we
don't<00:04:44.430> need<00:04:44.610> to<00:04:44.670> finger<00:04:44.940> the<00:04:45.030> 3rd<00:04:45.210> string

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
don't need to finger the 3rd string

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.530 
don't need to finger the 3rd string
so<00:04:48.200> and<00:04:48.380> get<00:04:48.500> that<00:04:48.620> like<00:04:48.860> that<00:04:49.360> makes<00:04:50.360> up<00:04:50.510> a

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
so and get that like that makes up a

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.850 
so and get that like that makes up a
little<00:04:50.630> bit<00:04:50.840> easier<00:04:50.990> because<00:04:51.350> it<00:04:51.500> don't<00:04:51.620> have

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
little bit easier because it don't have

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.130 
little bit easier because it don't have
to<00:04:51.950> actually<00:04:52.210> finger<00:04:54.730> both<00:04:55.730> notes<00:04:56.120> and<00:04:56.480> then

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
to actually finger both notes and then

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.340 
to actually finger both notes and then
we<00:04:57.290> can<00:04:57.500> get<00:04:57.740> smoothly<00:04:58.190> down<00:04:58.550> to<00:04:58.880> the<00:04:59.030> eye<00:04:59.350> and

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
we can get smoothly down to the eye and

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.970 
we can get smoothly down to the eye and
the<00:05:00.500> f-sharp<00:05:00.650> a<00:05:04.900> little<00:05:05.900> bit<00:05:06.020> good<00:05:06.680> let's<00:05:06.860> go

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
the f-sharp a little bit good let's go

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:22.270 
the f-sharp a little bit good let's go
back<00:05:07.160> to<00:05:07.370> doing<00:05:08.230> without<00:05:09.230> you

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.000 

now<00:05:23.450> the<00:05:24.450> third<00:05:24.690> thing<00:05:24.840> guide<00:05:25.320> up<00:05:25.530> here<00:05:25.740> to<00:05:25.860> the

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
now the third thing guide up here to the

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.720 
now the third thing guide up here to the
f<00:05:26.100> sharp<00:05:27.170> and<00:05:28.170> then<00:05:28.380> we<00:05:28.530> can<00:05:28.650> get<00:05:28.800> this<00:05:29.010> next

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
f sharp and then we can get this next

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.080 
f sharp and then we can get this next
one<00:05:29.880> in<00:05:30.240> the<00:05:30.420> same<00:05:30.630> way<00:05:31.400> dad<00:05:32.400> she<00:05:32.610> needed<00:05:32.970> we

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
one in the same way dad she needed we

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.820 
one in the same way dad she needed we
can<00:05:33.240> come<00:05:33.480> use<00:05:33.840> fourth<00:05:34.170> finger<00:05:34.500> if<00:05:34.560> you<00:05:34.650> like

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
can come use fourth finger if you like

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.890 
can come use fourth finger if you like
or<00:05:35.340> come<00:05:35.580> up<00:05:35.610> with<00:05:35.700> the<00:05:35.880> third<00:05:36.090> finger<00:05:36.480> we

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
or come up with the third finger we

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.740 
or come up with the third finger we
don't<00:05:37.080> actually<00:05:37.200> need<00:05:37.440> finger<00:05:37.890> B<00:05:38.600> port<00:05:39.600> when

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
don't actually need finger B port when

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.770 
don't actually need finger B port when
you<00:05:39.810> play<00:05:40.020> not<00:05:40.620> when<00:05:40.770> you<00:05:40.830> play<00:05:41.010> it<00:05:41.540> comes<00:05:42.540> out

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
you play not when you play it comes out

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:51.230 
you play not when you play it comes out
anyway<00:05:46.490> gonna<00:05:47.490> get<00:05:47.670> the<00:05:48.530> thumb<00:05:49.530> and<00:05:50.240> finger

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
anyway gonna get the thumb and finger

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.030 
anyway gonna get the thumb and finger
playing<00:05:51.480> last<00:05:51.960> chord<00:05:52.350> that's<00:05:52.620> the<00:05:52.860> only

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.040 
playing last chord that's the only

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.590 
playing last chord that's the only
instance<00:05:53.400> where<00:05:53.640> middle<00:05:54.150> fingers<00:05:54.450> not

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
instance where middle fingers not

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.450 
instance where middle fingers not
playing<00:05:54.900> will<00:05:55.350> ever<00:05:55.500> notice<00:05:55.680> the<00:05:55.980> thumb<00:05:58.460> okay

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
playing will ever notice the thumb okay

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:41.170 
playing will ever notice the thumb okay
so<00:06:00.120> putting<00:06:00.450> it<00:06:00.600> all<00:06:00.720> together

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:41.180 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:50.780 

finger<00:06:42.180> there<00:06:48.740> okay<00:06:49.740> so<00:06:50.100> it's<00:06:50.220> not<00:06:50.250> very<00:06:50.490> well

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:50.790 
finger there okay so it's not very well

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.080
