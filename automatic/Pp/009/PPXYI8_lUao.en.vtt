00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
messed up but there has been an

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.040 
messed up but there has been an
immediate<00:03:21.970> trend<00:03:22.270> that<00:03:22.330> I've<00:03:22.480> noticed<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:22.990> I

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
immediate trend that I've noticed and I

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
don't just jump straight on the pace

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.130 
don't just jump straight on the pace
bang<00:04:42.070> bandwagon<00:04:42.940> because<00:04:43.060> maybe<00:04:43.660> during<00:04:43.960> the

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
bang bandwagon because maybe during the

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.800 
bang bandwagon because maybe during the
trading<00:04:44.380> session<00:04:44.590> it<00:04:45.160> might<00:04:45.580> be<00:04:45.729> okay<00:04:46.060> but<00:04:46.210> if

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
trading session it might be okay but if

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.630 
trading session it might be okay but if
you<00:04:47.320> wait<00:04:47.620> a<00:04:47.650> little<00:04:47.919> while<00:04:48.010> to<00:04:48.310> you<00:04:48.370> actually

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
you wait a little while to you actually

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.770 
you wait a little while to you actually
start<00:04:48.790> playing<00:04:49.060> the<00:04:49.180> game<00:04:49.300> people<00:04:49.600> are<00:04:49.690> going

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
start playing the game people are going

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.510 
start playing the game people are going
to<00:04:49.870> realize<00:04:49.990> hold<00:04:50.380> on<00:04:50.500> a<00:04:50.530> second<00:04:50.950> I've<00:04:51.070> got

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
to realize hold on a second I've got

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.510 
to realize hold on a second I've got
this<00:04:51.640> 96<00:04:52.330> pace<00:04:52.570> player<00:04:52.900> but<00:04:53.770> his<00:04:53.890> first<00:04:54.190> touch

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
this 96 pace player but his first touch

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.120 
this 96 pace player but his first touch
is<00:04:54.729> abysmal<00:04:55.120> so<00:04:55.900> I'm<00:04:56.290> gonna<00:04:56.440> have<00:04:56.650> to<00:04:56.740> go<00:04:56.770> and

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
is abysmal so I'm gonna have to go and

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.409 
is abysmal so I'm gonna have to go and
sell<00:04:57.370> them<00:04:57.490> again<00:04:57.700> and<00:04:57.910> i'll<00:04:57.970> probably<00:04:58.210> sell

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
sell them again and i'll probably sell

00:04:58.419 --> 00:04:59.550 
sell them again and i'll probably sell
them<00:04:58.570> for<00:04:58.750> less<00:04:58.870> than<00:04:59.080> what<00:04:59.140> i<00:04:59.260> bought<00:04:59.470> them

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
them for less than what i bought them

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.770 
them for less than what i bought them
for<00:04:59.770> because<00:05:00.100> i<00:05:00.280> was<00:05:00.940> silly<00:05:01.240> during<00:05:01.660> the

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
for because i was silly during the

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.090
