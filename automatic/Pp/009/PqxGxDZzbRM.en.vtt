template system I'm going to start out

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.269 
template system I'm going to start out
with<00:00:18.090> template<00:00:18.540> number<00:00:18.840> one<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.440> template

with template number one and template

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.220 
with template number one and template
number<00:00:20.610> one<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.540> stuff<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:21.990> call<00:00:22.200> the

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
number one is the stuff that I call the

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.880 
number one is the stuff that I call the
small<00:00:22.590> scallop<00:00:23.130> template<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:24.270> has<00:00:24.890> three

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
small scallop template it has three

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.470 
small scallop template it has three
different<00:00:26.010> cutting<00:00:26.550> edges<00:00:26.850> depending<00:00:27.210> on<00:00:27.330> the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
different cutting edges depending on the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.660 
different cutting edges depending on the
curve<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:28.050> you're<00:00:28.170> going<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.500> want<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.430> then

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
curve that you're going to want and then

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.640 
curve that you're going to want and then
this<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.510> width<00:00:30.690> that<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.960> comes<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.350> if

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
this is the width that it comes in if

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.619 
this is the width that it comes in if
it's<00:00:31.980> not<00:00:32.220> an<00:00:32.369> appropriate<00:00:32.730> with<00:00:33.059> me<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.420> can

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
it's not an appropriate with me you can

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:35.270 
it's not an appropriate with me you can
adjust<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.110> just<00:00:34.140> by<00:00:34.379> cutting<00:00:34.710> your<00:00:34.739> fabric<00:00:35.010> a

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
adjust it just by cutting your fabric a

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.610 
adjust it just by cutting your fabric a
little<00:00:35.520> smaller<00:00:35.879> or<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.180> little<00:00:36.449> wider<00:00:36.660> on<00:00:36.930> each

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
little smaller or a little wider on each

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.130 
little smaller or a little wider on each
section<00:00:38.400> so<00:00:38.580> what<00:00:39.180> I've<00:00:39.300> done<00:00:39.449> is<00:00:39.510> I'm<00:00:39.809> showing

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.710 
section so what I've done is I'm showing
you<00:00:40.230> how<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.440> Center<00:00:40.980> your<00:00:41.159> pattern<00:00:41.699> and<00:00:42.629> you

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
you how you Center your pattern and you

you how you Center your pattern and you
can<00:00:42.839> see<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.110> actual<00:00:43.559> pattern<00:00:43.980> through<00:00:44.220> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
can see the actual pattern through the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.619 
can see the actual pattern through the
template<00:00:44.699> which<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.850> really<00:00:45.300> nice<00:00:45.390> let<00:00:45.540> me

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
template which is really nice let me

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.110 
template which is really nice let me
flip<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.900> over<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.170> it's<00:00:46.260> not<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.559> shiny<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.159> we

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
flip it over so it's not so shiny and we

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.149 
flip it over so it's not so shiny and we
Paul<00:00:49.080> behind<00:00:49.409> the<00:00:49.470> camera<00:00:49.739> there<00:00:49.890> maybe<00:00:50.040> you

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:50.159 
Paul behind the camera there maybe you

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:51.890 
Paul behind the camera there maybe you
can<00:00:50.280> get<00:00:50.400> a<00:00:50.430> better<00:00:50.580> shot<00:00:50.909> of<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.330> what

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
can get a better shot of it and what

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.360 
can get a better shot of it and what
I've<00:00:52.019> done<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.379> once<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.680> cut<00:00:52.890> out<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.159> first

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
I've done is once I cut out the first

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.540 
I've done is once I cut out the first
section<00:00:53.909> then<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.720> go<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.229> my<00:00:55.470> fabric<00:00:56.040> with<00:00:56.309> this

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
section then I go to my fabric with this

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.000 
section then I go to my fabric with this
piece<00:00:56.790> not<00:00:57.000> my<00:00:57.180> template<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.750> then<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.680> take

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
piece not my template and then I take

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.280 
piece not my template and then I take
this<00:00:59.220> and<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.519> line<00:00:59.909> it<00:00:59.940> up<00:01:00.239> where<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.870> perfectly

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
this and I line it up where it perfectly

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.509 
this and I line it up where it perfectly
matches<00:01:02.040> and<00:01:02.220> let<00:01:02.309> me<00:01:02.400> get<00:01:02.549> the<00:01:02.699> match<00:01:03.000> here

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
matches and let me get the match here

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.330 
matches and let me get the match here
you<00:01:05.519> can<00:01:05.670> see<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.330> want<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.690> match<00:01:06.840> all<00:01:07.340> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
you can see you want it to match all the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.480 
you can see you want it to match all the
way<00:01:08.610> around<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:10.200> once<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.070> matches<00:01:11.340> all<00:01:11.460> the

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
way around and once it matches all the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.980 
way around and once it matches all the
way<00:01:11.640> around<00:01:11.909> then<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.299> would<00:01:12.450> just<00:01:12.630> cut<00:01:12.840> this

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
way around then I would just cut this

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.240 
way around then I would just cut this
out<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.350> match<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.860> want<00:01:14.039> to<00:01:14.100> make<00:01:14.219> sure

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
out to match and you want to make sure

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.279 
out to match and you want to make sure
that<00:01:14.549> each<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.969> elements<00:01:15.450> match<00:01:15.750> when<00:01:16.170> you

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 
that each of the elements match when you

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:18.440 
that each of the elements match when you
cut<00:01:16.530> them<00:01:16.710> out<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.039> sew<00:01:17.430> them<00:01:17.579> together<00:01:17.700> so

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
cut them out and sew them together so

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.789 
cut them out and sew them together so
what<00:01:18.600> I've<00:01:18.689> done<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:18.899> I've<00:01:19.140> got<00:01:19.289> a<00:01:19.350> section

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
what I've done is I've got a section

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.469 
what I've done is I've got a section
here<00:01:19.979> similar<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.729> balance<00:01:21.149> that<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.329> have

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
here similar to this balance that I have

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.679 
here similar to this balance that I have
behind<00:01:21.780> me<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.670> I've<00:01:23.670> got<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.119> scallop<00:01:24.420> piece

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
behind me and I've got the scallop piece

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:25.940 
behind me and I've got the scallop piece
and<00:01:24.840> then<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:24.960> took<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.200> straight<00:01:25.619> piece<00:01:25.799> which

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
and then I took the straight piece which

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.679 
and then I took the straight piece which
is<00:01:25.979> actually<00:01:26.219> the<00:01:26.460> template<00:01:26.729> number<00:01:26.939> two<00:01:27.210> and

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
is actually the template number two and

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.510 
is actually the template number two and
if<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.829> fold<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:29.640> just<00:01:30.509> like<00:01:30.719> this<00:01:31.490> you<00:01:32.490> can

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
if I fold this just like this you can

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.230 
if I fold this just like this you can
see<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:34.109> it's<00:01:34.289> very<00:01:34.380> dramatic<00:01:34.939> one<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:35.969> the

another<00:01:50.490> idea<00:01:50.729> just<00:01:51.149> for<00:01:51.600> versatility

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:52.609 
another idea just for versatility

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:55.730 
another idea just for versatility
you<00:01:53.609> can<00:01:53.759> also<00:01:53.999> bring<00:01:54.539> this<00:01:54.749> pleat<00:01:55.109> forward

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
you can also bring this pleat forward

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.209 
you can also bring this pleat forward
like<00:01:56.219> this<00:01:57.079> and<00:01:58.079> by<00:01:58.229> bringing<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.710> forward

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
like this and by bringing it forward

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.980 
like this and by bringing it forward
you<00:01:59.460> create<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.789> totally<00:02:00.210> different<00:02:00.600> look<00:02:00.719> and

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
you create a totally different look and

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.620 
you create a totally different look and
you'd<00:02:01.770> want<00:02:02.039> to<00:02:02.100> match<00:02:02.399> these<00:02:02.909> pieces<00:02:03.420> also

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
you'd want to match these pieces also

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.899 
you'd want to match these pieces also
but<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.469> beauty<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:04.979> once<00:02:05.340> you've<00:02:05.549> cut<00:02:05.880> out

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
but the beauty is once you've cut out

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.790 
but the beauty is once you've cut out
your<00:02:07.069> your<00:02:08.069> scallops<00:02:08.789> then<00:02:09.720> your<00:02:09.960> scrap<00:02:10.500> or
