00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:06.030
 let's see it in ee an experiment is called steam explosions the eie 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.610
 pepper 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.929
 to do this project we need 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:14.409
 a large bottle of all diet cola 3 liters 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.900
 half minute pack 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.470
 and a funnel 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.470
 in the instructions of this experiment are 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.089
 it costs an outdoor space to carry out this experiment 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.360
 with the coca cola arieta on a surface 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.580
 the floor a mass and with a funnel in the peak of the bottle 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.160
 let it fall 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.820
 drop the mints down the funnel 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.870
 start running 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.580
 you can go lost the beauty landing point 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.710
 will shoot out of the bottle 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.920
 electors 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.580
 of 9 thousand 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.580
 nine meters high 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.509
 I experiment a piano because carbon dioxide 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.520
 expression will enter bottle during the process of packaging of soft drinks 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.540
 this means that there are a lot of problems waiting to be released in the form of a bulb 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.340
 that's why I spent them daring if both giants 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.870
 by dropping the merits the carbon dioxide release process is 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.820
 accelerates for two reasons 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.610
 the first reason 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.100
 is because the pretension of the surface to the drink breaks 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.500
 and the second reason is because the muscles today I flights that cover the 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.340
 outside of these candies 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.920
 to xente the area of ​​the surface is greater 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.950
 which implies that many more bubbles can be formed 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.979
 and carbon dioxide can be released more violently
