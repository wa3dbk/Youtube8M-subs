us<00:04:00.270> some<00:04:00.600> idea<00:04:00.630> of<00:04:01.020> what's<00:04:01.230> going<00:04:01.440> on<00:04:01.620> so

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
us some idea of what's going on so

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.479 
us some idea of what's going on so
there's<00:04:01.950> a<00:04:02.010> direct<00:04:02.220> 3d<00:04:03.470> 11<00:04:04.470> points<00:04:04.830> something

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
would actually be freaking cool Metro

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.089 
would actually be freaking cool Metro
went<00:05:42.539> for<00:05:42.780> five<00:05:42.990> point<00:05:43.260> eight<00:05:43.380> mil<00:05:43.530> to<00:05:43.770> koch

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:44.099 
went for five point eight mil to koch

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:46.159 
went for five point eight mil to koch
and<00:05:44.460> south<00:05:44.910> park<00:05:45.180> the<00:05:45.300> stick<00:05:45.360> of<00:05:45.660> truth<00:05:45.690> went

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
and south park the stick of truth went

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.940 
and south park the stick of truth went
to<00:05:46.289> ubisoft<00:05:46.890> so<00:05:47.450> yeah<00:05:48.450> that's<00:05:49.229> that's<00:05:49.560> a<00:05:49.740> shame

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
to ubisoft so yeah that's that's a shame

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.339 
to ubisoft so yeah that's that's a shame
but<00:05:50.190> i<00:05:50.250> guess<00:05:50.520> more<00:05:50.849> consolidation<00:05:51.510> is<00:05:51.960> going

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:52.349 
but i guess more consolidation is going

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:54.130 
but i guess more consolidation is going
to<00:05:52.410> happen<00:05:52.770> so<00:05:52.950> we're<00:05:53.099> going<00:05:53.190> to<00:05:53.280> be<00:05:53.370> left<00:05:53.520> with

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.140 
to happen so we're going to be left with

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.240 
to happen so we're going to be left with
basically<00:05:55.140> like<00:05:55.530> EA<00:05:55.800> and<00:05:56.250> Ubisoft<00:05:56.880> and

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
basically like EA and Ubisoft and

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.469 
basically like EA and Ubisoft and
hopefully<00:05:59.250> Crytek<00:05:59.700> sticks<00:06:00.000> around<00:06:00.120> because<00:06:00.390> I

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
hopefully Crytek sticks around because I

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.270 
hopefully Crytek sticks around because I
like<00:06:00.660> those<00:06:00.840> guys<00:06:01.080> that<00:06:01.650> was<00:06:01.860> pretty<00:06:02.070> much<00:06:02.220> it

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
like those guys that was pretty much it

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.279
