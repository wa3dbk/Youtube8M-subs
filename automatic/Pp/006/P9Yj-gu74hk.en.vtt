00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.939
 about Dutch business and calls on a new cabinet in an open letter 

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:06.710
 to participate in environmental protection 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.710
 top men from America manche, among others, lend each other 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.520
 10 10 and live now 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.380
 argue that the environmental issues that have arisen in recent years over the past few years 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.900
 has received little attention 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.669
 they are concerned about the worldwide degradation of nature 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:23.649
 They want the government to develop environmentally friendly 

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:25.669
 stimulates technology 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:29.009
 the letter is addressed to the informer and to the political parties 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.750
 the signatories of the letter believe that a new cabinet has good behavior with 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.630
 rewarded the measures 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.630
 and the polluting companies penalized it 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.000
 there is a chance that the North Pole will be free in the summer of 2014 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.760
 that is much faster than has been assumed so far, says an american 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.190
 climate agency that we have designed a very advanced computer model 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.430
 because they predict the melting of the ice cap at the North Pole 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.480
 the cause of melting it is the greenhouse effect that put out the the warms up 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.450
 bonuses and polar bears at the north pole 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.130
 global warming will make this idyllic picture definitive 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.730
 past 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.160
 the permanent sea ice has then disappeared 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.290
 only in the winter is there again at the north pole 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.600
 about the moment when that ice at the North Pole was completely gone 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.370
 so far a lot of disagreement 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.200
 the renowned american research institute now has one 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.340
 designed a computer simulation showing that it is roughly thirty to 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.210
 40 years 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.370
 much faster than previously thought 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.870
 These computer predictions show what the ice surface is like at the North Pole 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.340
 and between 19 90 and 2000 49 becomes smaller and smaller 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.230
 that process is going faster and faster 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.210
 and around 2040 the sea can be completely free in the summer 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.890
 and see that 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.560
 that it gets less and less here and now in 2040 by 2050 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.450
 that the ice 4 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.850
 it is also not too early 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.490
 andreas couples also does research in the netherlands on the melting of the ice 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.210
 according to him, the process is irreversible our calculations show that it is up 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.019
 turned 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.229
 but then let's have what can i tell you 

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:15.579
 different models four different answers 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.879
 and the only thing we can say is that it's going to happen it's still this 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:20.899
 happen this century 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:23.699
 nevertheless it makes sense to do something about it 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:26.699
 to put in the ser second how long will the process go 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:29.349
 and 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.579
 humanity must adapt 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.599
 And the adjustment goes better as the process you don't adjust for long 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:36.829
 taken away from 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.279
 so people still have the opportunity to get used to the situation 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:43.980
 the polar bears will no longer have the next euro in the Arctic
