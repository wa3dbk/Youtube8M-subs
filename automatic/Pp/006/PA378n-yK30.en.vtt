00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
disappear so I go back to full map if I

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.360 
disappear so I go back to full map if I
hit<00:00:48.020> it<00:00:48.140> again<00:00:48.380> it<00:00:48.410> comes<00:00:48.620> back<00:00:48.770> down

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
hit it again it comes back down

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.910 
hit it again it comes back down
so<00:00:49.940> that's<00:00:50.149> the<00:00:50.329> altimeter<00:00:50.920> dashboard

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
so that's the altimeter dashboard

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.020 
so that's the altimeter dashboard
function<00:00:52.430> there<00:00:52.640> let's<00:00:53.300> change<00:00:53.600> it<00:00:55.030> dashboard

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
function there let's change it dashboard

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.100 
function there let's change it dashboard
let's<00:00:56.780> go<00:00:56.930> the<00:00:57.020> next<00:00:57.230> one<00:00:57.350> automotive

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
let's go the next one automotive

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.090 
let's go the next one automotive
here<00:01:00.110> I<00:01:00.140> have<00:01:00.320> automotive<00:01:00.860> information

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
here I have automotive information

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.950 
here I have automotive information
you'll<00:01:01.550> find<00:01:01.760> on<00:01:01.879> the<00:01:01.969> computer<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:02.660> top<00:01:02.809> of

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
me to the trip computer so that's how

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.090 
me to the trip computer so that's how
this<00:04:54.690> one<00:04:54.900> works<00:04:55.110> which<00:04:55.590> is<00:04:55.770> a<00:04:55.800> little<00:04:56.010> bit

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
this one works which is a little bit

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.760 
this one works which is a little bit
different<00:04:56.400> on<00:04:56.430> the<00:04:56.550> Nuvi<00:04:58.220> and<00:04:59.690> then<00:05:00.690> finally<00:05:01.650> I

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
different on the Nuvi and then finally I

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.830 
different on the Nuvi and then finally I
can<00:05:01.920> do<00:05:02.070> a<00:05:02.100> custom<00:05:02.450> so<00:05:03.450> what<00:05:03.570> I<00:05:03.600> have<00:05:03.750> the

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
can do a custom so what I have the

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.840 
can do a custom so what I have the
option<00:05:04.110> is<00:05:04.200> is<00:05:04.350> when<00:05:04.710> navigating<00:05:04.920> I<00:05:05.490> want<00:05:05.790> it

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
option is is when navigating I want it

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.090 
option is is when navigating I want it
to<00:05:05.940> be<00:05:06.060> like<00:05:06.210> the<00:05:06.360> Nuvi<00:05:06.630> screen<00:05:06.930> and<00:05:07.170> when<00:05:07.890> not

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
I'm not navigating and go back here and

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.560 
I'm not navigating and go back here and
I<00:05:16.290> have<00:05:16.470> that<00:05:16.680> icon<00:05:17.100> whereas<00:05:17.850> if<00:05:17.970> I<00:05:18.120> want<00:05:18.390> to

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
and put a point right here and I say go

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.640 
and put a point right here and I say go
now<00:05:24.360> I<00:05:24.390> have<00:05:24.570> the<00:05:24.660> options<00:05:24.990> of<00:05:25.080> how<00:05:25.260> I<00:05:25.290> want<00:05:25.560> to

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.510 
navigate what a motive in the most time
it's<00:05:30.060> calculating<00:05:31.010> there<00:05:32.010> we<00:05:32.130> go

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
it's calculating there we go

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.070 
it's calculating there we go
now<00:05:33.480> the<00:05:33.540> unit<00:05:34.020> has<00:05:34.410> actually<00:05:34.770> changed<00:05:34.800> to<00:05:35.400> the

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
now the unit has actually changed to the

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.210 
now the unit has actually changed to the
movie<00:05:37.080> mode<00:05:37.290> don't<00:05:37.920> minimize<00:05:38.040> that<00:05:38.490> oops

minimize<00:05:41.220> that<00:05:41.490> there<00:05:41.880> we<00:05:41.970> go<00:05:42.120> and<00:05:42.420> now<00:05:42.480> I'm<00:05:42.840> in

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
minimize that there we go and now I'm in

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.310 
minimize that there we go and now I'm in
a<00:05:42.990> movie<00:05:43.560> screen<00:05:44.010> so<00:05:44.730> as<00:05:45.060> I<00:05:45.660> said<00:05:45.870> I<00:05:45.900> change

that custom function right there yeah so

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.500 
that custom function right there yeah so
in<00:05:52.440> the<00:05:52.500> custom<00:05:52.920> I<00:05:53.100> said<00:05:53.550> go<00:05:53.910> to<00:05:53.970> new<00:05:54.180> V<00:05:54.360> when

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
in the custom I said go to new V when

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.810
