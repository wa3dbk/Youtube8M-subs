e90 a 91 92 93 and the same also occurs
for<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.789> the<00:00:17.789> BMW<00:00:18.720> one<00:00:18.900> seriously<00:00:19.500> by<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.680> IDI

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
for the the BMW one seriously by the IDI

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.759 
for the the BMW one seriously by the IDI
I<00:00:20.279> think<00:00:20.760> it's<00:00:20.910> any<00:00:21.119> 182<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.080> they're<00:00:22.590> nearly

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
I think it's any 182 and they're nearly

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.429 
I think it's any 182 and they're nearly
788<00:00:23.900> and<00:00:24.900> we're<00:00:25.019> just<00:00:25.080> going<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.320> basically

you'll see the airbag light is on here
in<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.280> particular<00:00:38.579> vehicle<00:00:39.239> we<00:00:40.230> don't

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
in this particular vehicle we don't

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.530 
in this particular vehicle we don't
actually<00:00:40.559> have<00:00:40.829> an<00:00:40.980> airbag<00:00:41.250> fault<00:00:41.640> but<00:00:42.450> I'm

actually have an airbag fault but I'm

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.049 
actually have an airbag fault but I'm
going<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.719> go<00:00:42.870> through<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.170> process<00:00:43.730> as<00:00:44.730> if<00:00:44.910> we

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
going to go through the process as if we

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.090 
going to go through the process as if we
did<00:00:45.210> have<00:00:45.360> an<00:00:45.510> airbag<00:00:45.660> fault<00:00:46.079> what<00:00:46.800> we'll<00:00:46.950> need

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
did have an airbag fault what we'll need

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.139 
did have an airbag fault what we'll need
and<00:00:47.340> what<00:00:47.430> we're<00:00:47.520> going<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.670> use<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:48.059> this

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
and what we're going to use in this

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.529 
and what we're going to use in this
particular<00:00:48.300> case<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.230> auto<00:00:49.680> tell<00:00:49.950> MD<00:00:50.550> 7:02

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
particular case is the auto tell MD 7:02

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.290 
particular case is the auto tell MD 7:02
which<00:00:51.899> covers<00:00:52.199> European<00:00:52.739> vehicles<00:00:53.190> as<00:00:53.370> you

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
which covers European vehicles as you

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.920 
which covers European vehicles as you
can<00:00:54.449> see<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.870> covers<00:00:55.940> these<00:00:56.940> these<00:00:57.390> European

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
can see it covers these these European

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.760 
can see it covers these these European
vehicles<00:00:58.079> here<00:00:59.719> it's<00:01:00.719> quite<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> few<00:01:01.199> pages<00:01:01.440> of

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
vehicles here it's quite a few pages of

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.950 
vehicles here it's quite a few pages of
them<00:01:01.949> but<00:01:02.879> obviously<00:01:03.180> when<00:01:03.359> right<00:01:03.539> now<00:01:03.570> we're

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
them but obviously when right now we're

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.820 
them but obviously when right now we're
at<00:01:04.080> BMW<00:01:05.900> so<00:01:06.900> we're<00:01:07.049> going<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.260> select<00:01:07.470> our

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
at BMW so we're going to select our

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.539 
at BMW so we're going to select our
specific<00:01:08.430> model<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.510> 3-series<00:01:10.110> it's<00:01:10.650> an<00:01:10.950> e<00:01:11.130> and

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
specific model so 3-series it's an e and

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.969 
specific model so 3-series it's an e and
90<00:01:13.820> as<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:15.450> say<00:01:15.659> though<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.350> applicable<00:01:16.740> for

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
90 as I say though it is applicable for

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.630 
90 as I say though it is applicable for
the<00:01:17.189> 91<00:01:17.460> 1983<00:01:18.390> under<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.840> EDP<00:01:19.530> mw1<00:01:19.950> series<00:01:20.520> as

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
the 91 1983 under a EDP mw1 series as

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.560 
the 91 1983 under a EDP mw1 series as
well<00:01:21.680> so<00:01:22.680> it's<00:01:22.890> just<00:01:23.509> establishing<00:01:24.509> a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
well so it's just establishing a

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.380 
well so it's just establishing a
connection<00:01:25.110> with<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.820> vehicle's<00:01:26.820> ECU

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
connection with the vehicle's ECU

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.330 
connection with the vehicle's ECU
systems<00:01:27.960> here<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.500> we<00:01:28.650> know<00:01:28.799> what<00:01:29.009> we<00:01:29.130> can

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
systems here so we know what we can

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.890 
systems here so we know what we can
actually<00:01:29.700> diagnose

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.410 

okay<00:01:37.760> now<00:01:38.760> we're<00:01:38.970> going<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.150> select<00:01:39.390> our<00:01:39.660> model

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
okay now we're going to select our model

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.840 
okay now we're going to select our model
we<00:01:42.420> are<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.780> a318

probably<00:02:19.170> going<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.320> come<00:02:19.500> up<00:02:19.560> with<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.740> fall

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
probably going to come up with a fall

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.660 
probably going to come up with a fall
there<00:02:20.160> we<00:02:20.280> go<00:02:20.570> right<00:02:21.570> so<00:02:22.370> what<00:02:23.370> we<00:02:23.490> are<00:02:23.580> looking

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
there we go right so what we are looking

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.270 
there we go right so what we are looking
for<00:02:24.030> something<00:02:24.420> which<00:02:24.720> resembles<00:02:25.290> either<00:02:25.590> Mrs

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
for something which resembles either Mrs

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.750 
for something which resembles either Mrs
multiple<00:02:26.940> restraint<00:02:27.360> system<00:02:27.840> or<00:02:28.310> SRS<00:02:29.310> which

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
multiple restraint system or SRS which

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.310 
multiple restraint system or SRS which
is<00:02:30.230> supplemental<00:02:31.230> restraint<00:02:31.410> system<00:02:33.320> either

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
is supplemental restraint system either

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.550 
is supplemental restraint system either
way<00:02:34.560> they<00:02:34.800> are<00:02:34.830> both<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.400> airbag<00:02:35.820> module<00:02:36.560> so

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
way they are both the airbag module so

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.260 
way they are both the airbag module so
it's<00:02:37.830> just<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.190> case<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.400> scrolling<00:02:39.090> down

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
it's just the case of scrolling down

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.500 
it's just the case of scrolling down
until<00:02:39.330> we<00:02:39.750> find<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:40.230> module<00:02:41.330> something<00:02:42.330> to

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
until we find that module something to

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.320 
until we find that module something to
that<00:02:42.660> effect<00:02:45.650> there<00:02:46.650> it<00:02:46.800> is<00:02:46.920> Mrs<00:02:47.550> multiple

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
that effect there it is Mrs multiple

since asking to read codes again to make
sure<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.400> foot<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:35.700> codes<00:03:35.910> have<00:03:36.000> been

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
sure the foot the codes have been

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.060 
sure the foot the codes have been
deleted<00:03:36.650> so<00:03:38.000> that's<00:03:39.000> basically<00:03:39.450> it<00:03:40.070> it's
