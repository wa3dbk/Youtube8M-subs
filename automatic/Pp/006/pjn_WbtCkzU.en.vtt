00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
Canada and she's probably only about 18

Canada and she's probably only about 18
degrees<00:00:42.840> celcius<00:00:43.829> out<00:00:43.949> in<00:00:44.039> the<00:00:44.129> garage<00:00:44.250> so

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
degrees celcius out in the garage so

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.180 
degrees celcius out in the garage so
it's<00:00:46.199> actually<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.590> perfect<00:00:46.890> temperature<00:00:47.070> to

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.069 
it's actually a perfect temperature to
be<00:00:47.340> working<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.760> car<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.870> what<00:00:48.989> I'm

planning on doing tonight is actually
topping<00:00:51.840> up<00:00:51.929> the<00:00:52.579> differential<00:00:53.579> fluid<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.059> the

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
topping up the differential fluid in the

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:56.930 
topping up the differential fluid in the
in<00:00:55.019> the<00:00:55.170> tr6<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:55.949> don't<00:00:56.280> know<00:00:56.340> phone<00:00:56.519> yeah

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
in the tr6 I don't know phone yeah

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.029 
in the tr6 I don't know phone yeah
you've<00:00:57.120> seen<00:00:57.269> the<00:00:57.390> hardtop<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:58.019> any<00:00:58.829> what<00:00:58.949> I'm

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
you've seen the hardtop so any what I'm

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.880 
you've seen the hardtop so any what I'm
gonna<00:00:59.129> do<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.539> pull<00:01:00.539> out<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.719> tr6<00:01:01.230> maybe<00:01:01.440> flip

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
gonna do is pull out the tr6 maybe flip

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.680 
gonna do is pull out the tr6 maybe flip
her<00:01:02.010> around<00:01:02.250> get<00:01:02.519> the<00:01:02.609> Jetta<00:01:02.820> get<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.149> ramps

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
her around get the Jetta get the ramps

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.100 
her around get the Jetta get the ramps
out<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.379> we'll<00:01:04.980> put<00:01:05.010> her<00:01:05.250> up<00:01:05.400> on<00:01:05.810> stands<00:01:06.810> and

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
out and we'll put her up on stands and

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.260 
out and we'll put her up on stands and
ramps<00:01:07.440> cars<00:01:07.830> got<00:01:07.980> to<00:01:08.070> be<00:01:08.130> level<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.760> order<00:01:09.000> to

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
ramps cars got to be level in order to

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.920 
ramps cars got to be level in order to
check<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:10.100> diff<00:01:11.100> fluid<00:01:12.090> or<00:01:12.390> gear<00:01:12.689> oil

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
check the diff fluid or gear oil

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.399 
check the diff fluid or gear oil
basically<00:01:14.360> so<00:01:15.360> what<00:01:15.479> I'm<00:01:15.570> gonna<00:01:15.659> do<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.049> I'm

basically so what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.800 
basically so what I'm gonna do is I'm
going<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.619> do<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.430> maybe<00:01:17.820> I'll<00:01:17.939> take<00:01:18.750> you

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
okay guys I got the back of the car

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:26.780 
okay guys I got the back of the car
jacked<00:01:25.170> up<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.560> think<00:01:26.040> enough<00:01:26.250> for<00:01:26.520> me<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.700> get

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
jacked up I think enough for me to get

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.480

under<00:01:27.060> I've<00:01:27.180> got<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.920> couple<00:01:28.920> stands<00:01:29.340> at<00:01:29.399> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
under I've got a couple stands at the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.859 
under I've got a couple stands at the
back<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.850> what<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:29.970> ramps<00:01:30.329> at<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.509> front<00:01:30.750> and

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
back of what the ramps at the front and

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:31.910 
back of what the ramps at the front and
I've<00:01:30.930> got<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.079> couple<00:01:31.259> stands<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.860> middle

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
I've got a couple stands in the middle

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.319 
I've got a couple stands in the middle
just<00:01:32.640> for<00:01:32.759> safety's<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:33.869> case<00:01:35.299> so<00:01:36.299> I

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
just for safety's just in case so I

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.370 
just for safety's just in case so I
should<00:01:36.479> mention<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.810> reason<00:01:37.020> I'm<00:01:37.110> doing<00:01:37.229> this

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
should mention the reason I'm doing this

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.289 
should mention the reason I'm doing this
is<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:38.570> trying<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.659> sort<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.930> suffer<00:01:40.200> from<00:01:40.350> a

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
is that trying to sort of suffer from a

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.219 
is that trying to sort of suffer from a
problem

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
problem

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.160 
problem
I<00:01:43.290> guess<00:01:44.070> at<00:01:44.219> many<00:01:44.430> points<00:01:44.610> but<00:01:44.939> they<00:01:45.930> tend<00:01:46.140> to

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
I guess at many points but they tend to

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.010 
I guess at many points but they tend to
leak<00:01:46.350> oil<00:01:46.590> out<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.860> diff<00:01:47.810> after<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> period

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
leak oil out of the diff after a period

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.380 
leak oil out of the diff after a period
of<00:01:49.170> time<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.369> diff<00:01:50.549> seals<00:01:50.789> are<00:01:51.060> actually

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
of time the the diff seals are actually

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.770 
of time the the diff seals are actually
made<00:01:51.600> or<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.619> side<00:01:52.860> diff<00:01:53.130> seals<00:01:53.430> are<00:01:54.420> actually

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
made or the side diff seals are actually

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.370 
made or the side diff seals are actually
made<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:55.049> leather<00:01:56.180> and<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.539> course<00:01:57.600> they<00:01:58.049> wear

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
made of leather and of course they wear

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.130 
made of leather and of course they wear
out<00:01:58.409> over<00:01:58.530> time<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.729> no<00:01:59.939> longer<00:02:00.000> want<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.960> hold

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
out over time and no longer want to hold

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.039 
out over time and no longer want to hold
the<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.590> gear<00:02:01.770> oil<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.189> differential<00:02:02.670> so

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
the the gear oil in the differential so

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.010 
the the gear oil in the differential so
I<00:02:04.049> didn't<00:02:04.740> replace<00:02:05.039> mine<00:02:05.420> five<00:02:06.420> years<00:02:06.689> ago<00:02:06.899> or

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
I didn't replace mine five years ago or

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.980 
I didn't replace mine five years ago or
so<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.289> would<00:02:07.409> seem<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.649> be<00:02:08.690> leaking<00:02:09.690> not<00:02:09.840> too

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
so it would seem to be leaking not too

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.240 
so it would seem to be leaking not too
badly<00:02:10.200> but<00:02:10.470> it's<00:02:10.619> gotten<00:02:11.160> progressively

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
badly but it's gotten progressively

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.980 
badly but it's gotten progressively
worse<00:02:11.670> over<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.150> last<00:02:12.330> five<00:02:12.570> years<00:02:12.810> so

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
worse over the last five years so

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.160 
worse over the last five years so
generally<00:02:13.470> what<00:02:13.590> I've<00:02:13.680> done<00:02:14.269> is<00:02:15.269> I<00:02:15.540> filled<00:02:16.050> it

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
generally what I've done is I filled it

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.210 
generally what I've done is I filled it
up<00:02:16.200> at<00:02:16.319> the<00:02:16.379> beginning<00:02:16.500> of<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.830> year<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.160> I

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
up at the beginning of the year and I

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.320 
up at the beginning of the year and I
fill<00:02:17.370> that<00:02:17.459> up<00:02:17.519> towards<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:17.940> end<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.180> year

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
fill that up towards the end of the year

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.650 
fill that up towards the end of the year
and

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
and

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.810 
and
it's<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.650> I'm<00:02:19.710> generally<00:02:19.890> pretty<00:02:20.070> good<00:02:20.250> as

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
it's and I'm generally pretty good as

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.930 
it's and I'm generally pretty good as
far<00:02:21.060> as<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.780> mileage<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.260> put<00:02:22.440> on<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.650> car

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
far as the mileage that I put on the car

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.700 
far as the mileage that I put on the car
for<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.060> year<00:02:24.270> so<00:02:24.450> I've<00:02:24.540> got<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.690> slow<00:02:25.170> leak<00:02:25.410> but

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
for the year so I've got a slow leak but

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.220 
for the year so I've got a slow leak but
it<00:02:25.860> is<00:02:25.950> leaking<00:02:26.340> nonetheless<00:02:26.850> so<00:02:27.300> I<00:02:27.540> just

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
it is leaking nonetheless so I just

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.020 
it is leaking nonetheless so I just
prefer<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.560> get<00:02:28.680> under<00:02:28.830> there<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.700> check

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
prefer to get under there and and check

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.940 
prefer to get under there and and check
it<00:02:30.180> once<00:02:30.540> in<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.720> while<00:02:30.870> so<00:02:31.650> that's<00:02:31.740> what<00:02:31.890> I'm

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
it once in a while so that's what I'm

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.620 
it once in a while so that's what I'm
gonna<00:02:32.040> do<00:02:32.190> tonight<00:02:32.340> I'm<00:02:32.550> actually<00:02:32.730> off<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.600> a

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
gonna do tonight I'm actually off to a

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.750 
gonna do tonight I'm actually off to a
try<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:33.900> club<00:02:34.050> meeting<00:02:34.260> tomorrow<00:02:34.410> night<00:02:34.760> and

try and club meeting tomorrow night and

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.950 
try and club meeting tomorrow night and
then<00:02:35.910> I've<00:02:36.030> got<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.240> drive<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.540> triumph<00:02:36.840> into

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
then I've got to drive the triumph into

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.480 
then I've got to drive the triumph into
work<00:02:37.200> which<00:02:37.440> is<00:02:37.590> kind<00:02:37.800> of<00:02:37.830> unusual<00:02:37.980> for<00:02:38.400> me

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
work which is kind of unusual for me

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.370 
work which is kind of unusual for me
it's<00:02:38.610> about<00:02:38.700> an<00:02:39.390> hour<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.930> little<00:02:40.140> bit<00:02:40.260> to

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
it's about an hour and a little bit to

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.290 
it's about an hour and a little bit to
work<00:02:40.530> for<00:02:40.710> me<00:02:40.800> in<00:02:41.250> rush-hour<00:02:41.610> traffic<00:02:41.730> so<00:02:42.240> I'm

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
work for me in rush-hour traffic so I'm

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.460 
work for me in rush-hour traffic so I'm
not<00:02:42.420> looking<00:02:42.690> forward<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.020> that<00:02:43.140> tomorrow

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
not looking forward to that tomorrow

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.590 
not looking forward to that tomorrow
I'll<00:02:44.100> probably<00:02:44.280> end<00:02:44.550> up<00:02:44.640> going<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:45.000> little

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
I'll probably end up going a little

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.960 
I'll probably end up going a little
later<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:46.080> work<00:02:46.260> but<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.950> want<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.850> make<00:02:47.940> sure

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
later to work but I want to make sure

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.310 
later to work but I want to make sure
that<00:02:48.180> I<00:02:48.240> make<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.510> there<00:02:48.630> safely<00:02:48.990> and<00:02:49.050> I<00:02:49.140> don't

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
that I make it there safely and I don't

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.800 
that I make it there safely and I don't
hurt<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.620> car<00:02:49.770> so<00:02:50.100> I'm<00:02:51.000> gonna<00:02:51.330> do<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.540> diff

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
hurt the car so I'm gonna do the diff

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.090 
hurt the car so I'm gonna do the diff
and<00:02:54.230> maybe<00:02:55.230> once<00:02:55.380> I<00:02:55.410> get<00:02:55.530> under<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.770> car<00:02:55.890> we'll

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
and maybe once I get under the car we'll

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.350 
and maybe once I get under the car we'll
we'll<00:02:56.400> give<00:02:56.520> you<00:02:56.610> a<00:02:56.640> shot<00:02:56.850> under<00:02:57.000> there<00:02:57.180> and

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
we'll give you a shot under there and

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.930 
we'll give you a shot under there and
I'll<00:02:57.600> show<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.960> access<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:59.670> fact

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
I'll show you the access and the fact

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.000 
I'll show you the access and the fact
that<00:03:00.060> these<00:03:00.900> CR<00:03:01.200> sixes<00:03:01.530> didn't<00:03:01.740> come<00:03:01.860> with<00:03:01.980> a

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
that these CR sixes didn't come with a

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.760 
that these CR sixes didn't come with a
drain<00:03:02.250> plug<00:03:02.430> in<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.790> in<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.330> diff<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:04.500> drain

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
drain plug in the in the diff to drain

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.920 
drain plug in the in the diff to drain
the<00:03:04.950> old<00:03:05.040> oil<00:03:05.310> so<00:03:05.640> really<00:03:06.420> all<00:03:06.510> I'm<00:03:06.600> gonna<00:03:06.690> do

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
the old oil so really all I'm gonna do

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:13.310 
the old oil so really all I'm gonna do
is<00:03:07.140> just<00:03:07.860> top<00:03:08.010> it<00:03:08.070> up<00:03:11.390> hey<00:03:12.390> guys<00:03:12.630> well<00:03:12.900> don't

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
is just top it up hey guys well don't

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.160 
is just top it up hey guys well don't
think<00:03:13.380> it<00:03:13.500> was<00:03:13.590> gonna<00:03:13.710> work<00:03:13.920> out<00:03:14.070> too<00:03:14.250> well<00:03:14.280> but

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
think it was gonna work out too well but

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.150 
think it was gonna work out too well but
it's<00:03:16.170> pretty<00:03:16.380> tight<00:03:16.560> on<00:03:16.680> here<00:03:16.830> if<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.010> can

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
it's pretty tight on here if you can

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.640 
it's pretty tight on here if you can
imagine<00:03:17.600> I'm<00:03:18.600> kind<00:03:18.840> of<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:18.930> big<00:03:19.080> guy<00:03:19.290> in<00:03:19.470> I

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
imagine I'm kind of a big guy in I

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.560 
imagine I'm kind of a big guy in I
probably<00:03:20.550> don't<00:03:20.700> have<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:20.940> car<00:03:21.120> up<00:03:21.180> as<00:03:21.330> high

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
probably don't have the car up as high

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.600 
probably don't have the car up as high
as<00:03:21.600> I<00:03:21.840> should<00:03:22.050> but<00:03:22.440> that<00:03:23.340> would<00:03:23.460> take<00:03:23.580> some

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
as I should but that would take some

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.710 
as I should but that would take some
extra<00:03:23.970> effort<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.300> I<00:03:24.330> don't<00:03:24.420> want<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.660> go

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
extra effort and I don't want to go

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.960 
extra effort and I don't want to go
there<00:03:24.960> so<00:03:25.170> anyway<00:03:25.710> I've<00:03:26.340> got<00:03:26.520> up<00:03:26.640> far<00:03:26.820> enough

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
there so anyway I've got up far enough

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.760 
there so anyway I've got up far enough
for<00:03:27.210> me<00:03:27.300> to<00:03:27.390> get<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.570> drain<00:03:28.200> plug<00:03:28.380> out<00:03:28.590> which

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
for me to get the drain plug out which

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.510 
for me to get the drain plug out which
is<00:03:28.920> actually<00:03:29.550> way<00:03:30.150> up<00:03:30.300> in<00:03:30.480> there<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:32.280> as<00:03:32.430> you

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
is actually way up in there and as you

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.460 
is actually way up in there and as you
can<00:03:32.640> see<00:03:32.820> like<00:03:33.000> I<00:03:33.120> said<00:03:33.330> there's<00:03:33.990> actually<00:03:34.230> no

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
can see like I said there's actually no

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.520 
can see like I said there's actually no
drain<00:03:35.460> plug<00:03:35.700> in<00:03:35.850> these<00:03:35.970> stiffs<00:03:36.390> a<00:03:36.630> lot<00:03:37.290> of<00:03:37.410> guys

drain plug in these stiffs a lot of guys

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.200 
drain plug in these stiffs a lot of guys
will<00:03:37.740> actually<00:03:37.860> draw<00:03:38.250> this<00:03:38.370> little<00:03:38.520> boss<00:03:38.820> here

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
will actually draw this little boss here

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.050 
will actually draw this little boss here
at<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:39.960> bottom<00:03:40.230> and<00:03:40.350> top<00:03:40.890> it<00:03:41.100> and<00:03:41.340> put<00:03:41.520> a<00:03:41.550> plug

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
at the bottom and top it and put a plug

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.370 
at the bottom and top it and put a plug
in<00:03:42.210> there<00:03:42.390> so<00:03:42.510> you<00:03:42.600> can<00:03:42.720> actually<00:03:42.750> drain<00:03:43.230> the

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
in there so you can actually drain the

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.310 
in there so you can actually drain the
old<00:03:43.500> fluid<00:03:43.740> out<00:03:44.660> so<00:03:45.660> basically<00:03:46.020> what<00:03:46.230> the

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
old fluid out so basically what the

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.370 
old fluid out so basically what the
process<00:03:46.650> is<00:03:46.830> to<00:03:47.630> define<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:48.780> diff<00:03:49.080> plug<00:03:49.260> on

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
process is to define the diff plug on

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.610 
process is to define the diff plug on
the<00:03:49.440> side<00:03:49.650> of<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.920> diff<00:03:50.850> and<00:03:51.090> then<00:03:51.240> you<00:03:51.620> just

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
the side of the diff and then you just

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.160 
the side of the diff and then you just
use<00:03:52.800> a<00:03:52.830> fluid<00:03:53.190> pump<00:03:53.370> or<00:03:53.670> I<00:03:53.700> use<00:03:54.060> an<00:03:54.209> old<00:03:54.390> oil<00:03:54.780> can

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
use a fluid pump or I use an old oil can

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.470 
use a fluid pump or I use an old oil can
pump<00:03:55.560> oil<00:03:55.980> can<00:03:56.490> to<00:03:56.610> throw<00:03:56.700> gear<00:03:56.970> out<00:03:57.090> on<00:03:57.240> there

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
pump oil can to throw gear out on there

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.900 
pump oil can to throw gear out on there
so<00:03:57.660> maybe<00:03:58.530> just<00:03:58.650> fill<00:03:59.310> it<00:03:59.430> until<00:03:59.490> it<00:03:59.700> drains

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
so maybe just fill it until it drains

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.320 
so maybe just fill it until it drains
out<00:04:00.120> so<00:04:00.690> that's<00:04:00.870> what<00:04:01.020> I'm<00:04:01.080> going<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.260> do<00:04:01.410> and

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
out so that's what I'm going to do and

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.580 
out so that's what I'm going to do and
hopefully<00:04:03.330> that'll<00:04:03.480> go<00:04:03.630> successfully<00:04:04.200> and

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
hopefully that'll go successfully and

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.500 
hopefully that'll go successfully and
we'll<00:04:05.100> talk<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:05.280> you<00:04:05.340> later<00:04:05.459> all<00:04:05.760> right<00:04:05.790> if<00:04:06.390> you

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
we'll talk to you later all right if you

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.820 
we'll talk to you later all right if you
can<00:04:06.660> see<00:04:06.780> that<00:04:06.930> or<00:04:07.050> not<00:04:07.080> but<00:04:07.290> that's<00:04:07.410> generally

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
can see that or not but that's generally

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.980 
can see that or not but that's generally
the<00:04:07.890> idea<00:04:08.220> what<00:04:08.370> I<00:04:08.400> do<00:04:08.520> I<00:04:08.730> they<00:04:09.600> get<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.870> old

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
the idea what I do I they get the old

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.210 
the idea what I do I they get the old
squeezable<00:04:11.030> flexible<00:04:12.030> spouts<00:04:12.680> oil<00:04:13.680> can<00:04:14.040> this

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
squeezable flexible spouts oil can this

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.270 
squeezable flexible spouts oil can this
is<00:04:14.370> an<00:04:14.459> old<00:04:14.610> one<00:04:14.820> and<00:04:15.630> I<00:04:16.470> feed<00:04:17.040> it<00:04:17.160> up

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
is an old one and I feed it up

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.060 
is an old one and I feed it up
underneath<00:04:18.260> the<00:04:19.260> diff<00:04:19.440> and<00:04:19.590> into<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.830> side

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
underneath the diff and into the side

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.720 
underneath the diff and into the side
and<00:04:21.049> pump<00:04:22.049> it<00:04:22.140> until<00:04:22.380> it<00:04:22.500> runs<00:04:22.620> out<00:04:22.800> all<00:04:23.580> right

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
and pump it until it runs out all right

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.520 
and pump it until it runs out all right
that's<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.120> process<00:04:26.300> ready

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
that's the process ready

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.000 
that's the process ready
for<00:04:27.680> another<00:04:27.770> day<00:04:27.980> so<00:04:28.870> got<00:04:29.870> the<00:04:29.960> dip<00:04:30.110> oil<00:04:30.740> done

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
for another day so got the dip oil done

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.010 
for another day so got the dip oil done
it's<00:04:31.220> about<00:04:32.470> 8:30<00:04:33.520> and<00:04:34.520> just<00:04:35.090> wandered<00:04:35.750> up<00:04:35.840> the

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
it's about 8:30 and just wandered up the

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.600
