00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
team again is spawning this area should

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.939 
team again is spawning this area should
be<00:04:34.729> pretty<00:04:35.180> safe<00:04:35.590> hopefully<00:04:36.590> they<00:04:36.680> can<00:04:36.740> watch

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:36.949 
be pretty safe hopefully they can watch

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.909 
be pretty safe hopefully they can watch
my<00:04:37.190> back<00:04:37.460> as<00:04:38.090> my<00:04:38.660> guy<00:04:38.900> he's<00:04:39.139> kind<00:04:39.410> of<00:04:39.530> playing

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
my back as my guy he's kind of playing

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.460 
my back as my guy he's kind of playing
with<00:04:40.009> his<00:04:40.160> RC<00:04:40.520> car<00:04:40.550> and<00:04:41.060> there's<00:04:41.870> my<00:04:42.050> Valkyrie

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
with his RC car and there's my Valkyrie

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.469 
with his RC car and there's my Valkyrie
rockets<00:04:43.039> so<00:04:43.430> I'm<00:04:43.970> going<00:04:44.030> to<00:04:44.150> go<00:04:44.270> in<00:04:44.389> this

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
rockets so I'm going to go in this

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.450 
rockets so I'm going to go in this
corner<00:04:44.870> and<00:04:44.990> this<00:04:45.530> is<00:04:45.680> how<00:04:45.800> i<00:04:45.830> use<00:04:46.069> Valkyrie

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
corner and this is how i use Valkyrie

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.939 
corner and this is how i use Valkyrie
rockets<00:04:47.139> so<00:04:48.139> what<00:04:48.259> I<00:04:48.319> do<00:04:48.380> is<00:04:48.500> I<00:04:48.800> basically

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
rockets so what I do is I basically

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:50.830 
rockets so what I do is I basically
shoot<00:04:49.430> straight<00:04:49.789> up<00:04:49.880> in<00:04:49.970> the<00:04:50.030> air<00:04:50.090> I<00:04:50.449> use<00:04:50.810> a

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
shoot straight up in the air I use a

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.550 
shoot straight up in the air I use a
boat<00:04:51.139> maybe<00:04:51.830> a<00:04:51.949> fifth<00:04:52.220> of<00:04:52.340> my<00:04:52.460> gas<00:04:52.729> and<00:04:53.199> I<00:04:54.199> just

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
boat maybe a fifth of my gas and I just

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.950 
boat maybe a fifth of my gas and I just
fly<00:04:54.800> around<00:04:54.860> till<00:04:55.280> you<00:04:55.340> see<00:04:55.550> a<00:04:55.660> couple<00:04:56.660> red

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
fly around till you see a couple red

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.050 
fly around till you see a couple red
spots<00:04:57.229> and<00:04:57.470> there's<00:04:57.590> a<00:04:57.650> nice<00:04:57.830> double<00:04:58.070> kill<00:04:58.400> on

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
spots and there's a nice double kill on

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.180 
spots and there's a nice double kill on
a<00:04:59.120> map<00:04:59.509> like<00:04:59.690> jungle<00:05:00.050> Valkyrie<00:05:00.889> Rockets

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
a map like jungle Valkyrie Rockets

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.730 
a map like jungle Valkyrie Rockets
anything<00:05:01.639> that's<00:05:01.880> airborne<00:05:02.449> in<00:05:02.690> jungle<00:05:03.470> is<00:05:03.680> a

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
anything that's airborne in jungle is a

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.189 
anything that's airborne in jungle is a
good<00:05:04.340> kill<00:05:04.580> streak<00:05:04.880> just<00:05:05.539> because<00:05:05.720> it's<00:05:05.960> such

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 
good kill streak just because it's such

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:08.350 
good kill streak just because it's such
an<00:05:06.349> open<00:05:06.650> area<00:05:06.800> anything<00:05:07.729> in<00:05:07.820> the<00:05:07.910> air<00:05:08.030> can

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
an open area anything in the air can

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.870 
an open area anything in the air can
basically<00:05:08.690> kill<00:05:09.050> you<00:05:09.199> guys<00:05:09.259> and<00:05:09.710> right<00:05:10.699> there

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
basically kill you guys and right there

basically kill you guys and right there
I<00:05:10.910> got<00:05:11.120> a<00:05:11.150> single<00:05:11.419> kill<00:05:11.720> I<00:05:11.960> thought<00:05:12.289> I<00:05:12.349> would

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
I got a single kill I thought I would

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.890 
I got a single kill I thought I would
have<00:05:12.650> got<00:05:12.800> a<00:05:12.830> double<00:05:13.190> there<00:05:13.340> but<00:05:13.639> oh<00:05:13.820> well<00:05:14.120> 15

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
have got a double there but oh well 15

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.570 
have got a double there but oh well 15
and<00:05:15.050> 2<00:05:15.139> right<00:05:15.349> now<00:05:15.530> let's<00:05:15.949> keep<00:05:16.160> going<00:05:16.460> let's

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
and 2 right now let's keep going let's

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.370 
and 2 right now let's keep going let's
find<00:05:16.880> some<00:05:17.060> more<00:05:17.090> guys<00:05:17.360> I<00:05:17.720> want<00:05:17.930> more<00:05:18.169> velcro

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
find some more guys I want more velcro

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.830 
find some more guys I want more velcro
rockets<00:05:18.860> well<00:05:19.699> since<00:05:19.970> we<00:05:20.150> have<00:05:20.240> time<00:05:20.449> let<00:05:20.750> me

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
rockets well since we have time let me

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.930 
rockets well since we have time let me
tell<00:05:21.050> you<00:05:21.199> in<00:05:21.349> a<00:05:21.409> bit<00:05:21.590> more<00:05:21.740> detail<00:05:21.800> of<00:05:22.490> how<00:05:22.880> to

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
tell you in a bit more detail of how to

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.029 
tell you in a bit more detail of how to
use<00:05:23.270> velcro<00:05:23.539> rockets<00:05:24.050> now<00:05:24.349> if<00:05:24.470> you<00:05:24.620> think<00:05:24.860> that

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 
use velcro rockets now if you think that

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:26.529 
use velcro rockets now if you think that
the<00:05:25.159> velcro<00:05:25.370> rocket<00:05:25.880> is<00:05:25.970> a<00:05:26.000> lot<00:05:26.240> like<00:05:26.419> the

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539 
the velcro rocket is a lot like the

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:28.570 
the velcro rocket is a lot like the
predator<00:05:26.750> missile<00:05:27.259> in<00:05:27.349> modern<00:05:27.650> warfare<00:05:27.710> 2<00:05:28.220> you

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
predator missile in modern warfare 2 you

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.490 
predator missile in modern warfare 2 you
would<00:05:28.729> be<00:05:28.849> correct<00:05:28.880> but<00:05:29.570> one<00:05:29.870> big<00:05:30.020> plus<00:05:30.320> in

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
would be correct but one big plus in

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.140 
would be correct but one big plus in
this<00:05:30.650> is<00:05:30.830> that<00:05:31.099> you<00:05:31.250> get<00:05:31.370> two<00:05:31.580> of<00:05:31.610> them<00:05:31.849> they're

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
this is that you get two of them they're

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.550 
this is that you get two of them they're
a<00:05:32.180> little<00:05:32.389> hard<00:05:32.630> to<00:05:32.720> get<00:05:32.870> used<00:05:33.050> to<00:05:33.259> but<00:05:33.380> they're

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
a little hard to get used to but they're

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.200 
a little hard to get used to but they're
actually<00:05:33.740> an<00:05:34.009> awesome<00:05:34.430> killstreak<00:05:34.880> once<00:05:35.090> you

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
actually an awesome killstreak once you

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.850 
actually an awesome killstreak once you
get<00:05:35.330> the<00:05:35.419> hang<00:05:35.449> of<00:05:35.720> it<00:05:35.840> and<00:05:35.990> guys<00:05:36.349> do<00:05:36.710> you

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
get the hang of it and guys do you

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.680 
get the hang of it and guys do you
remember<00:05:36.889> how<00:05:37.430> big<00:05:37.669> the<00:05:37.820> splash<00:05:38.090> damage<00:05:38.360> was

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
remember how big the splash damage was

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.390 
remember how big the splash damage was
for<00:05:39.080> a<00:05:39.110> predator<00:05:39.470> missile<00:05:39.830> on<00:05:39.919> modern<00:05:40.220> warfare

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
for a predator missile on modern warfare

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.120 
for a predator missile on modern warfare
2<00:05:40.789> it<00:05:41.180> was<00:05:41.360> huge<00:05:41.780> and<00:05:41.960> i<00:05:42.500> would<00:05:42.650> say<00:05:42.770> Valkyrie

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
2 it was huge and i would say Valkyrie

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.159 
2 it was huge and i would say Valkyrie
rockets<00:05:43.550> have<00:05:43.699> close<00:05:44.000> to<00:05:44.210> the<00:05:44.330> same<00:05:44.509> amount<00:05:44.690> so

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
rockets have close to the same amount so

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:46.510 
rockets have close to the same amount so
you<00:05:45.259> should<00:05:45.380> have<00:05:45.409> no<00:05:45.590> problem<00:05:45.710> taking<00:05:46.280> out

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
you should have no problem taking out

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.550 
you should have no problem taking out
two<00:05:46.729> or<00:05:46.759> more<00:05:47.000> guys<00:05:47.210> easily<00:05:47.930> so<00:05:48.199> as<00:05:48.349> I<00:05:48.500> said

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
two or more guys easily so as I said

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.959 
two or more guys easily so as I said
earlier<00:05:48.830> you're<00:05:49.520> going<00:05:49.669> to<00:05:49.729> want<00:05:49.849> to<00:05:49.909> shoot

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:49.969 
earlier you're going to want to shoot

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:51.640 
earlier you're going to want to shoot
the<00:05:50.270> velcro<00:05:50.479> rocket<00:05:50.990> straight<00:05:51.259> up<00:05:51.409> in<00:05:51.530> the<00:05:51.560> air

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
the velcro rocket straight up in the air

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.649 
the velcro rocket straight up in the air
use<00:05:52.099> about<00:05:52.340> a<00:05:52.400> quarter<00:05:52.759> of<00:05:52.789> the<00:05:52.880> gas<00:05:53.150> and<00:05:53.449> then

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:53.659 
use about a quarter of the gas and then

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:55.300 
use about a quarter of the gas and then
turn<00:05:53.960> around<00:05:53.990> and<00:05:54.440> you<00:05:54.620> should<00:05:54.830> have<00:05:55.009> a<00:05:55.039> clear

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
turn around and you should have a clear

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.580 
turn around and you should have a clear
I<00:05:55.610> of<00:05:55.940> where<00:05:56.240> everyone<00:05:56.690> is<00:05:56.870> on<00:05:57.080> the<00:05:57.169> map<00:05:57.349> and

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
I of where everyone is on the map and

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.320 
I of where everyone is on the map and
you<00:05:57.620> have<00:05:58.190> the<00:05:58.340> choice<00:05:58.490> of<00:05:58.789> killing<00:05:59.120> whoever
