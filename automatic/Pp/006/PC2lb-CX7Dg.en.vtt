00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
but I just took one of the routes went

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.000 
but I just took one of the routes went
on<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:27.390> side<00:02:27.569> and<00:02:27.599> I'll<00:02:27.930> look<00:02:28.379> I'm<00:02:28.590> right

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
on the side and I'll look I'm right

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.920 
on the side and I'll look I'm right
behind<00:02:29.189> all<00:02:29.549> of<00:02:29.579> them<00:02:29.879> so<00:02:30.389> what<00:02:30.569> can<00:02:30.659> you<00:02:30.719> do

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
behind all of them so what can you do

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.229 
behind all of them so what can you do
you<00:02:31.439> can<00:02:31.620> just<00:02:31.799> shoot<00:02:32.040> them<00:02:32.219> all<00:02:32.400> capture<00:02:33.150> the

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
you can just shoot them all capture the

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.500 
you can just shoot them all capture the
hardpoint<00:02:33.629> get<00:02:34.469> up<00:02:34.650> but<00:02:35.489> low<00:02:35.700> 2<00:02:35.730> points<00:02:36.269> get

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
hardpoint get up but low 2 points get

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.619 
hardpoint get up but low 2 points get
your<00:02:36.659> kill<00:02:36.870> streaks<00:02:37.139> and<00:02:37.349> start<00:02:37.739> running<00:02:37.920> now

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
your kill streaks and start running now

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.429 
your kill streaks and start running now
seriously<00:02:39.629> that<00:02:39.870> is<00:02:39.989> probably<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.290> most

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
seriously that is probably the most

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.319 
seriously that is probably the most
useful<00:02:40.530> thing<00:02:40.799> ever<00:02:41.099> like<00:02:41.310> just<00:02:41.519> try<00:02:41.879> to<00:02:41.939> flank

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
useful thing ever like just try to flank

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.449 
useful thing ever like just try to flank
go<00:02:42.750> around<00:02:43.109> trying<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.560> make<00:02:43.769> sure<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.250> go

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
go around trying to make sure you go

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.009 
go around trying to make sure you go
behind<00:02:44.819> your<00:02:44.909> enemies<00:02:45.239> because<00:02:45.569> with

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
behind your enemies because with

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.349 
behind your enemies because with

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
hardpoint you can almost guarantee the

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:49.699 
hardpoint you can almost guarantee the
fact<00:02:48.569> that<00:02:48.659> everyone's<00:02:49.230> going<00:02:49.349> to<00:02:49.379> be<00:02:49.500> running

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
fact that everyone's going to be running

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.159 
fact that everyone's going to be running
to<00:02:50.159> the<00:02:50.189> hardpoint<00:02:50.700> like<00:02:51.090> like<00:02:51.689> cheap<00:02:51.989> you

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:52.169 
to the hardpoint like like cheap you

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:54.349 
to the hardpoint like like cheap you
know<00:02:52.260> be<00:02:52.409> like<00:02:52.470> bad<00:02:52.919> and<00:02:53.489> just<00:02:53.970> run<00:02:54.209> the

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
know be like bad and just run the

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:55.729 
know be like bad and just run the
hardpoint<00:02:54.659> so<00:02:54.900> if<00:02:55.109> you<00:02:55.290> manage<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.560> get

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
hardpoint so if you manage to get

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.289 
hardpoint so if you manage to get
between<00:02:55.889> the<00:02:56.220> sheep<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.609> a<00:02:56.669> hard<00:02:56.849> point<00:02:57.030> or
