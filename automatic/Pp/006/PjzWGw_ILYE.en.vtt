00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.820
 what's up, teacher 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.650
 today's tip from the board and then teacher 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.210
 serves everybody are five 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.119
 pressures we use on a daily basis 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:19.810
 Look, but one of them is just 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:22.830
 which will be in absolute certainty 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:26.320
 another alternative in the month of June 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.240
 expressly prohibited a large majority in the 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.740
 It's true, a lot of people talk about all these 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.630
 expressions and that the personal church is 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.550
 Everybody says it wrong, I came here. 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.920
 at a company in the mountains to ask for help 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.989
 that the people you think tell me there 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.409
 that's right 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:44.620
 alternative is the third in the month of 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:47.139
 June is a correct is great majority 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.850
 think it's another alternative 

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:51.219
 I think we 'll go and ask for help. 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.459
 teacher let's go by elimination 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:57.729
 if there is a certainty it will always be 

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:58.619
 absurd then never say certainty 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:02.260
 absolute 

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:04.540
 second item another alternative is the 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.140
 high element in Greek already means 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.299
 other 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.140
 so there's no need to say another 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.649
 alternative 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.939
 just saying I do not have 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:15.700
 alternative for example but what gives 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:18.280
 two alternatives that will say I do not 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.030
 I have an alternative or I do not have another 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.159
 option is in the month of June with the use of 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.909
 June word there is no need to 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:30.399
 writing the correct answer is in 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.310
 July that June always immense 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:36.399
 this is also true for the year there is not no 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.460
 need to say in the year 2013 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:42.520
 just say in 2013 fourth item 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.560
 expressly prohibited or album is 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.240
 prohibited or not 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.450
 there is no need for the term 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:53.549
 expressly or strictly the only 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:58.719
 correct answer is great majority reason 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:02.289
 majority corresponds to at least 50% more 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:05.560
 a large majority may correspond to 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:08.310
 example to 80% then the difference 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.890
 in saying majority and great majority 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.600
 agrees 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.090
 afternoon we said things without 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.319
 you do not even know you're talking 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.030
 repetitive thing 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.030
 Thanks teacher thank you, thanks people.
