00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
gym bag full of nice tools that I use it

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.490 
gym bag full of nice tools that I use it
to<00:00:24.810> gym<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.680> one<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.039> tools<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:27.500> tape

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
to gym and one of the tools is tape

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.859 
to gym and one of the tools is tape
measure<00:00:28.849> and<00:00:29.849> when<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.150> use<00:00:30.330> this<00:00:30.449> tape<00:00:30.660> measure

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
measure and when I use this tape measure

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.880 
measure and when I use this tape measure
for<00:00:31.340> first<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.489> all<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:33.200> to<00:00:34.200> make<00:00:34.380> sure<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.710> rim

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
for first of all is to make sure the rim

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.069 
for first of all is to make sure the rim
or<00:00:35.340> whatever<00:00:35.940> I'm<00:00:36.059> working<00:00:36.210> with<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.660> 10-foot

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
or whatever I'm working with is 10-foot

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.360 
or whatever I'm working with is 10-foot
because<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.440> lot<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.800> rims<00:00:37.980> are<00:00:38.219> not

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
because a lot of the rims are not

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.709 
because a lot of the rims are not
10-foot<00:00:38.940> but<00:00:39.870> first<00:00:40.410> I'll<00:00:40.620> measure<00:00:41.629> you<00:00:42.629> know

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
10-foot but first I'll measure you know

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.299 
10-foot but first I'll measure you know
if<00:00:42.809> I'm<00:00:42.930> using<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.320> rim<00:00:43.530> it's<00:00:43.860> really<00:00:44.070> easy<00:00:44.219> to

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
if I'm using a rim it's really easy to

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.700 
if I'm using a rim it's really easy to
use<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.610> rim<00:00:44.789> because<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.960> just<00:00:46.170> reach<00:00:46.379> up<00:00:46.559> in

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
use the rim because you just reach up in

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.750 
use the rim because you just reach up in
the<00:00:46.860> air<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.899> touch<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.190> to<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.309> rim<00:00:50.520> and

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
the air and touch this to the rim and

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.990 
the air and touch this to the rim and
see<00:00:51.449> what<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.719> difference<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:53.100> if<00:00:53.789> we

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
see what the difference is so if we

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.689 
see what the difference is so if we
reach<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.390> up<00:00:54.649> just<00:00:55.649> touching<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.190> rim<00:00:56.370> was

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
reach it up just touching the rim was

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.689 
reach it up just touching the rim was
say<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.600> know<00:00:57.719> 20<00:00:58.109> inches<00:00:58.469> 25<00:00:58.890> inches<00:00:58.949> 30

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
say you know 20 inches 25 inches 30

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.639 
say you know 20 inches 25 inches 30
inches<00:01:00.090> then<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:00.840> know<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.260> if<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.500> can

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
inches then you know that if you can

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.709 
inches then you know that if you can
stand<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.309> touch<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.239> rim<00:01:03.390> while<00:01:03.600> you're

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
stand and touch the rim while you're

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.740 
stand and touch the rim while you're
jumping<00:01:03.930> 30<00:01:04.290> inches<00:01:04.700> and<00:01:05.700> if<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.330> can<00:01:06.479> stand

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
jumping 30 inches and if you can stand

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.870 
jumping 30 inches and if you can stand
and<00:01:07.110> touch<00:01:07.850> here<00:01:09.380> say<00:01:10.380> well<00:01:11.220> then<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.729> can

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
and touch here say well then you can

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.100 
and touch here say well then you can
jump<00:01:12.060> 30<00:01:12.270> inches<00:01:12.659> plus<00:01:14.869> whatever<00:01:15.869> that

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
jump 30 inches plus whatever that

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.190 
jump 30 inches plus whatever that
distance<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.490> now<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:18.509> particular

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
distance is so now in this particular

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.270 
distance is so now in this particular
example<00:01:19.290> if<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.549> rim<00:01:20.729> was<00:01:21.740> 30<00:01:22.740> inches<00:01:23.130> away

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
example if the rim was 30 inches away

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.710 
example if the rim was 30 inches away
and<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:24.600> could<00:01:24.930> touch<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.680> rim<00:01:26.040> right<00:01:26.189> here

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
and I could touch the rim right here

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.120 
and I could touch the rim right here
then<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.930> would<00:01:28.049> be<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.439> 38-inch<00:01:29.430> vertical

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
then that would be a 38-inch vertical

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.280 
then that would be a 38-inch vertical
but<00:01:32.130> that's<00:01:32.340> just<00:01:32.520> an<00:01:32.759> approximation<00:01:33.329> what

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
but that's just an approximation what

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.380 
but that's just an approximation what
you<00:01:34.409> really<00:01:34.619> need<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.890> do<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.460> measure<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
you really need to do is measure the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.929 
you really need to do is measure the
distance<00:01:37.079> between<00:01:37.430> what<00:01:38.430> you're<00:01:38.640> standing

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
distance between what you're standing

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.480 
distance between what you're standing
reaches<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.990> what<00:01:40.799> you're<00:01:40.950> able<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.220> touch

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
reaches and what you're able to touch

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.990 
reaches and what you're able to touch
which<00:01:42.360> will<00:01:42.540> be<00:01:43.070> what<00:01:44.070> your<00:01:44.250> vertical<00:01:44.640> jump<00:01:44.670> is

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
which will be what your vertical jump is

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.370 
which will be what your vertical jump is
so<00:01:46.850> this<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.000> what<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.149> use<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.170> use<00:01:49.350> it

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
so this is what I use and you use it

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.530 
so this is what I use and you use it
with<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.710> rim<00:01:49.890> or<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.610> can<00:01:50.759> use<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:50.970> with<00:01:51.299> a

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
with the rim or you can use it with a

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.389 
with the rim or you can use it with a
wall<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:52.140> can<00:01:52.290> use<00:01:52.380> anything<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:52.979> can<00:01:53.220> jump

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
wall you can use anything you can jump

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.410 
wall you can use anything you can jump
up<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.700> touch<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.930> know<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:56.240> tell<00:01:57.240> people

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
up and touch and you know I tell people

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.270 
up and touch and you know I tell people
they<00:01:57.600> always<00:01:57.810> need<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.170> be<00:01:58.259> measuring<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:58.979> you

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
they always need to be measuring so you

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.289 
they always need to be measuring so you
know<00:01:59.369> there's<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.640> lot<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.880> tricks<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.240> can

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
know there's a lot of tricks you can

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.569 
know there's a lot of tricks you can
come<00:02:00.600> up<00:02:00.750> with<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:01.259> end<00:02:01.740> up<00:02:01.860> training<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.399> lot

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
come up with I end up training in a lot

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.090 
come up with I end up training in a lot
of<00:02:02.700> different<00:02:02.969> areas<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.710> let's<00:02:04.710> say<00:02:04.890> for

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
of different areas so let's say for

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.319 
of different areas so let's say for
example<00:02:05.130> you're<00:02:05.520> going<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.729> use<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.909> ceiling

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
example you're going to use the ceiling

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.570 
example you're going to use the ceiling
in<00:02:06.780> your<00:02:06.960> own<00:02:07.079> home<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.920> let's<00:02:08.160> say<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.340> can

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
in your own home so let's say you can

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.969 
in your own home so let's say you can
you<00:02:09.239> reach<00:02:09.479> up<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.929> air<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.649> distance

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
you reach up in the air and the distance

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.280 
you reach up in the air and the distance
between<00:02:11.160> your<00:02:11.459> fingers<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.239> ceiling

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
between your fingers and the ceiling

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.770 
between your fingers and the ceiling
is<00:02:13.379> ten<00:02:14.370> inches<00:02:14.549> so<00:02:14.939> that<00:02:15.209> would<00:02:15.329> be<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.450> 10<00:02:15.629> inch

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
is ten inches so that would be a 10 inch

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.869 
is ten inches so that would be a 10 inch
vertical<00:02:16.110> jump<00:02:16.290> obviously<00:02:16.769> you<00:02:16.860> need<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.730> be

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
vertical jump obviously you need to be

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.539 
vertical jump obviously you need to be
able<00:02:17.939> to<00:02:18.090> jump<00:02:18.590> reach<00:02:19.590> further<00:02:20.010> than<00:02:20.219> that<00:02:20.280> so

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
able to jump reach further than that so

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.009 
able to jump reach further than that so
your<00:02:20.700> next<00:02:20.909> step<00:02:21.120> would<00:02:21.299> be<00:02:21.359> to<00:02:21.480> touch<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:21.900> with

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
your next step would be to touch it with

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.080 
your next step would be to touch it with
your<00:02:22.049> knuckles<00:02:22.590> so<00:02:23.370> then<00:02:23.519> you<00:02:23.609> would<00:02:23.730> just<00:02:23.760> add

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
your knuckles so then you would just add

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.190 
your knuckles so then you would just add
the<00:02:24.239> distance<00:02:24.920> from<00:02:25.920> your<00:02:26.159> knuckles<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:27.200> add

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
the distance from your knuckles and add

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.369 
the distance from your knuckles and add
that<00:02:28.409> on<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:28.980> if<00:02:29.549> that<00:02:29.730> distance<00:02:30.030> my<00:02:30.989> fingers

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
that on so if that distance my fingers

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.470 
that on so if that distance my fingers
to<00:02:31.530> my<00:02:31.650> knuckles<00:02:32.010> is<00:02:32.159> four<00:02:32.370> inches<00:02:32.549> well<00:02:33.329> if<00:02:33.420> I

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
to my knuckles is four inches well if I

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.000 
to my knuckles is four inches well if I
can<00:02:33.659> touch<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:34.049> with<00:02:34.170> my<00:02:34.290> inches<00:02:34.650> then<00:02:34.829> it's

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
can touch that with my inches then it's

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.220 
can touch that with my inches then it's
the<00:02:35.220> ten<00:02:35.430> inches<00:02:35.730> plus<00:02:35.909> the<00:02:36.180> four<00:02:36.450> so<00:02:37.200> my

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
the ten inches plus the four so my

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.309 
the ten inches plus the four so my
vertical<00:02:37.620> would<00:02:37.859> be<00:02:38.040> 14<00:02:38.970> inches<00:02:39.329> now<00:02:39.930> if<00:02:40.049> I<00:02:40.139> can

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
vertical would be 14 inches now if I can

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.479 
vertical would be 14 inches now if I can
do<00:02:40.409> that<00:02:40.620> well<00:02:40.889> then<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.069> want<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.310> touch<00:02:41.459> it

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
do that well then I want to touch it

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.399 
do that well then I want to touch it
with<00:02:41.639> my<00:02:41.849> wrist<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:42.569> if<00:02:42.659> I<00:02:42.750> can<00:02:42.900> reach<00:02:43.079> up<00:02:43.260> and

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
with my wrist so if I can reach up and

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.199 
with my wrist so if I can reach up and
touch<00:02:43.469> it<00:02:43.680> with<00:02:43.769> my<00:02:43.920> wrist<00:02:44.159> then<00:02:44.879> I<00:02:44.969> measure

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
touch it with my wrist then I measure

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.479 
touch it with my wrist then I measure
the<00:02:45.420> distance<00:02:45.450> from<00:02:45.959> my<00:02:46.500> fingers<00:02:46.859> to<00:02:47.069> my<00:02:47.220> wrist

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
the distance from my fingers to my wrist

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.559 
the distance from my fingers to my wrist
and<00:02:48.500> let's<00:02:49.500> say<00:02:49.650> if<00:02:49.769> that<00:02:49.980> was<00:02:50.030> 17<00:02:51.030> inches<00:02:51.389> in

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
and let's say if that was 17 inches in

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.599 
and let's say if that was 17 inches in
this<00:02:51.720> case<00:02:51.989> if<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:52.709> can<00:02:52.889> jump<00:02:53.099> up<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.370> touch<00:02:53.459> it

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
this case if I can jump up and touch it

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.119 
this case if I can jump up and touch it
with<00:02:53.700> my<00:02:53.849> wrist<00:02:54.060> then<00:02:54.269> is<00:02:54.389> 17<00:02:54.900> inches<00:02:55.109> and<00:02:55.470> if

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
with my wrist then is 17 inches and if

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:57.800 
with my wrist then is 17 inches and if
you<00:02:56.220> need<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.400> go<00:02:56.519> further<00:02:56.909> you<00:02:57.180> can<00:02:57.329> go<00:02:57.389> and

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
you need to go further you can go and

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.020 
you need to go further you can go and
use<00:02:58.079> your<00:02:58.290> elbow<00:02:58.609> so<00:02:59.609> that<00:03:01.310> is<00:03:02.310> another<00:03:02.790> way<00:03:02.970> to

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
use your elbow so that is another way to

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.429 
use your elbow so that is another way to
do<00:03:03.269> it<00:03:03.389> if<00:03:03.569> you're<00:03:03.750> doing<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:04.049> in<00:03:04.139> your<00:03:04.260> home

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:04.439 
do it if you're doing it in your home

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:05.809 
do it if you're doing it in your home
where<00:03:04.709> you<00:03:04.739> don't<00:03:04.980> have<00:03:05.129> something<00:03:05.430> to

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
where you don't have something to

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.629 
where you don't have something to
measure<00:03:06.269> your<00:03:06.480> vertical<00:03:06.900> with<00:03:07.489> another<00:03:08.489> way

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
measure your vertical with another way

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.330 
measure your vertical with another way
you<00:03:08.700> can<00:03:08.849> do<00:03:08.939> is<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.150> can<00:03:09.269> use<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.629> backboard

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
you can do is you can use the backboard

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.530 
you can do is you can use the backboard
now<00:03:11.340> this<00:03:11.489> isn't<00:03:11.700> gonna<00:03:11.970> be<00:03:12.090> a<00:03:12.239> little<00:03:12.419> more

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
now this isn't gonna be a little more

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.080 
now this isn't gonna be a little more
accurate<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:13.139> can<00:03:13.319> you<00:03:14.069> put<00:03:14.280> some<00:03:14.489> paint<00:03:14.879> or

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
accurate you can you put some paint or

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.920 
accurate you can you put some paint or
some<00:03:15.480> tape<00:03:15.750> on<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.079> tip<00:03:16.290> of<00:03:16.319> your<00:03:16.439> finger<00:03:16.829> and

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
some tape on the tip of your finger and

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.469 
some tape on the tip of your finger and
stand<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.229> jump<00:03:19.859> and<00:03:20.069> place<00:03:20.549> that<00:03:20.579> up<00:03:21.150> on<00:03:21.359> the

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:21.479 
stand and jump and place that up on the

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:23.990 
stand and jump and place that up on the
backboard<00:03:21.900> or<00:03:22.109> a<00:03:22.139> wall<00:03:22.409> then<00:03:23.280> reach<00:03:23.519> up<00:03:23.549> and

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
backboard or a wall then reach up and

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.300 
backboard or a wall then reach up and
measure<00:03:24.359> the<00:03:24.569> distance<00:03:24.750> between<00:03:25.109> your<00:03:25.979> hand

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
measure the distance between your hand

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.509 
measure the distance between your hand
and<00:03:26.609> that<00:03:27.239> piece<00:03:27.510> of<00:03:27.659> tape<00:03:27.930> or<00:03:28.260> smudge<00:03:29.159> on<00:03:29.430> the

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
and that piece of tape or smudge on the

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.159 
and that piece of tape or smudge on the
wall<00:03:29.669> what<00:03:30.000> have<00:03:30.090> you've<00:03:30.239> done<00:03:30.620> so<00:03:31.620> basically

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:33.169 
wall what have you've done so basically

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:35.420 
wall what have you've done so basically
there<00:03:34.169> are<00:03:34.229> a<00:03:34.290> lot<00:03:34.409> of<00:03:34.530> ways<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.769> do<00:03:34.919> this<00:03:35.129> and

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
there are a lot of ways to do this and

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.219 
there are a lot of ways to do this and
you<00:03:35.970> may<00:03:36.090> have<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.239> get<00:03:36.389> creative<00:03:36.659> but<00:03:37.079> the

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:37.229 
you may have to get creative but the

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:39.949 
you may have to get creative but the
idea<00:03:37.530> is<00:03:37.849> what<00:03:38.849> you're<00:03:39.030> standing<00:03:39.209> reach<00:03:39.569> and

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
idea is what you're standing reach and

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.629 
idea is what you're standing reach and
what's<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.590> highest<00:03:40.769> distance<00:03:41.370> you<00:03:41.489> can

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
what's the highest distance you can

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.000 
what's the highest distance you can
touch<00:03:41.819> from<00:03:42.150> that<00:03:42.329> standing<00:03:42.720> reach<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.319> you

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
touch from that standing reach and you

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.080 
touch from that standing reach and you
do<00:03:44.190> this<00:03:44.340> often

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
do this often

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.939 
do this often
you<00:03:45.359> know<00:03:45.479> for<00:03:45.780> for<00:03:46.169> training<00:03:46.500> I<00:03:46.590> recommend

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:46.949 
you know for for training I recommend

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:48.619 
you know for for training I recommend
that<00:03:47.010> you<00:03:47.069> do<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.400> really<00:03:48.030> every<00:03:48.359> session

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
that you do it really every session

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:50.330 
that you do it really every session
because<00:03:49.199> it's<00:03:49.379> always<00:03:49.680> gonna<00:03:49.829> change

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
because it's always gonna change

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.949 
because it's always gonna change
and<00:03:50.549> you're<00:03:50.760> gonna<00:03:50.879> get<00:03:51.030> a<00:03:51.090> better<00:03:51.389> reading<00:03:51.659> if

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
and you're gonna get a better reading if

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.869 
and you're gonna get a better reading if
you're<00:03:52.139> doing<00:03:52.290> this<00:03:52.530> on<00:03:52.949> a<00:03:53.010> regular<00:03:53.159> basis

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
you're doing this on a regular basis

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.909 
you're doing this on a regular basis
you're<00:03:54.599> also<00:03:54.720> gonna<00:03:54.989> push<00:03:55.290> yourself<00:03:55.709> to

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
you're also gonna push yourself to

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:00.110 
you're also gonna push yourself to
exceed<00:03:56.419> your<00:03:57.419> current<00:03:57.780> best<00:03:58.760> if<00:03:59.760> you're<00:03:59.970> doing

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
exceed your current best if you're doing

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.140 
exceed your current best if you're doing
this<00:04:00.389> as<00:04:00.629> often<00:04:01.049> as<00:04:01.199> possible<00:04:01.729> so<00:04:02.729> I<00:04:02.760> hope<00:04:03.000> that

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
this as often as possible so I hope that

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.849 
this as often as possible so I hope that
makes<00:04:03.299> sense<00:04:03.389> measuring<00:04:04.260> your<00:04:04.319> vertical<00:04:04.769> is

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
makes sense measuring your vertical is

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.860 
makes sense measuring your vertical is
extremely<00:04:05.519> important<00:04:05.939> for<00:04:06.150> pushing<00:04:06.510> yourself

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
extremely important for pushing yourself

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.110 
extremely important for pushing yourself
for<00:04:07.530> knowing<00:04:07.739> where<00:04:07.889> you're<00:04:08.010> at<00:04:08.159> as<00:04:08.669> well<00:04:08.970> as

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
for knowing where you're at as well as

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.939 
for knowing where you're at as well as
for<00:04:09.359> measuring<00:04:09.780> what<00:04:10.019> your<00:04:10.259> central<00:04:10.919> nervous

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:10.949 
for measuring what your central nervous

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:13.309 
for measuring what your central nervous
system<00:04:11.549> fatigue<00:04:11.909> might<00:04:12.209> be<00:04:12.389> I<00:04:12.599> mean<00:04:13.169> if<00:04:13.229> you

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
system fatigue might be I mean if you

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.710 
system fatigue might be I mean if you
see<00:04:13.470> it<00:04:13.560> going<00:04:13.709> down<00:04:13.829> and<00:04:14.280> down<00:04:14.430> you<00:04:15.389> know<00:04:15.540> that

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
see it going down and down you know that

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.719 
see it going down and down you know that
your<00:04:15.870> central<00:04:16.139> nervous<00:04:16.229> system<00:04:16.799> might<00:04:17.699> be

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
your central nervous system might be

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.659 
your central nervous system might be
fatigued<00:04:18.690> especially<00:04:19.590> if<00:04:20.190> you<00:04:20.370> see<00:04:20.519> your

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
fatigued especially if you see your

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.640 
fatigued especially if you see your
strength<00:04:20.970> going<00:04:21.269> up<00:04:21.450> but<00:04:21.810> you<00:04:21.989> see<00:04:22.169> a<00:04:22.200> vertical

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
strength going up but you see a vertical

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.200 
strength going up but you see a vertical
jump<00:04:22.770> going<00:04:23.099> down

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
jump going down

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.070 
jump going down
