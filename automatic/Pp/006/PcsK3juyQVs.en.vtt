00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.289 
different approach and so I credit the
organization's<00:02:02.229> but<00:02:02.560> for<00:02:03.310> coming<00:02:03.640> together<00:02:03.790> I

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
organization's but for coming together I

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.840 
organization's but for coming together I
think<00:02:04.869> in<00:02:05.049> the<00:02:05.170> end<00:02:05.320> all<00:02:06.310> those<00:02:06.549> resources

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
think in the end all those resources

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.479 
think in the end all those resources
being<00:02:07.540> pulled<00:02:07.840> that<00:02:08.440> will<00:02:08.679> benefit<00:02:09.070> the<00:02:09.250> kids

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
being pulled that will benefit the kids

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.250 
being pulled that will benefit the kids
it'll<00:02:09.880> benefit<00:02:10.239> new<00:02:10.450> kids<00:02:10.720> getting<00:02:11.049> in<00:02:11.170> the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
it'll benefit new kids getting in the

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.110 
it'll benefit new kids getting in the
game<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:11.739> ultimately<00:02:11.829> I<00:02:12.250> hope<00:02:12.459> it<00:02:12.700> benefits

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
game and ultimately I hope it benefits

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.600 
game and ultimately I hope it benefits
more<00:02:13.660> kids<00:02:14.049> playing<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.070> game<00:02:15.250> at<00:02:15.459> higher

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
more kids playing the game at higher

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.880 
more kids playing the game at higher
levels<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.209> maybe<00:02:16.360> even<00:02:16.630> become<00:02:17.380> you<00:02:17.829> know

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
levels and maybe even become you know

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.819 
levels and maybe even become you know
having<00:02:18.370> a<00:02:18.489> larger<00:02:19.000> number<00:02:19.180> that<00:02:19.480> could<00:02:19.600> be

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
having a larger number that could be

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:23.460 
having a larger number that could be
College<00:02:20.829> prospects

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.350 

girls<00:02:24.470> hockey's<00:02:24.770> been<00:02:24.920> under<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.220> radar<00:02:25.430> so<00:02:26.330> I

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
girls hockey's been under the radar so I

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.990 
girls hockey's been under the radar so I
think<00:02:26.630> now<00:02:27.140> having<00:02:27.770> both<00:02:28.130> rinks<00:02:28.610> promoting

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
think now having both rinks promoting

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.610 
think now having both rinks promoting
girls<00:02:29.210> hockey<00:02:29.420> it's<00:02:29.720> just<00:02:29.870> giving<00:02:30.170> us<00:02:30.290> a<00:02:30.380> wider

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
girls hockey it's just giving us a wider

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.190 
girls hockey it's just giving us a wider
net<00:02:31.040> to<00:02:31.340> cast<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:31.940> market<00:02:32.450> it<00:02:32.570> to<00:02:32.600> more<00:02:32.870> girls

net to cast and market it to more girls

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.860 
net to cast and market it to more girls

like hockey and so as we know winners
are<00:02:49.640> long<00:02:49.850> and<00:02:50.150> this<00:02:51.140> is<00:02:51.290> a<00:02:51.320> great<00:02:51.590> place<00:02:51.890> to
