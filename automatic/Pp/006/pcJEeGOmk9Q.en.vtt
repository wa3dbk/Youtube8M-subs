 then manage it's a campaign that was created in 1947 that's the fleet 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.750
 current it is made up of 31 devices the early 70s will be 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.369
 managed by the French state at the elysÃ©e 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.369
 so that the lines with France gets price 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.899
 especially with lille it's called the traffic has evolved since the years 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.090
 70 that 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.160
 at the beginning it was the workers who left to travel back home 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.060
 having been back at the end of the summer after the holidays after that 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.910
 has evolved but now his two children who travels Tuesday to any 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.260
 a community if ali differed demand is a request of the community 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.420
 Algerian to live 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.420
 we did studies we noticed that the area 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.480
 was important to the community in the kent and it also made the 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.330
 palm on the program for two years 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.370
 it is at the opening of the reinforced water line one of the actions 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.260
 % today is the first volume 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.360
 so we are going to ask ourselves that the deal be regular to 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.560
 starting June 26, a daily update on Algeria on September 25th 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.750
 first study which in my opinion at la the freedom of the line for 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:21.320
 removal 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.940
 the second part of the study as long as we're working on 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.940
 the opening of 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.390
 there is a potential 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.850
 and if the program evolves well 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.470
 going on and not addressing too many other openings too and algeria l to 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.960
 to evolve 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.200
 the traffic and at the end of the coasts of the commune that's it's part too 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.480
 of democratic 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.290
 this is the first time this company has been forced to clear 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.770
 enjoys a rather compatible bonus between judges 9 million entries 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.580
 at this price but from 10 am 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.890
 the director of l'ens lyon 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.900
 why it's interesting for us 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.480
 and why it's interesting 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.470
 my sister diana and giscard shined all in short circuit important for 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.480
 you from the island yes because I do not live far already goals to 0 it's 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.380
 easier 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.869
 the list in paris montsouris this is the first time she took the ball 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.609
 the discipline of limits is the first time 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:16.769
 but then what do you think of this reactor is a way to work 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.059
 now it's ours 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:23.139
 and why because it's a practicing man 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:27.400
 it's the least we can say it's only the 5th goal festival in 130 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.949
 days 

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:30.109
 but this one was born from a split 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:31.290
 we went again 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.029
 for their part and for good reason 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:35.259
 this week's discovery 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:37.969
 we have the opportunity to give ourselves time studies 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:41.950
 nice moments of stress what the party will be adept at this problem tgv a 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:44.289
 error plus you have to have a lot of time without taking 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:47.289
 practically all day parise decided together that now 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:49.829
 around 3 hours 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.559
 advantage is that the next game of the month 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:53.380
 that's it 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.609
 on this side where we also speak of minors 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:56.719
 in his grave 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:59.019
 there are a lot of people traveling 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.159
 r I believe they did an investigation at the entrances of the consulate power corp 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.629
 what is the distribution of course deadlines 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.000
 while the club of bruges to jeremy foot who aimed in the world I believe 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:10.049
 that's what motivated this europe who were skeptical
