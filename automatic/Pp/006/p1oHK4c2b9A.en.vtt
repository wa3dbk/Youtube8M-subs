the full size it is 2250 per so kind of

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.779 
the full size it is 2250 per so kind of
expensive<00:00:51.629> for<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.930> lip<00:00:52.170> tint<00:00:52.350> but<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:53.520> can<00:00:53.670> get

wearing most often on my channel lately

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.530 
wearing most often on my channel lately
and<00:02:35.770> that's<00:02:35.830> mixing<00:02:36.340> honey<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:36.910> tulip

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
and that's mixing honey and tulip

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.600 
and that's mixing honey and tulip
together<00:02:37.840> so<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.170> nude<00:02:38.350> and<00:02:38.740> the<00:02:39.160> bold<00:02:39.370> pink

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
together so the nude and the bold pink

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.180 
together so the nude and the bold pink
and<00:02:42.610> I<00:02:43.390> always<00:02:43.480> put<00:02:43.720> honey<00:02:43.930> on<00:02:44.020> first<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:45.010> then

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
and I always put honey on first and then

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.560 
and I always put honey on first and then
I<00:02:45.250> you<00:02:45.310> tulip<00:02:45.670> afterwards<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:49.180> I<00:02:49.240> just<00:02:49.420> think

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
I you tulip afterwards and I just think

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:50.820 
I you tulip afterwards and I just think
that<00:02:49.630> these<00:02:49.780> two<00:02:50.020> together<00:02:50.200> personally

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
that these two together personally

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.010 
that these two together personally
create<00:02:51.160> like<00:02:51.310> your<00:02:52.000> lips<00:02:52.240> but<00:02:52.480> better<00:02:52.540> tint

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
create like your lips but better tint

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.780 
create like your lips but better tint
which<00:02:53.530> is<00:02:53.650> really<00:02:53.860> nice<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.280> obviously

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
which is really nice and obviously

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.220 
which is really nice and obviously
layering<00:02:55.150> two<00:02:55.270> colors<00:02:55.600> is<00:02:55.810> going<00:02:55.960> to<00:02:56.020> give<00:02:56.140> you

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
layering two colors is going to give you

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.560 
layering two colors is going to give you
more<00:02:56.350> coverage<00:02:56.740> and<00:02:56.920> more<00:02:57.820> moisture<00:02:58.300> I<00:02:58.360> think

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
more coverage and more moisture I think

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.270 
more coverage and more moisture I think
so<00:02:58.720> I<00:02:58.930> think<00:02:59.380> it's<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.530> win<00:02:59.650> and<00:02:59.830> then<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.130> other

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
so I think it's a win and then the other

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.430 
so I think it's a win and then the other
mix<00:03:00.520> that<00:03:00.670> I<00:03:00.730> wear<00:03:00.910> often<00:03:01.270> is<00:03:01.480> all<00:03:01.750> mixed<00:03:01.930> tulip

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.650 
mix that I wear often is all mixed tulip
which<00:03:02.590> is<00:03:02.740> the<00:03:02.860> bold<00:03:03.040> pink<00:03:03.490> with<00:03:03.790> berry<00:03:04.360> which

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
which is the bold pink with berry which

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.020 
which is the bold pink with berry which
is<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.900> more<00:03:05.050> purplish<00:03:05.440> slumming<00:03:06.430> color<00:03:06.790> one

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
is the more purplish slumming color one

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.250 
is the more purplish slumming color one
and<00:03:07.060> that<00:03:07.330> gives<00:03:07.480> you<00:03:07.630> more<00:03:07.660> of<00:03:07.810> like<00:03:07.990> a<00:03:08.020> nice

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.110 
for me that's a big deal because I don't
want<00:03:50.709> to<00:03:50.770> have<00:03:50.860> to<00:03:50.950> reapply<00:03:51.250> at<00:03:51.430> 8000<00:03:51.940> times

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
want to have to reapply at 8000 times

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.240 
want to have to reapply at 8000 times
you<00:03:52.360> know<00:03:52.480> it's<00:03:52.750> a<00:03:52.870> bomb<00:03:53.110> so<00:03:53.530> it<00:03:53.620> moisturizes

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
you know it's a bomb so it moisturizes

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.500 
you know it's a bomb so it moisturizes
really<00:03:54.610> well<00:03:54.760> and<00:03:55.000> especially<00:03:55.120> because

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
really well and especially because

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.090 
really well and especially because
there's<00:03:55.780> no<00:03:55.870> petroleum<00:03:56.200> it<00:03:56.680> actually

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
there's no petroleum it actually

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.650 
there's no petroleum it actually
moisturizes<00:03:57.550> because<00:03:57.850> it's<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.209> lot<00:03:58.390> of<00:03:58.510> the

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
moisturizes because it's a lot of the

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.540 
moisturizes because it's a lot of the
different<00:03:59.050> oils<00:03:59.230> as<00:03:59.590> the<00:04:00.040> base<00:04:00.190> so<00:04:00.400> that's

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
different oils as the base so that's

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.820 
different oils as the base so that's
really<00:04:00.820> nice<00:04:00.970> and<00:04:01.269> then<00:04:01.780> along<00:04:02.290> with<00:04:02.440> that<00:04:02.590> it

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
really nice and then along with that it

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.380 
really nice and then along with that it
