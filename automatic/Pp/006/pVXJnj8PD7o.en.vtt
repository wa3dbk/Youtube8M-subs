00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.960
 developed using the tech five 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.460
 wolfenstein the new order puts at 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.020
 try heidi's graphics engine 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.060
 software and allowed us to understand 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.830
 what are the performances both on 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.750
 old generation consoles both on 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.160
 latest hardware 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.260
 let's start by saying that the 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.360
 used technology allowed to 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.460
 machinegames the developer of 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.380
 reach 60 frames per second on 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.300
 all the platforms but the difference 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.670
 main room all in 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.320
 resolution while on the consoles of 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.989
 new wolfenstein generation e 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.809
 rendered at 1080p native on 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.420
 playstation 3 and xbox 360 the game yes 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.370
 obviously stops at 720p 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.680
 the result is evident on the old ones 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.080
 machines you notice more blurry textures 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.159
 less details and graphic effects 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.470
 reduced 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.120
 the smoke and debris on the fire system 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.890
 general lighting and surrender 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.570
 water is definitely less 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.350
 credible on the consoles of the past 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.700
 generation 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.150
 unlike what is possible 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:19.060
 see on playstation 4 and xbox one on 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.860
 xbox 360 we have also noticed some 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.260
 scenes where elements of the are missing 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.480
 vegetation or there are fewer 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.370
 characters 60 frames per second 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.350
 allow you to have an experience of 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.570
 almost identical game but the old one 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.150
 consoles suffer from a showy ring 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.580
 of the screen by comparing the hardware 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.040
 more recent is really hard to notice 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.290
 big differences same resolution e 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.400
 same framerate both on xbox one is that 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.710
 on playstation 4 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.300
 all thanks to the dynamic frame buffer 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.340
 a technique that fits the resolution 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.600
 frame by frame so as to 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.320
 prevent any kind of 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.630
 slowdown 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.940
 it must be said however that the console sony a 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.530
 slightly higher performance with the 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.230
 frame buffer that is applied in 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.130
 much less frequent flashy way up 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.050
 both consoles 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.300
 however, it remains a problem of slowness 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.970
 in loading some more distant textures 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.429
 with a pop effect not too annoying 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.959
 but still present it is a 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.360
 problem inherited from technology 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.420
 megatexture seen for the first time in 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.430
 direction 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.860
 the development team has focused 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.660
 especially on performance and this 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.880
 it is also seen in the environments that 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.700
 mix more detailed textures ad 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.230
 others at lower resolution 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.450
 as expected it is the end-of-line PCs 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.180
 high to reach the top as for 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.950
 graphic quality make the difference clear 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.670
 not between consoles and computers 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.440
 net 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.569
 yet a careful eye can notice a 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.489
 more massive use of particulates beyond 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.640
 to a yield has slightly better than 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.959
 shadows lights and depth of field 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.120
 despite the filters used 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.250
 leasing and unfortunately remains visible on 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.959
 some elements of the environment 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.640
 another advantage on pc and then the 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.940
 possibility to set a resolution 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.410
 higher than 1080p but unlike 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.120
 console versions and in this case the 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.830
 framerate depends a lot on the hardware 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.350
 which can lead to having 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.030
 graphically superior experience but 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.030
 in some cases less stable
