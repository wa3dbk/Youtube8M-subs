our next champion is Henry now he's a

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.550 
our next champion is Henry now he's a
very<00:00:03.030> interesting<00:00:03.300> fighter<00:00:03.750> not<00:00:04.170> because<00:00:04.470> of

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
very interesting fighter not because of

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.470 
very interesting fighter not because of
how<00:00:04.710> he<00:00:04.770> fights<00:00:05.190> more<00:00:05.640> so<00:00:05.850> because<00:00:06.150> of<00:00:06.270> how<00:00:06.420> he

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
how he fights more so because of how he

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.560 
how he fights more so because of how he
thinks<00:00:10.010> this<00:00:11.010> what<00:00:11.880> you<00:00:11.969> see<00:00:12.090> now<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.269> mice

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
thinks this what you see now is mice

little<00:00:12.900> studies<00:00:13.170> in<00:00:13.469> my<00:00:13.590> little<00:00:13.799> study<00:00:14.040> room

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
little studies in my little study room

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.250 
little studies in my little study room
here<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.360> why<00:00:15.509> where<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:15.870> get<00:00:16.080> all<00:00:16.170> of<00:00:16.199> my

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
here is why where I get all of my

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.230 
here is why where I get all of my
homework<00:00:16.740> done<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:17.970> probably

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
homework done and I you probably

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.300 
homework done and I you probably
wondering<00:00:18.510> why<00:00:19.050> what<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.619> studying<00:00:20.220> have

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
wondering why what is that studying have

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.519 
wondering why what is that studying have
to<00:00:20.430> do<00:00:20.550> with<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.880> martial<00:00:21.660> arts<00:00:21.900> I'm<00:00:22.289> pretty

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
to do with the martial arts I'm pretty

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.080 
to do with the martial arts I'm pretty
much<00:00:22.650> self-taught<00:00:23.070> enough<00:00:23.430> in<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.789> martial

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
much self-taught enough in the martial

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.390 
much self-taught enough in the martial
arts<00:00:24.180> everything<00:00:24.990> I've<00:00:25.109> done<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.470> uh<00:00:25.500> out<00:00:26.250> of

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
arts everything I've done is uh out of

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.920 
arts everything I've done is uh out of
my<00:00:26.460> own<00:00:26.609> accord<00:00:26.849> I've<00:00:27.029> had<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.390> decipher<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.810> lot

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
my own accord I've had to decipher a lot

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.410 
my own accord I've had to decipher a lot
of<00:00:28.019> things<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.410> wasn't<00:00:29.400> always<00:00:29.580> able<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.970> attend

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
of things I wasn't always able to attend

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.330 
of things I wasn't always able to attend
the<00:00:30.539> best<00:00:30.750> martial<00:00:31.140> arts<00:00:31.320> course<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:32.070> then<00:00:32.219> I

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
the best martial arts course so then I

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.180 
the best martial arts course so then I
had<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.610> figure<00:00:32.790> out<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.030> lot<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.300> things<00:00:33.480> and

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
had to figure out a lot of things and

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.380 
had to figure out a lot of things and
seeing<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.340> I'm<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.700> am<00:00:35.940> mechanical

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
seeing that I'm I am mechanical

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.540 
seeing that I'm I am mechanical
engineering<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.840> could<00:00:37.020> decide<00:00:37.920> for<00:00:38.160> motion

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
engineering I could decide for motion

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.100 
engineering I could decide for motion
much<00:00:38.910> like<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.090> dancer<00:00:39.450> would<00:00:39.570> say<00:00:39.750> somebody

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
much like a dancer would say somebody

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.920 
much like a dancer would say somebody
perform<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.500> particular<00:00:40.620> dance<00:00:41.190> step<00:00:42.000> break<00:00:42.780> it

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
perform a particular dance step break it

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.900 
perform a particular dance step break it
down<00:00:43.050> into<00:00:43.260> little<00:00:43.430> little<00:00:44.430> tidbits<00:00:44.820> and

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
down into little little tidbits and

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.389 
down into little little tidbits and
depart<00:00:45.570> digested<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:46.680> then<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.950> would<00:00:47.010> do<00:00:47.219> with

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
depart digested so then I would do with

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.580 
depart digested so then I would do with
martial<00:00:48.030> arts<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.360> would<00:00:48.539> see<00:00:49.379> for<00:00:49.469> example

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
martial arts I would see for example

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.500 
martial arts I would see for example
jumping<00:00:50.100> back<00:00:50.219> spinning<00:00:50.550> kick<00:00:50.700> see<00:00:50.910> how<00:00:51.360> this

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
jumping back spinning kick see how this

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.180 
jumping back spinning kick see how this
person<00:00:51.719> will<00:00:51.960> be<00:00:51.989> rotating<00:00:52.530> about<00:00:52.680> what<00:00:52.860> axis

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
person will be rotating about what axis

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.889 
person will be rotating about what axis
what<00:00:53.670> we<00:00:53.699> relative<00:00:54.090> velocity<00:00:54.480> what<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.629> foot

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
what we relative velocity what is foot

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
or where is he focusing on so all these

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.959 
or where is he focusing on so all these
things<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.770> mechanics<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.399> body<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.730> had

things the mechanics of the body I had

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.420 
things the mechanics of the body I had
to<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.300> would<00:01:03.409> be<00:01:04.409> able<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.650> decipher<00:01:04.949> from<00:01:05.220> like

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430

hard<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.560> matter<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.040> having

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.660 
hard is just a matter of you having
velocity<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.869> particular<00:01:43.409> mass<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:44.490> then

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
velocity and a particular mass so then

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.639 
velocity and a particular mass so then
the<00:01:45.149> faster<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.509> go<00:01:45.720> with<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.930> particular<00:01:46.500> mass

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649
