think<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:21.099> most<00:02:21.250> entertaining<00:02:21.580> aspect<00:02:22.090> of

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
think the most entertaining aspect of

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.759 
think the most entertaining aspect of
this<00:02:22.959> mod<00:02:23.200> is<00:02:23.530> that<00:02:23.739> each<00:02:23.980> fish<00:02:24.370> comes<00:02:25.060> with<00:02:25.420> a

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
this mod is that each fish comes with a

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.350 
this mod is that each fish comes with a
random<00:02:26.769> weight<00:02:26.980> so<00:02:27.549> this<00:02:27.760> gave<00:02:28.030> me<00:02:28.060> the

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
random weight so this gave me the

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.930 
random weight so this gave me the
opportunity<00:02:28.959> to<00:02:29.019> say<00:02:29.230> hey<00:02:29.500> I'm<00:02:30.160> going<00:02:30.580> to<00:02:30.670> have

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
opportunity to say hey I'm going to have

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.570 
opportunity to say hey I'm going to have
fishing<00:02:31.629> tourney's<00:02:32.140> I<00:02:32.379> actually<00:02:32.860> set<00:02:33.069> up<00:02:33.099> this

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
fishing tourney's I actually set up this

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.030 
fishing tourney's I actually set up this
fish<00:02:34.090> museum<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:34.930> anyone<00:02:35.290> inside<00:02:35.590> our<00:02:35.739> server

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
fish museum and anyone inside our server

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.920 
fish museum and anyone inside our server
can<00:02:36.459> go<00:02:36.610> ahead<00:02:36.760> find<00:02:37.299> the<00:02:37.450> fish<00:02:37.630> that<00:02:37.810> they

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
can go ahead find the fish that they

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.839 
can go ahead find the fish that they
just<00:02:38.170> caught<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:38.650> if<00:02:38.739> it's<00:02:38.920> heavier<00:02:39.310> they

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
just caught and if it's heavier they

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.000 
just caught and if it's heavier they
take<00:02:40.120> my<00:02:40.390> fish<00:02:40.660> down<00:02:40.900> or<00:02:41.170> whoever's<00:02:41.590> fish<00:02:41.799> down

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
take my fish down or whoever's fish down

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.770 
take my fish down or whoever's fish down
replace<00:02:42.880> it<00:02:43.030> with<00:02:43.120> their<00:02:43.269> own<00:02:43.299> and<00:02:43.630> they've

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
replace it with their own and they've

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.839 
replace it with their own and they've
changed<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.470> sign<00:02:44.739> and<00:02:45.099> put<00:02:45.370> their<00:02:45.610> name<00:02:45.640> and

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
changed the sign and put their name and

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.030 
changed the sign and put their name and
their<00:02:46.209> information<00:02:46.480> so<00:02:47.140> I<00:02:47.170> think<00:02:47.470> you<00:02:47.950> know

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
their information so I think you know

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.240 
their information so I think you know
that<00:02:48.310> adds<00:02:48.519> like<00:02:48.880> an<00:02:49.030> entire<00:02:49.510> thing<00:02:49.959> to<00:02:50.410> this

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250
