00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.390
 careful you do not eat much that then goes to 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.310
 be the one that will serve us for the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.170
 I cook the rice and there is no 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.630

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.760

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.250
 white pepper powder shake and a 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.629
 pinch salt and let it boil 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.629
 medium-high fire 10 minutes 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.940
 time has passed we add the 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:48.940
 carrot inside 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.920
 and finally we add the peas that 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.920
 they come frozen 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.399
 Well, we already have everything perfect 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.830
 let's go pulling chicken looks this 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.630
 When cool let's discard let 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.729
 to book and on the other hand we are going to 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.070
 separate the vegetable from the broth that is going 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.360
 to serve to cook the good rice you see 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.680
 that in the kitchen is not worth everything there that we have 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.200
 put to bake every thing in its moment 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.229
 so that we stay on your point but 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.000
 great we take the vegetable that for a 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.680
 We are going to reserve the side 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.869
 then and on the other hand we 're going to stay 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.250
 with the caldito in the caldito de la 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.720
 cooking because it has flavors 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.090
 impressive of the chicken vegetable 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.640

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.440
 rice spark and color if come let's go to 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.840

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.200
 the sealed rice is closed so that 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.330
 then do not make a platoon or cpi one with 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.090
 another one and on the plate it is left loose 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.520

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.819
