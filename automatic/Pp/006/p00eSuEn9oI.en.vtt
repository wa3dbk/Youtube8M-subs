00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.120 
pro at the bottom he will try to get an
earlier<00:02:00.180> gas<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.750> time<00:02:00.810> he<00:02:01.469> will<00:02:01.590> definitely

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
earlier gas this time he will definitely

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.859 
earlier gas this time he will definitely
have<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.399> option<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.820> going<00:02:03.090> for<00:02:03.719> an<00:02:03.780> early

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
have the option of going for an early

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.020 
have the option of going for an early
gas<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:04.799> would<00:02:04.979> shut<00:02:05.219> down<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.700> early

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
gas and this would shut down the early

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.270 
gas and this would shut down the early
game<00:02:06.180> pressure<00:02:06.570> by<00:02:06.810> Nate<00:02:06.990> poo<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.740> probe<00:02:08.099> is

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
game pressure by Nate poo the probe is

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.559 
game pressure by Nate poo the probe is
at<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.580> bottom<00:02:08.729> while<00:02:09.030> we<00:02:09.149> have<00:02:09.330> the

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
at the bottom while we have the

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.540 
at the bottom while we have the
cybernetics<00:02:10.110> core<00:02:10.319> now<00:02:10.500> for<00:02:10.830> produce

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
cybernetics core now for produce

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.530 
cybernetics core now for produce
yeah<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:12.180> main<00:02:12.390> base<00:02:12.630> being<00:02:13.080> on<00:02:13.230> one<00:02:13.470> gas

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
yeah the main base being on one gas

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.660 
yeah the main base being on one gas
saving<00:02:15.540> some<00:02:15.780> chrono<00:02:16.110> boost<00:02:16.440> energy<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:17.070> the

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
saving some chrono boost energy and the

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.520 
saving some chrono boost energy and the
probe<00:02:17.940> is<00:02:18.120> already<00:02:18.510> saying<00:02:18.810> hi<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.110> drone

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
probe is already saying hi the drone

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.620 
probe is already saying hi the drone
that<00:02:19.680> is<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.070> probe<00:02:20.310> trying<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.970> block<00:02:21.330> and

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
that is the probe trying to block and

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.960 
that is the probe trying to block and
yeah<00:02:22.380> while<00:02:22.680> this<00:02:22.890> phone<00:02:23.130> is<00:02:23.400> not<00:02:23.580> going<00:02:23.820> to

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
yeah while this phone is not going to

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.120 
yeah while this phone is not going to
survive<00:02:24.090> for<00:02:24.510> very<00:02:24.540> long<00:02:24.900> as<00:02:25.170> circlings<00:02:25.890> are

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
survive for very long as circlings are

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.070 
survive for very long as circlings are
down<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:26.940> he<00:02:27.390> has<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.750> cancel<00:02:29.330> cancel<00:02:30.330> started

their way but a hundred gas have been

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.710 
their way but a hundred gas have been
built<00:02:36.930> in<00:02:37.110> here<00:02:37.470> is<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.920> early<00:02:38.490> speed<00:02:38.940> going

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
built in here is the early speed going

haven't<00:02:47.310> been<00:02:47.430> using<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:47.910> lately<00:02:47.940> because<00:02:48.510> the

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
haven't been using it lately because the

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.160 
haven't been using it lately because the
early<00:02:49.110> speed<00:02:49.400> did<00:02:50.400> not<00:02:50.580> make<00:02:50.730> any<00:02:50.760> sense<00:02:51.170> you

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
early speed did not make any sense you

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.500 
early speed did not make any sense you
didn't<00:02:52.410> need<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:53.400> just<00:02:53.640> needed<00:02:54.000> against

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
didn't need it you just needed against

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.140 
didn't need it you just needed against
the<00:02:54.690> aggression<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.680> your<00:02:55.890> opponent<00:02:56.370> lizella

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
the aggression of your opponent lizella

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.170 
the aggression of your opponent lizella
is<00:02:57.330> on<00:02:57.450> whole<00:02:57.630> position<00:02:57.840> there's<00:02:58.440> no<00:02:59.180> getting

piling on the high ground look at that

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.850 
piling on the high ground look at that
we<00:03:07.860> might<00:03:08.190> actually<00:03:08.490> just<00:03:08.760> see<00:03:09.710> we<00:03:10.710> might

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
we might actually just see we might

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.640 
we might actually just see we might
actually<00:03:11.100> just<00:03:11.280> say<00:03:11.610> forget<00:03:11.820> here<00:03:12.380> this<00:03:13.380> might

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
actually just say forget here this might

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.560 
actually just say forget here this might
well<00:03:13.860> be<00:03:14.070> a<00:03:14.100> 48<00:03:14.580> he's<00:03:14.790> not<00:03:14.970> building<00:03:15.210> any

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
well be a 48 he's not building any

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.780 
well be a 48 he's not building any
additional<00:03:16.230> probes<00:03:16.530> he's<00:03:16.860> complete<00:03:17.370> is<00:03:17.550> this

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
additional probes he's complete is this

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.210 
additional probes he's complete is this
a<00:03:17.850> 4<00:03:18.150> gate<00:03:18.330> he's<00:03:18.870> going<00:03:19.350> for<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.650> four<00:03:20.010> gate

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
a 4 gate he's going for the four gate

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.210 
a 4 gate he's going for the four gate
strategy<00:03:20.790> wow<00:03:21.090> this<00:03:21.660> is<00:03:21.959> interesting<00:03:22.530> at<00:03:23.190> the

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
strategy wow this is interesting at the

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.880 
strategy wow this is interesting at the
least<00:03:23.640> this<00:03:24.209> is<00:03:24.450> very<00:03:24.930> very<00:03:25.080> interesting<00:03:25.709> this

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
least this is very very interesting this

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.160 
least this is very very interesting this
could<00:03:26.130> well<00:03:26.370> end<00:03:26.400> games<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.120> last<00:03:27.150> five<00:03:27.810> games

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
could well end games the last five games

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.020 
could well end games the last five games
that<00:03:28.410> I've<00:03:28.560> seen<00:03:28.890> with<00:03:29.070> a<00:03:29.100> fork<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.489> strategy
