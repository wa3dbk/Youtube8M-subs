00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
okay so how long do you

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.440 
okay so how long do you
we<00:02:13.770> have<00:02:13.950> Steven<00:02:14.459> before<00:02:14.760> this<00:02:14.880> stuff<00:02:15.120> starts

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
we have Steven before this stuff starts

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.510 
we have Steven before this stuff starts
to<00:02:15.599> burst<00:02:15.780> before<00:02:16.110> before<00:02:16.830> it<00:02:17.069> doesn't<00:02:17.370> work

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
to burst before before it doesn't work

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.970 
to burst before before it doesn't work
anymore<00:02:17.880> well<00:02:18.180> here's<00:02:18.360> what<00:02:18.569> happens<00:02:18.959> if<00:02:19.410> if

what's<00:02:26.069> happening<00:02:26.400> over<00:02:26.610> in<00:02:26.640> Russia<00:02:27.030> is

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
what's happening over in Russia is

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.600 
what's happening over in Russia is
sanded<00:02:28.140> exactly<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:28.739> if<00:02:28.830> their<00:02:29.010> economies

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
sanded exactly so if their economies

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.699 
sanded exactly so if their economies
start<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.180> turn<00:02:30.599> south<00:02:30.900> then<00:02:31.410> there's<00:02:31.620> going

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
start to turn south then there's going

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.320 
start to turn south then there's going
to<00:02:31.800> be<00:02:31.830> less<00:02:32.010> buyers<00:02:32.340> if<00:02:32.640> they're<00:02:32.790> less<00:02:33.000> buyers

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
to be less buyers if they're less buyers

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.270 
to be less buyers if they're less buyers
for<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.900> debt<00:02:34.110> then<00:02:34.349> guess<00:02:34.560> what<00:02:34.650> happens<00:02:35.130> and

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
for the debt then guess what happens and

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.460 
for the debt then guess what happens and
we<00:02:35.700> have<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.209> raise<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.750> interest<00:02:36.870> rate<00:02:37.230> now

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
we have to raise the interest rate now

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.979 
we have to raise the interest rate now
guess<00:02:37.860> who<00:02:38.099> is<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.819> biggest<00:02:39.060> debtor<00:02:39.569> in<00:02:39.870> the

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
guess who is the biggest debtor in the

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.509 
guess who is the biggest debtor in the
entire<00:02:40.230> world<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:41.040> United<00:02:41.190> States

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
entire world the United States

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.580 
entire world the United States
government<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.360> so<00:02:42.599> if<00:02:42.780> we<00:02:42.810> start<00:02:43.019> seeing

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
government and so if we start seeing

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.830 
government and so if we start seeing
higher<00:02:43.890> interest<00:02:44.280> rates<00:02:44.519> then<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.269> cost<00:02:45.540> of

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
higher interest rates then the cost of

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.009 
higher interest rates then the cost of
this<00:02:46.049> stimulus<00:02:46.890> plan<00:02:47.390> you<00:02:48.390> know<00:02:48.510> raises

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
this stimulus plan you know raises

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.470 
this stimulus plan you know raises
another<00:02:49.170> 200<00:02:49.830> 300<00:02:50.040> billion<00:02:50.459> dollars<00:02:50.880> that's

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
another 200 300 billion dollars that's

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.910 
another 200 300 billion dollars that's
the<00:02:51.750> problem<00:02:51.989> I've<00:02:52.170> had<00:02:52.200> with<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:52.709> when<00:02:52.830> we

the problem I've had with it when we

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.470 
the problem I've had with it when we
