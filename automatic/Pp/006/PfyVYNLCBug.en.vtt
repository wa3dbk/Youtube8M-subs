00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 I am glad to greet everyone today 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.980
 video i will talk about how 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.960
 do gel polish at home for 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.809
 start you need to remove the previous layer of varnish 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.460
 for this I use a remuver from now and 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.470
 to gel polish better mated with the nail 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.390
 you need to select the top layer 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.939
 a special buff that is your 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.070
 glitters after this procedure wipe 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.390
 nail degreaser i use 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.390
 degreasers from severin 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.570
 after you have prepared the plates 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.120
 you can begin to apply the base coat 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.860
 it is very important to remember that all layers 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.840
 must be applied very tone 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.670
 otherwise when drying in the lamp they start 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.329
 behave very strangely in the end altogether 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.329
 don't dry out 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.770
 after you are now bathrooms for both 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:58.040
 hands i need to separate i dry about 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.840
 two names almost do not be scared nails will 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.699
 sticky but it is necessary in order to 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.250
 all the layers interlocked 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:07.100
 after you have dried the base layer 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.920
 it is necessary to apply the color here very much 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.259
 it is important not because if 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.210
 too fat to paint the nails they 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.940
 stop drying and this is very bad 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.070
 will affect your result this varnish 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.630
 pretty well spreads so no 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.630
 need to apply a thick layer 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.340
 I dried each layer absolutely 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.030
 all the fingers are the same first and then 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.679
 big day you need 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.600
 the top layer is applied very carefully not 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.579
 because it can spread because 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.590
 if there are any dents or clearance 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.270
 that's exactly how it dries and give it 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.159
 look ugly this one disappears 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.000
 incredible gloss that remains after 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.000
 cotton gain 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:01.320
 and hold hands again 22 minutes 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.240
 the last layer is also strange 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.759
 stays sticky that's why we again 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.930
 will use degrease 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.940
 rub your nails with a degreaser 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.479
 very carefully so that the nails do not remain 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.479
 sticky 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.040
 at the output we get the same result 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:23.170
 as in the cabin so investing once 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.849
 your nails can make you happy for a long time 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.290
 thanks for watching the video I hope it 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.290
 it was helpful to you bye
