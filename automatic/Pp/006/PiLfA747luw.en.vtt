this<00:00:05.970> is<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.210> magnavox<00:00:06.830> black-and-white<00:00:07.830> TV<00:00:08.309> I

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
this is a magnavox black-and-white TV I

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.140 
this is a magnavox black-and-white TV I
think<00:00:08.760> it's<00:00:08.940> probably<00:00:09.410> maybe<00:00:10.410> in<00:00:10.670> 1950<00:00:11.670> late

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
think it's probably maybe in 1950 late

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.799 
think it's probably maybe in 1950 late
1950s<00:00:13.019> model<00:00:13.410> I'm<00:00:14.219> going<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.460> take<00:00:14.610> apart<00:00:15.000> the

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
1950s model I'm going to take apart the

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.330 
1950s model I'm going to take apart the
take<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.320> chassis<00:00:16.800> out<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:17.039> there<00:00:17.220> and

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
take the chassis out of there and

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.300 
take the chassis out of there and
replace<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.880> camps<00:00:21.289> now<00:00:22.289> if<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.560> look<00:00:22.710> here

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
replace the camps now if you look here

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.220 
replace the camps now if you look here
you'll<00:00:23.640> see<00:00:23.670> how<00:00:24.060> somebody<00:00:24.539> replaced<00:00:25.019> the

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
you'll see how somebody replaced the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.960 
you'll see how somebody replaced the
deflection<00:00:25.859> yoke<00:00:25.890> wiring<00:00:26.519> on<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.820> they<00:00:26.939> just

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
deflection yoke wiring on it they just

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.429 
deflection yoke wiring on it they just
twisted<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:28.880> doesn't<00:00:29.880> even<00:00:29.939> soldered<00:00:30.720> you

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
twisted it doesn't even soldered you

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.760 
twisted it doesn't even soldered you
have<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.980> repair<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:33.290> the<00:00:34.290> edge<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.710> that

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
have to repair that the edge of that

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.160 
have to repair that the edge of that
kinda<00:00:35.340> had<00:00:35.489> disintegrated<00:00:35.820> but<00:00:36.480> we<00:00:37.050> actually

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
kinda had disintegrated but we actually

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.440 
kinda had disintegrated but we actually
did<00:00:37.559> test<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.640> picture<00:00:38.969> tube<00:00:39.180> does

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
did test this and the picture tube does

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.780 
did test this and the picture tube does
work<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> good<00:00:40.440> too<00:00:40.860> it's<00:00:41.219> actually<00:00:41.760> a

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
work it is a good too it's actually a

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:50.180 
work it is a good too it's actually a
new<00:00:42.030> rebuilt<00:00:42.690> tube<00:00:42.989> in

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.850 

here's<00:00:51.190> how<00:00:51.370> the<00:00:51.430> magnavox<00:00:52.150> chassis<00:00:52.930> detaches

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
here's how the magnavox chassis detaches

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.370 
here's how the magnavox chassis detaches
you<00:00:54.610> actually<00:00:55.150> don't<00:00:55.360> need<00:00:55.600> chance<00:00:55.900> to<00:00:56.140> catch

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.380 
you actually don't need chance to catch

the chassis or the picture tube from the
bottom<00:00:58.930> board<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:01.030> board<00:01:01.330> that<00:01:01.810> this<00:01:02.140> all

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
bottom board the board that this all

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.009 
bottom board the board that this all
mounts<00:01:02.739> to<00:01:02.950> just<00:01:03.250> kind<00:01:03.489> of<00:01:03.610> it<00:01:04.030> just<00:01:04.300> screws<00:01:04.600> up

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
mounts to just kind of it just screws up

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.560 
mounts to just kind of it just screws up
to<00:01:06.010> this<00:01:06.160> bottom<00:01:06.610> part<00:01:06.760> of<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:06.910> case<00:01:07.210> and<00:01:07.450> you

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
to this bottom part of the case and you

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.120 
to this bottom part of the case and you
just<00:01:07.690> took<00:01:07.900> the<00:01:08.080> whole<00:01:08.290> thing<00:01:08.320> down<00:01:08.770> and<00:01:09.010> move

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
just took the whole thing down and move

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.460 
just took the whole thing down and move
it<00:01:09.280> out<00:01:09.400> or<00:01:10.330> have<00:01:10.540> a<00:01:10.570> trouble<00:01:10.840> figuring<00:01:11.170> out

how<00:01:11.680> to<00:01:11.710> get<00:01:11.979> this<00:01:12.160> chassis<00:01:12.790> out<00:01:12.910> of<00:01:13.090> here<00:01:13.560> but

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
how to get this chassis out of here but

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.770 
how to get this chassis out of here but
you<00:01:14.680> just

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
you just

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.010

old<00:02:05.740> electrolytics<00:02:06.550> in<00:02:06.760> there<00:02:08.580> might<00:02:09.580> be<00:02:09.610> able

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
old electrolytics in there might be able

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.790 
old electrolytics in there might be able
to<00:02:10.030> get<00:02:10.240> to<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.479> electrolytics<00:02:11.200> just<00:02:11.500> from

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
to get to the electrolytics just from

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.290 
to get to the electrolytics just from
the<00:02:11.920> crime<00:02:12.160> there<00:02:12.400> I<00:02:12.430> don't<00:02:12.990> well<00:02:13.990> no<00:02:15.270> none<00:02:16.270> of

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
the crime there I don't well no none of

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:25.020 
the crime there I don't well no none of
theirs<00:02:16.630> there's<00:02:17.380> some<00:02:17.650> down<00:02:18.180> down<00:02:19.180> in<00:02:19.420> there

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.120 

wasn't<00:02:26.030> through<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.450> high<00:02:27.350> voltage<00:02:27.380> and

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
wasn't through the high voltage and

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.740 
wasn't through the high voltage and
everything<00:02:28.520> would<00:02:28.670> be<00:02:28.790> nice<00:02:29.000> if<00:02:29.300> you<00:02:29.420> kind<00:02:29.630> of

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
everything would be nice if you kind of

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.860

in<00:02:33.020> a<00:02:33.170> Plexiglas<00:02:33.580> cabinet<00:02:34.580> we<00:02:35.060> probably<00:02:35.330> could

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
in a Plexiglas cabinet we probably could

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.240 
in a Plexiglas cabinet we probably could
actually<00:02:35.870> demonstrate<00:02:36.590> it<00:02:36.680> like<00:02:36.830> this<00:02:37.040> once

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
you know one thing I got it

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.670 
you know one thing I got it
when<00:02:55.240> I<00:02:55.330> got<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.660> better<00:02:55.840> deal<00:02:56.050> with<00:02:56.470> more<00:02:58.680> no

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
when I got the better deal with more no

when I got the better deal with more no
yeah<00:03:00.100> you<00:03:00.160> could<00:03:00.400> only<00:03:00.550> choose<00:03:00.880> those

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
yeah you could only choose those

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.300 
yeah you could only choose those
attached<00:03:01.540> oh<00:03:01.810> look<00:03:02.140> at<00:03:02.260> that<00:03:02.290> i<00:03:02.830> mean<00:03:02.950> just

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.400 

methyl<00:03:37.080> says

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.680 

it's<00:03:41.040> like<00:03:41.250> a<00:03:41.280> no<00:03:41.580> hang-up<00:03:42.150> end<00:03:42.480> of<00:03:42.630> a

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
it's like a no hang-up end of a

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:54.010 
it's like a no hang-up end of a
paintbrush

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.920 

ok
