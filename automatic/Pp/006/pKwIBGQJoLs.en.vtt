would<00:00:38.219> like<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.460> stress<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.790> he<00:00:38.910> went<00:00:39.090> down

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
would like to stress that he went down

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.090 
would like to stress that he went down
not<00:00:39.719> playing<00:00:40.050> badly<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.590> either<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.980> those

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
not playing badly in either of those

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.580 
not playing badly in either of those
games<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.329> know<00:00:42.600> even<00:00:43.140> though<00:00:43.200> he<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.440> now

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
games so you know even though he is now

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.139 
games so you know even though he is now
out<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.890> both<00:00:44.160> star<00:00:44.430> leagues<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.760> really<00:00:45.030> do

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
out of both star leagues I really do

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.450 
out of both star leagues I really do
feel<00:00:45.180> for<00:00:45.570> him<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.870> guess<00:00:46.230> he'll<00:00:46.500> probably<00:00:46.710> now

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
feel for him I guess he'll probably now

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.130 
feel for him I guess he'll probably now
have<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.789> chance<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.120> show<00:00:48.270> us<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.780> best<00:00:48.989> of

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
have the chance to show us the best of

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.540 
have the chance to show us the best of
his<00:00:49.260> play<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> Pro<00:00:49.980> League<00:00:50.129> even<00:00:50.489> though

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
his play in the Pro League even though

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.950 
his play in the Pro League even though
he's<00:00:50.700> out<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.000> Star<00:00:51.180> League<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.750> am

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
he's out of the Star League so I am

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.229 
he's out of the Star League so I am
looking<00:00:52.140> forward<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.620> watching<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.879> game<00:00:54.059> as

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
looking forward to watching that game as

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.490 
looking forward to watching that game as
well<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.600> I'm<00:00:54.690> looking<00:00:54.989> forward<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.320> not

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
well and I'm looking forward to not

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.319 
well and I'm looking forward to not
regaining<00:00:56.309> some<00:00:56.579> confidence<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.149> hopefully

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
regaining some confidence and hopefully

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.540 
regaining some confidence and hopefully
beating<00:00:57.750> Dark<00:00:57.930> Elf<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.739> have<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.309> say<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.430> don't

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
beating Dark Elf I have to say I don't

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.580 
beating Dark Elf I have to say I don't
think<00:01:00.030> I've<00:01:00.570> always<00:01:00.960> felt<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.410> don't

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
think I've always felt that I don't

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.680 
think I've always felt that I don't
think<00:01:01.800> terran<00:01:02.070> vs<00:01:02.340> turn<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.730> not<00:01:03.059> as<00:01:03.210> strongest

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
think terran vs turn is not as strongest

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.719 
think terran vs turn is not as strongest
matchup<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.229> maybe<00:01:04.710> maybe<00:01:05.220> I'm<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.489> little<00:01:05.610> bit

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
matchup and maybe maybe I'm a little bit

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.460 
matchup and maybe maybe I'm a little bit
biased<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.240> respect<00:01:06.659> but<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:06.990> think<00:01:07.260> nada

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
biased in that respect but I think nada

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.590 
biased in that respect but I think nada
tends<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.340> cheese<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> lot<00:01:08.970> on<00:01:09.119> turn<00:01:09.330> versus

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
tends to cheese a lot on turn versus

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.390 
tends to cheese a lot on turn versus
turn<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.530> know<00:01:10.619> boxer<00:01:11.130> tends<00:01:11.310> to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
turn and and I know boxer tends to

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.340 
turn and and I know boxer tends to
cheese<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.610> lot<00:01:11.820> versus<00:01:12.570> turn<00:01:12.750> were<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.080> turn

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
cheese a lot versus turn were in turn

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.990 
cheese a lot versus turn were in turn
versus<00:01:13.590> Terran<00:01:13.770> as<00:01:13.920> well<00:01:14.040> but<00:01:14.189> boxers<00:01:14.640> cheese

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
versus Terran as well but boxers cheese

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.300 
versus Terran as well but boxers cheese
to<00:01:15.659> me<00:01:15.810> seems<00:01:16.229> more<00:01:16.439> convincing<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.100> turn

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
to me seems more convincing in turn

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.249 
to me seems more convincing in turn
versus<00:01:17.580> turn<00:01:17.729> games<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.659> don't<00:01:18.689> get<00:01:19.110> that

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
versus turn games and I don't get that

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.929 
versus turn games and I don't get that
same<00:01:19.439> feeling<00:01:19.500> when<00:01:19.920> nada<00:01:20.130> cheese's<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.729> know

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
same feeling when nada cheese's I know

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.120 
same feeling when nada cheese's I know
you<00:01:21.119> did<00:01:21.330> beat<00:01:21.509> me<00:01:21.540> das<00:01:21.780> with<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.170> rush<00:01:22.409> but

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
you did beat me das with that rush but

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.890 
you did beat me das with that rush but
most<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.670> times<00:01:23.880> we're<00:01:24.090> not<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> hoss<00:01:24.540> he's

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
most of the times we're not a hoss he's

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.660 
most of the times we're not a hoss he's
I<00:01:25.140> have<00:01:25.229> seen<00:01:25.680> him<00:01:25.830> lose<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.250> game<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.460> I

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
I have seen him lose the game and I

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.010 
I have seen him lose the game and I
think<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.909> actually<00:01:27.030> saw<00:01:27.270> him<00:01:27.390> try<00:01:27.570> cheese<00:01:27.840> on

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
think I actually saw him try cheese on

little bit easier to see and now I just

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.290 
little bit easier to see and now I just
started<00:02:51.440> off<00:02:51.500> at<00:02:51.739> the<00:02:52.060> 6<00:02:53.060> o'clock<00:02:53.150> position

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
started off at the 6 o'clock position

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.449 
started off at the 6 o'clock position
that<00:02:53.720> fought<00:02:53.900> on<00:02:53.989> the<00:02:54.050> map<00:02:54.200> and<00:02:54.410> dark<00:02:55.190> alpha

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
that fought on the map and dark alpha

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:56.770 
that fought on the map and dark alpha
started<00:02:55.730> off<00:02:55.820> at<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:56.390> 2<00:02:56.540> o'clock<00:02:56.690> position

started off at the 2 o'clock position

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.830 
started off at the 2 o'clock position
and<00:02:57.290> I<00:02:57.980> guess<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:58.730> fact<00:02:58.910> is<00:02:59.060> that<00:02:59.090> these<00:02:59.630> guys

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
and I guess the fact is that these guys

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.449 
and I guess the fact is that these guys
don't<00:03:00.019> have<00:03:00.140> close<00:03:00.440> positions<00:03:00.920> so<00:03:01.100> that<00:03:01.250> does

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
don't have close positions so that does

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:02.740 
don't have close positions so that does
change<00:03:01.489> the<00:03:01.820> game<00:03:01.970> around<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:02.239> little<00:03:02.360> bit<00:03:02.570> you

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
change the game around a little bit you

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.080 
change the game around a little bit you
tend<00:03:03.709> to<00:03:03.769> see<00:03:03.920> drop<00:03:04.190> ships<00:03:04.459> being<00:03:04.790> more

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
tend to see drop ships being more

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
1 star port build and that was very

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.080 
1 star port build and that was very
possible<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:21.470> I<00:03:21.709> have<00:03:22.400> to<00:03:22.519> say<00:03:22.670> well<00:03:22.880> that's

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
possible and I have to say well that's

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.250 
possible and I have to say well that's
one<00:03:23.239> of<00:03:23.269> the<00:03:23.390> things<00:03:23.540> I've<00:03:23.720> noted<00:03:24.110> about

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
one of the things I've noted about

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.319 
one of the things I've noted about
Python<00:03:24.739> is<00:03:24.950> that<00:03:25.130> those<00:03:25.610> kind<00:03:25.850> of<00:03:25.910> builds<00:03:26.150> are

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
Python is that those kind of builds are

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.440 
Python is that those kind of builds are
certainly<00:03:26.780> more<00:03:26.959> viable<00:03:27.260> on<00:03:27.650> Python<00:03:28.250> one<00:03:29.180> fact

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
certainly more viable on Python one fact

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.150 
certainly more viable on Python one fact
one<00:03:29.630> star<00:03:29.870> port<00:03:30.140> has<00:03:30.320> worked<00:03:30.709> at<00:03:30.860> least<00:03:31.040> a

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
one star port has worked at least a

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.949 
one star port has worked at least a
couple<00:03:31.310> of<00:03:31.489> times<00:03:31.760> on<00:03:32.000> Python<00:03:32.690> I<00:03:32.780> think

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
couple of times on Python I think

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.509 
couple of times on Python I think
Firebat<00:03:33.440> hero<00:03:33.650> again<00:03:34.040> used<00:03:34.280> it<00:03:34.400> successfully

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
Firebat hero again used it successfully

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.770 
Firebat hero again used it successfully
versus<00:03:35.329> movie<00:03:35.750> on<00:03:36.440> this<00:03:36.709> very<00:03:36.920> map<00:03:37.100> so<00:03:37.670> that<00:03:37.910> is

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
versus movie on this very map so that is

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.930 
versus movie on this very map so that is
definitely<00:03:38.930> a<00:03:39.140> viable<00:03:39.380> build<00:03:39.739> I<00:03:39.950> do<00:03:40.190> expect<00:03:40.880> to

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
definitely a viable build I do expect to

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.580 
definitely a viable build I do expect to
see<00:03:41.030> fairly<00:03:41.420> early<00:03:41.690> expansions<00:03:42.320> from<00:03:42.470> both

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590

players<00:03:42.920> I<00:03:42.980> don't<00:03:43.220> think<00:03:43.310> pure<00:03:43.730> cheese<00:03:44.000> is<00:03:44.120> a

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
players I don't think pure cheese is a

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.390 
players I don't think pure cheese is a
viable<00:03:44.360> build<00:03:44.690> I<00:03:44.870> think<00:03:45.290> movie<00:03:45.829> made<00:03:46.370> a

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
viable build I think movie made a

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.310 
viable build I think movie made a
mistake<00:03:46.760> where<00:03:46.970> he<00:03:47.120> went<00:03:47.299> for<00:03:47.570> that<00:03:47.780> fast

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
mistake where he went for that fast

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.199 
mistake where he went for that fast
expansions<00:03:48.950> before<00:03:49.250> his<00:03:49.370> barracks<00:03:49.700> even<00:03:50.060> oh

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209

expansions before his barracks even oh
you<00:03:50.930> know<00:03:51.019> I<00:03:51.049> think<00:03:51.230> at<00:03:51.440> the<00:03:51.530> very<00:03:51.560> least<00:03:51.829> you

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
you know I think at the very least you

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.270 
you know I think at the very least you
need<00:03:52.220> to<00:03:52.340> go<00:03:52.579> power<00:03:53.150> X<00:03:53.329> into<00:03:53.930> expansion<00:03:54.829> or<00:03:55.010> one

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
need to go power X into expansion or one

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.740 
need to go power X into expansion or one
fact<00:03:55.579> into<00:03:55.850> expansion<00:03:56.299> because<00:03:56.540> otherwise

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
fact into expansion because otherwise

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.060 
fact into expansion because otherwise
you're<00:03:57.049> really<00:03:57.290> giving<00:03:57.500> yourself<00:03:57.590> too<00:03:57.920> much

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
you're really giving yourself too much

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.740 
you're really giving yourself too much
of<00:03:58.160> a<00:03:58.220> disadvantage<00:03:58.430> and<00:03:58.880> if<00:03:59.209> you<00:03:59.299> do<00:03:59.420> go<00:03:59.540> back

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
of a disadvantage and if you do go back

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.080 
of a disadvantage and if you do go back
into<00:04:00.109> expansion<00:04:00.769> I<00:04:00.920> think<00:04:01.370> if<00:04:01.489> you<00:04:01.700> spot<00:04:01.970> the

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
into expansion I think if you spot the

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.699 
into expansion I think if you spot the
other<00:04:02.239> player<00:04:02.420> not<00:04:02.600> doing<00:04:02.810> the<00:04:02.900> same<00:04:03.350> or<00:04:03.590> not

other player not doing the same or not

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.619 
other player not doing the same or not

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
going for as already an expansion as you

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:07.780 
going for as already an expansion as you
you<00:04:05.959> need<00:04:06.110> to<00:04:06.200> put<00:04:06.410> a<00:04:06.440> bunker<00:04:06.769> down<00:04:06.890> ASAP<00:04:07.220> and

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
you need to put a bunker down ASAP and

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.339 
you need to put a bunker down ASAP and
that<00:04:08.180> is<00:04:08.330> something<00:04:08.599> that<00:04:08.720> is<00:04:08.810> very<00:04:08.840> important

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
that is something that is very important

that is something that is very important

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.160 
you saw that flash did that versus hoovy
a<00:04:12.100> mad<00:04:12.400> bunker<00:04:12.880> was<00:04:13.390> the<00:04:13.600> key<00:04:13.750> that<00:04:13.900> allowed

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
a mad bunker was the key that allowed

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.260 
a mad bunker was the key that allowed
flash<00:04:14.470> to<00:04:14.650> overcome<00:04:15.400> movie<00:04:15.730> in<00:04:15.880> the<00:04:16.000> previous

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
an early scout there I'm not sure if

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:20.910 
an early scout there I'm not sure if
he's<00:04:19.840> building<00:04:20.080> something<00:04:20.110> this<00:04:20.470> switch<00:04:20.710> to

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
he's building something this switch to

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.610 
he's building something this switch to
the<00:04:21.100> fans<00:04:21.310> and<00:04:22.300> I<00:04:22.630> absolutely<00:04:22.930> love<00:04:23.260> Korean

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
fans and their passion for the game so

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.780 
fans and their passion for the game so
as<00:04:25.750> I<00:04:25.810> said<00:04:25.990> you<00:04:26.170> know<00:04:26.530> I<00:04:26.560> do<00:04:26.710> expect<00:04:27.100> this<00:04:27.280> to

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
as I said you know I do expect this to

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.550 
as I said you know I do expect this to
be<00:04:27.880> a<00:04:27.910> longish<00:04:28.330> game<00:04:28.570> it's<00:04:29.080> very<00:04:29.290> rare<00:04:29.530> that

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
be a longish game it's very rare that

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.130 
be a longish game it's very rare that
we've<00:04:29.860> seen<00:04:30.130> short<00:04:30.520> games<00:04:30.760> and<00:04:30.970> not<00:04:31.660> at<00:04:31.840> going

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
we've seen short games and not at going

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.170 
we've seen short games and not at going
for<00:04:32.380> a<00:04:32.410> fast<00:04:32.950> tag<00:04:33.220> so<00:04:33.430> nada<00:04:33.610> is<00:04:33.790> definitely<00:04:34.120> out

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
for a fast tag so nada is definitely out

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.580 
for a fast tag so nada is definitely out
going<00:04:34.390> for<00:04:34.540> that<00:04:34.630> fast<00:04:34.870> expansion<00:04:35.320> it<00:04:35.410> looks

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
going for that fast expansion it looks

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:36.750 
going for that fast expansion it looks
like<00:04:35.710> nada<00:04:35.890> is<00:04:36.010> going<00:04:36.220> to<00:04:36.310> take<00:04:36.490> very<00:04:36.700> very

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
like nada is going to take very very

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.610 
like nada is going to take very very
quickly<00:04:37.090> both<00:04:37.600> players<00:04:37.840> taking<00:04:38.170> there<00:04:38.290> both

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
quickly both players taking there both

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.280 
quickly both players taking there both
players<00:04:38.890> going<00:04:39.640> for<00:04:39.820> the<00:04:39.880> tag<00:04:40.060> quickly<00:04:40.420> so<00:04:40.840> we

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
players going for the tag quickly so we

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.680 
players going for the tag quickly so we
can<00:04:41.440> expect<00:04:41.770> to<00:04:41.890> see<00:04:42.210> excuse<00:04:43.210> me<00:04:43.360> I<00:04:43.390> would<00:04:43.510> say

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
can expect to see excuse me I would say

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.120 
can expect to see excuse me I would say
again<00:04:43.930> I<00:04:43.960> still<00:04:44.260> think<00:04:44.440> of<00:04:44.500> one<00:04:44.650> fact<00:04:44.920> in<00:04:45.040> two

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
again I still think of one fact in two

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.640 
again I still think of one fact in two
expansion<00:04:45.580> build<00:04:45.760> is<00:04:45.880> very<00:04:46.090> very<00:04:46.270> viable<00:04:46.650> or

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
expansion build is very very viable or

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.350 
expansion build is very very viable or
we<00:04:47.890> might<00:04:48.010> see<00:04:48.220> a<00:04:48.250> one<00:04:48.490> fact<00:04:48.730> one<00:04:48.910> star<00:04:49.120> port

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
we might see a one fact one star port

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.330 
we might see a one fact one star port
built<00:04:49.540> and<00:04:50.170> then<00:04:50.380> followed<00:04:50.740> followed<00:04:51.070> by<00:04:51.280> an

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
built and then followed followed by an

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.790 
built and then followed followed by an
expansion<00:04:51.750> again<00:04:52.750> lots<00:04:53.410> of<00:04:53.530> different

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
expansion again lots of different

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.950 
expansion again lots of different
strategies<00:04:54.130> are<00:04:54.280> viable<00:04:54.910> on<00:04:54.970> this<00:04:55.090> map<00:04:55.270> on

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
strategies are viable on this map on

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.270 
strategies are viable on this map on
this<00:04:56.140> map<00:04:56.320> and<00:04:56.470> both<00:04:56.650> players<00:04:56.890> scouting<00:04:57.220> in

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
this map and both players scouting in

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.200 
this map and both players scouting in
the<00:04:57.340> correct<00:04:57.550> direction<00:04:57.580> so<00:04:57.970> they're<00:04:58.090> gonna

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
the correct direction so they're gonna

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.310 
the correct direction so they're gonna
find<00:04:58.510> each<00:04:58.630> other<00:04:58.780> and<00:04:58.870> both<00:04:59.080> players

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
find each other and both players

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.080 
find each other and both players
strategies<00:04:59.610> mirroring<00:05:00.610> each<00:05:00.670> other<00:05:00.880> we're

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
strategies mirroring each other we're

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.370 
strategies mirroring each other we're
yet<00:05:01.270> to<00:05:01.390> see<00:05:01.510> them<00:05:01.660> diverge<00:05:01.990> and<00:05:02.200> that's

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
yet to see them diverge and that's

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.960 
yet to see them diverge and that's
really<00:05:02.590> when<00:05:02.800> you<00:05:02.890> can<00:05:03.040> you<00:05:03.430> can<00:05:03.580> start<00:05:03.820> making

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
really when you can you can start making

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.280 
really when you can you can start making
guesses<00:05:04.300> about<00:05:04.420> what's<00:05:04.750> gonna<00:05:04.870> happen<00:05:05.200> is

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
guesses about what's gonna happen is

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:06.470 
guesses about what's gonna happen is
when<00:05:05.440> you<00:05:05.530> see<00:05:05.710> the<00:05:05.830> two<00:05:05.980> players<00:05:06.250> strategies

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
when you see the two players strategies

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.330 
when you see the two players strategies
diverging<00:05:07.480> from<00:05:07.510> each<00:05:07.840> other<00:05:08.050> as<00:05:09.010> I<00:05:09.190> said

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
diverging from each other as I said

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.480 
diverging from each other as I said
before<00:05:09.490> chop<00:05:10.120> ships<00:05:10.420> are<00:05:10.930> absolutely<00:05:11.650> key<00:05:12.190> to

actually<00:05:26.650> scouting<00:05:27.010> wrongly<00:05:27.220> so<00:05:27.490> I<00:05:27.550> thought

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
actually scouting wrongly so I thought

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:28.530 
actually scouting wrongly so I thought
dark<00:05:27.910> elf<00:05:28.090> was<00:05:28.180> going<00:05:28.330> in<00:05:28.390> the<00:05:28.450> right

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
dark elf was going in the right

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.060 
dark elf was going in the right
direction<00:05:28.690> but<00:05:28.990> dark<00:05:29.230> elf<00:05:29.410> has<00:05:29.680> counted

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
direction but dark elf has counted

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.280 
direction but dark elf has counted
wrongly<00:05:30.280> but<00:05:30.910> he<00:05:31.000> has<00:05:31.180> to<00:05:31.360> know<00:05:31.480> that<00:05:31.510> nada<00:05:31.960> is

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
wrongly but he has to know that nada is

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.080 
wrongly but he has to know that nada is
in<00:05:32.680> the<00:05:32.770> south<00:05:32.980> at<00:05:33.190> the<00:05:33.220> other<00:05:33.430> base<00:05:33.760> because

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
in the south at the other base because

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.360 
in the south at the other base because
he<00:05:34.150> did<00:05:34.300> see<00:05:34.420> that<00:05:34.450> as<00:05:34.690> SCV<00:05:35.050> run<00:05:35.230> past<00:05:35.410> his<00:05:35.620> and

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
he did see that as SCV run past his and

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.270 
he did see that as SCV run past his and
not<00:05:36.970> just<00:05:37.300> harassing<00:05:38.080> dark<00:05:38.260> elfs<00:05:38.560> SCD<00:05:38.920> that<00:05:39.160> is

that very very rarely works it's only on

that very very rarely works it's only on

space<00:05:48.010> so<00:05:48.130> dark<00:05:48.310> elf<00:05:48.460> is<00:05:48.550> now<00:05:48.700> gonna<00:05:48.880> go<00:05:49.780> and

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
space so dark elf is now gonna go and

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.150 
space so dark elf is now gonna go and
scatter<00:05:50.230> now<00:05:50.350> his<00:05:50.470> base<00:05:50.560> and<00:05:50.650> he<00:05:50.710> might<00:05:50.890> not<00:05:51.010> be

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
scatter now his base and he might not be

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.770 
scatter now his base and he might not be
able<00:05:51.220> to<00:05:51.340> scout<00:05:51.520> advanced<00:05:51.820> smart<00:05:52.270> he<00:05:52.660> would

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
able to scout advanced smart he would

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.090 
able to scout advanced smart he would
have<00:05:52.870> Brock<00:05:53.050> blocked<00:05:53.380> his<00:05:53.530> ramp<00:05:53.710> by<00:05:53.860> now<00:05:53.980> and

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 
have Brock blocked his ramp by now and

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.230 
have Brock blocked his ramp by now and
that's<00:05:54.220> gonna<00:05:54.340> prevent<00:05:54.670> Arkell<00:05:55.060> from

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
that's gonna prevent Arkell from

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.760 
that's gonna prevent Arkell from
scouting<00:05:55.450> it<00:05:55.630> and<00:05:55.810> not<00:05:56.050> a<00:05:56.080> has<00:05:56.320> got<00:05:56.470> a<00:05:56.500> marine

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
scouting it and not a has got a marine

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:57.810 
scouting it and not a has got a marine
on<00:05:56.830> that<00:05:57.010> ramp<00:05:57.190> but<00:05:57.310> I<00:05:57.370> think<00:05:57.550> that<00:05:57.640> should<00:05:57.790> be

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
on that ramp but I think that should be

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.240 
on that ramp but I think that should be
sufficient<00:05:58.390> to<00:05:58.720> block<00:05:58.930> dark<00:05:59.410> elf<00:05:59.650> nada<00:06:00.070> has

Walter<00:06:31.259> is<00:06:31.319> going<00:06:31.499> for<00:06:31.649> very<00:06:31.769> similar

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 
Walter is going for very similar

Walter is going for very similar
strategies<00:06:32.399> at<00:06:32.489> the<00:06:32.519> moment<00:06:32.819> I<00:06:32.849> think<00:06:32.909> the

00:06:33.049 --> 00:06:33.059 
strategies at the moment I think the

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:34.339 
strategies at the moment I think the
fact<00:06:33.300> that<00:06:33.389> nada<00:06:33.599> doesn't<00:06:33.959> seem<00:06:34.139> to<00:06:34.289> be

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:34.349 
fact that nada doesn't seem to be

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:35.209 
fact that nada doesn't seem to be
building<00:06:34.499> the<00:06:34.619> second<00:06:34.860> factory<00:06:35.099> might

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:35.219 
building the second factory might

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:36.379 
building the second factory might
suggest<00:06:35.399> to<00:06:35.580> me<00:06:35.669> that<00:06:35.729> he's<00:06:35.879> gonna<00:06:35.969> be<00:06:36.149> looking

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:36.389 
suggest to me that he's gonna be looking

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:37.489 
suggest to me that he's gonna be looking
to<00:06:36.479> start<00:06:36.629> off<00:06:36.749> that<00:06:36.869> command<00:06:37.169> center<00:06:37.409> that

00:06:37.489 --> 00:06:37.499 
to start off that command center that

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:38.419 
to start off that command center that
he's<00:06:37.589> gonna<00:06:37.679> be<00:06:37.800> looking<00:06:38.039> to<00:06:38.099> start<00:06:38.219> off<00:06:38.309> that

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:38.429 
he's gonna be looking to start off that

00:06:38.429 --> 00:06:40.279 
he's gonna be looking to start off that
expansion<00:06:38.789> and<00:06:39.239> it<00:06:39.449> does<00:06:39.599> look<00:06:39.749> like<00:06:39.899> that<00:06:39.989> has

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:40.289 
expansion and it does look like that has

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:41.869 
expansion and it does look like that has
got<00:06:40.409> that<00:06:40.529> SCD<00:06:40.979> on<00:06:41.129> that<00:06:41.279> Ridge<00:06:41.459> just<00:06:41.699> above

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:41.879 
got that SCD on that Ridge just above

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:43.519 
got that SCD on that Ridge just above
his<00:06:42.059> natural<00:06:42.389> there<00:06:42.539> and<00:06:42.749> I<00:06:43.050> would<00:06:43.229> guess<00:06:43.409> the

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:43.529 
his natural there and I would guess the

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:45.079 
his natural there and I would guess the
purpose<00:06:43.739> of<00:06:43.919> that<00:06:43.949> SDB<00:06:44.339> is<00:06:44.489> to<00:06:44.610> start<00:06:44.819> up<00:06:44.849> his

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:45.089 
purpose of that SDB is to start up his

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:46.429 
purpose of that SDB is to start up his
command<00:06:45.330> center<00:06:45.539> and<00:06:45.689> not<00:06:45.869> on<00:06:46.019> now<00:06:46.199> is

00:06:46.429 --> 00:06:46.439 
command center and not on now is

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:47.959 
command center and not on now is
starting<00:06:47.039> off<00:06:47.129> that<00:06:47.309> turn<00:06:47.489> command<00:06:47.789> center

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:47.969 
starting off that turn command center

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:50.119 
starting off that turn command center
