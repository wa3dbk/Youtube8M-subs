with<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.280> riot<00:01:29.490> shield<00:01:29.549> on<00:01:29.880> their<00:01:30.030> back<00:01:30.210> a

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
with the riot shield on their back a

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.539 
with the riot shield on their back a
sniper<00:01:30.869> rifle<00:01:31.110> or<00:01:31.500> an<00:01:31.619> lmg<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.340> they're<00:01:32.460> not

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
really hindered at all by anything it's

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.039 
really hindered at all by anything it's
craziness<00:01:35.430> they<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:36.180> would<00:01:36.299> be<00:01:36.450> perfect<00:01:36.990> to

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
craziness they it would be perfect to

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.359 
craziness they it would be perfect to
add<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.439> game<00:01:37.590> like<00:01:37.770> Call<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.009> Duty

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
add in the game like Call of Duty

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.880 
add in the game like Call of Duty
because<00:01:38.610> then<00:01:38.850> these<00:01:39.689> idiots<00:01:40.290> who<00:01:40.500> do<00:01:40.710> this

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
because then these idiots who do this

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.280 
because then these idiots who do this
crap<00:01:41.220> wouldn't<00:01:41.970> be<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.210> goddamn<00:01:42.450> successful

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
crap wouldn't be so goddamn successful

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.260 
crap wouldn't be so goddamn successful
so<00:01:43.860> have<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.189> weight<00:01:44.399> threshold<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:44.970> how<00:01:45.119> much

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
so have a weight threshold of how much

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.880 
so have a weight threshold of how much
guns<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.840> can<00:01:45.990> have<00:01:46.110> not<00:01:46.290> likes<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.680> where<00:01:46.799> it

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
guns you can have not likes it where it

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.109 
guns you can have not likes it where it
hits<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.130> point<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.369> say<00:01:47.490> oh<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.640> can't<00:01:47.939> carry

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
hits the point of say oh you can't carry

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.249 
hits the point of say oh you can't carry
that<00:01:48.240> many<00:01:48.420> guns<00:01:48.659> because<00:01:48.810> that's<00:01:49.020> that

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
that many guns because that's that

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.139 
that many guns because that's that
wouldn't<00:01:49.619> make<00:01:49.680> sense<00:01:49.740> as<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.579> can<00:01:50.729> put<00:01:51.060> as

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
wouldn't make sense as you can put as

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.240 
wouldn't make sense as you can put as
many<00:01:51.270> guns<00:01:51.540> as<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.869> want<00:01:52.079> on<00:01:52.200> or<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:53.009> perks

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
many guns as you want on or the perks

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.649 
many guns as you want on or the perks
will<00:01:53.520> allow<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.820> or<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.210> creative<00:01:54.600> class

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
will allow you or the creative class

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.780 
will allow you or the creative class
will<00:01:54.960> allow<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.290> but<00:01:55.890> everyone<00:01:56.490> or

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
will allow you but everyone or

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.399 
will allow you but everyone or
everything<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.600> put<00:01:57.810> on<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.110> then

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
everything that you put on that then

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.100 
everything that you put on that then
goes<00:01:58.920> through<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.310> weight<00:01:59.490> threshold<00:02:00.049> so<00:02:01.049> you

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
goes through a weight threshold so you

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.560 
goes through a weight threshold so you
can<00:02:01.380> if<00:02:01.560> sorry<00:02:01.950> obviously<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.759> submachine<00:02:03.329> gun

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
can if sorry obviously a submachine gun

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.510 
can if sorry obviously a submachine gun
and<00:02:03.810> maybe<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.170> shotgun<00:02:04.229> would<00:02:05.130> be<00:02:05.280> lightweight

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
and maybe a shotgun would be lightweight

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.819 
and maybe a shotgun would be lightweight
so<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.329> can<00:02:06.509> run<00:02:06.659> around<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.990> lot<00:02:07.110> faster<00:02:07.320> again

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
so you can run around a lot faster again

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.320 
so you can run around a lot faster again
don't<00:02:08.429> remove<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.759> lightweight<00:02:09.090> perk

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
don't remove the lightweight perk

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.780 
don't remove the lightweight perk
because<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.660> kind<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:09.929> balance<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.790> so

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
because that kind of balance is it so

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.250 
because that kind of balance is it so
then<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.030> can<00:02:12.150> move<00:02:12.239> around<00:02:12.390> faster<00:02:12.900> if<00:02:13.140> you

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
then it can move around faster if you

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.559 
then it can move around faster if you
have

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
have

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.989 
have
an<00:02:13.749> assault<00:02:14.530> rifle<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:15.459> move<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.670> little<00:02:15.909> bit

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:15.999 
an assault rifle you move a little bit

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:18.780 
an assault rifle you move a little bit
slow<00:02:16.329> up<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:16.659> if<00:02:16.780> you<00:02:16.900> have<00:02:17.109> a<00:02:17.609> sniper<00:02:18.609> rifle

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
slow up and if you have a sniper rifle

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.720 
slow up and if you have a sniper rifle
or<00:02:19.209> an<00:02:19.329> LMG<00:02:19.810> you<00:02:20.079> may<00:02:20.230> you<00:02:20.680> move<00:02:20.889> even<00:02:21.129> slower

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
or an LMG you may you move even slower

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.610 
or an LMG you may you move even slower
but<00:02:22.239> then<00:02:22.450> if<00:02:22.599> you<00:02:22.689> want<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:22.959> have<00:02:23.079> a<00:02:23.109> secondary

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
but then if you want to have a secondary

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.619 
but then if you want to have a secondary
weapon<00:02:24.040> especially<00:02:24.249> a<00:02:24.549> fucking<00:02:25.060> riot<00:02:25.269> shield

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
weapon especially a fucking riot shield

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.670 
weapon especially a fucking riot shield
then<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.590> can't<00:02:26.829> sprint<00:02:27.219> at<00:02:27.370> all<00:02:28.200> only<00:02:29.200> fair

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
then you can't sprint at all only fair

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.289 
then you can't sprint at all only fair
because<00:02:29.920> it's<00:02:30.219> ridiculous<00:02:30.639> but<00:02:30.670> if<00:02:31.030> you<00:02:31.150> have

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
because it's ridiculous but if you have

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.089 
because it's ridiculous but if you have
like<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:31.510> submachine<00:02:32.049> gun<00:02:32.230> anti-riot<00:02:32.739> Jill

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
like a submachine gun anti-riot Jill

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.349 
like a submachine gun anti-riot Jill
then<00:02:33.310> it's<00:02:33.489> a<00:02:33.549> little<00:02:33.760> bit<00:02:33.849> better<00:02:33.969> so<00:02:34.239> you'll

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:34.359 
then it's a little bit better so you'll

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:36.089 
then it's a little bit better so you'll
be<00:02:34.450> able<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.629> as<00:02:34.900> sprint<00:02:35.260> or<00:02:35.590> an<00:02:35.769> assault<00:02:36.040> rifle

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
be able to as sprint or an assault rifle

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.879 
be able to as sprint or an assault rifle
or<00:02:36.430> shotgun<00:02:36.579> not<00:02:37.180> an<00:02:37.389> LMG<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:38.170> not<00:02:38.349> a<00:02:38.379> goddamn

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:38.889 
or shotgun not an LMG and not a goddamn

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.159 
or shotgun not an LMG and not a goddamn
sniper<00:02:39.189> rifle<00:02:39.639> same<00:02:40.120> if<00:02:40.299> you<00:02:40.389> want<00:02:40.569> to<00:02:40.659> have<00:02:40.810> a

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:41.169 
sniper rifle same if you want to have a

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:43.319 
sniper rifle same if you want to have a
sniper<00:02:41.799> rifle<00:02:41.980> in<00:02:42.340> an<00:02:42.400> LMG<00:02:42.819> you<00:02:42.999> shouldn't<00:02:43.269> be

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
sniper rifle in an LMG you shouldn't be

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.059 
sniper rifle in an LMG you shouldn't be
able<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.599> sprint<00:02:43.900> it's<00:02:44.109> just<00:02:44.319> it<00:02:44.530> makes<00:02:44.739> sense

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
able to sprint it's just it makes sense

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.800 
able to sprint it's just it makes sense
and<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.519> balances<00:02:45.669> the<00:02:46.000> game<00:02:46.269> kind<00:02:46.540> of<00:02:46.659> because

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
and it balances the game kind of because

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.929 
and it balances the game kind of because
I'm<00:02:46.930> sick<00:02:47.169> of<00:02:47.200> people<00:02:47.680> running<00:02:47.889> around<00:02:48.129> really

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:48.939 
I'm sick of people running around really

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.899 
I'm sick of people running around really
