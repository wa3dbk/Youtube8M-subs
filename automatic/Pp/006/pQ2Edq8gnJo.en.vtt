00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
to go racing I think about two hundred

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.860 
to go racing I think about two hundred
fifty<00:02:57.160> euros<00:02:57.520> even<00:02:58.120> including<00:02:58.570> spare

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
fifty euros even including spare

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.199 
fifty euros even including spare
batteries<00:02:59.290> and<00:02:59.650> then<00:02:59.830> you<00:02:59.950> can<00:03:00.160> off<00:03:00.310> go<00:03:00.550> on<00:03:01.000> the

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
batteries and then you can off go on the

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.030 
batteries and then you can off go on the
racetrack<00:03:01.360> now<00:03:02.290> we've<00:03:02.440> got<00:03:02.530> one<00:03:02.620> of<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.770> lrp

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
racetrack now we've got one of the lrp

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.440 
racetrack now we've got one of the lrp
cart<00:03:03.430> it<00:03:03.640> just<00:03:03.670> want<00:03:03.970> to<00:03:04.030> talk<00:03:04.209> us<00:03:04.420> through
