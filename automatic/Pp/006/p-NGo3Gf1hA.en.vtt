00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hi people i hope you are fine i 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.150
 have in any case fully bock on the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.599
 video today this is an outfit video 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.590
 again and is up for oversized fashion 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.840
 widest senses 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.540
 that means not only sweaters but everything 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.609
 what is called something area will be 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.359
 I show you and I am happy and 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.520
 have fun 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.500
 my first part is my oversized 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.269
 Pulli and I like in any case 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.510
 very much like the hero in any case 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.880
 drive very well and that is a supreme 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.390
 podium vokuhila style longer in the back 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.559
 as a front and yes , of course , is good 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.170
 if you're a bit behind what 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.670
 would like to cover then offers such a 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.969
 cut in any case 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.020
 and yes, that's what I mean generally 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.570
 or or 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.969
 I like to do that so I know 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.219
 a little bit down really tight 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.260
 fitting things wear like my 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.489
 art leather leggings so tighter than in 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.949
 Leggings are not really 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.250
 I also like to wear shoes 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.430
 high sales because I think when it comes to 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.799
 is a bit bulkier 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.720
 or a bit shaky 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.390
 So it is very relaxed 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.729
 then you sometimes act on flat 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.400
 shoes shorter than you actually are 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.820
 of the size and that's why I'm wearing 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:22.140
 in any case, higher school for and for 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.330
 Actually, I'm so good at that too 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.210
 is my husband timo wess is looking for the 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.080
 is milieu black and white to have now 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.490
 even a little bit longer 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.630
 and he bought him but mango but 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.189
 which ever I am writing 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.409
 In any case, everything in the infobox 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.400
 where I have my things here because you can 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.820
 you read this 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.229
 and yes I think that's called coat 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.939
 actually pretty cool 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.520
 So I think they always see who 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.250
 I have to say fashion and me 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.619
 Combine the whole has also like 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.420
 completely close fitting because of the coat 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.399
 really very much and applies 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.430
 is very voluminous and if you are now 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.260
 inside also something else has anhat then 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.720
 you go up a little bit more 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.700
 I would say that's why I'm up 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.540
 in any case left everything and I do 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:14.360
 you sometimes just to 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:16.890
 to show you the number important so 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.010
 is he and otherwise I wear it too 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.200
 really like a little bit 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.800
 rolled up sleeves and always that 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.780
 actually even access third so not 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.240
 I have quite outfit until now 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.630
 pushed in between and the us 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.980
 means yes that is really ear is like that 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.840
 may not look her in the 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.310
 maybe a little bit like that too 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.780
 who has a lot of fabric and shows 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.709
 give yourself an open one 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.840
 that is quite broad and like that said 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.080
 also very very long so almost 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.550
 like a poncho I would say now and 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.030
 I think you could even do it 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.830
 already wear as one 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.090
 you're welcome to do that again 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.400
 watch a video of me I have yes 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.690
 already a video could and how to 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.489
 the wear can be shown and that is up 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.600
 definitely a scarf I in winter 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:14.340
 I'll probably wear it very often 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.230
 fourth oversize garment is 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.880
 this blouse is here as you can see 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.350
 pretty far not just here 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.480
 but the sleeves are pretty, too 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.489
 flattr the rule of law namely such offenders 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.299
 Must be moz in the sleeve but pretty much 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:29.190
 exaggerated as I think very very far 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.170
 and I think that's pretty much 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.060
 Of course, autumnal is also possible 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.989
 the color is brown 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.510
 then the golden button has one here 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.580
 bit this mustard yellow orange 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.500
 and then again this team blue 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.660
 and that's why I combine the whole thing 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.420
 also like to be with skinny jeans with men 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.730
 the blue and I am so it looks 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.680
 any case very cool and mine 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.120
 shoes to ankle boots are on these 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.860
 brown and I actually think quite 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.500
 comfortable is namely wedge heel 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.910
 Ankle boots and I can vary that 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.709
 So depending on how I've bock 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.770
 I usually wear them the way I do them 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.320
 So now have without any 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.420
 visible the panel inside doing this go 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.270
 I just easily so that I am on 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.010
 then I have the buttons and 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.630
 can fix that and back in the same way 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:19.370
 as I said I actually wear 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:21.200
 that's the way it is and that's definitely the case 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.180
 oversized blouse I like and like 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.830
 also in this autumn or in this 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.480
 I will definitely apply this year 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.760
 Hope you like that were mine 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.640
 four websites garments i 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.190
 I like it and I hope you liked it 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.710
 and I can just give you a hint 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.800
 Just give it a try if you want something 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.420
 is wearing then applied untenrum closely 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.970
 to stay that works in any case 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.890
 better than when everything says I'm sitting and 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.360
 to those who do not dare 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.130
 Maybe they think a bit 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.690
 too thick to trust you the calm 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.750
 Just try in the qualities 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.760
 to play because we see what I am 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.800
 So far, this blouse was and 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.930
 which does not really work as far as 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.180
 the other things, that's why you dare 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.160
 Try a bit and leave us 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.590
 the comments because of their hot or 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.540
 like it or not and if you like the video 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.110
 I would like to thumb that down 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.180
 I am glad 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.520
 I also like to subscribe because missed 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.620
 her nothing and if you are still up 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.630
 want to stay current 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.610
 then that works best with mine 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.260
 social networks then dressing up 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.300
 a lot and I am happy when I am 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.570
 the next time it says to be there again 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.570
