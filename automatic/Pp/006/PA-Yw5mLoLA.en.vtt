it was you know great tournament and my

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.380 
it was you know great tournament and my
hat<00:00:45.360> goes<00:00:45.600> off<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.840> complexity<00:00:46.620> they<00:00:47.390> it's

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
hat goes off to complexity they it's

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.360 
hat goes off to complexity they it's
crazy<00:00:48.629> like<00:00:49.050> if<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.710> didn't<00:00:49.890> get<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.010> chance<00:00:50.190> to

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
crazy like if you didn't get a chance to

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.060 
crazy like if you didn't get a chance to
watch<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.870> which<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:52.140> surprisingly<00:00:52.739> did<00:00:55.070> that

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
watch it which I surprisingly did that

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.639 
watch it which I surprisingly did that
they<00:00:56.399> went<00:00:56.579> down<00:00:56.850> actually<00:00:57.510> two<00:00:58.260> maps<00:00:58.469> to

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
they went down actually two maps to

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.260 
they went down actually two maps to
nothing<00:00:58.980> against<00:00:59.309> epsilon<00:00:59.789> and<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.030> grand

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
nothing against epsilon and the grand

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.789 
nothing against epsilon and the grand
finals<00:01:00.890> now<00:01:02.359> when<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.570> happened<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.260> think

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
finals now when that happened I think

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.320 
finals now when that happened I think
everybody<00:01:05.189> was<00:01:05.309> just<00:01:05.489> like<00:01:05.640> oh<00:01:05.760> it's<00:01:06.119> over

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
everybody was just like oh it's over

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.060 
everybody was just like oh it's over
epsilon<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:06.930> gonna<00:01:07.049> win<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.470> then<00:01:08.340> we<00:01:09.210> go<00:01:09.420> into

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
epsilon is gonna win and then we go into

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.969 
epsilon is gonna win and then we go into
Rick<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.220> capture<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.760> flag<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.830> you<00:01:13.830> know

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
Rick and capture the flag and you know

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.370 
Rick and capture the flag and you know
they<00:01:14.189> they<00:01:14.490> capture<00:01:14.909> five<00:01:15.180> flags<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.840> one<00:01:16.080> and

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
they they capture five flags to one and

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.050 
they they capture five flags to one and
like<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.530> said<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.009> in<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.610> search<00:01:17.909> and

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
like I said and in the search and

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.120 
like I said and in the search and
destroy<00:01:18.180> before<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.780> though<00:01:18.960> they<00:01:19.229> got<00:01:19.409> they

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
destroy before that though they got they

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.679 
destroy before that though they got they
got<00:01:20.159> sick<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:20.610> they<00:01:20.970> didn't<00:01:21.150> even<00:01:21.240> they<00:01:21.509> didn't

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
got sick so they didn't even they didn't

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.810 
got sick so they didn't even they didn't
even<00:01:21.750> take<00:01:21.960> one<00:01:22.140> round<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.680> then<00:01:23.610> they<00:01:23.700> went

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
even take one round and then they went

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.700 
even take one round and then they went
in<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.030> hardpoint<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:25.110> they<00:01:25.200> won<00:01:25.409> Yemen

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
in the hardpoint and they won Yemen

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.890 
in the hardpoint and they won Yemen
hardpoint<00:01:26.159> which<00:01:26.759> they<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.420> know<00:01:27.450> sometimes

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
hardpoint which they you know sometimes

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.660 
hardpoint which they you know sometimes
struggle<00:01:28.320> with<00:01:28.470> they<00:01:28.740> ran<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> ours<00:01:29.520> this

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
struggle with they ran to a ours this

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.460 
struggle with they ran to a ours this
time<00:01:29.909> which<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.960> know<00:01:31.079> made<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.290> big

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
time which you know made a big

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.760 
time which you know made a big
difference<00:01:31.850> and<00:01:33.020> then<00:01:34.020> we<00:01:34.140> went<00:01:34.290> into<00:01:34.500> search

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
difference and then we went into search

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.510 
difference and then we went into search
and<00:01:34.950> destroy<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.610> got<00:01:36.329> from<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.530> got<00:01:37.680> 24<00:01:38.220> rounds

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
and destroy it got from it got 24 rounds

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.719 
and destroy it got from it got 24 rounds
to<00:01:38.640> 14<00:01:39.240> complexity<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.049> then<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.159> stream<00:01:41.460> got

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
to 14 complexity and then the stream got

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.090 
to 14 complexity and then the stream got
freakin<00:01:42.150> hit<00:01:42.329> off<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.840> then<00:01:43.439> then<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.890> seemed

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
freakin hit off and then then it seemed

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.499 
freakin hit off and then then it seemed
like<00:01:44.250> they<00:01:44.369> won<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.700> last<00:01:44.850> two<00:01:45.060> rounds<00:01:45.240> like

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
like they won the last two rounds like

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.120 
like they won the last two rounds like
instantly<00:01:45.960> because<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.320> checked<00:01:46.590> Twitter<00:01:46.829> and

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
instantly because I checked Twitter and

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.060 
instantly because I checked Twitter and
it<00:01:47.189> was<00:01:47.310> like<00:01:47.460> like<00:01:48.210> 51<00:01:49.170> complexity<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.950> then

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
it was like like 51 complexity and then

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.300 
it was like like 51 complexity and then
it<00:01:50.189> was<00:01:50.369> complexity<00:01:51.240> wins<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.899> was<00:01:52.560> like<00:01:52.710> what

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
it was complexity wins I was like what

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.340 
it was complexity wins I was like what
the<00:01:53.340> what<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.000> hell<00:01:54.270> like<00:01:54.509> they<00:01:54.720> must<00:01:54.869> have

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
the what the hell like they must have

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.899 
the what the hell like they must have
all<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:55.619> rushed<00:01:55.950> be<00:01:56.219> or<00:01:56.399> something<00:01:56.790> it's

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
all just rushed be or something it's

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.219 
all just rushed be or something it's

remember the things that he did but as

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.160 
remember the things that he did but as
far<00:02:17.220> as<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:18.090> know<00:02:18.240> I<00:02:18.630> don't<00:02:18.840> know<00:02:18.990> where<00:02:19.140> my

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170

gonna<00:02:26.040> give<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.490> crimp<00:02:26.700> 6<00:02:26.940> because<00:02:27.090> he

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
gonna give it to crimp 6 because he

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.150 
gonna give it to crimp 6 because he
really<00:02:27.720> stepped<00:02:27.960> it<00:02:28.140> up<00:02:28.200> after<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.740> second

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
game when they were down two to nothing

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.400 
game when they were down two to nothing
he<00:02:31.170> went<00:02:31.560> off<00:02:31.770> it<00:02:32.460> was<00:02:32.640> insane<00:02:33.090> he<00:02:33.870> went<00:02:34.020> off<00:02:34.170> in
