00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.580
 the hi people and again I am 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.660
 back with a new unboxing finally 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.450
 she stands before me 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.960
 the special edition on blu-ray of the 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:23.119
 tribute of panem the hunger games 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.860
 finally , I have them all fresh today 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.390
 published and also delivered today 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.239
 get from Amazon 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.380
 and of course I like it myself today 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:32.419
 reinziehen equal 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.220
 I love this movie when I'm in the 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.070
 I was really like that 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.260
 really just surprised him 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.750
 great movie and what me too 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.330
 just as happy as you see something 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:50.870
 Just glued on even only on the 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:52.250
 a sweat film cool thing yes then 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.930
 Of course you can see that right away 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.380
 Much better but now I would 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.930
 say 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:01.840
 we pack the whole first time from the 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:04.610
 foil them a little bit carefully 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:12.740
 that I do not break my head 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:21.909
 here at the moment a knife that is 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:25.569
 cuts that makes sense more perfect 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.450
 It took a while, but now 

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:30.219
 can I 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.100
 yes the whole thing is in a cardboard box 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:34.390
 delivered is of course the same time 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.630
 again something completely different if you 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.700
 then a top school committee has that 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:46.390
 the same time a bit higher quality and 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:49.959
 better and yes that could know about 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.259
 a high gloss that is a glossy 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:54.700
 cover so that's something here 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.909
 You do not recognize fingerprints at all 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.579
 if you reach out here so that is 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.049
 well there is such a chamber because someone sees 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.509
 Immediately all fingerprints are 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.829
 Here is a short course not so what I 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.000
 I do not quite understand that 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.569
 internet already seen 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.230
 you can remove the fsk bottles but 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.239
 Nevertheless, this title is from the movie 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.819
 shifted right because there actually 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.530
 may be the fsk that is now 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.810
 how strange I think 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.230
 I do not know if it's just me but 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.579
 I think it's a bit weird though 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:32.889
 yes really a nice cover anyway 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:34.440
 here at the back then very many times 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:40.840
 information about the film 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:42.370
 up here, for example, how this is here 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.760
 Of course you can read each one 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:49.500
 on stop third we have that too 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.500
 individual sequences from the film itself 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.790
 janka was just but looks really nice 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.760
 Extras were not too short 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.310
 if you look down here, the movie reads 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.319
 has a run length of 242 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.970
 minutes and alone have the extras 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:09.930
 a run length of about 223 minutes so 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:13.359
 that has what you can see a long time yes 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.549
 the sound german english 5.1 dts hd 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:17.859
 master audio 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.660
 Of course that also does something here and yes 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:22.419
 in full hd this movie is really 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.410
 just the madness cinema bavarian and 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:27.160
 just the hammer 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.859
 and why buy the dvd if so 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:34.750
 what a great, how popular we look 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:35.170
 a top shoves here slightly and 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.980
 the 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.930
 looks really strong from horny chamber 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.420
 front was chosen here because the cover 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:48.880
 front frontcover I think so again 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:50.980
 crisis, yes, the knowledge and up here 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.319
 you do not even see it urban 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.800
 just like that, a special edition 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.630
 It is a disc edition of 104 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.300
 special edition perhaps called 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.540
 Cardboard slip or more extras than normal 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.170
 So I do not know the fsk here 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:11.080
 logo imprinted as always below 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:15.250
 is mostly like that and yes great 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:18.479
 cold super she also side 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.250
 the tribute of panem the hunger games 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:27.700
 yes, and here we have the same thing 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:29.830
 again as on paper so no 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:36.250
 cheap box is a bit 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:40.300
 high quality and german desk also the same 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:43.200
 very nice here of course advertising always 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.970
 but again, no one is interested 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.419
 with blu rays to buy and 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:52.690
 decades I do not need cool thing 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:57.729
 cool thing there is a reversible cover 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:59.550
 I have super hammer perfect so then 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.830
 we know the disc here again 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:10.229
 well done as you can see here 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:12.640
 tourist wendecover without fsk great 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.289
 film is just the madness me 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.470
 Of course the opinions again and again 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:19.060
 apart but i love this movie 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.390
 he is really mad about everything 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.010

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.770

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:30.070
 not know should necessarily 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:32.590

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.020
 made cool and just who the 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.300

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:42.280
 Excuse me right now 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:45.340
 as always with me in the movie 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.400
 in and look like that 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.800
 image quality too 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.930
 and then I'll get back to you like that and 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.250
 here I am again have short 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.610
 have a look again 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:58.460
 and yes image quality is awesome 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.979
 only cool is indeed only in 2012 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.229
 appeared and now on this day on 30 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:07.580
 august only on dvd and blu-ray 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:09.949
 were released and 2012 a film 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.289
 really should be such a flower quality 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:12.830
 have the expected one produced 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:14.660
 beautiful 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.449
 the sound is of course not too 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.340
 stayed short my master audio is 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:22.400
 of course, I find madness awesome 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.080
 and of course I could do that extra 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.270
 See now is not equal because all 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.530
 over 200 minutes already the madness but 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.350
 I took a quick look 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.630
 for example that here completely really great 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:36.770
 here the tributes of panem are distancing 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:39.530
 It is really beautiful 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:43.160
 nice to look at and should you 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:45.199
 definitely also have a look yes how 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.800
 said film madness I can anyone 

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:48.139
 recommend 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:52.210
 and I hope we see each other in my 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:52.210
 next unboxing so it existed
