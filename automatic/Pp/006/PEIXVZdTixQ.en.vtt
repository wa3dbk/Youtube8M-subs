oh<00:02:32.010> it's<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.160> box<00:02:33.430> within<00:02:33.790> a<00:02:33.940> box<00:02:34.319> what<00:02:35.319> do<00:02:35.380> you

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
oh it's a box within a box what do you

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.470 
oh it's a box within a box what do you
know<00:02:35.760> actually<00:02:36.760> really<00:02:37.120> wasn't<00:02:37.390> expecting

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480

so we can play our game um powered
system<00:03:55.049> and<00:03:55.379> everything<00:03:56.180> um<00:04:01.489> ok<00:04:02.489> so<00:04:02.730> let's<00:04:03.569> see

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
system and everything um ok so let's see

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.420 
system and everything um ok so let's see
put<00:04:04.349> this<00:04:04.469> off<00:04:04.650> to<00:04:04.799> the<00:04:04.829> side<00:04:05.510> so<00:04:06.510> I<00:04:06.569> guess<00:04:07.430> we

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
put this off to the side so I guess we

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.429 
put this off to the side so I guess we
have<00:04:08.549> an<00:04:08.730> online<00:04:08.969> past<00:04:09.450> or<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.840> last<00:04:10.109> of<00:04:10.319> us

the box give me a minute alrighty and i

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.360 
the box give me a minute alrighty and i
guess<00:04:29.760> these<00:04:30.120> are<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.919> this<00:04:31.919> is<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.190> disc

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
guess these are the this is the disc

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.129 
guess these are the this is the disc
version<00:04:32.490> of<00:04:33.060> the<00:04:33.300> last<00:04:33.449> bus<00:04:33.690> so<00:04:33.810> it's<00:04:33.930> not<00:04:34.080> the

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
version of the last bus so it's not the

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.770 
version of the last bus so it's not the
usual<00:04:34.680> case<00:04:35.130> that<00:04:35.880> you<00:04:36.000> would<00:04:36.150> expect<00:04:36.270> with

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
usual case that you would expect with

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.350 
usual case that you would expect with
