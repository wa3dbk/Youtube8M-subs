00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.099
 good afternoon welcome to you i 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.990
 even though you are watching youtube channel 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.849
 flysplay in Russian 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.529
 and in this video we will look at the toy 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.560
 called fist poncho 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.960
 the game came out a couple of months ago and then i 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.660
 she somehow missed us not very 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.480
 interested in graphics by gameplay 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.670
 so I decided not to take it, but now 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.850
 she is we have and special 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.399
 monday discounts which we have sim 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.040
 he decided to announce noob on monday 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.340
 father of discounts and leave them for a whole week 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.680
 it's nice i don't mind and now for 150 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.510
 rubles took all the machine and I'll tell you 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.250
 what I don't regret is this fun toy this 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.920
 simple toy is nice to beat people 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.610
 nice to go back and forth it's just in 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.010
 cute sweet 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.170
 wolf boring gameplay the only thing 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.960
 I do not like here what is here 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.090
 experience system and regular system 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.159
 experience such a sinful system in 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.170
 which we choose special bonuses 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.130
 we can open like that 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.409
 for example, a strike like this here 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.890
 that's the most important thing to do then 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.979
 when there is someone standing next to us 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.490
 or else it's this so boring pleasant 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.729
 toy experience system is not for me 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.060
 like because she doesn't seem to have 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:33.390
 here is the place why is she in the game which 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.189
 relies on the playerâ€™s skill ie if 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.850
 we don't rely on player skill she 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.159
 rocking the hero it means 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.530
 there must be a grant that is a grind 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.340
 enemies we have to collect experience 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.530
 must collect level and if we collect something 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.810
 let's go if we collect some bosses 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.149
 impassable for us and since here 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.570
 more or less open card 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.610
 then the vectors of cases we can get on 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.700
 a level that does not pass for us here 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.369
 it is at this moment and it is not very 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.409
 good decision i understand what they wanted 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.430
 shove in such a small toy as 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.550
 can be more 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.540
 and I support it but sometimes just 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.480
 some 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.060
 design decision they do not fit 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.370
 the game itself cast the style of the game itself 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.950
 which in theory we rely only on 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.160
 pressing a button on your skill and timing 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.290
 everything else is just out of place here but 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.420
 but on the other hand the toy is now on 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.370
 50 percent discount and she 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.959
 very very cool is played at 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.150
 least on the controller I'm sorry on 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.310
 did not try to take the keyboard right away 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.910
 controller and it is clearly readable on 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.890
 the controller 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.940
 she for this and she made first 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:47.000
 out on the x-box and or in my opinion not really 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.750
 very much overtaken by the output of the computer version 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.640
 from x-box and there and either i'm in your hand or i 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.530
 you lie first came out on the computer he 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.970
 anyway i'm i'm just so sure 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:01.100
 or else they did it just by thinking about 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.579
 control the controller they control 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.070
 keyboards and so here we are now 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:09.260
 Meet with the boss boss as you can see from 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.269
 my one hit gets some 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.150
 amount of damage i get him some 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:17.480
 amount of damage but somehow wax 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.820
 we can come back to it so let's 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.280
 now I had to shoulder myself 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.180
 go all the way 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:28.180
 and it turns out that we are oh god we kill 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.930
 you alone when we understand for example 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.030
 how to beat him 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.730
 or we know some cool combo 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.800
 which unfortunately is very very small in 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.810
 this game is not, we kill the boss then 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.000
 when we have enough damage we do 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.030
 and we have enough health to 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.610
 stand it blows everything else is 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.350
 just plain grime and here it is 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.030
 the only thing I don't like in general 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.330
 cool game humor 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.680
 this is a very very perky graphic 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.239
 style 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.030
 nice this this this is not the best that i 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.260
 seen ever in life but it can 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.570
 take on discounts 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.700
 so if you do not interfere too much here 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.950
 this one is a gameplay element of what 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.780
 will have to be by grandis 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.160
 maybe go to another level 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:14.709
 choose somewhere in another level get 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.840
 level shake your hero and 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.820
 come back if that doesn't bother you 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.060
 please play take it nice 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.010
 if it bothers then this game is not for you and I 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:28.350
 Then I say a big thank you very much for 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.350
 attention and we will see you next video
