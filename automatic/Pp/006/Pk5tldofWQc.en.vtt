00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.399 

we've<00:01:26.270> done<00:01:26.420> is<00:01:26.509> we've<00:01:26.630> adjusted<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:27.140> fifth

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
we've done is we've adjusted the fifth

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:28.690 
we've done is we've adjusted the fifth
peg<00:01:27.590> so<00:01:27.829> I've<00:01:27.950> got<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:28.189> right<00:01:28.310> amount<00:01:28.490> of

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
peg so I've got the right amount of

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.539 
peg so I've got the right amount of
throw<00:01:29.000> between<00:01:29.570> my<00:01:30.380> foot<00:01:30.680> the<00:01:31.159> idea<00:01:31.399> is<00:01:31.490> you

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
throw between my foot the idea is you

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:32.770 
throw between my foot the idea is you
want<00:01:31.579> to<00:01:31.729> make<00:01:31.850> sure<00:01:31.909> this<00:01:32.149> is<00:01:32.240> right<00:01:32.479> every

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
want to make sure this is right every

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:33.969 
want to make sure this is right every
time<00:01:32.960> before<00:01:33.110> you<00:01:33.350> ride<00:01:33.530> I'll<00:01:33.679> do<00:01:33.799> the<00:01:33.860> only

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
time before you ride I'll do the only

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.169 
time before you ride I'll do the only
person<00:01:34.280> who<00:01:34.340> rides<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.610> motorcycle

obviously<00:01:35.719> once<00:01:35.929> you<00:01:36.020> set<00:01:36.200> it<00:01:36.229> up<00:01:36.380> it's<00:01:36.560> going

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
obviously once you set it up it's going

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:38.260 
obviously once you set it up it's going
to<00:01:36.740> be<00:01:36.799> right<00:01:37.039> but<00:01:37.219> checking<00:01:37.820> different<00:01:37.909> pairs

move your leg legs and feet around the
shift<00:01:49.130> lever<00:01:49.270> yeah<00:01:50.270> you<00:01:50.329> know<00:01:50.450> I<00:01:50.479> could<00:01:50.600> still

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
shift lever yeah you know I could still

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.300 
shift lever yeah you know I could still
come<00:01:50.960> looks<00:01:51.079> a<00:01:51.170> little<00:01:51.259> bit<00:01:51.469> more<00:01:51.649> because<00:01:52.009> the

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
come looks a little bit more because the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.529 
come looks a little bit more because the
angle<00:01:52.579> of<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:52.700> boot<00:01:52.909> right<00:01:53.179> here

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
angle of the boot right here

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.600 
angle of the boot right here
if<00:01:54.259> I<00:01:54.350> get<00:01:54.500> my<00:01:54.590> foot<00:01:54.799> under<00:01:54.950> there<00:01:55.189> I<00:01:55.219> can<00:01:55.459> get

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
if I get my foot under there I can get

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.820 
if I get my foot under there I can get
it<00:01:55.700> I<00:01:55.880> do<00:01:56.360> like<00:01:56.479> a<00:01:56.509> ballerina<00:01:56.810> toe<00:01:57.380> point<00:01:57.679> to

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
it I do like a ballerina toe point to

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.639 
it I do like a ballerina toe point to
get<00:01:57.979> underneath<00:01:58.220> it<00:01:59.049> so<00:02:00.049> we'll<00:02:00.170> do<00:02:00.259> now<00:02:00.439> is<00:02:00.470> I'm

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
get underneath it so we'll do now is I'm

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.410 
get underneath it so we'll do now is I'm
shortening<00:02:01.039> the<00:02:01.189> throw<00:02:01.399> of<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:01.610> shift<00:02:01.909> arm<00:02:02.179> by

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
shortening the throw of the shift arm by

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.600 
shortening the throw of the shift arm by
making<00:02:02.720> that<00:02:02.840> shorter<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:03.560> it<00:02:03.979> grabs<00:02:04.340> the

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
making that shorter and it grabs the

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.919 
making that shorter and it grabs the
levers<00:02:04.939> if<00:02:05.090> it's<00:02:05.209> going<00:02:05.299> to<00:02:05.360> pull<00:02:05.599> the<00:02:05.720> lever

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
levers if it's going to pull the lever

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.139 
levers if it's going to pull the lever
farther<00:02:06.439> up<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:06.860> towards<00:02:07.220> me<00:02:07.340> getting<00:02:07.939> more

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
farther up and towards me getting more

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.120 
farther up and towards me getting more
space<00:02:08.420> behind<00:02:08.660> a<00:02:08.989> lever<00:02:09.170> for<00:02:09.440> me<00:02:09.709> to<00:02:09.829> put<00:02:09.979> my

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
space behind a lever for me to put my

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.650 
space behind a lever for me to put my
foot<00:02:10.399> so<00:02:10.640> that<00:02:10.759> makes<00:02:11.120> it<00:02:11.239> will<00:02:11.360> make<00:02:11.450> it<00:02:11.569> more

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
foot so that makes it will make it more

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.850 
foot so that makes it will make it more
comfortable<00:02:11.900> I<00:02:12.170> don't<00:02:12.230> have<00:02:12.380> to<00:02:12.470> point<00:02:12.680> my

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
comfortable I don't have to point my

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.800 
comfortable I don't have to point my
toes<00:02:13.130> so<00:02:13.489> hard<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:13.790> get<00:02:13.880> down<00:02:14.090> behind<00:02:14.269> the<00:02:14.630> ship

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
toes so hard to get down behind the ship

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.630 
toes so hard to get down behind the ship
there<00:02:14.989> and<00:02:15.260> pull<00:02:15.500> it<00:02:15.560> back<00:02:15.739> towards<00:02:15.950> me<00:02:16.190> sort

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
there and pull it back towards me sort

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.559 
there and pull it back towards me sort
of<00:02:16.670> things<00:02:16.819> want<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.030> make<00:02:17.120> sure<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.299> set<00:02:17.480> up

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
of things want to make sure to set up

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.569 
of things want to make sure to set up
like<00:02:17.750> before<00:02:17.900> right<00:02:18.190> that's<00:02:19.190> a<00:02:19.250> good<00:02:19.370> fit

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
like before right that's a good fit

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:22.509 
like before right that's a good fit
right<00:02:19.730> there<00:02:20.260> cruising<00:02:21.260> shifting<00:02:21.920> down

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
right there cruising shifting down

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:43.450 
right there cruising shifting down
shifting<00:02:27.940> pavarotti<00:02:28.940> do<00:02:29.120> that

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.440 

there's<00:02:44.460> a<00:02:44.520> relationship<00:02:44.910> between<00:02:45.180> how<00:02:45.390> the

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
there's a relationship between how the

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.540 
there's a relationship between how the
engine<00:02:45.810> is<00:02:45.930> tuned<00:02:46.170> pipe<00:02:46.890> length<00:02:47.190> pipe

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
engine is tuned pipe length pipe

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.180 
engine is tuned pipe length pipe
diameter<00:02:48.330> exhaust<00:02:48.810> port<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:49.740> every<00:02:50.010> bike

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
diameter exhaust port and so every bike

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.400 
diameter exhaust port and so every bike
has<00:02:50.490> its<00:02:50.850> own<00:02:50.970> little<00:02:51.240> unique<00:02:51.480> tone<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:52.230> it

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
has its own little unique tone to it

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.350 
has its own little unique tone to it
this<00:02:53.100> one's<00:02:53.250> when<00:02:53.370> you<00:02:53.460> come<00:02:53.670> when<00:02:53.880> you're<00:02:53.970> in

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
this one's when you come when you're in

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.750 
this one's when you come when you're in
gear<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.020> you're<00:02:55.320> rolling<00:02:55.680> off<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:55.980> gas<00:02:56.460> it

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
gear and you're rolling off the gas it

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.940 
gear and you're rolling off the gas it
has<00:02:56.850> this<00:02:56.970> nice<00:02:57.180> little<00:02:57.440> pop<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.560> kind<00:02:58.710> of<00:02:58.770> back

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
has this nice little pop to kind of back

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:17.729 
has this nice little pop to kind of back
pressure<00:02:59.160> sound<00:02:59.520> which<00:02:59.610> I<00:02:59.700> really<00:02:59.910> like

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:59.979 

design<00:03:52.510> challenge

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.890 

like<00:04:00.500> like<00:04:00.709> this<00:04:00.860> you<00:04:01.069> to<00:04:01.190> plan<00:04:01.519> ahead<00:04:01.900> because

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
like like this you to plan ahead because

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.869 
like like this you to plan ahead because
it's<00:04:03.290> got<00:04:03.470> a<00:04:03.500> longer<00:04:03.769> linking<00:04:04.220> distance<00:04:04.640> since

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
it's got a longer linking distance since

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.330 
it's got a longer linking distance since
they<00:04:05.120> say<00:04:05.269> a<00:04:05.299> standard<00:04:05.629> type<00:04:06.110> Cruiser<00:04:06.590> there's

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
they say a standard type Cruiser there's

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.800 
they say a standard type Cruiser there's
no<00:04:07.430> matter<00:04:07.580> what<00:04:07.849> bike<00:04:08.060> riding<00:04:08.390> you<00:04:08.900> wanna<00:04:09.140> get

no matter what bike riding you wanna get

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.470 
no matter what bike riding you wanna get
good<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:11.280> only<00:04:11.520> way<00:04:11.610> to<00:04:11.670> do<00:04:11.849> that<00:04:12.000> is<00:04:12.300> to

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
good the only way to do that is to

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.570 
good the only way to do that is to
practice<00:04:12.690> find<00:04:13.680> yourself<00:04:13.950> with<00:04:14.040> a<00:04:14.099> nice<00:04:14.250> empty

touch and it's gonna pitch me over so

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.590 
touch and it's gonna pitch me over so
it's<00:04:39.160> why<00:04:39.280> I<00:04:39.310> initiate<00:04:39.790> all<00:04:39.940> my<00:04:40.120> braking<00:04:40.480> with

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
it's why I initiate all my braking with

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.360 
it's why I initiate all my braking with
the<00:04:40.750> rear<00:04:40.900> tire<00:04:41.200> and<00:04:41.650> just<00:04:41.920> want<00:04:42.130> to<00:04:42.190> feel<00:04:42.340> the

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
the rear tire and just want to feel the

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.590 
the rear tire and just want to feel the
threshold<00:04:42.910> like<00:04:43.030> it's<00:04:43.150> about<00:04:43.210> to<00:04:43.420> lock<00:04:43.540> up

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
threshold like it's about to lock up

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:56.770 
threshold like it's about to lock up
nicely<00:04:44.290> to<00:04:44.620> add<00:04:44.800> all<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.130> foot<00:04:45.340> brake

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:29.480 

it<00:04:57.780> was<00:04:57.870> so<00:05:02.180> long<00:05:27.919> corners<00:05:28.919> like<00:05:29.100> this<00:05:29.130> try<00:05:29.430> to

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
it was so long corners like this try to

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:30.950 
it was so long corners like this try to
steer<00:05:29.850> the<00:05:30.000> pipe<00:05:30.150> like<00:05:30.300> with<00:05:30.450> your<00:05:30.540> left<00:05:30.780> hand

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
steer the pipe like with your left hand

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.870 
steer the pipe like with your left hand
so<00:05:31.350> that<00:05:31.650> all<00:05:31.800> your<00:05:31.919> right<00:05:32.100> hand<00:05:32.310> has<00:05:32.430> to<00:05:32.580> do<00:05:32.729> is

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
so that all your right hand has to do is

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.610 
so that all your right hand has to do is
run<00:05:33.030> the<00:05:33.150> throttle<00:05:33.540> otherwise<00:05:34.260> what<00:05:34.440> ends<00:05:34.590> up

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
run the throttle otherwise what ends up

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.810 
run the throttle otherwise what ends up
happening<00:05:34.680> is<00:05:35.070> you're<00:05:35.160> trying<00:05:35.280> the<00:05:35.400> throttle

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
happening is you're trying the throttle

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.390 
happening is you're trying the throttle
and<00:05:36.060> steer<00:05:36.419> and<00:05:36.810> hold<00:05:37.260> on<00:05:37.470> at<00:05:37.830> the<00:05:37.950> same<00:05:38.160> time

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
and steer and hold on at the same time

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.980 
and steer and hold on at the same time
with<00:05:38.639> the<00:05:38.729> right<00:05:38.880> and<00:05:39.030> hit<00:05:39.090> hand<00:05:39.330> which<00:05:39.960> is

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
with the right and hit hand which is

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.690 
with the right and hit hand which is
natural<00:05:40.530> and<00:05:40.800> then<00:05:41.160> it<00:05:41.250> becomes<00:05:41.490> what's

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
natural and then it becomes what's

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.969 
natural and then it becomes what's
what's<00:05:42.389> choppier<00:05:42.870> up<00:05:43.050> up<00:05:43.200> so<00:05:43.350> smooth<00:05:43.650> much

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
what's choppier up up so smooth much

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.700 
what's choppier up up so smooth much
harder<00:05:44.250> to<00:05:44.340> control<00:05:44.990> on<00:05:45.990> the<00:05:46.080> right<00:05:46.260> side<00:05:46.530> here

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
harder to control on the right side here

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.020 
harder to control on the right side here
the<00:05:46.830> limitation<00:05:47.340> is<00:05:47.430> going<00:05:47.580> to<00:05:47.639> be<00:05:47.729> the<00:05:47.820> way<00:05:47.970> to

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
the limitation is going to be the way to

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.900 
the limitation is going to be the way to
that<00:05:48.300> second<00:05:48.750> pipe<00:05:48.990> the<00:05:49.440> lower<00:05:49.650> pipe<00:05:50.039> flowing

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
that second pipe the lower pipe flowing

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.969 
that second pipe the lower pipe flowing
straight<00:05:51.240> down<00:05:51.479> towards<00:05:51.870> the<00:05:51.960> ground<00:05:51.990> what's

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
straight down towards the ground what's

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:57.870 
straight down towards the ground what's
really<00:05:53.340> cool

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.430
