 shipping or anything is worth it so I 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.520
 I think it's a great opportunity to 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.770

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.359

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.649

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.479

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.420
 uploading videos so often and good 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.890

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.409
 that you are here waiting for me all that 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.030

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.110
 about how you see me playing valbuena in this 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.599
 case I think it is the yes because it already has 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.360
 an imc or in this case the valbuena comes out 

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:09.679
 as extreme right end and good 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.940
 Well here you see a bit about the envelope what 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.860
 I'm going through a bit because I'm going to 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.150
 take me the surprise just when the 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.860
 they're opening was on a call from 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.329
 hype so I could not record the voice but 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.069
 good about it was passing very little 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.540
 little bit so do not stop to see me 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.340
 touched or had his eyes closed when 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.019
 of the envelope and well I get a 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.750
 surprise how are you going to see now there 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.400

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.950

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.150

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.000

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.770

 I also like it enough, it's worth it, nothing like that 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.330

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.160
 coins that you have opened what has 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.450
 touched and remember about the two draws 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.310
 what you have in the description is worth it 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.990
 that I do not expect anything to come up soon 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.280
 a new video and let's keep talking 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.690
