00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.359
 Welcome to the form with the hands on the 

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:08.490
 ford fiesta 2012 model you in rom us 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.660
 have the coliseum and i am happy 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.580
 short and it's about how you see it 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.190
 can now have a very nice look 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.589
 Everything was completely redesigned this 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.609
 year to ring so to speak of the product and 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:19.589
 we have now too 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.789
 Of course, Ford sync is involved in that 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:21.749
 thereby in the last years here 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.169
 was developed 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:26.159
 that is a tdi here of course still the 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.890
 flap for refueling 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:30.439
 So no electrowagon not yet 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.120
 maybe it will be the next 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.710
 versions then be an electrowagen the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.600
 we have the culture here and there is 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.780
 a bit of traffic on the street 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.070
 but I get the same times but a 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.900
 before we look back here 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.420
 for four in the trunk have because 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.130
 Of course, the hands on is about here 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.020
 The most important thing we can do, of course 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.970
 also extra fold down and is 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.940
 also a lot of space once again below 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.520
 drunter for additional tires for 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.010
 Example, of course, or what else is there 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.600
 I would like to stow away now 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.460
 but not the rich depending 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.299
 then of course you can see here 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.350
 cologne mark we just there 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.920
 now that I did not run over here 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.320
 become 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.580
 if I want to get in here but there 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.570
 you have to wait briefly for the coming 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.570
 a big bus we look in the 3 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:34.580
 Here you can see very nice here 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:35.810
 as processed for moderate and so seats 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.060
 we are in the car in it 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.110
 and here we can see everything or everything 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.680
 try to see 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.210
 very nice interior design story 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.100
 Here we have again here 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.140
 many buttons here and we still have one 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.480
 USB connection power connection and rainer 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.580
 then millimeter headphone jack 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.960
 of course, we still have the driver side 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.880
 according to the many buttons you can 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.880
 needs to use the car 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.600
 loudspeakers here too left and right 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.979
 nice ford logo here we have 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.380
 of course extra the service that is 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.119
 the normal version is ford sync 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.520
 Although in there but we only have here 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.720
 So the gps is external to ours 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.170
 model here now what we test drive 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.520
 allowed 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.350
 Here we have the kilometers 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.150
 display maximum so how many kilometers 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.190
 the car has driven so far and 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.620
 Otherwise, here is the standard view you 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.570
 of course, instantly recognize doing here 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.490
 with the power button of course and 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.040
 otherwise we can do everything accordingly 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.820
 adjust as you already know from 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.989
 Of course, other cars are normal now 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.700
 Just let it all go 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.930
 read which direction exactly what 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.450
 and then we have another in the back 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.720
 of course, some buttons for the light and 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.040
 it is similar to us up here 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.040
 we have that again 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:53.810
 some interesting stories 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:58.040
 the light then built the possibility 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:02.120
 but very stable on the course 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.560
 the other side the approval as I said 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.060
 that a four-door than now have here 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.480
 also doors but otherwise everything 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.880
 very nicely processed 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.320
 very nicely built here by ford at the 94th 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.030
 is up there we also have one here 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.940
 extra light we can, however 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.970
 hold on top somewhere and above all 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.070
 that's down here by the doors too 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.750
 not too stable but you see everything 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.370
 electronically as in the meantime in the 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.870
 car in it which I still very interesting 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.930
 I think I have not found a trash once 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.459
 in the car but of course here below 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.510
 The armrest can also be here 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.510
 a few things stowed away 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.180
 is also quite comfortable to put it on then 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.349
 you can also wonderful here 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.000
 Stick when you reach the clip 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.470
 however, moving forward then can 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.989
 you do not hang up your hand anymore 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.700
 it's a pretty in there you can get 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.590
 of course everything in addition to it 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.420
 pick and also a pretty big one 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.280
 drawer for this extra 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.260
 stories are herders and the airbag 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.050
 for passenger could be here and 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.370
 what then, of course, then 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.720
 according to here he lights up or 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.950
 that is of course important though 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.780
 Your little kid is stuck in front here 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.069
 We already know that 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.140
 technically and then the child 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.730
 is crushed and otherwise yes that was 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.100
 here the ford fiesta for hannes 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.819
 watched while watching tv in the first hands-on 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.819
 Until next time
