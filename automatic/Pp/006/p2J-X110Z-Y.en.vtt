00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:07.910
 hi how are the name is good 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.850
 the story starts from 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:14.550
 18 years old 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:17.100
 and they started to leave one another 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.950
 At first I took it as many 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.220
 people always have an autoscale 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:27.619
 but half spent time in some two 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:32.490
 three four or five were really looking forward 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:35.720
 one more than an ace removing but after 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:38.720
 I saw that they threaten going more and more more 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.720
 so 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.720
 carmelo 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.210
 in three years from 23 years to about 70 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.980
 number more or less every three months 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.370
 because I just got better out here in the 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.760
 back did not have much serve 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.519
 forward then 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.449
 We are painting every month or every 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:06.420
 week but half the time has already passed 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.930
 It was not our months is not left every month 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.430
 every three weeks I did not have to be 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:18.520
 painting for me 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:23.160
 a texture they looked at the root have to 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.750
 paint - again it was horrible then 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:30.180
 when they leave arm of the problem and 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:34.860
 first daughter I stopped painting 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:38.010
 and that is to say I do not know how many years but 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.820
 I liked what it was called but I followed 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.780
 painting until two years ago I said no 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.310
 no longer 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.399
 and I stopped painting melo 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.030
 I have simply let it grow many 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.640
 people what they do is that 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.890
 many are made 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:03.270
 White months are many grays for 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:07.480
 to qualify the color but not 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:10.660
 I just wanted 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:14.740
 grow more or less I have the cut by 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:19.000
 here what I'm doing still makes me 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:22.390
 this ticket is missing at least 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.250
 still has dye remains still 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.250
 but I want to leave less to grow 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.280
 is 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.260
 well I did not say we're in a society 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.520
 that still not no 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:43.950
 does not accept all gray hair 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:46.710
 but we have to do that 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.550
 change the mentality that one associates 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:53.970
 neglect 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:57.810
 sometimes it's just something natural if 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:02.200
 someone has a mole 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:07.900
 a feature that you do not see 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:11.560
 how is that myth lately 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.800
 many many people what 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.020
 and see your letters 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:22.780
 many young people of what 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:24.790
 the gray wicks are also made many 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.290
 people think I've painted 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.510
 A) Yes 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:34.810
 and I 'm two hours 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:37.440
 many people do not believe me that they are beds is 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.940
 do also events 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.000
 also my good hair 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.739
 and 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.730
 what I use 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:51.810
 regularly my way to the wedding of 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.989
 forever 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:58.270
 so they do not mistreat you sct a lot 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:01.560
 good hair recommended me 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.560
 usually one removes the hair 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.530
 the day that I have to wash it I use it to 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:13.220
 to struggle 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:19.310
 and conditioner that soft 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:22.810
 morgan this to the hair and this time is 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:27.620
 well pretty and it's very economical this 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:31.540
 it costs 48 and some very well only 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.540
 for Mexicans 4 dollars 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:39.350
 7 days I do not wash it 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.350
 the next day 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:47.390
 always depends on expression with the 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.390
 conditioner 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:55.430
 I liked this one, it's pretty good 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.540
 soft 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:02.790

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:05.470

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:08.180
 for gray hair and for 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:11.590
 for hair with 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:16.160
 that has been submitted to point 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:20.270

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.880
 I liked looking for a left why not 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.340
 feel like one also prescribed this one what 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:30.830
 lets leave it softer and apart is 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:33.550
 more for all the same costs 34 the load 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.550
 each 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.410
 Y 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:44.080
 the scale 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:48.480
 tend to do as dry we have to 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:52.070
 Be careful of having them treated 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.070
 very hydrated because 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.790

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:06.960
 this moisturizing mask also with 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.960
 rock oil 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:15.289

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:32.560
