reliable<00:01:27.280> quite<00:01:27.729> easy<00:01:27.880> to<00:01:28.060> tie<00:01:28.780> not<00:01:29.439> much<00:01:29.590> can

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
reliable quite easy to tie not much can

reliable quite easy to tie not much can
go<00:01:29.950> wrong<00:01:29.979> with<00:01:30.399> it<00:01:30.549> so<00:01:31.299> I'm<00:01:31.869> using<00:01:32.079> the<00:01:32.439> garden

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.569 
of sink skin in the camo ground I like
to<00:01:37.450> solve<00:01:37.869> leave<00:01:38.469> myself<00:01:38.679> quite<00:01:39.189> a<00:01:39.219> lot<00:01:39.490> of

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
to solve leave myself quite a lot of

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:45.990 
to solve leave myself quite a lot of
room<00:01:39.849> to<00:01:39.880> play<00:01:40.060> with<00:01:40.240> so<00:01:41.140> I<00:01:41.250> cut<00:01:42.250> that<00:01:42.399> off<00:01:45.000> ok

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.980 
foodie I that way it's like that leave a
little<00:03:31.320> bit<00:03:31.500> there<00:03:31.850> so<00:03:32.850> it's<00:03:33.330> just<00:03:33.510> how<00:03:33.690> I<00:03:33.720> like

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
little bit there so it's just how I like

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
bit of a hinge and then normally all I

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:46.310 
bit of a hinge and then normally all I
do<00:03:40.170> is<00:03:40.920> just<00:03:41.280> tie<00:03:44.300> overhand<00:03:45.300> loop<00:03:45.840> with<00:03:46.110> the

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
do is just tie overhand loop with the

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:55.780 
do is just tie overhand loop with the
coated<00:03:46.740> braid<00:03:49.040> in<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.100> end

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:07.210 

bit<00:03:56.790> fiddly<00:03:59.930> stock<00:04:00.930> in<00:04:01.200> this

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:19.990 

got<00:04:07.670> cold<00:04:07.970> hands<00:04:08.270> so<00:04:08.540> it's<00:04:08.690> quite<00:04:08.870> fiddly<00:04:19.000> so

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
got cold hands so it's quite fiddly so

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.210 
got cold hands so it's quite fiddly so
as<00:04:20.150> you<00:04:20.270> can<00:04:20.450> see<00:04:20.660> it's<00:04:20.840> all<00:04:20.930> cold<00:04:21.620> up<00:04:21.860> in<00:04:22.040> that

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
as you can see it's all cold up in that

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.460 
as you can see it's all cold up in that
so<00:04:22.640> all<00:04:23.090> you<00:04:23.210> do<00:04:23.420> is<00:04:23.690> when<00:04:23.990> you're<00:04:24.140> making<00:04:24.320> your

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
so all you do is when you're making your

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.030 
so all you do is when you're making your
tea<00:04:24.770> or<00:04:25.040> whatever<00:04:25.910> you<00:04:26.330> just<00:04:26.360> steam<00:04:26.930> it<00:04:27.140> and<00:04:27.860> it

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
tea or whatever you just steam it and it

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.960 
tea or whatever you just steam it and it
goes<00:04:28.130> all<00:04:28.340> straight<00:04:28.640> or<00:04:29.110> alternatively<00:04:30.970> just

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
goes all straight or alternatively just

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.280 
goes all straight or alternatively just
hold<00:04:32.210> it<00:04:32.360> like<00:04:32.510> that<00:04:32.540> and<00:04:34.420> rub<00:04:35.420> it<00:04:35.630> until<00:04:35.900> your

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
hold it like that and rub it until your

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.740 
hold it like that and rub it until your
fingers<00:04:36.410> go<00:04:36.770> warm<00:04:37.040> and<00:04:37.310> it'll<00:04:37.520> go<00:04:37.640> straight

then<00:07:35.740> I<00:07:35.830> think<00:07:36.010> no<00:07:36.130> just<00:07:36.310> move<00:07:36.430> down<00:07:36.640> here<00:07:36.700> to

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:36.850 
then I think no just move down here to

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:38.190 
then I think no just move down here to
try<00:07:37.060> and<00:07:37.150> get<00:07:37.240> into<00:07:37.360> the<00:07:37.420> pot<00:07:37.630> a<00:07:37.660> warm<00:07:37.930> up<00:07:38.080> in

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:38.200 
try and get into the pot a warm up in

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.770 
try and get into the pot a warm up in
the<00:07:38.260> warmer<00:07:38.920> war<00:07:39.070> it's<00:07:40.060> a<00:07:40.150> lot<00:07:40.270> shallower<00:07:40.450> down

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:40.780 
the warmer war it's a lot shallower down

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.860 
the warmer war it's a lot shallower down
there<00:07:41.020> as<00:07:41.110> well

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:42.870 
there as well

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:46.080 
there as well
today<00:07:43.890> almost<00:07:44.890> twice<00:07:45.220> because<00:07:45.460> it's<00:07:45.670> been<00:07:45.820> an

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:46.090 
today almost twice because it's been an

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.840 
today almost twice because it's been an
on<00:07:46.510> and<00:07:46.840> off<00:07:46.930> all<00:07:47.200> day<00:07:47.410> so<00:07:47.470> it's<00:07:48.100> a<00:07:48.490> bit<00:07:48.610> cold

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:48.850 
on and off all day so it's a bit cold

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.760 
on and off all day so it's a bit cold
and<00:07:49.270> obviously<00:07:50.020> the<00:07:50.170> fish<00:07:50.350> ain't<00:07:50.530> been

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:50.770 
and obviously the fish ain't been

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.730 
and obviously the fish ain't been
feeding<00:07:51.390> so<00:07:52.390> hopefully<00:07:52.990> we'll<00:07:53.200> can<00:07:53.410> get<00:07:53.620> out

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:53.740 
feeding so hopefully we'll can get out

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:58.680 
feeding so hopefully we'll can get out
in<00:07:54.040> a<00:07:54.460> couple<00:07:55.150> of<00:07:55.330> weeks<00:07:55.480> for<00:07:55.810> another<00:07:55.870> episode
