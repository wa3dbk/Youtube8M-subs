that's an a-flat that's an a sharp not
that<00:01:07.820> kind<00:01:08.090> of<00:01:08.210> knowledge<00:01:08.659> so<00:01:08.810> that<00:01:08.840> the

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
that kind of knowledge so that the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.219 
that kind of knowledge so that the
recall<00:01:09.560> is<00:01:09.710> completely<00:01:10.280> instant<00:01:10.789> so<00:01:11.479> in<00:01:11.810> this

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
recall is completely instant so in this

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.840 
recall is completely instant so in this
lesson<00:01:12.619> I'm<00:01:12.799> just<00:01:12.979> going<00:01:13.100> to<00:01:13.130> show<00:01:13.280> you<00:01:13.310> one

be a really beneficial way of cementing
that<00:01:19.520> kind<00:01:19.819> of<00:01:19.939> knowledge<00:01:20.859> so<00:01:21.859> this<00:01:22.130> exercise

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
that kind of knowledge so this exercise

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.249 
that kind of knowledge so this exercise

then this exercise is going to be a way

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.480 
then this exercise is going to be a way
of<00:01:43.880> just<00:01:44.060> speeding<00:01:44.420> up<00:01:44.689> that<00:01:44.959> recall<00:01:45.709> until

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
of just speeding up that recall until

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.519 
of just speeding up that recall until
you're<00:01:46.670> instantly<00:01:47.119> able<00:01:47.689> to<00:01:47.929> find<00:01:48.259> and

00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:48.529 
you're instantly able to find and

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:51.190 
you're instantly able to find and
identify<00:01:48.709> any<00:01:49.520> note<00:01:50.029> it's<00:01:50.779> a<00:01:50.840> really<00:01:51.049> simple

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
identify any note it's a really simple

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.480 
identify any note it's a really simple
exercise<00:01:51.679> you're<00:01:52.009> just<00:01:52.130> going<00:01:52.249> to<00:01:52.279> need<00:01:52.459> a

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
exercise you're just going to need a

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.039 
exercise you're just going to need a
guitar<00:01:52.909> and<00:01:53.149> you're<00:01:53.420> also<00:01:53.539> going<00:01:53.719> to<00:01:53.779> need<00:01:53.899> a

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
guitar and you're also going to need a

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.580 
guitar and you're also going to need a
metronome<00:01:54.649> and<00:01:55.459> the<00:01:56.170> idea<00:01:57.170> is<00:01:57.319> a<00:01:57.350> really

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
metronome and the idea is a really

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.779 
metronome and the idea is a really
simple<00:01:57.740> one<00:01:57.920> we're<00:01:58.069> just<00:01:58.189> going<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:58.340> choose<00:01:58.579> a

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
simple one we're just going to choose a

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.809 
simple one we're just going to choose a
note<00:01:59.350> we're<00:02:00.350> going<00:02:00.649> to<00:02:00.740> find<00:02:01.009> every<00:02:01.429> single

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
note we're going to find every single

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:04.179 
note we're going to find every single
possible<00:02:02.329> location<00:02:02.899> of<00:02:03.109> that<00:02:03.170> note<00:02:03.740> on<00:02:03.950> the

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
possible location of that note on the

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:05.980 
possible location of that note on the
fretboard<00:02:04.670> and<00:02:04.819> then<00:02:05.509> we're<00:02:05.599> going<00:02:05.719> to<00:02:05.749> play

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
fretboard and then we're going to play

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.290 
fretboard and then we're going to play
it<00:02:06.139> in<00:02:06.259> time<00:02:06.859> with<00:02:07.310> a<00:02:07.520> metronome

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
it in time with a metronome

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.210 
it in time with a metronome
now<00:02:08.630> the<00:02:08.690> metronome<00:02:09.289> stuff<00:02:09.590> is<00:02:09.770> important

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
now the metronome stuff is important

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.860 
now the metronome stuff is important
because<00:02:10.369> that's<00:02:11.030> going<00:02:11.209> to<00:02:11.300> force<00:02:11.540> us<00:02:11.720> to

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
because that's going to force us to

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.890 
because that's going to force us to
think<00:02:11.990> quickly<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:13.580> then<00:02:13.760> as<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.660> exercise

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
think quickly and then as the exercise

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.620 
think quickly and then as the exercise
evolves<00:02:15.770> we<00:02:15.890> can<00:02:16.010> speed<00:02:16.280> up<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.820> metronome<00:02:17.510> we

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
evolves we can speed up the metronome we

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
evolves we can speed up the metronome we
can<00:02:17.780> cut<00:02:17.960> down<00:02:18.170> off<00:02:18.410> the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
can cut down off the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.789 
can cut down off the
King<00:02:18.829> time<00:02:19.099> until<00:02:20.090> eventually<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:21.140> get<00:02:21.650> to

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
King time until eventually you get to

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.229 
King time until eventually you get to
the<00:02:21.890> stage<00:02:22.129> where<00:02:22.159> that<00:02:22.610> recall<00:02:23.090> is

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
the stage where that recall is

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.050 
the stage where that recall is
completely<00:02:23.840> instant<00:02:24.790> so<00:02:25.790> we're<00:02:25.909> going<00:02:26.000> to

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
completely instant so we're going to

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.149 
completely instant so we're going to
pick<00:02:26.239> a<00:02:26.299> note<00:02:26.569> let's<00:02:26.750> start<00:02:26.989> with<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.379> note<00:02:27.590> C

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.159 
pick a note let's start with the note C

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:30.670 
pick a note let's start with the note C
and<00:02:28.430> we're<00:02:29.000> going<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.150> find<00:02:29.390> every<00:02:29.659> possible<00:02:30.200> C

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
and we're going to find every possible C

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.770 
and we're going to find every possible C
note<00:02:31.069> on<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.610> neck<00:02:31.970> of<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.269> guitar<00:02:32.390> if<00:02:32.659> we

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
note on the neck of the guitar if we

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.589 
note on the neck of the guitar if we
start<00:02:33.049> on<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.409> low<00:02:33.620> E<00:02:33.860> string<00:02:34.150> you've<00:02:35.150> got<00:02:35.299> a<00:02:35.329> C

going to play one note every four clicks

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.199 
going to play one note every four clicks
of<00:03:41.989> the<00:03:42.379> metronome<00:03:42.949> so<00:03:43.010> to<00:03:43.609> start<00:03:43.879> with<00:03:44.030> you've

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
of the metronome so to start with you've

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.909 
of the metronome so to start with you've
got<00:03:44.239> a<00:03:44.389> little<00:03:44.690> bit<00:03:44.930> of<00:03:45.079> thinking<00:03:45.470> time<00:03:45.650> a

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:45.919 
got a little bit of thinking time a

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:48.490 
got a little bit of thinking time a
little<00:03:46.340> bit<00:03:46.489> of<00:03:47.389> time<00:03:47.659> to<00:03:47.810> think<00:03:47.989> ahead<00:03:48.290> and

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
little bit of time to think ahead and

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.180 
little bit of time to think ahead and
work<00:03:49.069> out<00:03:49.340> where<00:03:49.639> the<00:03:49.669> next<00:03:50.120> C<00:03:50.629> note<00:03:51.049> is<00:03:51.290> let<00:03:52.159> me

work out where the next C note is let me
just<00:03:52.280> go<00:03:52.609> through<00:03:52.639> that<00:03:52.940> I'm<00:03:53.180> going<00:03:53.329> to<00:03:53.419> start

C<00:04:12.219> on<00:04:12.430> this<00:04:12.640> string<00:04:12.939> so<00:04:12.969> I<00:04:13.150> go<00:04:13.329> straight<00:04:13.569> to<00:04:13.810> the

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
C on this string so I go straight to the

C on this string so I go straight to the
to<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:14.620> third<00:04:14.859> string<00:04:15.250> then<00:04:16.829> octave<00:04:17.829> fire

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.330 

and<00:04:24.840> onto<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.440> top<00:04:25.620> string<00:04:25.950> and<00:04:27.680> then<00:04:28.680> when

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
and onto the top string and then when

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.390 
and onto the top string and then when
you<00:04:29.400> get<00:04:29.550> to<00:04:29.670> the<00:04:29.790> highest<00:04:30.210> C<00:04:30.660> you<00:04:30.870> can<00:04:31.050> just

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
you get to the highest C you can just

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.870 
you get to the highest C you can just
come<00:04:32.400> back<00:04:32.550> down<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:33.600> same<00:04:33.870> way<00:04:33.900> so<00:04:34.610> back<00:04:35.610> down

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
come back down the same way so back down

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:45.510 
come back down the same way so back down
to<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.300> second<00:04:37.290> string

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:58.510 

just<00:04:46.270> that<00:04:46.449> one<00:04:46.690> see<00:04:46.990> on<00:04:47.229> the<00:04:47.349> fourth<00:04:47.590> string

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.680 

and<00:04:59.520> then<00:04:59.730> we're<00:04:59.880> back<00:05:00.180> down<00:05:00.360> to<00:05:00.540> where<00:05:00.660> we

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
and then we're back down to where we

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.720 
and then we're back down to where we
started<00:05:01.440> from<00:05:01.500> so<00:05:02.040> once<00:05:02.280> you<00:05:02.370> can<00:05:02.490> do<00:05:02.580> that

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
started from so once you can do that

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.000 
started from so once you can do that
without<00:05:03.000> any<00:05:03.510> mistakes<00:05:04.050> then<00:05:04.350> you<00:05:04.650> can<00:05:04.800> start

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
without any mistakes then you can start

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.860 
without any mistakes then you can start
to<00:05:05.130> make<00:05:05.250> things<00:05:05.460> a<00:05:05.640> bit<00:05:05.790> more<00:05:05.820> difficult<00:05:06.540> for

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
to make things a bit more difficult for

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.050 
to make things a bit more difficult for
yourself<00:05:07.020> and<00:05:07.500> you<00:05:08.040> can<00:05:08.160> cut<00:05:08.490> down<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:08.970> amount

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
yourself and you can cut down the amount

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.550 
yourself and you can cut down the amount
of<00:05:09.300> time<00:05:09.510> you've<00:05:09.690> got<00:05:09.720> to<00:05:09.810> think<00:05:10.080> about<00:05:10.230> the

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
of time you've got to think about the

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.520 
of time you've got to think about the
note<00:05:10.740> that's<00:05:10.860> coming<00:05:11.280> up<00:05:11.400> next<00:05:11.730> so<00:05:12.180> you<00:05:12.960> can

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
note that's coming up next so you can

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.230 
note that's coming up next so you can
either<00:05:13.590> speed<00:05:13.950> up<00:05:13.980> the<00:05:14.460> metronome<00:05:14.910> or<00:05:15.090> you

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
either speed up the metronome or you

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.230 
either speed up the metronome or you
could<00:05:15.420> go<00:05:16.020> down<00:05:16.410> to<00:05:16.710> fewer<00:05:17.130> clicks<00:05:17.550> on<00:05:17.820> each

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
could go down to fewer clicks on each

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.780 
could go down to fewer clicks on each
notes<00:05:18.720> so<00:05:18.990> you<00:05:19.020> could<00:05:19.290> play<00:05:19.470> one<00:05:20.040> note<00:05:20.340> every

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
notes so you could play one note every

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.110 
notes so you could play one note every
three<00:05:21.090> clicks<00:05:21.390> I<00:05:21.600> know<00:05:22.050> every<00:05:22.440> two<00:05:22.650> clicks

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
three clicks I know every two clicks

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.820 
three clicks I know every two clicks
playing<00:05:24.120> a<00:05:24.300> note<00:05:24.450> on<00:05:24.690> every<00:05:24.960> click<00:05:25.440> of<00:05:25.620> the

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
playing a note on every click of the

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:26.990 
playing a note on every click of the
metronome<00:05:26.160> let<00:05:26.310> me<00:05:26.400> just<00:05:26.550> try<00:05:26.880> and

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
metronome let me just try and

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.440 
metronome let me just try and
demonstrate<00:05:27.150> that<00:05:27.600> for<00:05:27.930> you<00:05:28.230> now<00:05:29.360> so<00:05:30.360> I'm

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
demonstrate that for you now so I'm

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.150 
demonstrate that for you now so I'm
going<00:05:30.600> to<00:05:30.660> play<00:05:30.810> my<00:05:30.960> C<00:05:31.230> note<00:05:31.470> still<00:05:31.830> but<00:05:32.010> on

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
going to play my C note still but on

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.460 
going to play my C note still but on
every<00:05:32.400> click<00:05:32.640> of<00:05:32.820> the<00:05:33.030> metronome<00:05:33.420> two<00:05:33.720> three

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
every click of the metronome two three

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:52.760 
every click of the metronome two three
four<00:05:50.690> there<00:05:51.690> you<00:05:51.810> guys<00:05:51.930> not<00:05:52.260> as<00:05:52.380> easy<00:05:52.620> as<00:05:52.680> you

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
four there you guys not as easy as you

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:53.930 
four there you guys not as easy as you
think<00:05:52.890> it's<00:05:53.070> going<00:05:53.190> to<00:05:53.250> be<00:05:53.370> actually<00:05:53.760> when

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
think it's going to be actually when

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.390 
think it's going to be actually when
you're<00:05:54.060> doing<00:05:54.600> it<00:05:54.720> that<00:05:55.290> kind<00:05:55.590> of<00:05:55.680> speed<00:05:56.220> on

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
you're doing it that kind of speed on

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.900 
you're doing it that kind of speed on
every<00:05:56.730> single<00:05:57.090> click<00:05:57.920> so<00:05:58.920> that's<00:05:59.100> the<00:05:59.310> basic

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
every single click so that's the basic

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.550 
every single click so that's the basic
exercise<00:06:00.480> obviously<00:06:00.660> once<00:06:01.110> you<00:06:01.230> can<00:06:01.380> do<00:06:01.470> it

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
exercise obviously once you can do it

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.380 
exercise obviously once you can do it
with<00:06:01.710> a<00:06:01.740> C<00:06:02.040> note<00:06:02.070> you've<00:06:02.640> got<00:06:02.820> eleven<00:06:03.360> more

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.390 
with a C note you've got eleven more

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.980 
with a C note you've got eleven more
notes<00:06:03.990> to<00:06:04.500> go<00:06:04.680> so<00:06:05.330> you<00:06:06.330> can<00:06:06.450> either<00:06:06.540> just<00:06:06.810> pick

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
notes to go so you can either just pick

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.690 
notes to go so you can either just pick
a<00:06:07.140> note<00:06:07.350> random<00:06:07.980> and<00:06:08.190> go<00:06:08.310> through<00:06:08.580> it<00:06:08.610> with

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
a note random and go through it with

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.670

in a single practice session that's

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.280 
in a single practice session that's
really<00:06:32.730> so<00:06:33.060> dependent<00:06:33.600> on<00:06:33.720> your<00:06:33.870> current

level of knowledge so um it's not the

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.860 
level of knowledge so um it's not the
most<00:06:37.920> sexy<00:06:38.580> thing<00:06:38.820> to<00:06:39.000> be<00:06:39.120> practicing
