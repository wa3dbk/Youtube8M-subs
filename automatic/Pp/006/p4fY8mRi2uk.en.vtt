00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
all the way out to the outside so that

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.420 
all the way out to the outside so that
that<00:01:38.330> collects<00:01:38.720> dirt<00:01:39.590> in<00:01:39.830> there<00:01:39.979> too<00:01:40.190> and<00:01:40.340> it

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
that collects dirt in there too and it

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.250 
that collects dirt in there too and it
looks<00:01:40.610> bad<00:01:40.909> I<00:01:41.440> mean<00:01:42.440> these<00:01:42.590> are<00:01:42.770> just<00:01:42.890> minor

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
looks bad I mean these are just minor

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.440 
looks bad I mean these are just minor
minor<00:01:45.260> things<00:01:45.619> but<00:01:45.920> people<00:01:46.310> don't<00:01:47.000> talk<00:01:47.270> about

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
minor things but people don't talk about

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.000 
minor things but people don't talk about
this<00:01:47.720> stuff<00:01:47.900> so<00:01:48.229> I<00:01:48.260> figured<00:01:48.650> that<00:01:48.740> might<00:01:48.920> as

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
this stuff so I figured that might as

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.780 
this stuff so I figured that might as
well<00:01:49.630> so<00:01:50.630> those<00:01:50.780> collector<00:01:51.380> yeah<00:01:52.310> the

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
well so those collector yeah the

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.120 
well so those collector yeah the
joysticks<00:01:53.330> yeah<00:01:54.320> I<00:01:54.350> don't<00:01:54.650> I<00:01:54.770> don't<00:01:54.799> believe

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
joysticks yeah I don't I don't believe

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.570 
joysticks yeah I don't I don't believe
they<00:01:55.340> move<00:01:55.549> far<00:01:55.880> enough<00:01:56.119> that<00:01:56.180> it<00:01:56.689> just<00:01:57.580> that's

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
they move far enough that it just that's

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.910 
they move far enough that it just that's
it<00:01:58.820> right<00:01:59.659> there

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.969 

and<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:03.110> feel<00:02:04.110> they<00:02:04.229> don't<00:02:04.350> they<00:02:04.619> should<00:02:04.830> move

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
and I feel they don't they should move

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.460 
and I feel they don't they should move
farther<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.580> also<00:02:06.450> they<00:02:06.570> don't<00:02:06.600> click<00:02:07.020> in<00:02:07.229> and

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
farther and also they don't click in and

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.449 
farther and also they don't click in and

you hit that you hit that joystick so

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.020 
you hit that you hit that joystick so
like<00:02:52.640> you<00:02:53.390> have<00:02:53.659> to<00:02:53.930> like<00:02:54.319> go<00:02:55.189> off<00:02:55.219> to<00:02:55.609> the<00:02:55.730> side

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
like you have to like go off to the side

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.690 
like you have to like go off to the side
or<00:02:57.939> use<00:02:58.939> your<00:02:59.090> thumb<00:02:59.329> like<00:02:59.359> that<00:03:00.129> so<00:03:01.129> I<00:03:01.159> don't

or use your thumb like that so I don't

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.420 
or use your thumb like that so I don't
like<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:01.969> placement<00:03:02.239> of<00:03:02.829> the<00:03:03.829> buttons<00:03:04.189> and

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
like the placement of the buttons and

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.490 
like the placement of the buttons and
the<00:03:04.459> joysticks<00:03:05.109> actually<00:03:06.109> I<00:03:06.170> think<00:03:06.200> the

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
the joysticks actually I think the

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.839 
the joysticks actually I think the
joysticks<00:03:06.980> would<00:03:07.129> have<00:03:07.220> been<00:03:07.340> better<00:03:07.489> up<00:03:07.670> here

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
joysticks would have been better up here

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.309 
joysticks would have been better up here
in<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.090> buttons<00:03:08.390> down<00:03:08.540> here<00:03:08.599> I<00:03:08.930> know<00:03:09.049> that's

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
in the buttons down here I know that's

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.550 
in the buttons down here I know that's
backwards<00:03:09.829> from<00:03:11.170> what<00:03:12.170> a<00:03:12.200> lot<00:03:12.379> of<00:03:12.409> people

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
backwards from what a lot of people

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.410 
backwards from what a lot of people
would<00:03:12.980> say<00:03:13.280> but<00:03:15.549> but<00:03:16.549> as<00:03:16.670> far<00:03:16.819> as<00:03:16.879> that<00:03:17.060> the

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
hard your skin will press them in but so

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.429 
hard your skin will press them in but so
they're<00:03:50.269> kind<00:03:50.389> of<00:03:50.510> hard<00:03:50.599> to<00:03:50.689> press<00:03:50.900> in<00:03:51.139> like<00:03:51.319> if

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:51.439 
they're kind of hard to press in like if

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:52.740 
they're kind of hard to press in like if
you<00:03:51.530> have<00:03:51.620> to<00:03:51.709> pause<00:03:51.889> the<00:03:52.069> game<00:03:52.099> real<00:03:52.430> quick

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
you have to pause the game real quick

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.649 
you have to pause the game real quick
which<00:03:53.829> what<00:03:54.829> where<00:03:55.639> they're<00:03:55.790> located<00:03:55.940> is<00:03:56.599> a

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:56.659 
which what where they're located is a

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:58.960 
which what where they're located is a
good<00:03:57.049> thing<00:03:57.319> but<00:03:58.280> I<00:03:58.340> think<00:03:58.579> they<00:03:58.669> could<00:03:58.879> have

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
good thing but I think they could have

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.300 
good thing but I think they could have
relocated<00:03:59.299> them<00:03:59.750> and<00:03:59.930> made<00:04:00.079> them<00:04:00.109> bigger<00:04:00.409> and

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
relocated them and made them bigger and

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.580 
relocated them and made them bigger and
the<00:04:01.699> playstation<00:04:02.269> home<00:04:02.299> button<00:04:02.780> is<00:04:03.139> the<00:04:03.379> same

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
the playstation home button is the same

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.159 
the playstation home button is the same
way<00:04:03.799> it's<00:04:04.069> just<00:04:04.159> flush<00:04:04.669> with<00:04:04.909> the<00:04:04.940> screen<00:04:05.389> but

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:06.169 
way it's just flush with the screen but

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:08.170 
way it's just flush with the screen but
it's<00:04:06.530> a<00:04:06.620> little<00:04:06.829> easier<00:04:06.949> to<00:04:07.159> press<00:04:07.430> I<00:04:07.760> don't

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
it's a little easier to press I don't

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.849 
it's a little easier to press I don't
have<00:04:08.239> a<00:04:08.329> problem<00:04:08.449> with<00:04:08.659> that<00:04:08.870> the<00:04:09.169> location<00:04:09.530> is

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
have a problem with that the location is

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.879 
have a problem with that the location is
kind<00:04:10.099> of<00:04:10.190> weird<00:04:10.370> for<00:04:11.329> that<00:04:11.479> too<00:04:11.720> like<00:04:12.560> I<00:04:12.680> think

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:12.889 
kind of weird for that too like I think

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:14.770 
kind of weird for that too like I think
they<00:04:13.010> should<00:04:13.220> have<00:04:13.250> been<00:04:13.370> up<00:04:13.579> here<00:04:14.269> or

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
they should have been up here or

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.699 
they should have been up here or
something<00:04:15.169> but<00:04:15.789> that's<00:04:16.789> no<00:04:16.970> big<00:04:17.150> deal<00:04:17.709> these

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
something but that's no big deal these

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.069 
something but that's no big deal these
