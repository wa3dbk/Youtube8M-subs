through with the pace of mural and it

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.510 
through with the pace of mural and it
barbeau<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.100> worked<00:01:11.310> brilliantly

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
barbeau and it worked brilliantly

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.250 
barbeau and it worked brilliantly
following<00:01:12.119> me<00:01:12.210> started<00:01:12.540> off<00:01:12.630> really<00:01:12.900> brightly

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
following me started off really brightly

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.840 
following me started off really brightly
we<00:01:13.530> came<00:01:13.710> very<00:01:13.740> close<00:01:14.040> here<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.490> put<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.729> an

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
we came very close here to put in an

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.929 
we came very close here to put in an
equalizer<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.990> 12th<00:01:16.320> minute<00:01:16.350> but<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:17.189> think

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
equalizer on the 12th minute but I think

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.210 
equalizer on the 12th minute but I think
again<00:01:18.210> no<00:01:18.900> he<00:01:19.110> didn't<00:01:19.350> have<00:01:19.439> an<00:01:19.560> instant

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
again no he didn't have an instant

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.920 
again no he didn't have an instant
counter-attack<00:01:20.759> from<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.030> we<00:01:21.509> had<00:01:21.630> another

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
counter-attack from that we had another

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.480 
counter-attack from that we had another

for a corner where nothing came from

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.660 
for a corner where nothing came from
that<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.049> then<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:08.129> managed<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.489> chip

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
that and then you managed to chip

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.720 
that and then you managed to chip
through<00:02:08.700> 80<00:02:09.179> here<00:02:09.450> who<00:02:10.039> managed<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.099> just<00:02:11.580> get

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
through 80 here who managed to just get

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.130 
through 80 here who managed to just get
the<00:02:11.819> ball<00:02:11.940> over<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.209> goalie<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.660> then<00:02:12.780> don't

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
the ball over the goalie and then don't

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.290 
the ball over the goalie and then don't
be

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
be

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.730 
be
followed<00:02:13.630> it<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:13.930> head<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.410> ball<00:02:14.440> into<00:02:14.650> the

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
followed it to head the ball into the

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.080 
followed it to head the ball into the
back<00:02:14.950> of<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.130> net<00:02:15.280> and<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.460> believe<00:02:15.730> that<00:02:15.760> put

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
back of the net and I believe that put

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.130 
back of the net and I believe that put
it<00:02:16.180> now<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:16.740> 211<00:02:17.740> that's<00:02:17.980> right<00:02:18.220> but<00:02:19.030> he<00:02:19.420> was<00:02:19.660> he

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
it now to 211 that's right but he was he

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.810 
it now to 211 that's right but he was he
