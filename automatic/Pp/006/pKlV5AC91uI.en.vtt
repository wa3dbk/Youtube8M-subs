for<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.050> first<00:00:40.350> time<00:00:40.620> what's<00:00:41.309> your<00:00:41.399> first

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
for the first time what's your first

impression interesting very interesting

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.580 
impression interesting very interesting
you<00:00:45.300> quickly<00:00:45.570> feel<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:46.019> the<00:00:46.110> runner<00:00:46.260> glides

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
you quickly feel that the runner glides

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.619 
you quickly feel that the runner glides
really<00:00:47.010> well<00:00:47.160> which<00:00:47.489> makes<00:00:47.699> a<00:00:47.790> big<00:00:47.820> difference

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
really well which makes a big difference

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.579 
really well which makes a big difference
the<00:00:49.050> feeling<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.469> noticeable<00:00:49.980> right<00:00:50.250> away

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:51.589 
the feeling is noticeable right away

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:54.350 
the feeling is noticeable right away
aside<00:00:52.589> from<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.860> glide<00:00:53.100> what<00:00:53.970> do<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.120> think

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
aside from the glide what do you think

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.719 
aside from the glide what do you think
of<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.600> runner<00:00:54.809> it's<00:00:55.739> great<00:00:55.979> really<00:00:56.430> no

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:56.729 
of the runner it's great really no

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:58.520 
of the runner it's great really no
friction<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.420> seems<00:00:57.750> like<00:00:57.899> my<00:00:58.019> skating<00:00:58.350> is

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
friction it seems like my skating is

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.430 
friction it seems like my skating is
more<00:00:58.710> fluid<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.489> really<00:00:59.790> good<00:01:00.140> do<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.199> think

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
more fluid it's really good do you think

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.020 
more fluid it's really good do you think
that<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.649> fast<00:01:01.949> acceleration<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.879> runner

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
that in fast acceleration the runner

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.670 
that in fast acceleration the runner
could<00:01:03.239> give<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.540> an<00:01:03.690> extra<00:01:03.930> fraction<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.619> a

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
could give you an extra fraction of a

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.820 
could give you an extra fraction of a
second<00:01:05.180> I'd<00:01:06.180> say<00:01:06.420> yes<00:01:06.630> for<00:01:06.780> accelerations<00:01:07.440> but

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
second I'd say yes for accelerations but

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.950 
second I'd say yes for accelerations but
I'd<00:01:07.950> also<00:01:08.159> add<00:01:08.490> change<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.970> direction<00:01:09.090> it's

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
I'd also add change of direction it's

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.270 
I'd also add change of direction it's
often<00:01:10.289> important<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.770> change<00:01:11.009> direction

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
often important to change direction

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.249 
often important to change direction
quickly<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.940> a<00:01:12.030> game<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.479> these<00:01:13.020> runners

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
quickly in a game and these runners

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.570 
quickly in a game and these runners
provide<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:16.500> second<00:01:16.830> exercise<00:01:17.190> is<00:01:17.369> one

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
provide that the second exercise is one

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.730 
provide that the second exercise is one
of<00:01:17.700> agility<00:01:18.000> our<00:01:18.600> skaters<00:01:19.020> will<00:01:19.200> really<00:01:19.470> test

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
of agility our skaters will really test

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.230 
of agility our skaters will really test
the<00:01:19.920> hardness<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.610> black<00:01:20.789> edge<00:01:21.000> runner

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
the hardness of the black edge runner

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.210 
the hardness of the black edge runner
and<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:21.570> torsion<00:01:22.050> on<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.380> ice

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
the main strength of this runner once

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.660 
the main strength of this runner once
again<00:02:18.690> it's<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.050> runners<00:02:19.410> bite<00:02:19.650> when<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.460> put

center of gravity I can get around the

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.240 
center of gravity I can get around the
defenseman<00:02:24.300> easily<00:02:24.810> what<00:02:25.650> do<00:02:25.740> you<00:02:25.800> think<00:02:26.100> of

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250

the runners performance in the ice the
runners<00:02:28.110> performance<00:02:28.620> on<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.800> ice<00:02:28.950> I'm

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
runners performance on the ice I'm

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.910 
runners performance on the ice I'm
really<00:02:29.910> surprised<00:02:30.300> four<00:02:30.900> starts<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.320> stops<00:02:31.560> I

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
really surprised four starts and stops I

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.440 
really surprised four starts and stops I
can<00:02:32.190> only<00:02:32.340> say<00:02:32.580> that<00:02:32.610> it<00:02:32.760> bites<00:02:33.000> really<00:02:33.210> well

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
can only say that it bites really well

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.450 
can only say that it bites really well
into<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.810> ice<00:02:33.960> which<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:34.650> excellent<00:02:35.310> for

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
into the ice which is excellent for

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.440 
into the ice which is excellent for
hockey<00:02:35.670> players<00:02:37.970> what<00:02:38.970> does<00:02:39.060> this<00:02:39.180> runner

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
hockey players what does this runner

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.760 
hockey players what does this runner
provide<00:02:39.870> it's<00:02:40.080> different<00:02:40.410> from<00:02:40.560> other

it bites it bites when it glides it

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.550 
it bites it bites when it glides it
glides<00:02:45.120> there's<00:02:45.660> not<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:45.900> good<00:02:46.110> side<00:02:46.350> and<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.530> bad
