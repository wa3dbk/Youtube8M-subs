00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
yes

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.420 
yes
said<00:00:12.960> it<00:00:13.110> before<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:13.980> was<00:00:14.490> unable<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:16.100> get<00:00:17.100> the

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
said it before I was unable to get the

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.939 
said it before I was unable to get the
fiberglass<00:00:18.330> tape<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:19.170> place<00:00:19.230> completely

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
fiberglass tape in place completely

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.109 
fiberglass tape in place completely
around<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.580> bulkhead<00:00:21.000> even<00:00:21.510> on<00:00:21.660> one<00:00:21.869> side<00:00:23.119> and

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
around the bulkhead even on one side and

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.420 
around the bulkhead even on one side and
so<00:00:25.019> we're<00:00:25.289> gonna<00:00:25.380> get<00:00:25.560> like<00:00:25.769> this<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.279> my

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
so we're gonna get like this is my

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.250 
so we're gonna get like this is my
problem<00:00:26.730> I'm<00:00:27.090> sure<00:00:27.359> other<00:00:27.720> people<00:00:28.050> who<00:00:28.109> have

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
problem I'm sure other people who have

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.980 
problem I'm sure other people who have
not<00:00:28.410> had<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.740> difficulty<00:00:29.220> but<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.400> did<00:00:29.840> so<00:00:30.840> my

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
not had the difficulty but I did so my

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.830 
not had the difficulty but I did so my
solution<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:32.130> use<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.969> high<00:00:33.390> grain<00:00:33.660> of

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
solution is to use a high grain of

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.819 
solution is to use a high grain of
silicon<00:00:34.290> clear<00:00:34.649> silicone<00:00:34.920> caulk<00:00:36.620> which<00:00:37.620> I

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
silicon clear silicone caulk which I

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.420 
silicon clear silicone caulk which I
will<00:00:38.010> apply<00:00:38.840> to<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.050> edge<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:41.070> part<00:00:41.280> that

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
will apply to that edge the part that

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.069 
will apply to that edge the part that
hasn't<00:00:41.579> been<00:00:41.809> glassed

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
hasn't been glassed

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.180 
hasn't been glassed
on<00:00:44.420> okay<00:00:45.420> from<00:00:45.870> whatever<00:00:46.289> angle<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.739> can<00:00:46.800> get<00:00:47.039> it

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
on okay from whatever angle I can get it

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.100 
on okay from whatever angle I can get it
I<00:00:47.460> can<00:00:47.670> get<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.850> from<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.450> inside<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:48.899> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
I can get it from the inside of the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.750 
I can get it from the inside of the
cockpit<00:00:51.230> the<00:00:52.230> cockpit<00:00:52.260> side<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> back

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
cockpit the cockpit side on the back

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.639 
cockpit the cockpit side on the back
bulkhead<00:00:54.239> side<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.510> can<00:00:54.809> get<00:00:54.989> at<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.170> maybe<00:00:55.440> from

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
bulkhead side I can get at it maybe from

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.830 
bulkhead side I can get at it maybe from
the<00:00:55.829> back

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
the back

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.200 
the back
front<00:00:57.350> bulkhead<00:00:57.710> only<00:00:58.039> through<00:00:58.280> the<00:00:59.059> edge

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
front bulkhead only through the edge

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.350 
front bulkhead only through the edge
cover<00:00:59.539> and<00:00:59.949> probably<00:01:00.949> not<00:01:01.160> be<00:01:01.760> able<00:01:01.850> to<00:01:01.969> get<00:01:02.149> at

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
cover and probably not be able to get at

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.930 
cover and probably not be able to get at
it<00:01:02.510> from<00:01:02.660> the<00:01:02.809> other<00:01:02.840> side<00:01:03.190> so<00:01:04.190> that's<00:01:04.460> what<00:01:04.909> I

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
it from the other side so that's what I

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:16.710 
it from the other side so that's what I
do

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:26.760 

I<00:01:20.880> finished<00:01:24.550> the<00:01:25.530> front<00:01:26.530> and<00:01:26.650> rear

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
I finished the front and rear

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.760 
I finished the front and rear
bulkheads<00:01:27.250> with<00:01:28.590> silicone<00:01:29.590> caulk<00:01:29.890> and<00:01:31.770> it

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
bulkheads with silicone caulk and it

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.110 
bulkheads with silicone caulk and it
actually<00:01:32.950> went<00:01:33.220> easier<00:01:33.490> than<00:01:33.670> I<00:01:33.730> thought<00:01:33.940> it

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
actually went easier than I thought it

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.680 
actually went easier than I thought it
would<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:35.200> caulking<00:01:35.590> gun<00:01:35.800> would<00:01:36.040> not<00:01:36.220> fit<00:01:36.690> in

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
would the caulking gun would not fit in

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.680 
would the caulking gun would not fit in
the<00:01:37.870> cockpit<00:01:38.520> or<00:01:39.520> in<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:39.940> back<00:01:40.120> hatch<00:01:40.390> of<00:01:40.420> the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
the cockpit or in the back hatch of the

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.820 
the cockpit or in the back hatch of the
places<00:01:41.080> that<00:01:41.110> I<00:01:41.320> needed<00:01:41.530> to<00:01:41.740> work<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:43.720> using<00:01:44.710> my

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
places that I needed to work so using my

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.340 
places that I needed to work so using my
rubber<00:01:44.980> gloves<00:01:45.130> I<00:01:45.580> would<00:01:45.850> I<00:01:46.120> put<00:01:46.480> some<00:01:47.200> of<00:01:47.260> the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
rubber gloves I would I put some of the

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.710 
rubber gloves I would I put some of the
material<00:01:47.800> on<00:01:47.980> my<00:01:48.160> index<00:01:48.790> finger<00:01:49.180> and<00:01:49.210> then

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
material on my index finger and then

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.530 
material on my index finger and then
just<00:01:50.430> laid<00:01:51.430> it<00:01:51.610> in<00:01:51.790> the<00:01:52.330> in<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.720> crack<00:01:54.300> to<00:01:55.300> seal

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
just laid it in the in the crack to seal

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.969 
just laid it in the in the crack to seal
it<00:01:55.690> up<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:57.280> front<00:01:57.580> cockpit<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:59.290> rear<00:01:59.470> side<00:01:59.740> in

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
it up the front cockpit the rear side in

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.120 
it up the front cockpit the rear side in
the<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:01.420> they<00:02:01.570> are<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.869> front<00:02:02.500> hatch<00:02:02.740> the

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
the and they are the front hatch the

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.130 
the and they are the front hatch the
rear<00:02:03.310> sight<00:02:03.580> in<00:02:03.759> the<00:02:03.850> cockpit<00:02:04.240> area<00:02:04.360> was<00:02:04.869> quite

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
rear sight in the cockpit area was quite

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.230 
rear sight in the cockpit area was quite
easy<00:02:05.320> to<00:02:05.440> do<00:02:05.680> with<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.640> caulking<00:02:07.060> gun

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
easy to do with the caulking gun

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.730 
easy to do with the caulking gun
although<00:02:07.420> I<00:02:07.509> got<00:02:07.750> an<00:02:07.900> awful<00:02:08.110> lot<00:02:08.200> of<00:02:08.229> material

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
although I got an awful lot of material

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.690 
although I got an awful lot of material
in<00:02:08.830> there<00:02:09.040> and<00:02:09.670> then<00:02:09.790> I<00:02:09.820> used<00:02:10.030> a<00:02:10.149> bathtub<00:02:11.700> tool

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
in there and then I used a bathtub tool

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.730 
in there and then I used a bathtub tool
to<00:02:13.630> lay<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.320> caulk<00:02:14.590> in<00:02:14.920> tight<00:02:15.490> around<00:02:16.740> the

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
to lay the caulk in tight around the

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.990 
to lay the caulk in tight around the
bulkhead<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.850> removed<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.900> excess<00:02:20.050> amount

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
bulkhead and removed the excess amount

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.020 
bulkhead and removed the excess amount
front<00:02:22.000> hatch<00:02:22.209> from<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.200> from<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:24.030> front

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
front hatch from the from the front

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.610 
front hatch from the from the front
bulkhead<00:02:25.420> from<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.720> hatch<00:02:25.930> was<00:02:26.200> much<00:02:26.440> the

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
bulkhead from the hatch was much the

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.570 
bulkhead from the hatch was much the
same<00:02:26.800> although<00:02:27.070> that<00:02:27.370> areas<00:02:28.239> even<00:02:28.510> more

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
same although that areas even more

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.610 
same although that areas even more
confined<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:31.540> difficult<00:02:31.600> to<00:02:32.019> work<00:02:32.170> with<00:02:32.230> but

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
confined and difficult to work with but

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.270 
confined and difficult to work with but
all<00:02:33.459> in<00:02:33.700> all<00:02:33.850> I<00:02:33.880> think<00:02:34.360> I<00:02:34.630> have<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.560> reasonable

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
all in all I think I have a reasonable

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.350 
all in all I think I have a reasonable
watertight<00:02:37.860> situation<00:02:38.860> there<00:02:39.010> between<00:02:39.360> the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
watertight situation there between the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.390 
watertight situation there between the
three<00:02:40.600> different<00:02:40.920> elements<00:02:41.920> that<00:02:42.010> I've<00:02:42.130> used

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
three different elements that I've used

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.380 
three different elements that I've used
one<00:02:43.330> was<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:44.190> epoxy<00:02:45.190> putty<00:02:45.370> which<00:02:46.120> was

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
one was the epoxy putty which was

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.630 
one was the epoxy putty which was
originally<00:02:46.840> used<00:02:46.989> to<00:02:47.290> seal<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.680> pieces<00:02:48.489> in

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
originally used to seal the pieces in

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.960

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.539 
place the second was the glass and tape
the<00:02:52.420> glass<00:02:52.630> tape<00:02:52.959> which<00:02:53.709> was<00:02:53.920> used<00:02:54.100> over

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
the glass tape which was used over

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.170 
the glass tape which was used over
probably<00:02:54.940> three-quarters<00:02:55.810> of<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:57.180> bulkhead

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
probably three-quarters of the bulkhead

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.640 
probably three-quarters of the bulkhead
and<00:03:00.239> then<00:03:01.239> finally<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.870> caulk<00:03:02.110> which

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
and then finally the caulk which

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.130 
and then finally the caulk which
hopefully<00:03:03.489> will<00:03:03.850> take<00:03:04.030> care<00:03:04.269> of<00:03:04.330> the<00:03:04.840> any

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
hopefully will take care of the any

the excess it worked really well on that
front<00:03:25.750> cockpit<00:03:27.150> this<00:03:28.150> is<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:28.720> cockpit<00:03:29.590> side

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
front cockpit this is the cockpit side

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.210 
front cockpit this is the cockpit side
of<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.310> rear<00:03:30.520> bulkhead<00:03:30.850> and<00:03:31.830> you<00:03:32.830> know<00:03:32.950> it<00:03:33.100> was

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
of the rear bulkhead and you know it was

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.630 
of the rear bulkhead and you know it was
taped<00:03:33.520> at<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.790> bottom<00:03:34.440> and<00:03:35.440> then<00:03:35.710> some<00:03:36.430> tape

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
taped at the bottom and then some tape

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.190 
taped at the bottom and then some tape
applied<00:03:37.000> at<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:37.270> top<00:03:37.450> but<00:03:37.630> I<00:03:37.720> couldn't<00:03:37.990> get<00:03:38.080> it

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
applied at the top but I couldn't get it

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.720 
applied at the top but I couldn't get it
all<00:03:38.320> the<00:03:38.440> way<00:03:38.500> around<00:03:38.650> so<00:03:39.070> I<00:03:39.100> finished<00:03:39.460> with

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
all the way around so I finished with

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.040 
all the way around so I finished with
the<00:03:39.790> caulk<00:03:40.120> I'm<00:03:40.300> not<00:03:40.450> sure<00:03:40.660> whether<00:03:40.840> you<00:03:40.990> can

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
the caulk I'm not sure whether you can

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.530 
the caulk I'm not sure whether you can
see<00:03:41.380> that<00:03:41.620> or<00:03:42.520> not<00:03:42.760> here<00:03:43.800> this<00:03:44.800> is<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.540> front

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
see that or not here this is the front

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.810 
see that or not here this is the front
bulkhead<00:03:46.960> from<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.350> cockpit<00:03:47.560> side<00:03:48.070> which<00:03:48.670> I

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
bulkhead from the cockpit side which I

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.370 
bulkhead from the cockpit side which I
really<00:03:49.060> can't<00:03:49.240> reach<00:03:49.450> with<00:03:49.660> my<00:03:49.810> arm<00:03:50.050> but<00:03:50.260> which

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
really can't reach with my arm but which

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.750 
really can't reach with my arm but which
I<00:03:50.500> was<00:03:50.620> able<00:03:50.710> to<00:03:50.860> reach<00:03:51.040> with<00:03:51.250> that<00:03:51.280> tool<00:03:52.560> and

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
I was able to reach with that tool and

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.920 
I was able to reach with that tool and
you<00:03:54.760> can<00:03:54.820> see<00:03:55.030> that<00:03:55.180> there's<00:03:55.390> a<00:03:55.450> bead<00:03:55.630> of<00:03:55.660> caulk

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
you can see that there's a bead of caulk

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.690 
you can see that there's a bead of caulk
all<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.380> way<00:03:56.470> around<00:03:56.800> and<00:03:56.980> a<00:03:57.070> fill<00:03:57.280> that<00:03:57.460> very

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
all the way around and a fill that very

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.620 
all the way around and a fill that very
filled<00:03:58.000> all<00:03:58.180> the<00:03:58.300> gaps<00:03:58.480> very<00:03:58.810> nicely<00:04:00.480> so<00:04:01.480> I'm

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
filled all the gaps very nicely so I'm

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.780 
filled all the gaps very nicely so I'm
hopeful<00:04:02.020> hopeful<00:04:02.380> that<00:04:02.620> that<00:04:02.890> will<00:04:02.950> eliminate

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
hopeful hopeful that that will eliminate

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.860 
hopeful hopeful that that will eliminate
any<00:04:04.590> water<00:04:05.590> leakage

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.140 

was<00:04:10.440> that<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:10.890> most<00:04:11.129> difficult<00:04:11.610> of<00:04:11.700> all<00:04:11.879> but

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
was that the most difficult of all but

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.830 
was that the most difficult of all but
it<00:04:12.180> was<00:04:12.269> just<00:04:12.360> a<00:04:12.810> small<00:04:13.080> amount<00:04:13.230> at<00:04:14.069> the<00:04:14.129> top<00:04:14.840> of

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
it was just a small amount at the top of

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.819 
it was just a small amount at the top of
the<00:04:16.280> the<00:04:17.840> bulkhead<00:04:18.840> that<00:04:18.870> needed<00:04:19.320> needed

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
the the bulkhead that needed needed

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.500 
the the bulkhead that needed needed
caulk<00:04:20.220> and<00:04:20.459> I<00:04:20.489> had<00:04:20.639> to<00:04:20.729> operate<00:04:21.060> pretty<00:04:21.329> much

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
caulk and I had to operate pretty much

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.100 
caulk and I had to operate pretty much
by<00:04:22.350> feel<00:04:23.070> I<00:04:23.580> could<00:04:23.850> stick<00:04:24.389> my<00:04:24.690> head<00:04:24.810> in<00:04:24.960> there<00:04:25.050> a

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
by feel I could stick my head in there a

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.110 
by feel I could stick my head in there a
little<00:04:25.320> bit<00:04:25.470> and<00:04:25.919> get<00:04:26.160> some<00:04:26.370> idea<00:04:26.699> of<00:04:26.760> where

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
little bit and get some idea of where

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.430 
little bit and get some idea of where
things<00:04:27.330> needed<00:04:27.660> to<00:04:27.750> go<00:04:27.900> but<00:04:28.110> I<00:04:28.139> pretty<00:04:28.320> much

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
things needed to go but I pretty much

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.220 
things needed to go but I pretty much
had<00:04:28.770> to<00:04:28.830> operate
