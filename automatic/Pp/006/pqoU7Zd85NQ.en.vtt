00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.350

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:30.809
 finally 

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:33.859
 why not why not so I go to the shop 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:37.459
 in the shop very often yes she is duly the mutiny that had 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.709
 agitated the fishes it's right next descoings jumping rubble of the 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.070
 hamsters but the fault he has charge 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.139
 he was allergic to me 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:50.769
 but the afssaps started well because free stage is everywhere the 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.779
 commission of lips the bottom of the throat finally sneeze world 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:56.489
 not very nice 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.179
 and then she 

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:03.779
 and then good m - thanks to once the balls and a worker me 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:05.119
 I try to concentrate 

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:08.920
 this goldfish and red crescent and I did not care then 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.459
 I tell you how it was going 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.329
 I thought it was great that I had the idea that I had good 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.779
 found a compromise is actually not at all and pp all his charms and in addition 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:19.269
 I have a feeling of sadness 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.400
 it is that I am at the shop and I look at this slope once without project jo 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.169
 winter party 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:26.849
 these do not remember anything that is to say that 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.419
 for that he congratulated me 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:31.949
 eventually possible 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:34.949
 so that's empty-handed in ee 

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:39.149
 it's like that 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:42.149
 so I wrote me I can I can leave the apartment 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:47.359
 even in a little trick had in the countryside with a white hat the redemption 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.569
 it's on a sport button + x not possible to read here it's nice 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:55.809
 finally leave 

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:58.159
 So here is 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.489
 mf the console face on late 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.709
 the baby who will adapt this stuff 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.399
 like that like everyone else finally 

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:09.049
 and by then 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.689
 I think we changed had dinner in the evening 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:14.769
 doing so a mountaineer 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.019
 - his name 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.309
 German romanticism 

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:18.659
 the bottom 

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:21.659
 we must build ourselves 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:25.599
 8:30 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.340
 listen to corentin marchiani 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:33.569
 August 20th 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.490
 this thing 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.490
 like that 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.960
 it's crazy what it's like to match is a notch cutter 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.050
 I think of them 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.219
 or the other one 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:05.219
 according to seconds it's mythical 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:08.029
 but this group 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:11.029
 why happy 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.740
 perhaps 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.580
 but it is redemption according to m 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.580
 in his encyclical a mine 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.360
 as a distinctive sign as 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.360
 it changes my ideas 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:37.199
 every time
