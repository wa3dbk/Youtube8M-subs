00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.450
 the philips saeco 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.710
 flow sa is half automatic 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.960
 espresso machine 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.849
 And that means you do everything yourself 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.590
 figuring out coffee determines how strong you are 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.750
 cup and how much water you want 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.779
 what you don't have to do is 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.070
 pressing the coffee in the gun 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.369
 well as you see it is a beauty of 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.109
 a device but it also works fine 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.730
 Let's just put espresso 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.169
 because it is possible when you first get it 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.820
 you will have to use the device 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.290
 Flush and there has this device 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.520
 a button for 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.840
 once the system is full of 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.480
 water then you can actually get one 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.670
 make espresso what you do i grab one 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.170
 scoop of coffee put it in the gun 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.710
 I won't handle it because it does 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.730
 device itself and turn in the device 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.829
 annoying is that the device 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.760
 if you do that because you have the 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.920
 force on 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.750
 after all i have to do now is on 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.020
 press the coffee button and go with that 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.760
 banana 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.039
 now flows first tiny bit 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.629
 water over the coffee already a 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.940
 to loosen the taste 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.520
 growth brewing is called that and now comes the 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.500
 rest of the water over it of course 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.500
 you have to make the coffee buttons yourself 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.000
 Press to stop the water supply 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.650
 well then you get a cup of espresso and 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.619
 it is just very tasty and has one 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.240

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.159

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.229
 if you need the device mains connection 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.820
 you just keep a booklet but 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.170
 everything else is just clear there 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.030
 explained in 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.670

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.259

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.210
 Of course you need a cup of espresso 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.759

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.710
 you remove it from the espresso machine and 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.970
 knock it out in the trash 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.500
 you'll be a bit of a firm one 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.930

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.280
 so you have to do after every cup of coffee 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.600
 that you put and that takes time 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.720

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.220
 device for the enthusiast 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.060
 you must now purchase this device 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.950
