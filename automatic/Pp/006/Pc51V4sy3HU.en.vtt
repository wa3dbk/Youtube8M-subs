to<00:01:42.090> have<00:01:42.270> both<00:01:42.570> right<00:01:42.840> now<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.229> i<00:01:43.259> ended<00:01:43.470> up

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
to have both right now so i ended up

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.830 
to have both right now so i ended up
getting<00:01:43.740> rid<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.100> my<00:01:44.310> ps4<00:01:44.610> i<00:01:44.880> sold<00:01:45.180> my<00:01:45.299> xbox<00:01:45.329> one

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
getting rid of my ps4 i sold my xbox one

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.690 
getting rid of my ps4 i sold my xbox one
but<00:01:46.110> i<00:01:46.140> really<00:01:46.500> primarily<00:01:47.009> game<00:01:47.430> on<00:01:47.610> the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
but i really primarily game on the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.520 
but i really primarily game on the
computer<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.420> like<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.750> only<00:01:48.899> get<00:01:49.110> exclusive

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
computer so like I only get exclusive

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.410 
computer so like I only get exclusive
for<00:01:49.890> each<00:01:49.979> console<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.670> because<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.149> ps4

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
for each console and because the ps4

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.270 
for each console and because the ps4
right<00:01:51.780> now<00:01:51.899> has<00:01:52.110> like<00:01:52.350> only<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:52.860> many<00:01:53.009> like<00:01:53.250> a

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
right now has like only so many like a

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.889 
right now has like only so many like a
handful<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.729> exclusives<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.479> figured<00:01:54.750> that'd

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
handful of exclusives I figured that'd

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.120 
handful of exclusives I figured that'd
be<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.049> better<00:01:55.259> one<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.530> get<00:01:55.649> rid<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:55.890> because

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
be the better one to get rid of because

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.639 
be the better one to get rid of because
like<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.610> prefer<00:01:57.000> shooters<00:01:57.570> on<00:01:57.780> xbox<00:01:58.170> one<00:01:58.409> so
