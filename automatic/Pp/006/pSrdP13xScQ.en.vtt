00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.410
 ana 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:23.120
 I'm no good logical betting teacher today I'm expecting Sekiya Memorial this time 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:27.170
 At first glance it is Sekiya memorial 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:36.380
 The course is against Niigata Shiba 1600m 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:43.240
 Well basically, please think in terms of the capture data of the Niigata Shiba 1600m battle 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:43.240
 First of all, it is the basic tendency of the turf 1600m battle of Niigata 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.710
 Basically, it is a course where considerable work is advantageous 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:58.060
 If you have a horse racing investment Encyclopedia, then you should check the lineage and the person here too. 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.430
 Please give me 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:04.180
 So you this year in 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.270
 The departure of the Sekiya Memorial is with this resident 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:12.310
 Book and number 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:17.439
 What a big point but it is a good way to run Chukyo Memorial 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.460
 That the horse is 6 horses half of that is in step with that 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:24.580
 a 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:25.360
 It's not a very good step, but it's eco-friendly. 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.490
 is not it 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:32.560
 I think it will be the point to go to the choice 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:40.960
 It is from the data side 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:43.450
 The age is an unquestionable race. Even with a 7-year-old horse , the fact that it is 304 24 is 5 4 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.170
 I am 6 years old 7 years old 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:51.950
 Seven-year-old horse has the highest multiple win rate 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:55.330
 It is a 6-year-old bar yeah most double winning percentage Hikuku' 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.410
 That's only 12% 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.410
 Once this time 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:07.380
 The popularity of Sekiya Memorial is here 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:11.130
 Currently the most popular extra end for 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:15.300
 Though this horse is 6 years old 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:19.030
 For example think about the fact that little is it the most popular and Eiya 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.569
 I think I can say that the risk is high 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.569
 3 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.270
 It is correct I 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:35.620
 The higher popularity of horse to at solid race 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:40.060
 Horses favored by the most popular have a 80% multiple victory rate, so you can not remove them from the betting ticket 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:44.020
 However, you will Well annoying place 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.830
 At first I checked the steps for a while 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:55.989
 Here is the first excellent Yasuda memorial group 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:57.910
 There is 71.4% of winning ratio, so I can not remove it from the betting ticket a little , and the other is half this time 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.800
 Six heads come out 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:05.780
 It is a group of Chukyo commemoration 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:10.370
 Has a multi-win rate of only 13.6% 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:16.110
 a You are here a little if not a good choice a 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:20.100
 I think that this year's Sekiya memorial will not hit a little 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:27.260
 Set of pre-run Yasuda Kinen is it is here of two horses 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:27.260
 These two heads to Satono Galant and the extra end 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:40.349
 It is here and there is a thing that the result of the grass of Niigata is also 4 good. 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:44.460
 I can not remove it for a moment I think the frame order is good for the extra end 8 frames are 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:49.950
 Multiple wins 29% over the past 10 years 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:54.690
 There are also 6 machines in a row and there is also a machine called Demuro in the first place 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:04:03.090
 There is a place to go if you can not remove it for a moment 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:09.599
 It is a group of the whole Chukyo commemoration Eh-6 like this time this time we have been out 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:11.069
 It is not so good as a step situation as an overall result, but it is good with a multiple victory rate 13.6% 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:18.180
 I do not have 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:24.330
 There are many courses that specialize in Niigata Shiba, so a little 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:29.900
 I think I would like to check it, right? 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.900
 Nigatashiba 320 to Fukusho rate of 71.4% 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.180
 Because there is, I need some attention 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:41.240
 Next is this cafe brilliant. 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:43.800
 This is a a 5 run on Niigata Shiba 3110 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.849
 Multiple win rate 100% 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:55.080
 But you know yeah following is or that Arbatax 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:58.480
 This is also a maturi song because it has been running twice in the past for Niigata Shiba and you have a 100% multiple victory rate. 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:03.000
 Horse from the memorial to 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.000
 There is a thing that I can not remove this area for a moment 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:15.900
 If you have a large enclave with Keba, the winners check sheet 

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:22.560
 I want you to check carefully, but in the data aspect it is here 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:25.660
 Definitely, 9 people have 7 wins and 8 wins, and they have nearly 30% multiple wins. 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.900
 This is a little bit 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:33.969
 It is hard to remove from betting 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:39.300
 It is this time upon adding that say 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:43.250
 I will make such an expectation 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.250
 Japanese name is Cafe Brilliant 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:49.620
 I finished and finished 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:55.170
 This horse is a pedigree 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:06:00.530
 It is good because it is considerably against this 1600 m of grass of Niigata 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:06:00.530
 It is here that it is a pedigree with a high run rate 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:09.020
 If you have a ranch and a large encyclopaedia , check it here and make it a favorite 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:13.910
 did 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:16.810
 Opposite extra end you think you can say 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:21.400
 Satona Gallant to Etana 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:26.080
 Here is Almaty Ban Arbatax a Smart Orion 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:31.200
 I turned the mark about Majesty Hearts 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:36.710
 But it's a bit like this cafe brilliant 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.710
 There is one anxiety material That's kinda 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:46.940
 Here is blog ranking 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:51.009
 Anxious material cafe Brilliant at 4 is kinda 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:57.039
 In the past that Niigata turf 1600m 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:59.619
 Because I have a little dangerous factor Oite in Sekiya Kinen a it better here 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:06.719
 I will put about 

00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:09.729
 Once you know that, I would like you to refer to this forecast . 

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:11.030
 It becomes more than this time 

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:16.510
 Have a look until the end 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:16.510
