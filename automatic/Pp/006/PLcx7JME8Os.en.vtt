here on radar and satellite you can see
the<00:00:16.770> clouds<00:00:17.010> starting<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.640> filter<00:00:17.820> in<00:00:18.090> there

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
the clouds starting to filter in there

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.660 
the clouds starting to filter in there
it<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:18.930> folks<00:00:19.230> coming<00:00:19.890> our<00:00:20.039> way<00:00:20.220> there<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.520> the

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
it is folks coming our way there is the

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.090 
it is folks coming our way there is the
leading<00:00:20.910> edge<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:22.080> snow<00:00:22.320> field<00:00:22.590> coming

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
leading edge of the snow field coming

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.830 
leading edge of the snow field coming
our<00:00:23.310> way<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.789> will<00:00:23.939> head<00:00:24.180> our<00:00:24.420> way<00:00:24.449> tonight

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
our way that will head our way tonight

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.990 
our way that will head our way tonight
now<00:00:25.199> as<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.890> initially<00:00:26.070> starts<00:00:26.670> out<00:00:26.820> this

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
now as it initially starts out this

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.320 
now as it initially starts out this
evening<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.390> think<00:00:27.630> it's<00:00:27.779> going<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.080> be<00:00:29.240> one<00:00:30.240> of

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
evening I think it's going to be one of

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.970 
evening I think it's going to be one of
those<00:00:30.390> type<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.660> situations<00:00:30.929> where<00:00:31.470> it's

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
those type of situations where it's

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.770 
those type of situations where it's
going<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.309> show<00:00:32.520> up<00:00:32.640> on<00:00:32.759> radar<00:00:32.820> but<00:00:33.239> not<00:00:33.450> start

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
going to show up on radar but not start

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.810 
going to show up on radar but not start
fall<00:00:34.140> immediately<00:00:34.469> we've<00:00:35.160> got<00:00:35.309> pretty<00:00:35.550> dry

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
fall immediately we've got pretty dry

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.130 
fall immediately we've got pretty dry
air<00:00:36.059> in<00:00:36.210> place<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.690> sea<00:00:36.870> surface

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
air in place you sea surface

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.350 
air in place you sea surface
temperatures<00:00:37.770> here<00:00:38.010> across<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.850> area<00:00:39.030> but<00:00:39.270> if

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
temperatures here across the area but if

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.090 
temperatures here across the area but if
I<00:00:39.450> put<00:00:39.660> on<00:00:39.780> dew<00:00:39.989> points<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.530> mean<00:00:40.680> just<00:00:40.860> look<00:00:41.040> at

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
I put on dew points I mean just look at

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.880 
I put on dew points I mean just look at
how<00:00:41.219> bone<00:00:41.579> dry<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.059> air<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.600> dew<00:00:43.440> points<00:00:43.829> in

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
how bone dry the air is dew points in

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.740 
how bone dry the air is dew points in
the<00:00:44.010> very<00:00:44.219> low<00:00:44.489> single<00:00:44.940> digits<00:00:45.420> around<00:00:45.660> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
the very low single digits around the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.540 
the very low single digits around the
area<00:00:45.989> that's<00:00:46.500> going<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.710> have<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.039> be<00:00:47.070> overcome

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
area that's going to have to be overcome

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.430 
area that's going to have to be overcome
enough<00:00:48.149> by<00:00:48.390> some<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.750> snow<00:00:48.809> before<00:00:49.230> it

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
enough by some of the snow before it

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.990 
enough by some of the snow before it
will<00:00:49.559> actually<00:00:49.710> start<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.190> fall<00:00:50.460> from<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.789> sky

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
will actually start to fall from the sky

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.240 
will actually start to fall from the sky
so<00:00:51.329> I'd<00:00:51.870> say<00:00:52.079> it'll<00:00:52.680> be<00:00:52.770> at<00:00:52.860> least<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.100> couple

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
so I'd say it'll be at least a couple

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.369 
so I'd say it'll be at least a couple
hours<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.910> snow<00:00:54.149> falling<00:00:54.449> through<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
hours of snow falling through the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.200 
hours of snow falling through the
gradually<00:00:56.129> through<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.430> sky<00:00:56.610> probably

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
gradually through the sky probably

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.670 
gradually through the sky probably
before<00:00:57.329> we<00:00:57.570> start<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.899> see<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> lot<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.559> reach

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
before we start to see a lot of it reach

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.950 
before we start to see a lot of it reach
the<00:00:58.859> ground<00:00:59.039> my<00:00:59.820> best<00:01:00.059> guess<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.570> we're

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
the ground my best guess is that we're

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.260 
the ground my best guess is that we're
probably<00:01:01.410> going<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.890> see<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.370> starting<00:01:03.059> to

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
probably going to see this starting to

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.530 
probably going to see this starting to
affect<00:01:04.170> us<00:01:04.799> really<00:01:05.339> on<00:01:05.519> from<00:01:05.790> about<00:01:06.030> midnight

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
affect us really on from about midnight

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.210 
affect us really on from about midnight
on<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:06.990> got<00:01:07.140> evening<00:01:07.380> plans<00:01:07.530> tonight<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.070> think

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
on so got evening plans tonight I think

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.310 
on so got evening plans tonight I think
you'll<00:01:08.580> be<00:01:08.610> okay<00:01:09.090> here's<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.840> way<00:01:09.990> future

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
you'll be okay here's the way future

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.630 
you'll be okay here's the way future
radar<00:01:10.680> goes<00:01:10.830> let<00:01:11.040> me<00:01:11.070> show<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> couple<00:01:11.400> of

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
radar goes let me show you a couple of

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.070 
radar goes let me show you a couple of
use<00:01:11.820> first<00:01:12.090> let's<00:01:12.240> look<00:01:12.270> at<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.510> her<00:01:12.720> model

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
use first let's look at the her model

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.020 
use first let's look at the her model
the<00:01:13.170> her<00:01:13.260> model<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.680> highest<00:01:13.979> res<00:01:14.189> data

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
the her model is the highest res data

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.880 
the her model is the highest res data
that<00:01:15.270> we<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.049> only<00:01:16.140> goes<00:01:16.380> out<00:01:16.590> really

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
that we have and it only goes out really

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.830 
that we have and it only goes out really
into<00:01:17.009> about<00:01:17.189> 4am<00:01:17.580> right<00:01:18.000> now<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.600> very

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
into about 4am right now it is a very

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.140 
into about 4am right now it is a very
short-term<00:01:19.229> model<00:01:19.770> but<00:01:19.920> here's<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.640> picture

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
short-term model but here's the picture

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.910 
short-term model but here's the picture
and<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.420> can<00:01:21.570> see<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.810> leading<00:01:22.290> edge<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.680> some

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
and you can see the leading edge of some

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.710 
and you can see the leading edge of some
of<00:01:23.009> those<00:01:23.100> precipitation<00:01:23.909> bands<00:01:24.119> starting<00:01:24.630> to

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
of those precipitation bands starting to

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.109 
of those precipitation bands starting to
work<00:01:24.930> into<00:01:25.229> our<00:01:25.350> area<00:01:25.580> tonight<00:01:26.580> but<00:01:26.850> again

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
work into our area tonight but again

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.929 
work into our area tonight but again
here<00:01:27.390> we<00:01:27.420> are<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:28.350> see<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:29.040> starts<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.549> sort<00:01:29.790> of

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
here we are you see it starts to sort of

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.120 
here we are you see it starts to sort of
watch<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.689> how<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.930> brings<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.650> then

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
watch this how it brings it in and then

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.249 
watch this how it brings it in and then
just<00:01:32.310> notice<00:01:32.759> how<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.210> really<00:01:33.600> dries<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
just notice how it just really dries the

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.230 
just notice how it just really dries the
things<00:01:34.500> up<00:01:34.710> over<00:01:35.009> us<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.939> will<00:01:36.030> raise<00:01:36.180> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
things up over us that will raise the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.700 
things up over us that will raise the
dewpoints<00:01:36.840> enough<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.259> by<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.439> time

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
dewpoints enough that by the time

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.469 
dewpoints enough that by the time
midnight<00:01:38.250> here<00:01:38.549> comes<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.060> we've<00:01:39.150> got<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
midnight here comes and we've got the

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.480 
midnight here comes and we've got the
snow<00:01:39.720> working<00:01:40.110> into<00:01:40.290> our<00:01:40.409> area<00:01:40.619> that's<00:01:41.310> when

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
snow working into our area that's when

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.710 
snow working into our area that's when
we<00:01:41.579> can<00:01:41.729> really<00:01:41.939> start<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.360> see<00:01:42.509> some<00:01:42.540> things

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
we can really start to see some things

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.840 
we can really start to see some things
working<00:01:43.290> but<00:01:43.500> as<00:01:43.710> we<00:01:43.890> head<00:01:44.070> out<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.430> end<00:01:44.640> of

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
working but as we head out to the end of

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.670 
working but as we head out to the end of
the<00:01:44.909> model<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.360> model<00:01:45.390> ends<00:01:45.990> at<00:01:46.110> 4am<00:01:46.409> and

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
the model the model ends at 4am and

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.649 
the model the model ends at 4am and
that's<00:01:47.280> when<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.549> biggest<00:01:48.030> snows<00:01:48.270> are<00:01:48.479> just

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
that's when the biggest snows are just

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.300 
that's when the biggest snows are just
starting<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.049> approach<00:01:49.380> us<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.950> think<00:01:50.159> the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
starting to approach us so I think the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.679 
starting to approach us so I think the
heaviest<00:01:50.579> snow<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:51.000> probably<00:01:51.329> going<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.570> be

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
heaviest snow is probably going to be

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.200 
heaviest snow is probably going to be
from<00:01:51.840> about<00:01:52.110> 4am<00:01:52.770> tonight<00:01:53.460> all<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.119> way
