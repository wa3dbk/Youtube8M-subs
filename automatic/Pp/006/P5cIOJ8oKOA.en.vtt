00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.580 
this is sort of like the logical trick
that<00:03:29.700> I<00:03:29.730> have<00:03:29.820> a<00:03:30.000> tutorial<00:03:30.390> on<00:03:30.690> where<00:03:31.290> you<00:03:31.410> have

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
that I have a tutorial on where you have

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.190 
that I have a tutorial on where you have
to<00:03:31.709> think<00:03:31.740> quick<00:03:32.250> on<00:03:32.430> your<00:03:32.760> feet<00:03:32.870> because<00:03:33.870> the

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
to think quick on your feet because the

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.380 
to think quick on your feet because the
card<00:03:34.470> is<00:03:34.590> in<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:34.770> fifth<00:03:34.980> position<00:03:35.160> so<00:03:36.150> let's

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
card is in the fifth position so let's

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.920 
card is in the fifth position so let's
say<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.750> spectator<00:03:37.380> says<00:03:38.180> Lance<00:03:39.180> Armstrong

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
say the spectator says Lance Armstrong

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.160 
say the spectator says Lance Armstrong
so<00:03:40.800> you<00:03:40.860> know<00:03:41.100> la<00:03:41.600> NCE

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
so you know la NCE

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.650 
so you know la NCE
well<00:03:43.740> there's<00:03:44.010> Lance<00:03:44.400> you<00:03:44.850> got<00:03:45.030> that<00:03:45.180> on<00:03:45.390> top

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
well there's Lance you got that on top

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.449 
well there's Lance you got that on top
so<00:03:46.230> then<00:03:46.350> you<00:03:46.410> can<00:03:46.530> spell<00:03:46.740> Armstrong<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.580> RM<00:03:48.300> STR

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
so then you can spell Armstrong a RM STR

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.330 
so then you can spell Armstrong a RM STR
Ong<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:50.640> then<00:03:51.300> again<00:03:51.600> you<00:03:51.840> just<00:03:52.310> spell<00:03:53.310> it

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
Ong and then again you just spell it

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.300 
Ong and then again you just spell it
again<00:03:53.520> la<00:03:54.120> NCE<00:03:54.770> AR<00:03:55.770> M<00:03:56.010> STR<00:03:57.620> Ong<00:03:58.620> Lance

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
again la NCE AR M STR Ong Lance

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.580 
again la NCE AR M STR Ong Lance
Armstrong<00:03:59.850> so<00:04:00.300> this<00:04:00.900> could<00:04:01.080> be<00:04:01.110> the<00:04:01.290> tricky

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
Armstrong so this could be the tricky

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.290 
Armstrong so this could be the tricky
part<00:04:01.860> but<00:04:02.130> you<00:04:02.280> have<00:04:02.430> to<00:04:02.550> be<00:04:02.670> creative<00:04:02.850> and

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
part but you have to be creative and

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.770 
part but you have to be creative and
think<00:04:03.770> when<00:04:04.770> the<00:04:04.890> person<00:04:05.220> tells<00:04:05.459> you<00:04:05.670> the<00:04:06.600> name

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
think when the person tells you the name

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.150 
think when the person tells you the name
of<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:07.050> person<00:04:07.470> how<00:04:07.650> you're<00:04:07.830> going<00:04:07.950> to<00:04:08.040> get

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
of the person how you're going to get

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.310 
of the person how you're going to get
that<00:04:08.340> fifth<00:04:08.610> card<00:04:08.880> to<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.150> top<00:04:09.360> and<00:04:09.660> then<00:04:10.140> when

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
that fifth card to the top and then when

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.560 
that fifth card to the top and then when
you<00:04:10.410> do<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.590> reveal<00:04:11.040> at<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.340> end<00:04:11.520> they<00:04:12.420> will

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
you do the reveal at the end they will

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.199 
you do the reveal at the end they will
be<00:04:12.750> very<00:04:13.200> impressed<00:04:13.530> this<00:04:14.310> is<00:04:14.489> a<00:04:14.520> very<00:04:14.820> simple

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
be very impressed this is a very simple

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.720 
be very impressed this is a very simple
trick<00:04:15.390> all<00:04:16.200> it<00:04:16.500> involves<00:04:17.010> is<00:04:17.130> that<00:04:17.310> simple

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
trick all it involves is that simple

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.729 
trick all it involves is that simple
glide<00:04:18.030> move<00:04:18.359> where<00:04:19.049> it<00:04:19.200> appears<00:04:19.560> you're

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
glide move where it appears you're

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.289 
glide move where it appears you're
taking<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.130> bottom<00:04:20.400> card<00:04:20.729> but<00:04:20.940> you're<00:04:21.090> not

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
taking the bottom card but you're not

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.200 
taking the bottom card but you're not
and<00:04:21.600> then<00:04:22.560> just<00:04:22.860> following<00:04:23.400> this

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
and then just following this

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.510 
and then just following this
little<00:04:24.479> code<00:04:24.750> right<00:04:25.110> here<00:04:25.880> 4<00:04:26.880> 1<00:04:27.750> 3<00:04:28.110> 2<00:04:28.830> if<00:04:29.400> you

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
little code right here 4 1 3 2 if you

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.279 
little code right here 4 1 3 2 if you
didn't<00:04:29.759> catch<00:04:29.940> it<00:04:29.970> the<00:04:30.180> first<00:04:30.509> time<00:04:30.750> watch<00:04:31.080> the

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
didn't catch it the first time watch the

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.499 
didn't catch it the first time watch the
tutorial<00:04:31.770> again<00:04:31.889> and<00:04:32.340> hopefully<00:04:32.970> you<00:04:33.330> guys

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:33.509 
tutorial again and hopefully you guys

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:36.320 
tutorial again and hopefully you guys
like<00:04:33.810> this<00:04:34.080> trick<00:04:34.319> that's<00:04:35.069> it<00:04:35.310> I'll<00:04:35.490> see<00:04:35.550> you

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
like this trick that's it I'll see you

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.750 
like this trick that's it I'll see you
next<00:04:36.360> time
