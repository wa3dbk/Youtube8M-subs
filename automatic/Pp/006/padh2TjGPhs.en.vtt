00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 this Sunday the world of games was 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.450
 sadder the industry lost one of 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.000
 their biggest names actor and the current 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.519
 president of nintendo that died at 55 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.160
 years the act took over the company's 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.730
 in 2002 becoming the fourth president 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.130
 of nintendo that was founded in 1889 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.050
 when a company has only four 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.449
 presidents over more than 100 years 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.970
 now you can imagine how hard it is 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.680
 to get that certain position that the actor 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.960
 he was a leader who really 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.189
 understands the legal challenges of 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.899
 make video games 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.940
 After all, he started his career as a 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.190
 programmer and liked to recall that the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.410
 all with that classic phrase that 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.809
 I used my game interviews 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.030
 developer and the act was the mind behind 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.500
 the creation of the game deem land clubs 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.079
 when we were introduced to the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.300
 dear pink mascot he also 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.070
 helped create the game boy years later 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.829

 About me I do not even need to say anything 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.520
 Of course not everything was flowers. 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.799
 since the act took over the presidency of the 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.200
 nintendo but its ability to deal with 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.670
 setbacks certainly were envied by 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.200
 many people 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.000
 the actor and the act believed that the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.430
 main objective of the games was 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.530
 entertaining people and went to work 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.750
 under this motto that he managed to bring 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.570
