have to do is you got to get the perks
in<00:02:22.830> time<00:02:23.100> if<00:02:23.550> you're<00:02:23.730> on<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:23.970> specific<00:02:24.180> for

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
in time if you're on a specific for

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.720 
in time if you're on a specific for
let's<00:02:25.200> say<00:02:25.260> you're<00:02:25.560> on<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.890> bow<00:02:26.220> know<00:02:26.490> how

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
let's say you're on the bow know how

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.760 
let's say you're on the bow know how
many<00:02:26.880> floors<00:02:27.090> they<00:02:27.330> are<00:02:27.450> but<00:02:27.690> let's<00:02:28.470> say<00:02:28.620> on

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
many floors they are but let's say on

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.440 
many floors they are but let's say on
the<00:02:28.950> fifth<00:02:29.130> floor<00:02:29.280> for<00:02:29.640> example<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.300> there's

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
the fifth floor for example and there's

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.210 
the fifth floor for example and there's
a<00:02:30.510> speed<00:02:30.900> cola<00:02:31.140> machine<00:02:31.260> in<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.860> elevator

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
a speed cola machine in the elevator

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.170 
a speed cola machine in the elevator
shaft<00:02:32.480> right<00:02:33.860> you<00:02:34.860> go<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.100> grab<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.400> but<00:02:36.090> you

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
shaft right you go to grab it but you

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.460 
shaft right you go to grab it but you
didn't<00:02:36.390> make<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.540> in<00:02:36.750> time<00:02:36.780> because<00:02:37.320> the

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
didn't make it in time because the

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.470 
didn't make it in time because the
elevator<00:02:37.860> actually<00:02:38.280> decided<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.760> go<00:02:38.910> up<00:02:39.120> a

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
elevator actually decided to go up a

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
floor or three and that means that you

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.260 
floor or three and that means that you
have<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.410> now<00:02:43.560> go<00:02:43.800> up<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.190> floor<00:02:44.460> or<00:02:44.520> three<00:02:44.970> just
