we<00:00:02.250> had<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.370> mage<00:00:02.610> mackeage<00:00:03.540> is<00:00:03.600> actually

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
we had a mage mackeage is actually

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.150 
we had a mage mackeage is actually
pretty<00:00:04.049> difficult<00:00:04.259> because<00:00:04.620> on<00:00:04.890> you<00:00:05.040> can

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
pretty difficult because on you can

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.289 
pretty difficult because on you can
freeze<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.460> board<00:00:05.670> but<00:00:05.819> they<00:00:05.879> can<00:00:06.000> still<00:00:06.120> fire

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
freeze the board but they can still fire

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.360 
freeze the board but they can still fire
possible<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:06.960> you<00:00:07.049> and<00:00:07.230> then<00:00:07.859> once<00:00:08.069> you<00:00:08.189> think

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
possible to you and then once you think

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.370 
possible to you and then once you think
you're<00:00:09.000> done<00:00:09.120> with<00:00:09.269> their<00:00:09.570> board<00:00:09.870> they<00:00:10.200> just

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
you're done with their board they just

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.230 
you're done with their board they just
drop<00:00:10.530> in<00:00:10.679> and<00:00:10.740> tonight<00:00:10.980> is<00:00:11.160> super<00:00:11.460> scary<00:00:14.240> we

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
drop in and tonight is super scary we

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.700 
drop in and tonight is super scary we
can<00:00:15.360> afford<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.690> keep<00:00:15.839> two<00:00:16.049> defensive<00:00:16.470> cards

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
can afford to keep two defensive cards

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.670 
can afford to keep two defensive cards
because<00:00:16.800> we<00:00:16.949> have<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.100> arcane<00:00:17.369> intellect<00:00:17.490> so

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
because we have the arcane intellect so

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.220 
because we have the arcane intellect so
and<00:00:19.680> plus<00:00:20.400> some<00:00:20.640> they<00:00:21.630> are<00:00:21.689> pretty<00:00:22.020> hard<00:00:22.170> to

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
and plus some they are pretty hard to

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.630 
and plus some they are pretty hard to
stop<00:00:22.470> me<00:00:22.710> just<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.039> you<00:00:23.070> need<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.340> lot<00:00:23.519> of

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
stop me just so you need a lot of

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.779 
stop me just so you need a lot of
defense<00:00:23.939> but<00:00:25.250> acolyte<00:00:26.250> might<00:00:26.490> be<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.609> little

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
defense but acolyte might be a little

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.070 
defense but acolyte might be a little
bit<00:00:26.970> better<00:00:27.119> than<00:00:27.240> on<00:00:27.359> kintel<00:00:27.570> intellect

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
bit better than on kintel intellect

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.390 
bit better than on kintel intellect
because<00:00:28.260> like<00:00:28.410> forcing<00:00:28.769> them<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.920> frost<00:00:29.160> bolt

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
because like forcing them to frost bolt

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.939 
because like forcing them to frost bolt
or<00:00:29.519> something<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.590> doomsayers<00:00:31.590> probably

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
or something and doomsayers probably

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.740 
or something and doomsayers probably
better<00:00:32.070> than<00:00:32.189> these<00:00:32.369> but<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.880> suppose<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.600> can

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
better than these but I suppose you can

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:42.560 
better than these but I suppose you can
do<00:00:33.899> work<00:00:34.079> you'll<00:00:34.770> see<00:00:40.969> it<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.090> hopefully<00:00:42.210> no

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
do work you'll see it so hopefully no

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.720 
do work you'll see it so hopefully no
mac<00:00:42.750> or<00:00:42.989> /<00:00:43.170> double<00:00:43.860> clockwork<00:00:44.370> nom<00:00:44.579> or

mac or / double clockwork nom or
something<00:00:45.000> like<00:00:45.090> that

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:06.740 

okay<00:00:55.980> just<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.520> one<00:00:57.060> is<00:00:57.239> fine<00:00:57.270> just<00:00:58.079> one<00:00:59.390> okay

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.970 

as<00:01:07.750> we<00:01:07.930> want<00:01:08.110> to<00:01:08.170> Quinn<00:01:08.320> Belcher<00:01:08.620> so<00:01:08.770> you<00:01:08.860> might

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:08.980 
as we want to Quinn Belcher so you might

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:18.649 
as we want to Quinn Belcher so you might
just<00:01:09.010> sheep<00:01:09.370> here<00:01:09.610> if<00:01:09.700> it<00:01:09.820> looks<00:01:10.120> good<00:01:10.560> um

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.080 

so<00:01:19.469> she<00:01:19.530> forces<00:01:19.979> him<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.249> pain<00:01:20.549> or<00:01:20.789> else<00:01:20.939> he

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
so she forces him to pain or else he

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.260 
so she forces him to pain or else he
loses<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> snow<00:01:21.749> chugger<00:01:22.109> to<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> sheep<00:01:23.270> but

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
loses a snow chugger to the sheep but

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.669 
loses a snow chugger to the sheep but
then<00:01:24.390> we<00:01:24.539> have<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.689> ping<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:24.990> or<00:01:25.170> else<00:01:25.259> for<00:01:25.499> just

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
then we have to ping it or else for just

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:28.340 
then we have to ping it or else for just
it's<00:01:26.100> just<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.340> 2-1<00:01:26.700> but<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.509> think<00:01:27.630> that's<00:01:28.109> I

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
it's just a 2-1 but I think that's I

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.230 
it's just a 2-1 but I think that's I
think<00:01:28.380> just<00:01:28.710> making<00:01:29.549> him<00:01:29.700> paying<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.060> room

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
think just making him paying this room

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.359 
think just making him paying this room
is<00:01:30.390> perfect<00:01:30.539> cuz<00:01:30.840> we're<00:01:30.929> going<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.109> curve<00:01:31.369> a

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
is perfect cuz we're going to curve a

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.359 
is perfect cuz we're going to curve a
coin<00:01:32.969> Beltre<00:01:33.450> into<00:01:33.719> belcher<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.289> he's<00:01:35.189> long

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
coin Beltre into belcher and he's long

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.190 
coin Beltre into belcher and he's long
enough<00:01:35.609> and<00:01:35.909> too<00:01:36.090> mad<00:01:36.270> at<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.450> turn<00:01:36.630> ideally

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
enough and too mad at this turn ideally

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:47.320 
enough and too mad at this turn ideally
or<00:01:38.189> lose<00:01:38.549> his<00:01:38.759> something

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.760 

yeah<00:01:47.930> so<00:01:48.050> he's<00:01:48.140> going<00:01:48.230> to<00:01:48.290> paint<00:01:48.470> so<00:01:48.680> we'll

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
yeah so he's going to paint so we'll

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.860 
yeah so he's going to paint so we'll
have<00:01:48.890> a<00:01:48.980> hit<00:01:49.370> 21<00:01:49.850> and<00:01:50.120> it's<00:01:50.270> whatever<00:01:50.630> else

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
have a hit 21 and it's whatever else

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.470 
have a hit 21 and it's whatever else
cost<00:01:51.140> to<00:01:51.560> man<00:01:51.740> and<00:01:51.980> the<00:01:52.640> belter<00:01:52.940> should<00:01:53.180> kill

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
cost to man and the belter should kill

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.320 
cost to man and the belter should kill
both<00:01:53.660> of<00:01:53.720> those<00:01:53.930> and<00:01:54.200> then<00:01:54.980> if<00:01:55.790> he<00:01:55.910> fireballs

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
both of those and then if he fireballs

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.690 
both of those and then if he fireballs
the<00:01:56.480> Belcher<00:01:56.840> then<00:01:57.680> we<00:01:57.830> could<00:01:57.950> just<00:01:58.070> played

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
the Belcher then we could just played

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.890 
the Belcher then we could just played
second<00:01:59.000> Belcher<00:02:03.730> it<00:02:04.730> no<00:02:04.910> I<00:02:04.940> drama<00:02:05.270> is<00:02:05.450> like<00:02:05.630> has

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
second Belcher it no I drama is like has

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.630 
second Belcher it no I drama is like has
to<00:02:06.020> be<00:02:06.080> the<00:02:06.200> weakest<00:02:06.560> thing<00:02:06.620> against<00:02:07.130> Belcher

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
to be the weakest thing against Belcher

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.889 
to be the weakest thing against Belcher
because<00:02:07.820> it<00:02:07.940> actually<00:02:08.090> has<00:02:08.330> to<00:02:08.479> attack<00:02:08.660> and<00:02:08.840> do

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
because it actually has to attack and do

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.200 
because it actually has to attack and do
it<00:02:09.050> you<00:02:09.890> can't<00:02:10.130> like<00:02:10.220> be<00:02:10.460> its<00:02:10.580> annoying<00:02:10.790> self

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
it you can't like be its annoying self

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.450 
it you can't like be its annoying self
and<00:02:11.480> make<00:02:11.780> us<00:02:11.930> hit<00:02:12.140> twice<00:02:14.950> it's<00:02:15.950> win<00:02:16.100> a<00:02:16.130> really

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
and make us hit twice it's win a really

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.800 
and make us hit twice it's win a really
good<00:02:16.580> position<00:02:16.730> this<00:02:17.000> is<00:02:17.150> like<00:02:17.330> amazing

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
good position this is like amazing

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.620 
good position this is like amazing
usually<00:02:18.380> like<00:02:18.560> they<00:02:18.710> have<00:02:18.860> like<00:02:19.300> six<00:02:20.300> minions

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
usually like they have like six minions

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.090 
usually like they have like six minions
on<00:02:20.720> board<00:02:20.960> need<00:02:21.110> blast<00:02:21.350> matches<00:02:21.740> right<00:02:21.860> here

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
on board need blast matches right here

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.280 
on board need blast matches right here
but<00:02:22.850> we're<00:02:23.030> in<00:02:23.090> a<00:02:23.150> really<00:02:23.240> great<00:02:23.690> position<00:02:24.080> I

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
but we're in a really great position I

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.180 
but we're in a really great position I
think<00:02:27.290> if<00:02:27.380> you<00:02:27.440> had<00:02:27.530> last<00:02:27.740> night<00:02:27.950> she<00:02:28.070> would

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
think if you had last night she would

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.440 
think if you had last night she would
have<00:02:28.280> played<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.520> last<00:02:28.730> turn<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:28.970> gone<00:02:29.209> for

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
have played the last turn and gone for

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.510 
have played the last turn and gone for
the<00:02:29.600> one<00:02:30.110> out<00:02:30.230> of<00:02:30.350> three<00:02:30.560> but<00:02:31.250> then<00:02:31.340> he<00:02:31.430> would

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
the one out of three but then he would

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.910 
the one out of three but then he would
have<00:02:31.640> damaged<00:02:31.910> his<00:02:31.970> glass<00:02:32.150> mage<00:02:32.390> so<00:02:32.920> yeah

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
have damaged his glass mage so yeah

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.020 
have damaged his glass mage so yeah
that's<00:02:34.070> how<00:02:34.220> I<00:02:34.250> gets<00:02:34.430> back<00:02:34.580> in<00:02:34.700> this<00:02:34.790> blast

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
that's how I gets back in this blast

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.020 
that's how I gets back in this blast
mage<00:02:35.209> it's<00:02:35.870> this<00:02:36.190> sea<00:02:37.190> glass<00:02:37.310> mages<00:02:37.640> even<00:02:37.910> get

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
mage it's this sea glass mages even get

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.050 
mage it's this sea glass mages even get
enough<00:02:38.209> here<00:02:39.340> you'd<00:02:40.340> have<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.520> hit<00:02:40.700> this<00:02:40.790> four

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
enough here you'd have to hit this four

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.699 
enough here you'd have to hit this four
times<00:02:41.090> and<00:02:41.510> then<00:02:41.630> hit<00:02:41.780> this<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.170> hit<00:02:42.290> this<00:02:42.440> and

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
times and then hit this and hit this and

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:55.929 
times and then hit this and hit this and
you'd<00:02:42.830> solve<00:02:43.100> a<00:02:43.160> week<00:02:43.310> board

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:55.939 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:57.949 

all<00:02:56.939> right<00:02:57.090> well<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:57.209> didn't<00:02:57.420> hit<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.569> all<00:02:57.720> four

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
all right well I didn't hit it all four

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.509 
all right well I didn't hit it all four
times<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:58.470> i<00:02:58.500> got<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.829> tank<00:02:59.010> Oh<00:02:59.129> by<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.489> I

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
times so i got the tank Oh by that I

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:06.470 
times so i got the tank Oh by that I
guess

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.900 

like<00:03:07.480> glass<00:03:07.660> mages<00:03:07.900> are<00:03:08.080> going<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.320> happen

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
like glass mages are going to happen

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.790 
like glass mages are going to happen
they're<00:03:09.910> going<00:03:10.060> to<00:03:10.120> hurt<00:03:10.380> well<00:03:11.380> actually<00:03:11.440> I

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
they're going to hurt well actually I

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.840 
they're going to hurt well actually I
don't<00:03:11.920> know<00:03:12.040> you<00:03:12.130> can<00:03:12.250> hope<00:03:12.370> that<00:03:12.580> they<00:03:12.700> never

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
don't know you can hope that they never

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.760 
don't know you can hope that they never
draw<00:03:13.090> them<00:03:13.300> that<00:03:14.170> happens<00:03:14.440> when<00:03:14.560> I<00:03:14.590> play<00:03:14.740> my

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
draw them that happens when I play my

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.910 
draw them that happens when I play my
mage<00:03:15.040> at<00:03:15.220> least<00:03:17.820> he'll<00:03:18.820> do<00:03:18.970> this<00:03:19.240> and<00:03:19.920> I'll

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
mage at least he'll do this and I'll

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.090 
mage at least he'll do this and I'll
take<00:03:21.070> the<00:03:21.160> shell<00:03:21.340> off<00:03:22.440> just<00:03:23.440> if<00:03:23.560> I<00:03:23.620> ran<00:03:23.770> in<00:03:23.950> for

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
take the shell off just if I ran in for

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:35.300 
take the shell off just if I ran in for
one<00:03:25.560> doesn't<00:03:26.560> matter

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.530 

um

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.569 

so<00:03:39.379> intellectus<00:03:39.860> pry<00:03:40.040> not<00:03:40.099> can<00:03:40.340> do<00:03:40.400> better

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
so intellectus pry not can do better

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:45.819 
so intellectus pry not can do better
than<00:03:40.670> water<00:03:40.939> water<00:03:41.299> elemental<00:03:41.750> pain<00:03:44.620> rag<00:03:45.620> nose

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
than water water elemental pain rag nose

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.569 
than water water elemental pain rag nose
is<00:03:46.010> pretty<00:03:46.310> good<00:03:46.730> considering<00:03:47.689> were<00:03:48.370> not<00:03:49.370> too

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
is pretty good considering were not too

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.789 
is pretty good considering were not too
far<00:03:49.760> behind<00:03:49.959> but<00:03:50.959> we<00:03:51.079> would<00:03:51.290> like<00:03:51.439> a<00:03:51.469> flame

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
far behind but we would like a flame

00:03:51.799 --> 00:04:04.819 
far behind but we would like a flame
strike<00:03:51.980> at<00:03:52.129> some<00:03:52.310> point

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.050 

yeah<00:04:05.829> so<00:04:05.980> we're<00:04:06.069> pretty<00:04:06.159> much<00:04:06.280> forced<00:04:06.579> to<00:04:06.730> well

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
yeah so we're pretty much forced to well

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.390 
yeah so we're pretty much forced to well
maybe<00:04:07.360> we're<00:04:07.510> not<00:04:07.569> for<00:04:07.750> us<00:04:07.810> to<00:04:07.840> ping<00:04:08.400> but

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
maybe we're not for us to ping but

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.850 
maybe we're not for us to ping but
probably<00:04:10.019> and<00:04:11.019> then<00:04:11.110> I<00:04:11.170> best<00:04:11.379> format<00:04:11.650> of<00:04:11.769> play

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
probably and then I best format of play

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.199 
probably and then I best format of play
is<00:04:11.980> gonna<00:04:12.129> be<00:04:12.250> the<00:04:12.340> water<00:04:12.459> mental<00:04:12.849> almost

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
is gonna be the water mental almost

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:19.160 
is gonna be the water mental almost
always

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.800 

um<00:04:19.700> for<00:04:20.700> us<00:04:20.790> know<00:04:20.970> it<00:04:21.090> doesn't<00:04:21.330> doesn't<00:04:21.600> want

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
um for us know it doesn't doesn't want

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.410 
um for us know it doesn't doesn't want
us<00:04:21.870> to<00:04:21.990> develop<00:04:22.200> anything<00:04:22.500> um<00:04:26.390> we're<00:04:27.390> fine

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
us to develop anything um we're fine

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.820 
us to develop anything um we're fine
with<00:04:27.690> him<00:04:27.810> making<00:04:28.140> that<00:04:28.170> attack<00:04:28.590> and

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
with him making that attack and

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.830 
with him making that attack and
hopefully<00:04:29.730> we'll<00:04:29.910> stall<00:04:30.150> by<00:04:30.360> not<00:04:30.570> attacking

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
hopefully we'll stall by not attacking

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.360 
hopefully we'll stall by not attacking
