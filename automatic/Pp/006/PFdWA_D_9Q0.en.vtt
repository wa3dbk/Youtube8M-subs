00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 hello you dear welcome to 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.670
 dell design today I do with you 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.670
 that does not mean baking and baking 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.469
 do not mix and stir together and me 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.570
 think that shows the special about this 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.429
 I never shook it before 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.080
 Of course, I'm pretty, too 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.529
 Excited because I do not know if that 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.510
 really, who is going to be like that? 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.119
 if you know so I know such a 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.680
 I do not like cake and I have the recipe 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.060
 from a spectator because how does he say 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.279
 that tastes delicious and 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.449
 simple and yet worth a video 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.489
 and that's what I have in my head 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.300
 let go and I have to say that 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.570
 vote 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.579
 because we have moody's 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.500
 That's a great thing because I like it 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.360
 like so fast practical things and 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.520
 more practical It's probably not there 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.020
 Just turn all ingredients into one 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.300
 bowl or will be neat 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.520
 shaken and then the cake 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.289
 ready and we'll do it now 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.120
 together and we will follow before we 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.460
 of course I want to start you the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.850
 ingredients just show for the rapid 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.120
 title cake you need a glass 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:09.210
 sour cherries twice paradise cream 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:13.020
 stracciatella three creams twice 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.060
 whipped cream and a cake crumb like it should 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.159
 that everything works and should 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.710
 you put everything in a bowl so 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.570
 do not stir everything, tipping lid 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.759
 on it and then you should vigorously 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.619
 Shake it and that's it 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.259
 And of course I do that now too 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:32.070
 So we start with the glass 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.020
 I already have sour cherries 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.560
 taken and that we need from the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.830
 juice only 150 milliliters in the glass in 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.640
 about 200 milliliters in it 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:53.990
 we just need 150 then the 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:59.420
 Paradise cream twice three times 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:02.890
 cream stiff so I'm really 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:08.929
 looking forward to that can work and 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:13.630
 twice cream so tasty to smell does 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:16.100
 In any case hope that will be something 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.890
 and I hope that too is natural 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.900
 Tastes but I trust you so 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.940
 if my audience says that tastes good 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.190
 Delicious then I think that too 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.990
 and of course I want that too 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.300
 imitating now comes naturally 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.890
 only with lid on it have here 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.220
 my lovely tupper taken together 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:38.410
 Of course, it has to be right too 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.410
 only to be shaken Let's go 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.790
 I do not hear anything anymore 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.850
 I think that's almost okay 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.530
 this crowd should just be up 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.990
 the cake soil can be done 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.990
 And of course I do that now too 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.960
 I mean that she does not even like that 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.370
 bad and I do not know 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:26.800
 how many seconds do I have for this 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:28.630
 used 15 maybe and finished 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.650
 you shake cake and it comes 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.880
 now two hours in the refrigerator 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.200
 so that was it for one now 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.880
 Shake cake comes now in 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.340
