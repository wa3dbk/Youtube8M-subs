00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
of motion design that eBay began a few

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.540 
of motion design that eBay began a few
years<00:00:14.610> ago<00:00:15.030> with<00:00:15.960> this<00:00:16.230> exact<00:00:16.680> car<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.130> cx-5

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
years ago with this exact car the cx-5

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.849 
years ago with this exact car the cx-5
so<00:00:18.060> hasn't<00:00:18.420> changed<00:00:18.840> within<00:00:19.320> these<00:00:19.500> few<00:00:19.800> years

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
so hasn't changed within these few years

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.210 
so hasn't changed within these few years
too<00:00:20.310> much<00:00:20.550> on<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:21.119> appearance<00:00:21.420> but<00:00:22.220> inside

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
too much on the appearance but inside

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.670 
too much on the appearance but inside
the<00:00:23.340> hood<00:00:23.519> they<00:00:23.970> gave<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.529> different<00:00:25.529> engine

like<00:05:20.729> edge<00:05:21.000> to<00:05:21.570> it<00:05:21.750> without<00:05:22.380> raising<00:05:23.130> the

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
like edge to it without raising the

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.600 
like edge to it without raising the
price<00:05:23.550> too<00:05:24.090> much<00:05:24.330> so<00:05:25.229> I<00:05:25.500> would<00:05:25.710> recommend<00:05:26.010> this

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
price too much so I would recommend this

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.910
