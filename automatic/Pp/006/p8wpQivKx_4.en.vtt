and<00:00:12.500> I<00:00:13.340> also<00:00:13.490> got<00:00:13.850> these<00:00:14.029> retro<00:00:14.990> adapter<00:00:15.859> retro

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
and I also got these retro adapter retro

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:27.820 
and I also got these retro adapter retro
USB<00:00:16.820> adapters<00:00:24.460> the<00:00:25.460> USB<00:00:26.000> end<00:00:26.560> what<00:00:27.560> we'll<00:00:27.710> do

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
USB adapters the USB end what we'll do

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.859 
USB adapters the USB end what we'll do
to<00:00:27.950> these<00:00:28.130> is<00:00:28.400> cut<00:00:28.700> it<00:00:28.850> open<00:00:28.970> take<00:00:29.420> the<00:00:29.630> chip

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
to these is cut it open take the chip

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.550 
to these is cut it open take the chip
out<00:00:30.080> and<00:00:30.680> the<00:00:31.010> wires<00:00:31.250> trailing<00:00:31.820> down<00:00:32.560> will

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:33.560 
out and the wires trailing down will

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.580 
out and the wires trailing down will
actually<00:00:33.920> not<00:00:34.100> even<00:00:34.250> use<00:00:34.900> this<00:00:35.900> type<00:00:36.200> of<00:00:36.230> end

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
actually not even use this type of end

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.389 
actually not even use this type of end
I'll<00:00:37.360> cut<00:00:38.360> it<00:00:38.510> up<00:00:38.660> and<00:00:38.930> put<00:00:39.290> an<00:00:39.860> internal

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
I'll cut it up and put an internal

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.270 
I'll cut it up and put an internal
header<00:00:40.780> on<00:00:41.780> it<00:00:42.079> so<00:00:42.320> it<00:00:42.470> can<00:00:42.560> plug<00:00:42.890> right<00:00:43.070> into

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
header on it so it can plug right into

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.520 
header on it so it can plug right into
the<00:00:43.460> motherboard<00:00:43.730> so<00:00:44.239> we'll<00:00:45.140> see<00:00:45.350> how<00:00:45.470> that

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
the motherboard so we'll see how that

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.420 
the motherboard so we'll see how that
goes

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
goes

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.410 
goes
a<00:00:46.489> little<00:00:46.940> bit<00:00:47.059> later<00:00:47.239> so<00:00:47.680> here's<00:00:48.680> the<00:00:48.860> retro

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
a little bit later so here's the retro

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.630 
a little bit later so here's the retro
USB<00:00:50.420> adapter<00:00:51.079> once<00:00:51.649> you<00:00:51.829> take<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:52.219> outside

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
USB adapter once you take the outside

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.869 
USB adapter once you take the outside
shell<00:00:53.000> off<00:00:53.920> what<00:00:54.920> I'll<00:00:55.040> probably<00:00:55.190> do<00:00:55.610> is

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
shell off what I'll probably do is

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.650 
shell off what I'll probably do is
Dremel<00:00:59.559> this<00:01:00.559> connector<00:01:01.210> completely<00:01:02.210> off<00:01:02.360> and

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
Dremel this connector completely off and

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.020 
Dremel this connector completely off and
then<00:01:03.379> hook<00:01:03.680> the<00:01:03.950> original<00:01:04.850> Nintendo

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
then hook the original Nintendo

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:12.099 
then hook the original Nintendo
connector<00:01:05.780> onto<00:01:06.649> here<00:01:07.039> and<00:01:07.450> then<00:01:10.240> strip<00:01:11.240> this

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:12.109 
connector onto here and then strip this

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:14.830 
connector onto here and then strip this
wire<00:01:12.950> completely<00:01:13.700> off<00:01:13.880> of<00:01:14.090> it<00:01:14.240> and<00:01:14.450> put<00:01:14.719> an

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
wire completely off of it and put an

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.499 
wire completely off of it and put an
internal<00:01:15.289> header<00:01:15.499> on<00:01:15.679> so<00:01:16.159> I'll<00:01:16.819> start<00:01:17.299> that

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
internal header on so I'll start that

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.630 
internal header on so I'll start that
process

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.149 

so<00:01:21.640> now<00:01:21.820> I've<00:01:21.939> chopped<00:01:22.299> off<00:01:22.570> that<00:01:22.990> retro<00:01:23.560> USB

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
so now I've chopped off that retro USB

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.969 
so now I've chopped off that retro USB
off<00:01:24.460> of<00:01:24.729> the<00:01:25.240> end<00:01:25.420> of<00:01:25.600> this<00:01:26.430> discard<00:01:27.430> that<00:01:28.979> the

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
off of the end of this discard that the

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.230 
off of the end of this discard that the
next<00:01:30.280> thing<00:01:30.430> I'm<00:01:30.549> going<00:01:30.580> to<00:01:30.759> do<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:32.939> chop<00:01:33.939> this

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
next thing I'm going to do is chop this

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.529 
next thing I'm going to do is chop this
side<00:01:34.509> off<00:01:34.720> I<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:39.340> have<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:39.850> circuit<00:01:40.270> board

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
side off I just have the circuit board

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:46.230 
side off I just have the circuit board
and<00:01:41.229> I<00:01:41.710> can<00:01:41.920> tap<00:01:42.189> that<00:01:42.429> right<00:01:42.759> into<00:01:44.789> these<00:01:45.789> USB

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
and I can tap that right into these USB

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.940 
and I can tap that right into these USB
internal<00:01:46.899> headers<00:01:47.110> that<00:01:47.320> I<00:01:47.409> pulled<00:01:47.649> out<00:01:47.770> of<00:01:47.830> an

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
internal headers that I pulled out of an

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.389 
internal headers that I pulled out of an
old<00:01:48.100> case<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:53.259> I've<00:01:53.409> got<00:01:53.619> everything<00:01:53.709> soldered

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
old case so I've got everything soldered

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.449 
old case so I've got everything soldered
up<00:01:54.520> to<00:01:55.299> the<00:01:55.479> original<00:01:56.080> Nintendo<00:01:56.590> connector

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:57.459 
up to the original Nintendo connector

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:01.199 
up to the original Nintendo connector
and<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.899> USB<00:01:59.170> internal<00:01:59.830> header<00:02:00.009> so<00:02:00.429> hopefully

00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:01.209 
and the USB internal header so hopefully

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:02.460 
and the USB internal header so hopefully
we<00:02:01.270> get<00:02:01.390> to<00:02:01.509> go<00:02:01.630> out<00:02:01.750> I'm<00:02:01.810> going<00:02:01.929> to<00:02:01.990> packages

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
we get to go out I'm going to packages

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.020 
we get to go out I'm going to packages
this<00:02:02.649> up<00:02:02.950> a<00:02:03.159> little<00:02:03.340> bit<00:02:03.520> better<00:02:03.670> with<00:02:03.850> duct

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
this up a little bit better with duct

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.580 
this up a little bit better with duct
tape<00:02:04.270> and<00:02:04.539> see<00:02:05.350> if<00:02:05.440> it<00:02:05.530> works<00:02:06.869> okay<00:02:07.869> I'm<00:02:08.140> wiring

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
tape and see if it works okay I'm wiring

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.289 
tape and see if it works okay I'm wiring
up<00:02:08.910> power<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.119> reset<00:02:10.509> switch<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:12.060> there's<00:02:13.060> the

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
up power and reset switch so there's the

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.949 
up power and reset switch so there's the
reset<00:02:14.489> these<00:02:15.489> two<00:02:15.819> soldering<00:02:16.360> joints<00:02:16.600> right

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
reset these two soldering joints right

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:23.339

here I'm wiring my PC header reset
switch<00:02:24.359> solder<00:02:25.359> on<00:02:25.570> to<00:02:25.600> here<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.170> it<00:02:26.590> should

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
switch solder on to here and it should

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.750 
switch solder on to here and it should
work<00:02:26.980> okay<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:28.660> have<00:02:28.870> that<00:02:29.049> soldered<00:02:29.500> up<00:02:29.760> for

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
work okay I have that soldered up for

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.740 
work okay I have that soldered up for
the<00:02:30.820> power<00:02:31.030> switch<00:02:31.329> I'm<00:02:32.290> gonna<00:02:32.470> go<00:02:32.620> for<00:02:33.750> those

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
the power switch I'm gonna go for those

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.970 
the power switch I'm gonna go for those

okay<00:02:38.980> I've<00:02:39.069> now<00:02:39.250> got<00:02:39.459> my<00:02:39.610> power<00:02:39.910> switch<00:02:40.360> on

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
okay I've now got my power switch on

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.979 
okay I've now got my power switch on
there

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
there

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.080 
there
I<00:02:41.020> made<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.800> leads<00:02:41.980> fairly<00:02:42.430> short<00:02:42.700> because

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
I made the leads fairly short because

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.360 
I made the leads fairly short because
the<00:02:43.690> power<00:02:43.930> switch<00:02:44.140> is<00:02:44.440> right<00:02:44.650> next<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:45.099> the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
the power switch is right next to the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.420 
the power switch is right next to the
motherboard<00:02:45.849> headers<00:02:46.360> so<00:02:46.660> I<00:02:46.980> don't<00:02:47.980> need<00:02:48.160> much

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
motherboard headers so I don't need much

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.380 
motherboard headers so I don't need much
room<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.970> be<00:02:49.270> able<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.569> move<00:02:50.170> those<00:02:50.410> around<00:02:50.739> so

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
room to be able to move those around so

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.320 
room to be able to move those around so
nice<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:52.599> clean<00:02:53.069> for<00:02:54.069> the<00:02:54.220> little<00:02:54.489> rip<00:02:54.670> NES

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
nice and clean for the little rip NES

motherboard<00:03:02.860> provides<00:03:03.310> so<00:03:04.300> I'll<00:03:04.720> be<00:03:04.900> using

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
motherboard provides so I'll be using

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.210 
motherboard provides so I'll be using
this<00:03:05.769> red<00:03:06.220> LED<00:03:06.910> out<00:03:07.269> of<00:03:07.739> just<00:03:08.739> a<00:03:08.890> normal

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
this red LED out of just a normal

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.000 
this red LED out of just a normal
computer<00:03:09.550> it's<00:03:10.480> actually<00:03:10.959> about<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.769> same

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
computer it's actually about the same

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.860 
computer it's actually about the same
size<00:03:12.400> once<00:03:12.819> it's<00:03:13.030> in<00:03:13.209> there<00:03:13.360> and<00:03:15.630> what<00:03:16.630> I'll<00:03:16.750> do

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
size once it's in there and what I'll do

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.500 
size once it's in there and what I'll do
is<00:03:17.049> I'll<00:03:17.200> just<00:03:17.230> snip<00:03:17.799> the<00:03:18.130> leads<00:03:18.850> off<00:03:19.120> of<00:03:19.330> this

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
is I'll just snip the leads off of this

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.030 
is I'll just snip the leads off of this
and<00:03:20.069> shorten<00:03:21.069> this<00:03:21.250> red<00:03:21.489> cable<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.920> then<00:03:23.920> I'll

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
and shorten this red cable and then I'll

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.890 
and shorten this red cable and then I'll
be<00:03:24.160> good<00:03:24.280> to<00:03:24.430> go<00:03:24.580> as<00:03:24.730> far<00:03:24.910> as<00:03:25.060> a<00:03:25.090> power<00:03:25.620> light<00:03:27.900> ok

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
be good to go as far as a power light ok

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.020 
be good to go as far as a power light ok
I've<00:03:28.989> shortened<00:03:29.470> my<00:03:29.560> LED<00:03:30.130> and<00:03:32.670> what<00:03:33.670> you<00:03:33.849> can

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
I've shortened my LED and what you can

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.120 
I've shortened my LED and what you can
do<00:03:34.209> is<00:03:34.390> just<00:03:35.349> push<00:03:35.709> it<00:03:35.890> up<00:03:37.650> right<00:03:38.650> in<00:03:38.799> place

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
do is just push it up right in place

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.930 
do is just push it up right in place
like<00:03:39.370> that<00:03:39.400> and<00:03:40.859> I'll<00:03:41.859> probably<00:03:42.190> put<00:03:42.519> a<00:03:42.579> little

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
like that and I'll probably put a little

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.580 
like that and I'll probably put a little
bit<00:03:43.060> of<00:03:43.180> hot<00:03:43.299> glue<00:03:43.510> over<00:03:43.780> that<00:03:43.930> just<00:03:44.230> hold<00:03:44.410> it

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
bit of hot glue over that just hold it

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:51.539 
bit of hot glue over that just hold it
down<00:03:45.870> okay<00:03:46.870> so<00:03:47.500> I've<00:03:48.100> got<00:03:48.160> it<00:03:48.609> wired<00:03:48.850> up<00:03:50.549> nice

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
down okay so I've got it wired up nice

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.590 
down okay so I've got it wired up nice
and<00:03:51.820> neat

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.660

what you need to do you've got this
little<00:04:24.419> bronze<00:04:25.419> looking<00:04:25.990> clip<00:04:26.760> just<00:04:27.760> yank

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
little bronze looking clip just yank

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.810 
little bronze looking clip just yank
that<00:04:28.660> clip<00:04:28.960> out<00:04:29.139> and<00:04:29.410> it<00:04:29.889> will<00:04:30.010> stop<00:04:30.340> clicking

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
that clip out and it will stop clicking

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.969 
that clip out and it will stop clicking
into<00:04:31.120> place<00:04:31.389> and<00:04:31.690> it<00:04:31.870> should<00:04:31.900> just<00:04:32.110> work<00:04:32.440> as<00:04:32.919> a

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
into place and it should just work as a

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:39.529 
into place and it should just work as a
normal<00:04:33.430> power<00:04:33.610> button<00:04:36.300> so<00:04:37.300> I've<00:04:37.600> got<00:04:37.870> the

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
normal power button so I've got the

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.090 
normal power button so I've got the
front<00:04:40.539> port<00:04:40.780> squared<00:04:41.139> away<00:04:41.260> they're<00:04:41.979> all

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
front port squared away they're all

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.510 
front port squared away they're all
working<00:04:43.289> I've<00:04:44.289> got<00:04:44.470> the<00:04:44.560> hard<00:04:44.800> drive<00:04:45.039> in<00:04:45.220> here

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
working I've got the hard drive in here

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.180 
working I've got the hard drive in here
wasn't<00:04:46.330> what<00:04:46.810> I<00:04:46.840> wanted<00:04:47.080> up<00:04:47.530> to<00:04:47.680> here<00:04:47.919> in<00:04:48.010> this

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
wasn't what I wanted up to here in this

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.920 
wasn't what I wanted up to here in this
little<00:04:49.380> micro

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
little micro

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.879 
little micro
her<00:04:51.740> micro<00:04:52.639> SATA<00:04:53.030> port<00:04:53.479> but<00:04:54.380> that<00:04:54.500> didn't<00:04:54.740> work

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
her micro SATA port but that didn't work

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.040 
her micro SATA port but that didn't work
out<00:04:55.070> so<00:04:55.310> I<00:04:55.340> had<00:04:55.520> to<00:04:55.639> use<00:04:55.790> a<00:04:55.820> conventional<00:04:56.240> SSD

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
out so I had to use a conventional SSD

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.469 
out so I had to use a conventional SSD
here<00:04:59.650> but<00:05:00.650> I<00:05:00.979> think<00:05:01.070> I've<00:05:01.550> got<00:05:01.820> everything<00:05:02.030> in

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 
here but I think I've got everything in

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:04.800 
here but I think I've got everything in
here

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
here

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.800 
here
and<00:05:06.340> pretty<00:05:07.340> soon<00:05:07.460> we'll<00:05:08.000> be<00:05:08.030> able<00:05:08.180> to<00:05:08.419> fire<00:05:08.660> it

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
and pretty soon we'll be able to fire it

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.800 
and pretty soon we'll be able to fire it
up<00:05:08.930> and<00:05:09.139> see<00:05:09.229> if<00:05:09.710> I<00:05:09.889> can<00:05:13.330> get<00:05:14.330> things<00:05:14.600> running

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
up and see if I can get things running

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:22.990 
up and see if I can get things running
as<00:05:15.110> far<00:05:15.320> as<00:05:15.470> OS<00:05:16.250> and<00:05:16.520> software<00:05:17.030> goes<00:05:22.000> last

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
as far as OS and software goes last

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.310 
as far as OS and software goes last
thing<00:05:23.180> I<00:05:23.270> need<00:05:23.449> to<00:05:23.539> do<00:05:23.720> is<00:05:25.419> get<00:05:26.419> this<00:05:26.600> SATA<00:05:26.930> port

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
thing I need to do is get this SATA port

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.370 
thing I need to do is get this SATA port
on<00:05:28.479> hopefully<00:05:29.479> I've<00:05:29.600> got<00:05:29.750> enough<00:05:30.020> clearance

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
on hopefully I've got enough clearance

00:05:30.380 --> 00:06:34.530 
on hopefully I've got enough clearance
here<00:05:30.800> it<00:05:30.919> looks<00:05:31.070> like<00:05:31.160> I<00:05:31.370> do

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:34.540 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.610 

okay<00:06:36.430> that<00:06:37.660> looks<00:06:38.660> like<00:06:38.810> it<00:06:38.990> completes<00:06:39.440> the

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
okay that looks like it completes the

00:06:39.620 --> 00:07:12.950 
okay that looks like it completes the
hardware<00:06:41.320> so<00:06:42.320> I'm<00:06:42.470> gonna<00:06:42.590> pop<00:06:43.100> the<00:06:43.370> top<00:06:43.640> on

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.020
