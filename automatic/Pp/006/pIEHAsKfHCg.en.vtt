 Calm down here to break the band attack. 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.510
 boot written here 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.940
 A little while ago, you know that one of the series 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.110
 most famous of the channel was attacked in the 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.269
 server, right? 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.940

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:47.430
 updated yesterday several pakour zes 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.589
 different here then I want to enter through 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.629
 at least 11 to take a look 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:54.720
 just to see if you guys wanna talk and 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.809
 If you already dialed, you called 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.699
 different then let's play a little game 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.010
 just to see what he looks like he was not 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.409
 wanting to start the series and such 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.060
 but I'll see you if you want 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.250
 that this series comes back is because each one 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.830
 People ache series d pakour and will come back 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.930
 a series of agreements and I decided to 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.500
 ask you if you want 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.150
 this series can go on like a frog 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.100
 can it come out as video cakes or some 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.370
 It 's not like this series here anymore. 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.080
 It was very very was it's because 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.900
 carrazzoni serious because type in each 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.390
 video was a 12-minute video but 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.790
 more objective of the video we pass the 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.610
 video project type of first pass 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.400
 a map is by video had not in part 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.350
 by the super difficult we lived 10 15 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.050
 minutes to advance others I passed 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.060
 for no minute two minutes already zeroed 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.360
 hence the father then makes a larger video such 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.610
 The kind I like to fucking do. 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.130
 series is so much that it was my series with 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.440
 The fucking episode is not popular here. 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.140
 Like this map I never played a new map. 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.780
 It's a write me and it warned me that it was 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.659
 having updated and I decided to see if 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.830
 It was true, if you really had 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.540
 updated, oh my god I can not 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.599
 step in the water where you are going now 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.340
 here and here, let's see if it's over 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:16.890
 It does not end, there's nothing else that 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:20.549

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.290
 from the beginning look what is legal but 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.920
 I do not know if you want to abandon your 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.769

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.410

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.280
