 no 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.480
 in oral surgery and in particular 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.250
 world in implantology a practice 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.990
 Incorrect septic can seriously 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.119
 put regeneration at risk 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.490
 tissue and subsequent bone 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.679
 system integration an assistant 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.960
 adequately protected proceeds to 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:32.980
 surface cleaning and disinfection 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.980
 with suitable products 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.540
 the different parts of the unit come 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.800
 coated with disposable protections ad 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:52.350
 barrier effect is thus possible 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.580
 drastically reduce the risk of 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.140
 several cross-infection studies have 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.480
 proved that the risk of 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.780
 contamination is particularly high 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.670
 during surgery for 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.860
 reduce these risks and a good rule a 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.570
 to establish strict protocols in the 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.290
 which operating procedures are adopted 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.290
 Asian 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.990
 at the end of this phase proceed to 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.160
 patient preparation 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.230
 the assistant after wearing a 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.880
 new pair of gloves check that the 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.040
 gown packaging is not 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.660
 damaged and that the label shows 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.660
 a valid expiration date 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.890
 the goal is to isolate the field 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.520
 operative from possible contamination 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.520
 external 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.190
 shoe covers allow for storage 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.930
 the bacterial load in the environment 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.840
 surgical the assistant proceeds to 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.670
 perioral tissue disinfection 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.050
 by scrubbing with a 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.050
 sterile saline solution 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.510
 the movements will always be the faces from 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.510
 lips to the outside 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.730
 the subsequent use of the oil afterwards 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.280
 Gel bin allows disinfection 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.560
 the skin without irritating not avoiding things 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.340
 to pay attention to the surface is the object 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.340
 of surgery
