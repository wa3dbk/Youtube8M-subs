00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:39.530 
like here's the first part of the idea
let<00:00:26.970> me<00:00:27.029> turn<00:00:27.180> up<00:00:33.140> slope<00:00:35.809> off<00:00:38.420> and<00:00:39.420> all

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
let me turn up slope off and all

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:49.790 
let me turn up slope off and all
chromatics<00:00:47.059> the<00:00:48.059> nice<00:00:48.239> part<00:00:48.539> shifts<00:00:49.350> down<00:00:49.500> to

chromatics the nice part shifts down to

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.430 
chromatics the nice part shifts down to
the<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:51.230> Aeolian<00:00:52.340> position<00:00:53.340> on<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.910> 5th<00:00:54.120> fret

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
the a Aeolian position on the 5th fret

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:02.900 
the a Aeolian position on the 5th fret
and<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.559> goes<00:00:57.620> f<00:00:58.620> major<00:00:59.300> triad<00:01:00.300> basically<00:01:01.910> then

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
and it goes f major triad basically then

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.450 
and it goes f major triad basically then
you<00:01:03.120> when<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.690> play<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.320> keep<00:01:05.280> this

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
you when you play that you keep this

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.770 
you when you play that you keep this
finger<00:01:05.760> down<00:01:06.260> slide<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.439> down<00:01:07.590> one<00:01:08.130> fret<00:01:08.780> and

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
finger down slide it down one fret and

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.170 
it's like f major triad back down a
minor<00:01:19.350> triad<00:01:20.420> so<00:01:21.420> fast<00:01:21.750> it's<00:01:21.960> like<00:01:22.020> okay<00:01:23.180> like

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
minor triad so fast it's like okay like

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.850 
minor triad so fast it's like okay like
that's<00:01:24.600> that's<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.170> jazzy<00:01:25.409> part<00:01:25.710> right<00:01:25.830> there

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
that's that's a jazzy part right there

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.940 
that's that's a jazzy part right there
then<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.250> goes<00:01:26.400> back<00:01:26.759> into<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.630> blues<00:01:28.350> part<00:01:28.710> in

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
then it goes back into a blues part in

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:38.300 
then it goes back into a blues part in
the<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:30.140> blues<00:01:31.140> scale<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:32.280> it's<00:01:32.400> like<00:01:37.310> so

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
the a blues scale and it's like so

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:49.760
