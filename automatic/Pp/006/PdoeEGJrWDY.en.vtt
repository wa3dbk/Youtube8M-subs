00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
grind kingpins on this board and my new

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.779 
grind kingpins on this board and my new
we<00:00:57.539> can<00:00:57.690> get<00:00:57.809> our<00:00:57.930> grinds<00:00:58.199> bushings<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:59.309> those

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
we can get our grinds bushings so those

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.340 
we can get our grinds bushings so those
are<00:00:59.879> those<00:01:00.090> will<00:01:00.300> be<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.510> dollar<00:01:00.750> each<00:01:00.989> and

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
you look down there it's kind of hard to

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.289 
you look down there it's kind of hard to
see<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.610> but<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.750> there<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:38.299> they're

tweak the bushing earth via oh my god we
have<00:01:57.060> few<00:01:57.509> bow<00:01:57.719> compress<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.710> bushing<00:01:59.070> like

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
have few bow compress the bushing like

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.580 
have few bow compress the bushing like
that<00:02:00.000> it's<00:02:00.450> like<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.960> always<00:02:01.170> goes<00:02:01.469> back

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590
