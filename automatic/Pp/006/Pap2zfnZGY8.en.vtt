00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:08.540
 The leader Vegalta will push away, but will Mr. Fredge reverse 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.540
 The stage is Hiroshima Big Arch 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:18.110
 To Ishikawa in the first half of 3/13 Fletcher six games the first time in the starting lineup is today 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:20.360
 Connect Clear Ball with Aoyama Shimizu 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:25.900
 Takaba's 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.900
 I aimed at the goal from quick pass work, but it does not go one step further 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.840
 Treasure look at 18-minute meeting peeling was the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.810
 Gann 4 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.800
 Pass through to Akagi 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.800
 This is not a step either 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:52.160
 It will return to the center when it is Sato from Sanfrece Takahata for 23 minutes, but receive a shot 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.160
 Hmm 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.670
 The first half wraps with 0 to 0 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.960
 3 minutes in the second half 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:11.610
 Sanfretce Kazuyuki Morizaki's best middleman stated balance of the game 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.680
 I'm Hiroshima teacher 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:20.640
 Well it was from this haste but there was a space open for learning a little 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.010
 It seems like a lucky goal, even if you say it all at once, but it was that wonderful haste 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.420
 I think 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:33.080
 The course was changed when I hit the high of such upper book just like this 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.080
 Ms. Fletcher , who scored one goal, scored 11 minutes into a corner kick from Moriwaki 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:48.229
 If it is a loss, it will be Vegulta 21 minutes of the first place fall 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.229
 Jai 4 for a free kick chance 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.920
 Slightly received 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:06.960
 It's a little bit, but it's my eyes . The ball is a little high. 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:09.569
 Each So Ota that offensive only is Hey Vegalta part that could not be meat follows 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.670
 The last is red fox 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:18.640
 The goal in 25 minutes with a goal in red leaned to a tie This was a center-like attack That vertical 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.850
 Through pass and this cross is 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.810
 Among the extent that you You're No. that come with one touch 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:29.569
 One touch of the shoot I this sounds great goal seems to Sendai over 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:33.100
 I will catch up with this Sendai tie which really made use of one chance 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.410
 I want 3 points at home Mr. Fredge 33 minutes 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.020
 Shimizu is 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.170
 cross 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:42.280
 Reverse side stone cover 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.280
 The last is Takamine 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:51.200
 Keeper Hayashi saves this but it is a difficult place to fit here 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.120
 I think that I hit down Takatsuki one touch well 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:03:01.220
 Isn't it a goal that I put on obstinately 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.220
 The 3rd pitch , scored by Takago's goal, returned to the top for the first time in 3 games 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.550
 that 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:11.430
 Asia is followed by many customers 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.069
 I would like to visit the stadium and do something in town 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:18.159
 I wanted to win 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:18.159
 I thought I couldn't win if I didn't run in such an important game 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.250
 From everyone 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:26.270
 I want to run and run more than the other 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.090
 In such an important game 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:36.140
 I think that it is very big to have decided the call and won 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.140
 In addition, I think that I want to do my best to teach as it is in the top position
