00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.550

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.070

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.219
 Well, that is what the situation is like 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.940

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.729
 fees for some reason he made up for agility 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.500
 I did not understand we had a very good 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.200

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.270

 gorgeous yes i can say a little 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.269
 At the beginning of the game, of course, I thought that 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:20.150
 now it's already some when I 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:21.080
 I saw this bill, but the ambassador watched it 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:29.870
 look at the end 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:32.239
 and then I saw a great look at 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:38.269

 lenchik 24 minutes in principle for 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.540
 medals very well i started collecting 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:56.540
 Ngo's apples 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.700
 passenger climbs tanks just nothing 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.730

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.680
 you are good all the same all the same and beat 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.079
 I 'm looking for vadim just for everything 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.879
 and here's the truth is that I donâ€™t 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:14.189
 pleased it blue in our team he 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:15.840
 but he played well the essence of his role that 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:18.540
 he did in general and you will survive 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.819
 finally mixes that are just already 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.310
 for deciding because our faces like a piece 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:27.000
 we did he say you played by 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.099
 ruler soon because here is xusar 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.650
 started at first very well initiate 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.959
 and then thanks to him 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.000
 they first came off very hard by 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.620
 pigeons on ekspe well thanks later 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.560
 our vidos we perefarmit and them 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.930
 levels by 10 and yet with this margin 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.329
 although they had the first such gap Goldie 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.220
 you still won in a pair 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.379
 batches and then it was necessary not to stop 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.120
 in fact the only problem here 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.719
 one poke see just flies by 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.780
 minus badly on telly effectively our 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:59.609
 the problem is that we sometimes 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.819
 diverged someone I went to kill roshan 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:05.430
 and here we somehow could not do everything 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:08.609
 still together but still then I 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.010

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:13.349

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:25.270
