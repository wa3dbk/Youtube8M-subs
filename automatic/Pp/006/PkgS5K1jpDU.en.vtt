00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.860
 ace and modern art 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.990
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.000
 video then she's going to be great 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.340
 important to me finally for my channel 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.289
 knife then is what I saw 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.300
 excuse me forgive if I speak like that 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.130
 it's simply because there is 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.490
 quite late at home there are people who 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.099
 sleep 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.630
 so I present you my shop then there 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.369
 you see on the screen it's going a little bit of 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.620
 roles therefore avoids speech first 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.410
 on average warfare 2 and you'll see 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.780
 the acts that I propose then there is 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.820
 spent on black ops years so I there is 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.690
 all the call of duty that I finally do 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.879
 that I ac and I will explain to you how 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.260
 we proceed at the end of the video so this 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.600
 is not free but it's not 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.340
 not expensive either so you see this 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.719
 which is displayed on the screen that will ask me 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.489
 questions since I was doing 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.140
 really everything to file I think well that 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.850
 it's me you see every time I 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.160
 change my name my name is this part 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.830
 lobby so for the curious I got 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.180
 bought a ps3 jailbreak in aix it's 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.030
 to say that I can launch toules and 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.400
 it's simple for me so duflot 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.210
 bush does pretty quickly in two days 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.950
 about we will say maximum and then so 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.630
 here is what I'm doing 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.600
 So just two stars finally spend 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.030
 call of duty is to two postal stars and 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.100
 the big blow in payments are 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.270
 by Facebook 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.579
 then you send me a message on 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.130
 hac you want then you tell me 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.259
 the call of duty and after that I'll go 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.000
 send the number to call and you will 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.920
 remember you will give me both 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.009
 star codes go so that goes fast and 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.320
 it's not very expensive around 0.50 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.689
 and then you will give me your account 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.520
 so I take the 30 inevitably and after 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.079
 I 'll validate you finally if you 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.610
 I have a big shower I would say 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.890
 hurry to take me for a con delevoye 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.180
 brigades and if not I would say ok 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.439

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.729
 I'll let you know when this is 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.890
 that I do when I finish them and 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.930
 So this is my facebook 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.130

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.420

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.370
 really pleasure and it encourages me to 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.030
 do more and more mac in the process 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.320
 artix v12 engine will be coming out soon so 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.490
 now it's not a surprise I 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.110
 rather, create it during the holidays 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.880
