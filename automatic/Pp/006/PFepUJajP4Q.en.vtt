00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.170 
not sure if all episodes are like that I
would<00:04:32.050> assume<00:04:32.290> definitely<00:04:32.980> not<00:04:33.190> it<00:04:33.490> probably

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
would assume definitely not it probably

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.660 
would assume definitely not it probably
is<00:04:34.390> season<00:04:34.870> season<00:04:35.440> like<00:04:35.770> most<00:04:36.010> series<00:04:36.460> these

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
is season season like most series these

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.900 
is season season like most series these
days<00:04:37.890> but<00:04:38.890> if<00:04:38.980> you're<00:04:39.100> gonna<00:04:39.190> watch<00:04:39.430> Doctor
