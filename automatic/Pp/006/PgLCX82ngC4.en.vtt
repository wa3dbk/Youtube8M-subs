against the wall just because the way
this<00:01:05.519> game<00:01:05.729> works<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:06.330> when<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.470> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
this game works is when you have the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.710 
this game works is when you have the
ball<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.979> become<00:01:08.280> vulnerable<00:01:08.720> meaning

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
ball you become vulnerable meaning

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.500 
ball you become vulnerable meaning
people<00:01:10.350> can<00:01:10.740> team<00:01:11.100> up<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.610> pummel<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.479> a

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
people can team up on you pummel you a

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.380 
people can team up on you pummel you a
couple<00:01:12.930> times<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.530> then<00:01:13.860> you'll<00:01:14.040> die<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:15.360> I

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
couple times and then you'll die like I

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.230 
couple times and then you'll die like I
think<00:01:15.659> it's<00:01:15.780> 3<00:01:15.990> pummels<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.619> then<00:01:17.119> then<00:01:18.119> you

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
think it's 3 pummels and then then you

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.969 
think it's 3 pummels and then then you
drop<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.600> ball<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.960> you're<00:01:19.080> dead<00:01:19.409> then<00:01:19.890> you

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
drop the ball and you're dead then you

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.260 
drop the ball and you're dead then you
respond<00:01:20.400> then<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.759> can<00:01:20.850> try<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.030> get<00:01:21.150> back

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
respond then you can try to get back

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.870 
respond then you can try to get back
into<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.570> but<00:01:22.560> there's<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.009> much<00:01:23.159> strategy<00:01:23.430> and

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
into it but there's so much strategy and

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.600
