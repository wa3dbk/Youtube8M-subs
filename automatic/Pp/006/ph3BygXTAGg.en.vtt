one easily goes to be key to the trailer

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.980 
one easily goes to be key to the trailer
ball<00:01:37.670> to<00:01:38.670> get<00:01:38.790> there<00:01:39.030> quickly<00:01:39.330> turns<00:01:39.750> its

ball to get there quickly turns its

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.600 
ball to get there quickly turns its
temperature<00:01:40.350> there<00:01:40.560> awaiting<00:01:40.830> Boyd<00:01:41.220> trucks

temperature there awaiting Boyd trucks

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.460 
temperature there awaiting Boyd trucks
and<00:01:42.119> be<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.330> first<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.720> pull<00:01:42.960> their<00:01:43.110> creator

and be the first to pull their creator

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:59.890 
and be the first to pull their creator
across<00:01:43.830> the<00:01:44.040> finish<00:01:44.220> line

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.110 

I<00:02:00.010> think<00:02:01.010> toby<00:02:01.400> is<00:02:01.430> a<00:02:01.700> back-up<00:02:02.120> plan<00:02:02.180> they're

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
I think toby is a back-up plan they're

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.809 
I think toby is a back-up plan they're
pretty<00:02:05.120> erratically

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.589 

looks<00:02:09.329> like<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.569> company<00:02:10.349> bracelet<00:02:10.860> by<00:02:11.069> Afghan

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.759 

so<00:02:15.599> this<00:02:15.689> is<00:02:15.870> getting<00:02:16.140> awfully<00:02:16.290> frustrating

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
so this is getting awfully frustrating

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:22.300 
so this is getting awfully frustrating
time<00:02:17.340> this

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:52.990 

so<00:02:23.270> he's<00:02:23.660> headed<00:02:23.990> for<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.290> finish<00:02:24.410> line

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.410

I may be bad everything seems to be

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.320 
I may be bad everything seems to be
