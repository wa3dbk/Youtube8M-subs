00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
sideline the man is going to basically

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.540

switch the halfback angle rod is going

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.639 
switch the halfback angle rod is going
to<00:00:35.610> cause<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> mad<00:00:36.149> switch<00:00:36.510> as<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.350> can<00:00:37.440> see

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
to cause a mad switch as you can see

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.360 
to cause a mad switch as you can see
here<00:00:38.600> 53<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.840> initially<00:00:40.500> guarding<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.160> tight

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
here 53 is initially guarding the tight

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.400 
here 53 is initially guarding the tight
end<00:00:41.579> but<00:00:41.760> then<00:00:41.940> he<00:00:42.030> switches<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.960> he<00:00:43.170> takes

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
end but then he switches and he takes

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.350 
end but then he switches and he takes
the<00:00:43.530> running<00:00:43.829> back<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.820> leaves<00:00:45.090> the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
the running back and that leaves the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.950 
the running back and that leaves the
tight<00:00:45.570> end<00:00:45.780> wide<00:00:46.170> open<00:00:46.200> because<00:00:47.270> 94<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.539> unable

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
to cover that much ground and you know

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.319 
to cover that much ground and you know
there's<00:00:52.320> just<00:00:52.410> too<00:00:52.710> much<00:00:52.829> room<00:00:53.100> there<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.850> get

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
there's just too much room there to get

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.860 
there's just too much room there to get
a<00:00:54.390> nice<00:00:54.629> easy<00:00:54.840> completion<00:00:55.500> our<00:00:56.219> next<00:00:56.520> slide

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
right a little bit precision down right

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.020 
right a little bit precision down right
you<00:01:10.619> can<00:01:10.799> basically<00:01:10.979> get<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.610> passed<00:01:11.850> in
