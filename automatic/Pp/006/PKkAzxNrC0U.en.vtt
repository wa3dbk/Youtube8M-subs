not on top of it so all in all I did
find<00:03:09.690> it<00:03:09.780> very<00:03:09.960> frustrating<00:03:10.110> but<00:03:11.040> on<00:03:11.190> the

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
find it very frustrating but on the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.770 
find it very frustrating but on the
other<00:03:11.370> end<00:03:11.580> you<00:03:11.700> can<00:03:11.760> get<00:03:12.090> some<00:03:12.300> really<00:03:12.510> nice

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
other end you can get some really nice

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.350 
other end you can get some really nice
and<00:03:13.140> exciting<00:03:13.440> kills<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.940> main<00:03:15.090> thing

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
and exciting kills the main thing

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.670 
and exciting kills the main thing
stopping<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:15.840> from<00:03:15.930> getting<00:03:16.110> nice<00:03:16.380> kill

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
stopping you from getting nice kill

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.320 
stopping you from getting nice kill
things<00:03:16.860> with<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.220> other<00:03:17.370> weapons<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:18.000> the

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
things with the other weapons is the

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.820 
things with the other weapons is the
fact<00:03:18.690> that<00:03:18.720> you've<00:03:18.900> got<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:19.140> stop<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:19.530> reload

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
fact that you've got to stop and reload

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.550 
fact that you've got to stop and reload
after<00:03:20.220> one<00:03:20.370> or<00:03:20.400> two<00:03:20.550> kills<00:03:21.030> with<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:21.930> m24<00:03:22.410> to

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
after one or two kills with the m24 to

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.410 
after one or two kills with the m24 to
Bea's<00:03:22.740> 200<00:03:23.550> rounds<00:03:23.730> with<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.180> help<00:03:24.330> of

gets<00:03:28.320> in<00:03:28.470> your<00:03:28.620> way<00:03:28.680> so<00:03:29.100> what<00:03:30.090> let's<00:03:30.270> move<00:03:30.390> on

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
gets in your way so what let's move on

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.270 
gets in your way so what let's move on
and<00:03:30.660> take<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:30.870> look<00:03:30.960> at<00:03:31.140> my<00:03:31.260> recommendations<00:03:32.040> of

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
ice on this weapon up too bad but you

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.290 
ice on this weapon up too bad but you
get<00:03:37.770> one<00:03:37.890> of<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.010> nice<00:03:38.190> optics<00:03:38.670> as<00:03:39.030> one<00:03:39.180> of<00:03:39.210> the

get one of the nice optics as one of the

get one of the nice optics as one of the

first attachment and locks after 10

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.220 
first attachment and locks after 10
kills<00:03:42.120> you<00:03:42.300> get<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.480> holographic<00:03:42.840> sight

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
kills you get the holographic sight

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.740 
kills you get the holographic sight
which<00:03:43.530> is<00:03:43.560> a<00:03:43.710> nice<00:03:43.920> 1.5<00:03:44.730> magnification<00:03:45.540> gun

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
which is a nice 1.5 magnification gun

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.440 
which is a nice 1.5 magnification gun
site<00:03:46.020> with<00:03:46.620> a<00:03:46.680> crosshair<00:03:47.160> reticle<00:03:47.670> I'm

site with a crosshair reticle I'm

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.580 
site with a crosshair reticle I'm
usually<00:03:48.600> a<00:03:48.810> fan<00:03:49.080> of<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.320> higher

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.490 
usually a fan of the higher

magnification scopes like the yet 3.5 x
which<00:03:52.770> is<00:03:52.800> actually<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.340> first<00:03:53.580> optical<00:03:53.970> yet

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
which is actually the first optical yet

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.390 
which is actually the first optical yet
or<00:03:54.990> any<00:03:55.230> of<00:03:55.350> the<00:03:55.440> higher<00:03:55.620> power<00:03:55.890> scopes<00:03:56.280> like

or any of the higher power scopes like
the<00:03:56.580> ACOG<00:03:56.970> but<00:03:57.600> once<00:03:57.750> you<00:03:57.870> do<00:03:57.990> played<00:03:58.230> on<00:03:58.440> the

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
the ACOG but once you do played on the

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.990 
the ACOG but once you do played on the
bipod<00:03:58.950> you<00:03:59.070> can<00:03:59.190> actually<00:03:59.310> get<00:03:59.580> away<00:03:59.640> with

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
bipod you can actually get away with

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.610 
bipod you can actually get away with
these<00:04:00.150> scopes<00:04:00.450> and<00:04:00.720> put<00:04:00.870> them<00:04:00.990> to<00:04:01.110> use<00:04:01.230> to<00:04:01.260> take

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
these scopes and put them to use to take

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.190 
these scopes and put them to use to take
out<00:04:01.800> those<00:04:01.950> snipers<00:04:02.490> at<00:04:02.610> long-range<00:04:03.200> usually

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
out those snipers at long-range usually

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.050 
out those snipers at long-range usually
the<00:04:04.350> recall<00:04:04.680> is<00:04:04.770> too<00:04:04.920> high<00:04:05.160> with<00:04:05.400> weapons<00:04:05.790> to

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
the recall is too high with weapons to

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.930 
the recall is too high with weapons to
use<00:04:06.270> these<00:04:06.840> high<00:04:07.080> optic<00:04:07.560> scopes<00:04:07.950> but<00:04:08.670> because

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
use these high optic scopes but because

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.730 
use these high optic scopes but because
the<00:04:09.030> recoils<00:04:09.420> cut<00:04:09.750> down<00:04:09.960> that<00:04:10.140> much<00:04:10.380> with<00:04:10.620> the

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
the recoils cut down that much with the

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.320 
the recoils cut down that much with the
bipod<00:04:11.160> this<00:04:11.490> suddenly<00:04:11.760> become<00:04:11.940> more

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
bipod this suddenly become more

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.630 
bipod this suddenly become more

the holographic side just allows us to

get both those long range kills and

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.260 
get both those long range kills and
