00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.940 
opinions opinions and even just family
members<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.980> people<00:02:34.190> in<00:02:34.400> our<00:02:34.489> lives<00:02:34.670> who<00:02:35.950> will

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
members and people in our lives who will

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.110 
members and people in our lives who will
probably<00:02:37.070> come<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:37.489> us<00:02:37.610> asking<00:02:37.790> these

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
probably come to us asking these

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.490 
probably come to us asking these
questions<00:02:38.959> so<00:02:39.500> I<00:02:39.530> think<00:02:39.739> that<00:02:39.950> that<00:02:41.350> we<00:02:42.350> have<00:02:42.470> a

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
questions so I think that that we have a

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.780 
questions so I think that that we have a
responsibility<00:02:42.650> to<00:02:44.350> inform<00:02:45.350> ourselves<00:02:45.440> and<00:02:46.070> I

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
responsibility to inform ourselves and I

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.670 
responsibility to inform ourselves and I
think<00:02:46.970> this<00:02:47.090> project<00:02:47.720> is<00:02:48.049> one<00:02:48.260> step<00:02:48.470> in<00:02:48.530> that

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
think this project is one step in that

00:02:48.680 --> 00:03:38.510 
think this project is one step in that
direction<00:02:48.799> but<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:49.820> hope<00:02:49.970> that<00:02:50.150> it<00:02:50.269> continues

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:46.120 

as<00:03:39.360> a<00:03:39.420> gold<00:03:40.050> throne<00:03:40.950> in<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.400> grass

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:54.309 

searching<00:03:47.130> for<00:03:47.310> souls<00:03:47.670> in<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.270> city

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:02.910 

she<00:03:54.590> got<00:03:54.890> the<00:03:54.920> burn<00:03:55.780> like<00:03:56.780> Rios<00:03:59.379> been<00:04:00.379> in<00:04:00.709> vain

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
she got the burn like Rios been in vain

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.599 
she got the burn like Rios been in vain
and<00:04:03.920> Kathleen

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:17.729 

coming<00:04:09.609> down

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.340 

I

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.940 

so

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.950
