00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.550
 since ios 7 beta 1 has apple neat 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.429
 a performance screw turned 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.019
 currently the beta is 5 votes 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.179
 it is rumored only a beta 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.060
 version before apple the final 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.560
 version release much should therefore be 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.510
 on the system no longer change 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.730
 time over seven times the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:29.910
 to look at different iphones 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:32.009
 i have an iphone 4 4 ​​s and then 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.010
 We'll also be launching iPhone 5 for the first time 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:39.510
 the bidding process the iphone 5 offers like 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:43.739
 usually quite fast the 4s has something 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.140
 took longer and the iphone is 4 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.489
 still on the state 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.280
 which stands out first as soon as the mobile phone 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.559
 of course, that in between the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.949
 homescreens it runs smoothly jerky is 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.230
 A little bit on the iPhone 5 you can tell 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:01.230
 no delay you can be here very much 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:06.060
 easy through the individual screens 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.729
 is the vision 4s draws minimal for the 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.909
 rather a perceived difference and that 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.939
 foursome iphone jerks clearly as 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:19.170
 Next, I open the control center 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.720
 it jerks neatly on the iphone 4 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.360
 if you pull it on the iphone 4s 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.830
 the control center opens quite a bit 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.700
 briskly 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.259
 You do not really notice any 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.630
 delay and on the iphone 5 is running 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.979
 the center is also very fluid as 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.970
 Next, I open the app store 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:42.649
 Let's see how much you look in that 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.439
 store can navigate 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:49.380
 on the iphone 4 makes the service 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.890
 not really fun is googling quite 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.479
 clearly the iphone 4s is very jerky 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.409
 strong even if the pictures after 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.649
 are loaded 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.840
 ruggell the store still clearly on the 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.719
 iphone 5 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.240
 the app store runs relatively smoothly too 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:07.460
 Here you can see a slight jerking back and forth 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.840
 again even if the apps are loaded after 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.780
 are synonymous if the pictures are loaded after 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.580
 there are slight misfires 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.560
 As you can see there are clear 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.500
 performance differences on the iphones 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.670
 Of course you should not forget that 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.049
 that we have three different ones here 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.450
 generations have to lie with 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.489
 different hardware power 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.099
 anyway, ios is six in total 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.849
 the performance is more balanced than it is now 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:33.829
 ios apple still has some time left 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.190
 until the final version here 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.190
 rework
