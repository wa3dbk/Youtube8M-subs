00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.090
 hello friends here we are with you 

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:08.660
 again we are going to prepare a rich rice 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:12.470
 mexican red mexican rice to be 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.380
 more clear we are going to occupy 2 tomatoes 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.690
 cut in 8 or continue to depend on 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.860
 the measure of the tomato 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.860
 a clove of garlic 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.349
 and a piece of onion is a quarter of the 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.140
 onion because my onion was very 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.600
 big 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.990
 and this 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.520
 a cup and a half of rice I wash it 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.950
 many people who do not like to wash it 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.100
 because he says he loses his vitamins but 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:46.230
 I like to wash it always then to 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.230
 a pot we add a little oil 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.050
 that covers all the sittings of the 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.180
 pan 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.390
 casserole or do not know how you tell 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.640
 your 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.640
 and we are already putting the rice 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:13.640
 and we let zen 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:17.800
 like to be toasted but to bathe in 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.800
 some oil all the rice 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.060
 while that is 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.100
 has been crying yes almost a little we are going 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.100
 to grind this the tomatoes 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.590
 a child back playing with all the 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.590
 little dolls 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:45.100
 although this here is the tomato the 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.420
 garlic clove piece of onion good to 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.430
 I think it's like a little bit 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.030
 a lot of onion but we cut a 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.030
 bit 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.260
 come on, we mix it with a little water 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.170
 while we keep moving the rice here 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.170
 min 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.450
 then today I'm in the east we put 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.450
 a spoonful of consumed 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.580
 and we are going to grind this 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.209
 well we have here this ground already 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.480
 we can add it to the oil to the east to 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.480
 rice 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:45.860
 if they see that they are missing a little bit of 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.050
 liquid they add more water I do not 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.170
 child does not add much water when 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:54.380
 ground because I gave quad now it's not 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:58.280
 so big so I'm going to add a 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:02.380
 little more water me to the pan 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.380
 like a cup of water I would say 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.620
 and we have it well 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:24.400
 many people add frozen vegetables 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.930
 or carrot me in this case I'm not going to 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.010
 add anything because I will accompany it 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.700
 this one with some chicken tacos 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.990
 that is 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.660
 what other day will I upload the recipe 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.910
 but a little salt is added 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.690
 remember not much salt because they already have 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.660
 Chicken soup is ok then put 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.540
 let it boil 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:55.260
 since going goes they cover it and they lower it to the 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:58.040
 fire be on low heat 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.519
 and they already let it 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.000
 that he evaporates because what he is 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.000
 the liquid 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:11.859
 it does not roughly last as one as 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:14.969
 about 25 minutes I would say so that 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:18.389
 soft rice and everything is more 

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:20.999
 that ready gas 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:23.189
 Well, as I tell you, it's like this to go 

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:27.620
 Seeing how the company is here 

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:27.620
 bubble up the plugs 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.650
 they cover it well and they lower it to the 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:38.610
 temperature as 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:43.670
 yes as a low game 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:47.450
 and about 25 minutes and we wait 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:49.640
 well, 25 minutes have passed and if we 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.520
 our rice was ready to eat 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.390
 and only that it cooled a little bit to 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.500
 what 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:05:00.360
 Look at yourself a lot better, so I hope 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.909
 what you liked 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.689
 and as I say you can add if 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:09.060
 like corn or the same in vegetables 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:10.969
 frozen when it starts to boil 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.399
 pan 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:17.860
 but that's how I wanted to do it today 

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:17.860
 I hope you like good day
