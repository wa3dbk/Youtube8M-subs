00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.569 
on the inside we did the door frames
with<00:01:59.979> a<00:02:01.500> textured<00:02:02.500> black<00:02:02.530> paint<00:02:03.099> so<00:02:03.399> it<00:02:03.489> would

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
with a textured black paint so it would

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.910 
with a textured black paint so it would
run<00:02:03.789> along<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:05.229> same<00:02:06.630> look<00:02:07.630> as<00:02:08.049> the<00:02:08.470> outside

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:13.330 
I've seen a really nice one from Spyder
but<00:05:08.180> the<00:05:08.360> things<00:05:08.599> like<00:05:08.840> almost<00:05:09.340> $700<00:05:12.340> we'll

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
but the things like almost $700 we'll

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.480 
but the things like almost $700 we'll
look<00:05:14.090> and<00:05:14.389> find<00:05:14.599> something<00:05:15.020> else<00:05:15.289> of<00:05:15.800> course<00:05:15.860> I

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
look and find something else of course I

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:22.330 
look and find something else of course I
want<00:05:17.389> to<00:05:17.449> get<00:05:17.569> the<00:05:17.689> 2<00:05:17.840> inch<00:05:18.050> lift<00:05:18.349> kit<00:05:18.610> and<00:05:21.340> I'm

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
want to get the 2 inch lift kit and I'm

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.860 
want to get the 2 inch lift kit and I'm
probably<00:05:22.699> going<00:05:22.909> to<00:05:22.969> go<00:05:23.180> with<00:05:23.360> some<00:05:23.569> true

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
probably going to go with some true

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:33.480 
probably going to go with some true
duals<00:05:24.199> and<00:05:24.639> go<00:05:25.639> out<00:05:25.759> on<00:05:25.939> the<00:05:26.030> other<00:05:26.270> side

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.230 

eventually<00:05:34.490> I'm<00:05:34.580> going<00:05:34.729> to<00:05:34.819> get<00:05:34.969> to<00:05:35.120> the

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
eventually I'm going to get to the

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:41.619 
eventually I'm going to get to the
inside<00:05:35.419> and<00:05:36.340> reupholster<00:05:37.340> it<00:05:38.800> still<00:05:40.629> still

00:05:41.619 --> 00:05:41.629 
inside and reupholster it still still

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:46.240 
inside and reupholster it still still
thinking<00:05:42.169> of<00:05:42.259> us<00:05:42.409> color<00:05:42.830> scheme<00:05:43.870> because<00:05:45.250> you

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
thinking of us color scheme because you

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.170 
thinking of us color scheme because you
may<00:05:47.150> have<00:05:47.389> a<00:05:47.419> really<00:05:47.810> awkward<00:05:48.020> color<00:05:48.560> scheme

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
may have a really awkward color scheme
