 Well, I don't want to be an idiot to that one's specialty, so it's a defensive, for example. 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:49.560
 Or in the or take the communication with various people I Toka and go overseas Bath 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.590

 Such little something because 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:13.590
 Child theme I think whether I can do different thinking unique to Kyoto University students 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:18.190
 This even after all their own because the professor also was totally different as pretty and October different from in Japan and the world 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:20.330

 It is a trial with a lot of diffusion laws and it is different from Japan 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:54.180
 Unlike Japan, whether or not it is in violation of the treaty between that country and that 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:57.710

 This is from a Japanese company 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:12.970
 If something is legally a little stronger at that prime minister , then the Japanese economy will be better 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.970

 In the undergraduate that is possible research 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:05:04.240
