00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:11.909
 herself that all the boys 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.550
 scam and this is a new video on sky 

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:17.560
 then today I will do 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:21.700
 see how to get the strongest weapon 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.770
 of the game that is the giant's club now 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.070
 as you can see I was expecting mine 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:32.020
 next official I use on ps3 but I'm in 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:34.450
 looking secondary which is on the mac then 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.110
 I wanted to start before I wanted to tell you that 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:41.110
 this trick can only be used 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.600
 with the computer both windows and mac 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:49.000
 however, the important view is fine 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:52.719
 keyboard for ps3 xbox not consoles 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.030
 I'm sure but I think I think so 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.829
 could if attached in a keyboard 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.469
 I don't want to say to the console, though 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:03.300
 shit so if you want to try though 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:07.410
 I don't guarantee that it works 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:11.200
 then starting for those who use windows 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:13.990
 will have to click the button under a bait 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:18.100
 other left of the keyboard than the 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:21.070
 key of the former Lecce instead for those who use it 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:26.140
 mac pro malin will have to click the button 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:29.280
 cells or accented once opened 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.440
 clicked to open this small chatroom 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.880
 and you will only have to put everything in 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:46.980
 lowercase 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:49.900
 she is precisely and here detached item 0 0 0 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:54.640
 4 6 1 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:58.200
 and this time in a capital letter click on 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.230
 I send and see that in the upper left 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.010
 giant equipped bat will be released 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:07.600
 so that the whole chat 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:10.729
 here is this here the bat if that girl 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:15.049
 since this is it 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:17.720
 let's say it 's strong enough 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:20.980
 I'm here now I'm secondary singing 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.590
 i am low level therefore not 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.610
 but great giving, however, is very strong 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.879
 in fact the strongest of the game here 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:34.090
 this one is a weapon 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:41.400
 his want i try to attack 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:43.599
 do you expect someone going up ok 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:52.269
 arrived attacking someone to see her 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:03:03.400
 strength because they run away from fear and do yourselves 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:03:06.269
 below you see strong enough ie 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.269
 kills with a blow 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:18.980
 okay then this was the weapon e 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.540
 so we can say that the video is 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.909
 finished even if it lasted a little bit 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.909
 compared to the other 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:28.010
 if you liked it announced I like it 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:30.579

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.579
