 gescartera and today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.610
 make yourselves two very gifts 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:11.259
 original and easy to do for 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.629
 your partner on valentine's day 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:16.810
 or any other important date for 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:19.810
 you the first one is a box with 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:24.990
 messages and candy to start what 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:28.830
 we need is a box rose petals 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:33.430
 chocolate balls a sheet of paper 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:36.390
 three or more red marker pens and 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.820
 black and zeal 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.690
 to begin we will fill the box 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.690
 rose petals 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.750
 Now we will cut the folio into strips in 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.220
 those that we will write sentences dedicated to 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.230
 that person 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.800
 we will make as many phrases as lollipops 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.800
 let's have 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.540
 and when they're ready we'll hit them 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.540
 this way to lollipops 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.140
 to finish we will place the lollipops of 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.810
 a beautiful and orderly manner in 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.610
 the box and we will finish decorating the box 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.610
 with the chocolate balls 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.910

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.460
 and now we go with the other gift 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.970
 This consists of a jar with candy and 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.160
