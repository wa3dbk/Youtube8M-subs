00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:09.290
 na dyn hot rod vil in belt of in and the 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.090
 son of this have a project in a 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.690
 old amsterdam store is its 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.369
 bet of future water pon ix a 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.950
 kind of urban garden for the 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:22.960
 vegetable self-supply that nothing in 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.960
 water and a pond with times below 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.289
 the fish produce the fertilizer that feeds 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.480
 our vegetables 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.250
 and here , the 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:39.290
 bacteria that convert the fertilizer of the 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:41.390
 fish in food and the result is a 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.879
 small ecosystem with a circuit 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.079
 closed waste that becomes 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.079
 a good fertilizer 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.090
 thanks to the water circuit the tomatoes 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.000
 broccoli and cauliflower have a risk 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.000
 and continuous drainage 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.640
 the harvests are regular and after 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.640
 8 months the 20 3 asia can be captured 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:14.470
 the garden they built themselves 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.470
 with the help of his friends 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.510
 and I think we have to do 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.299
 responsible for our actions in the 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.820
 world we have to understand where 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.820
 come our food and work 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.710
 so that less pollution occurs 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.710
 less energy consumption and more flavor 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.950
 Y 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.530
 'no garden and her daughter have a project 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.969
 similar with the city plot initiative that 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.990
 wants to turn amsterdam into the 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:46.990
 self-supply capital 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.340
 to achieve it they give courses on 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.310
 horticulture 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.240
 cultivate in open spaces and on 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.240
 roofs of the city 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.010
 Amsterdam can not produce one hundred 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.300
 one hundred of your food but you can plant 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.819
 lettuce on the roof of the 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.560
 supermarkets and sell them the food is 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.780
 would produce there and not in a remote country 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.459
 in a greenhouse that consumes a lot 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.209
 energy also the architect of 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.950
 rotterdam 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.140
 yago pfannberger deals with the 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.360
 local production of food without 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.390
 greenhouses and packaging that then 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.459
 they throw the project the super market park 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.530
 that with one thousand six hundred hectares will be 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.370
 the largest organic supermarket on the air 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.370
 free of the world 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.490
 each hectare will produce different 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.750
 fruits and vegetables and maybe even 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:57.810
 fish and rice in this pack supermarket 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.280
 there will be a small market in each area of 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.280
 so that it would not only be a place of 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.170
 shopping but also meeting the 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.310
 supermarket and become a 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.310
 real part of the city 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.690
 in the next few years the 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.580
 first park super market of the countries 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.710
 low 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.500
 nadine hot on road and belle belt of on 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.770
 they hope that soon their vegetables 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.450
 and trout reach them to feed 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:28.580
 and they want to prepare more water systems 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.580
 pony up to fill the entire store 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.360
 I do not think we can feed all of them 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.950
 Amsterdam alone with these crops but 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.990
 understand better how they work and 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.410
 participate in the process is the beginning 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.480
 of a change urban gardens every time 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.230
 more people are interested in this form of 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.230
 self-supply
