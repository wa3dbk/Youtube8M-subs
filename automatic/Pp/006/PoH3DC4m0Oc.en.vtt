really<00:00:41.760> really<00:00:41.790> mechanical<00:00:42.570> good<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.020> they

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
really really mechanical good and they

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.400 
really really mechanical good and they
have<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> good<00:00:43.950> mindset<00:00:44.250> about<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.670> game<00:00:44.850> and

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
have a good mindset about the game and

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.229 
have a good mindset about the game and
if<00:00:46.410> they<00:00:46.559> can<00:00:46.710> keep<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:46.920> up<00:00:47.219> we<00:00:47.370> will<00:00:47.520> see<00:00:47.789> but

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
if they can keep that up we will see but

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.069

saying goodbye to them because we all

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.690 
saying goodbye to them because we all
had<00:02:04.560> different<00:02:04.740> goals<00:02:05.040> we<00:02:05.340> all<00:02:05.430> wanted

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
had different goals we all wanted

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.999 
had different goals we all wanted
different<00:02:05.850> things<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.479> no<00:02:06.600> one<00:02:06.780> got<00:02:06.990> left<00:02:07.710> by

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
different things so no one got left by

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.100 
different things so no one got left by
being<00:02:08.399> unhappy<00:02:08.700> almost<00:02:09.209> happy<00:02:09.509> what<00:02:09.720> happened

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
being unhappy almost happy what happened

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.050 
being unhappy almost happy what happened
so<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.530> think<00:02:10.679> that's<00:02:10.950> all<00:02:11.039> right<00:02:11.160> would<00:02:11.940> you

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
so I think that's all right would you

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.640 
so I think that's all right would you
say<00:02:12.239> that<00:02:12.270> difference<00:02:12.959> in<00:02:13.170> goal

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
say that difference in goal

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.050 
say that difference in goal
might<00:02:13.950> have<00:02:14.040> been<00:02:14.189> that<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.459> wanted<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.790> win

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
might have been that you wanted to win

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.319 
might have been that you wanted to win
more<00:02:15.269> or<00:02:15.569> I<00:02:15.959> think<00:02:16.670> it's<00:02:17.670> just<00:02:17.879> different<00:02:18.060> than

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
more or I think it's just different than

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.119 
more or I think it's just different than
girls<00:02:18.510> like<00:02:18.840> for<00:02:18.989> example<00:02:19.049> Snoopy<00:02:19.829> always

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129
