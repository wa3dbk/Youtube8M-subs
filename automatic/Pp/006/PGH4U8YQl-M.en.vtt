right<00:01:10.720> after<00:01:11.050> they<00:01:11.170> started<00:01:11.560> single<00:01:12.010> crosses

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
right after they started single crosses

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.820 
right after they started single crosses
I<00:01:12.700> started<00:01:13.120> working<00:01:13.300> the<00:01:13.360> company<00:01:13.630> in<00:01:13.690> 1966<00:01:14.560> in

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
I started working the company in 1966 in

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.700 
I started working the company in 1966 in
production<00:01:15.460> so<00:01:16.090> I<00:01:16.120> had<00:01:16.330> a<00:01:16.360> diversified<00:01:17.350> career

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
production so I had a diversified career

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.550 
production so I had a diversified career
and<00:01:18.070> it<00:01:18.670> was<00:01:18.850> just<00:01:19.300> a<00:01:19.510> great<00:01:19.990> company<00:01:20.290> to<00:01:20.440> work

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
and it was just a great company to work

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.460 
and it was just a great company to work
for<00:01:20.710> and<00:01:20.979> I<00:01:21.400> look<00:01:21.640> back<00:01:21.880> and<00:01:22.090> I<00:01:22.180> have<00:01:22.390> so<00:01:23.350> many

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
for and I look back and I have so many

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.460 
for and I look back and I have so many
fond<00:01:23.800> memories<00:01:23.830> and<00:01:24.280> and<00:01:25.410> lifetime<00:01:26.410> friends

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.790 

I<00:01:30.120> think<00:01:31.120> that<00:01:31.330> the<00:01:31.630> opportunity<00:01:32.590> for

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
I think that the opportunity for

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.590 
I think that the opportunity for
agronomic<00:01:33.400> benefit<00:01:33.910> is<00:01:34.030> almost<00:01:34.330> unlimited

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
agronomic benefit is almost unlimited

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.020 
agronomic benefit is almost unlimited
and<00:01:35.470> will<00:01:35.620> really<00:01:35.830> help<00:01:36.040> us<00:01:36.220> get<00:01:36.520> to<00:01:36.760> our<00:01:36.790> goal

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
and will really help us get to our goal

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.360 
and will really help us get to our goal
of<00:01:37.180> doubling<00:01:37.330> yields<00:01:37.810> or<00:01:38.170> a<00:01:38.290> 300<00:01:38.770> bushel<00:01:39.070> yield

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
of doubling yields or a 300 bushel yield

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.170 
of doubling yields or a 300 bushel yield
so<00:01:40.180> in<00:01:40.810> 2030<00:01:41.380> we're<00:01:42.040> gonna<00:01:42.160> be<00:01:42.370> close<00:01:42.610> to<00:01:42.760> 300

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
so in 2030 we're gonna be close to 300

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.820 
so in 2030 we're gonna be close to 300
bushel<00:01:43.420> corn<00:01:43.600> if<00:01:43.810> we<00:01:43.930> haven't<00:01:44.230> surpassed<00:01:44.590> it

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
bushel corn if we haven't surpassed it

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.500 
bushel corn if we haven't surpassed it
with<00:01:45.040> products<00:01:45.550> like<00:01:45.760> integrated<00:01:46.360> farming

systems<00:01:46.990> in<00:01:47.410> the<00:01:47.590> future<00:01:47.980> it<00:01:48.550> just<00:01:48.640> it's<00:01:49.240> just

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
systems in the future it just it's just

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.060

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
to continue to add more yield it means a

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.420 
to continue to add more yield it means a
