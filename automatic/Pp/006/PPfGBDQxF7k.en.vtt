I'll<00:03:21.350> work<00:03:21.709> time<00:03:22.010> he's<00:03:22.580> getting<00:03:22.880> paid<00:03:23.090> for

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
I'll work time he's getting paid for

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.030 
I'll work time he's getting paid for
that<00:03:23.450> that's<00:03:23.780> how<00:03:23.930> much<00:03:24.110> he<00:03:24.319> got<00:03:24.500> to<00:03:24.680> put<00:03:24.890> them

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
that that's how much he got to put them

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:32.140 
that that's how much he got to put them
to<00:03:25.370> do<00:03:25.549> them<00:03:25.900> start<00:03:27.670> that<00:03:28.670> was<00:03:28.790> a<00:03:28.819> 33<00:03:30.310> on<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.370> 33

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
to do them start that was a 33 on the 33

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:39.520 
to do them start that was a 33 on the 33
where<00:03:32.840> was<00:03:33.110> that<00:03:33.140> in<00:03:33.349> 1933<00:03:34.280> he<00:03:34.549> did<00:03:34.970> it<00:03:35.410> um<00:03:37.299> no<00:03:38.530> I

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
where was that in 1933 he did it um no I

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.000 
where was that in 1933 he did it um no I
think<00:03:39.680> that's<00:03:40.010> just<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:40.430> 33<00:03:41.560> because<00:03:42.560> this<00:03:42.860> is

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
think that's just the 33 because this is

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.580 
think that's just the 33 because this is
a<00:03:43.040> 29<00:03:43.640> Cadillac<00:03:44.299> and<00:03:44.690> this<00:03:44.810> is<00:03:45.019> maybe<00:03:45.380> this

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
a 29 Cadillac and this is maybe this

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.750 
a 29 Cadillac and this is maybe this
maybe<00:03:46.070> this<00:03:46.250> is<00:03:46.430> a<00:03:46.760> Duesenberg<00:03:47.329> you<00:03:48.230> know<00:03:48.350> this

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
maybe this is a Duesenberg you know this

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.520 
maybe this is a Duesenberg you know this
this<00:03:49.760> absolutely<00:03:50.420> confirms<00:03:51.200> these<00:03:51.410> are

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
this absolutely confirms these are

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.620 
this absolutely confirms these are
moving<00:03:51.739> props<00:03:52.010> then<00:03:52.280> hug<00:03:52.790> you<00:03:53.120> think<00:03:53.329> it's

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
moving props then hug you think it's

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:54.970 
moving props then hug you think it's
