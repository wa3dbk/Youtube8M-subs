 on the h2s and mac os 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.080
 it sometimes happen to see 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.550
 other platforms such as beijing 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.900
 a little android clan even though for the 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.930

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.520
 android tutor 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.019

 if you have tutorials you can 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:57.350

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.050

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.390
 heil hi to all i'm james alias fx 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.519
 on Youtube 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.680
 I organize video tutorials on 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.970
 photoshop after effects on the 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.739
 web development with remember 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.920
 possibly our pope can more 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:59.400
 is on the OS operating system 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.400
 linux and windows 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.739
 so I'm 22 years old from the Caribbean 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.840
 hello while I was there as of I 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.430
 do the presentation right after that I 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.810
 will make you the presentation of g3 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.640
 design so he did not have time to 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.209
 do it so I make it to her 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.049
 quickly 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.669
 so it was actually a graphic designer so 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.479
 mainly on cinema 4d there 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.430
 photoshop 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:23.590
 so I do not know perfectly 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.990
 but that's what I see he was also 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.800
 so in his spare time videos on 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.590
 video games 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.090
 so it's a gamer so apparently not 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.960
 a professional gamer but a gamer 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.789
 for pleasure 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.370
 so I think he will suggest you 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:38.260
 really good quality videos 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.930
 in any case I am in relation to 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.940

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.289

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.830

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.870
