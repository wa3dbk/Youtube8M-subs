00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.269
 hello and welcome to bathrooms and if you're 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.759
 Looking for ideas to update your bathroom 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.740
 in a simple way and for little money in 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.630
 this site we give you the inspiration to 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.580
 I can do it, I'm a martine called 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.230
 interior decorator and today you 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.740
 I will teach how to give some more aspect 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.080
 modern and romantic to a bathtub creating 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.330
 a spa-like environment within yourself 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.460
 home here we have a typical way 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.160
 like white tiles although they are in 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.140
 good condition its shape and color looks 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.910
 a bit old-fashioned compared to the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.309
 decoration trends nowadays 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.760
 where natural stones are used most 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.770
 and mosaics usually in the past 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.410
 the only way to renew an area like 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.690
 this would knock down all the tiles and 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.449
 start again but as you imagine 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.789
 It would be very expensive and it would take a long time 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.190
 then I have another solution 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.350
 economical and easy that you will like 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.510
 The idea is to cover the surface of the 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.430
 bathtub with a new product like this 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.570
 that gives us the blue look of the 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.060
 mosaics 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.080
 I'm intrigued not the first time 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.659
 I saw this product 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.610
 I could not believe fascinates me 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.100
 difference of mosaics or tiles from 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.870
 stone or porcelain like these that 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.729
 they require many installation steps 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.250
 This tile is made of a gel 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.770
 special that simulates the same texture and 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.560
 touch of a real mosaic but it's 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.840
 flexible easy to cut and self-adhesive 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.910
 They come in various styles to coordinate 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.070
 with the decoration of your bathroom and you can 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.380
 buy online or in some 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.300
 home improvement stores I chose 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.030
 this design by the variation of grays 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.310
 that has as much metal as imitating 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.259
 marble that as you can see complements 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.149
 perfectly fine the existing color 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.130
 of the bathroom the first thing we should do is 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.140
 clean the surface well with a 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.140
 product removes grease and let dry 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.259
 It is very important to prepare the tile 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.390
 to receive the new tile 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.310
 self-adhesive is why we're 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.950
 cleaning any putty residue 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.989
 what we have then is as easy as 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.270
 remove the protective paper from the back and 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.040
 paste, I recommend you start with 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.110
 the center of the wall and work towards 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.280
 the ends to have the cuts 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.280
 even on both sides 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.769
 at the time of joining two tiles the 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.959
 manufacturer recommends overlaying the 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:35.060
 edge so that we have a 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.060
 uniform separation between each tile 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.790
 [Music] 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.520
 [Music] 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.440
 when cutting the tiles 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.750
 we simply measure and use a rule and 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.950
 sharp cutter we make the cut over 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.950
 a protected area 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.570
 almost always the floors in homes 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.960
 they have some kind of unevenness that's why 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.130
 that it is very important to measure each space 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.590
 individually to make sure that 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.220
 each tile is cut to size 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.220
 perfect 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.290
 I decided to only cover the front of 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.390
 the bathtub and the back wall in the 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.849
 mosaic leaving the edge blank 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.190
 existing but unify the old tile 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.569
 with the new what do you think 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.489
 we already have a bathtub that looks more 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:28.379
 modern environment and now only 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.379
 I need to give the romantic touch 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.420
 Install a rod from the ceiling to 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.720
 hang transparent curtain panels 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.600
 on the sides 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:43.250
 wow look at this the truth that as 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.340
 designer needs a moment 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.340
 [Applause] 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.019
 now if we can continue 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.750
 what did you think now we have a point 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.790
 more modern focal point and look at the change in 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.010
 One day we have transformed the bathtub 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.750
 without any construction is 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.640
 important to mention that although the 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.950
 product resists moisture in a bathroom 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.750
 the manufacturer does not recommend that 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.150
 install in an area that is in contact 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.430
 direct with the water as in the shower and 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.070
 about toilet what a novel product 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.410
 I really love it is only how to use 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.600
 decorative but also how they saw is 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.270
 perfect for pasting tiles or 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.340
 even on a painted wall there are many 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.260
 ways to use it so it may be that 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.410
 this idea that they learned here in bathrooms 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:34.389
 and it's exactly what they were looking for 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.389
 I am a beloved king and see you soon 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:43.309
