job no I think there's something I have
a<00:00:49.800> bit<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.039> deeper<00:00:50.280> philosophical<00:00:50.460> thing

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
a bit of a deeper philosophical thing

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.630 
a bit of a deeper philosophical thing
with<00:00:51.329> this<00:00:51.449> like<00:00:51.780> really<00:00:52.590> high<00:00:53.039> graphics

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
with this like really high graphics

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.900 
with this like really high graphics
versus<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.239> know<00:00:55.219> gameplay<00:00:56.219> versus<00:00:56.460> graphics

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
versus you know gameplay versus graphics

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.939 
versus you know gameplay versus graphics
like<00:00:57.120> graphics<00:00:57.960> ability<00:00:58.350> has<00:00:58.440> gone<00:00:58.649> through

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
like graphics ability has gone through

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.439 
like graphics ability has gone through
the<00:00:59.309> roof<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.730> keeps<00:00:59.940> going<00:01:00.149> through<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
the roof and it keeps going through the

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.560 
the roof and it keeps going through the
room<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:01.469> how<00:01:02.190> far<00:01:02.460> we<00:01:02.579> push<00:01:02.820> being<00:01:03.329> play

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
room the how far we push being play

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.980 
room the how far we push being play
always<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.500> think<00:01:04.799> might<00:01:04.979> have<00:01:05.570> this<00:01:06.570> trending

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
always I think might have this trending

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.380 
always I think might have this trending
towards<00:01:07.200> more<00:01:07.350> formulaic<00:01:07.920> turn<00:01:08.280> paint<00:01:08.610> get<00:01:09.360> a

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
towards more formulaic turn paint get a

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.969 
towards more formulaic turn paint get a
good<00:01:09.659> production<00:01:10.200> like<00:01:10.350> bitter<00:01:10.560> game<00:01:10.770> out

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
good production like bitter game out

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.980 
good production like bitter game out
there<00:01:11.780> and<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:13.080> think<00:01:14.299> this<00:01:15.299> reviews<00:01:15.810> little

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
there and I think this reviews little

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.450 
there and I think this reviews little
order<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.200> not<00:01:16.350> indicative<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.979> trend

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
order is not indicative of that trend

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.050 
order is not indicative of that trend
any<00:01:18.330> people<00:01:19.280> but<00:01:20.280> let's<00:01:20.430> assume<00:01:20.729> that's<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
any people but let's assume that's the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.670 
any people but let's assume that's the
case<00:01:21.270> do<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.140> think<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.890> reviews<00:01:23.990> are<00:01:24.990> being

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
case do you think the reviews are being

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.740 
case do you think the reviews are being
your<00:01:26.040> response<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.880> can<00:01:27.090> come<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.570> can

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
your response I you can come you can

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.490 
your response I you can come you can
call<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.049> game<00:01:28.380> out<00:01:28.560> as<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.890> poster<00:01:29.759> child<00:01:29.790> for

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
call a game out as a poster child for

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.990 
call a game out as a poster child for
reflecting<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.590> negative<00:01:32.130> trend<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.759> maybe

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
reflecting that negative trend and maybe

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.330 
reflecting that negative trend and maybe
or<00:01:33.299> maybe<00:01:33.450> not<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.900> order<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:35.189> does

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
or maybe not the order is that but does

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.580 
or maybe not the order is that but does
that<00:01:35.369> mean<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.030> deserves<00:01:36.450> like<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.079> 1<00:01:37.320> out<00:01:37.560> of

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
that mean it deserves like the 1 out of

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.190 
that mean it deserves like the 1 out of
5<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.759> 2<00:01:39.000> out<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.240> tens<00:01:39.570> because<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:40.079> that

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
5 and the 2 out of tens because in that

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.280 
5 and the 2 out of tens because in that
seem<00:01:40.439> extreme<00:01:40.829> or<00:01:40.950> maybe<00:01:41.130> not<00:01:41.340> if<00:01:41.850> there's<00:01:42.290> if

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
seem extreme or maybe not if there's if

think I haven't played at all so I don't

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.040 
think I haven't played at all so I don't
necessarily<00:02:04.430> have<00:02:05.060> it<00:02:05.600> doesn't<00:02:05.900> matter

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
necessarily have it doesn't matter

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.210 
necessarily have it doesn't matter
everyone<00:02:06.410> on<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.590> internet<00:02:06.830> gets<00:02:06.950> to<00:02:07.040> have<00:02:07.160> an

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
everyone on the internet gets to have an

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.010 
everyone on the internet gets to have an
opinion<00:02:07.490> even<00:02:07.940> if<00:02:08.000> it's<00:02:08.119> obviously<00:02:08.570> family

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
opinion even if it's obviously family

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.210 
opinion even if it's obviously family
but<00:02:09.170> nothing<00:02:10.840> okay<00:02:11.860> okay

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
but nothing okay okay

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.060 
but nothing okay okay
okay<00:02:13.640> well<00:02:13.850> you<00:02:14.090> talk<00:02:14.420> okay<00:02:14.840> like<00:02:15.560> games<00:02:15.830> that

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
okay well you talk okay like games that

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.310 
okay well you talk okay like games that
are<00:02:16.220> based<00:02:16.490> off<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:16.760> that<00:02:17.660> are<00:02:17.750> heavy<00:02:17.930> story

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
are based off of that are heavy story

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.720 
are based off of that are heavy story
based<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:18.890> I<00:02:18.920> feel<00:02:19.220> like<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.430> order<00:02:19.670> is

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
based so I feel like the order is

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:20.710 
based so I feel like the order is
probably<00:02:20.060> something<00:02:20.330> I<00:02:20.390> can<00:02:20.570> get<00:02:20.660> behind

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
probably something I can get behind

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.090 
probably something I can get behind
especially<00:02:21.440> because<00:02:21.530> it's<00:02:21.740> really<00:02:21.860> pretty

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
especially because it's really pretty

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.330 
especially because it's really pretty
like<00:02:23.290> but<00:02:24.290> yeah<00:02:24.440> I<00:02:24.470> think<00:02:24.620> there's<00:02:25.070> something

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
like but yeah I think there's something

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.980 
like but yeah I think there's something
to<00:02:25.490> be<00:02:25.580> said<00:02:25.670> where<00:02:26.180> you<00:02:26.870> can<00:02:27.020> go<00:02:27.170> too<00:02:27.230> far<00:02:27.470> and

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
to be said where you can go too far and

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.890 
to be said where you can go too far and
lose<00:02:29.990> sight<00:02:30.380> of<00:02:30.430> what<00:02:31.430> makes<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.940> game<00:02:32.120> games

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
lose sight of what makes the game games

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.900 
lose sight of what makes the game games
of<00:02:33.110> different<00:02:33.470> mediums<00:02:33.890> and<00:02:34.160> movies<00:02:34.550> like

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
of different mediums and movies like

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.680 
of different mediums and movies like
there's<00:02:35.240> nothing<00:02:35.450> special<00:02:35.690> of<00:02:35.930> that<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:38.450> be

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
there's nothing special of that to be

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.840 
there's nothing special of that to be
able<00:02:38.720> to<00:02:38.930> marry<00:02:39.110> a<00:02:39.230> good<00:02:39.530> balance<00:02:40.250> of<00:02:40.340> gameplay

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
able to marry a good balance of gameplay

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.020 
able to marry a good balance of gameplay
and<00:02:41.150> story<00:02:41.740> what<00:02:42.740> I've<00:02:42.890> heard<00:02:43.190> people<00:02:43.760> have

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
lost sight of that well I see every for

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.600 
lost sight of that well I see every for
the<00:02:47.120> gameplay<00:02:47.860> pushing<00:02:48.860> that<00:02:49.010> more<00:02:49.340> instead

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
the gameplay pushing that more instead

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.480 
the gameplay pushing that more instead
of<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.820> graphics<00:02:50.450> but<00:02:50.900> there's<00:02:51.740> a<00:02:51.830> huge<00:02:52.220> issue

long it's not five hours for everyone it

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.870 
long it's not five hours for everyone it
depends<00:03:06.650> on<00:03:06.709> how<00:03:06.830> you<00:03:06.890> play<00:03:07.040> some<00:03:07.489> people<00:03:07.730> play

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
depends on how you play some people play

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.310 
depends on how you play some people play
really<00:03:08.180> fast<00:03:08.450> some<00:03:08.660> people<00:03:08.930> take<00:03:09.140> their<00:03:09.290> time

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
really fast some people take their time

really fast some people take their time
so<00:03:10.130> to<00:03:10.790> me<00:03:11.060> it<00:03:11.750> seems<00:03:12.350> like<00:03:12.440> it's<00:03:12.709> getting

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
so to me it seems like it's getting

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.740 
so to me it seems like it's getting
really<00:03:13.340> harsh<00:03:13.580> criticism<00:03:14.180> for<00:03:14.360> something

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
really harsh criticism for something

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.020 
really harsh criticism for something
that's<00:03:14.959> like<00:03:15.340> subjective<00:03:16.340> like<00:03:16.580> this<00:03:16.850> is

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
that's like subjective like this is

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.430 
that's like subjective like this is
something<00:03:17.390> that's<00:03:17.510> an<00:03:17.690> opinion<00:03:17.959> of<00:03:18.200> one

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
something that's an opinion of one

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.170 
something that's an opinion of one
person<00:03:18.980> and<00:03:19.130> then<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.340> right<00:03:19.459> guy<00:03:19.640> that's<00:03:20.030> all

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
person and then the right guy that's all

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:33.970 
person and then the right guy that's all
for<00:03:20.420> above<00:03:20.750> all<00:03:20.959> you<00:03:21.230> know<00:03:32.110> I<00:03:33.110> think<00:03:33.769> that's

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
for above all you know I think that's

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.380 
for above all you know I think that's
why<00:03:34.160> it's<00:03:34.340> getting<00:03:34.459> so<00:03:34.700> much<00:03:34.820> flex<00:03:35.120> we<00:03:35.360> have

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
why it's getting so much flex we have

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.880 
why it's getting so much flex we have

I don't know I think that a lot of
gamers<00:04:02.930> and<00:04:03.380> reviewers<00:04:04.130> are<00:04:04.400> super<00:04:04.880> jaded

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
gamers and reviewers are super jaded

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.110

right<00:04:06.110> now<00:04:06.260> everybody<00:04:07.070> seems<00:04:07.400> so<00:04:07.490> jaded<00:04:07.970> and<00:04:08.030> I

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
right now everybody seems so jaded and I

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.630 
right now everybody seems so jaded and I
think<00:04:08.390> everyone's<00:04:08.840> just<00:04:09.140> being<00:04:09.710> overly

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
think everyone's just being overly

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.940 
think everyone's just being overly
critical<00:04:10.790> of<00:04:11.120> everything<00:04:11.750> can't<00:04:12.080> like<00:04:12.320> they

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
critical of everything can't like they

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.290 
critical of everything can't like they
play<00:04:13.160> a<00:04:13.190> good<00:04:13.340> game<00:04:13.460> and<00:04:13.790> they<00:04:13.880> have<00:04:14.030> to<00:04:14.180> like

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
play a good game and they have to like

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.020 
play a good game and they have to like
judge<00:04:14.660> it<00:04:14.870> and<00:04:15.140> critique<00:04:15.650> every<00:04:16.070> miniscule

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
judge it and critique every miniscule

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.940 
judge it and critique every miniscule
point<00:04:17.390> and<00:04:17.570> being<00:04:17.720> instead<00:04:18.050> of<00:04:18.110> like<00:04:18.320> I<00:04:18.470> liked

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950
