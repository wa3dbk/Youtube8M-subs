today<00:00:10.200> it's<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.889> beautiful<00:00:11.250> day<00:00:11.429> out<00:00:11.580> here<00:00:11.610> we

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
today it's a beautiful day out here we

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.850 
today it's a beautiful day out here we
got<00:00:12.360> nice<00:00:12.660> thermal<00:00:13.139> breezes<00:00:13.469> so<00:00:13.590> we<00:00:13.710> got

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
got nice thermal breezes so we got

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.829 
got nice thermal breezes so we got
thermals<00:00:14.490> building<00:00:14.880> up<00:00:15.000> here<00:00:15.210> I'm<00:00:15.599> going<00:00:15.719> to

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
thermals building up here I'm going to

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.240 
thermals building up here I'm going to
see<00:00:16.020> if<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.199> can<00:00:16.350> try<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.560> catch<00:00:16.859> one<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.100> those

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
see if I can try to catch one of those

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.920 
see if I can try to catch one of those
thermals<00:00:17.699> with<00:00:17.880> this<00:00:18.029> clutch<00:00:18.270> or<00:00:18.510> with<00:00:18.720> this

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
thermals with this clutch or with this

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.670 
thermals with this clutch or with this
glider<00:00:19.920> maybe<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:20.850> can<00:00:21.150> maybe<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.480> can't<00:00:21.840> let's

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
glider maybe I can maybe I can't let's

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.740 
glider maybe I can maybe I can't let's
see<00:00:22.830> how<00:00:23.039> much<00:00:23.220> better<00:00:23.850> I've<00:00:24.090> gotten<00:00:24.539> in<00:00:24.660> the

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:29.630 

it's<00:01:23.250> up<00:01:23.520> there<00:01:23.760> it's<00:01:24.050> gaining<00:01:28.280> like<00:01:29.280> there's

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
it's up there it's gaining like there's

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.110 
it's up there it's gaining like there's
a<00:01:29.729> thermal<00:01:30.060> right<00:01:30.180> there<00:01:31.729> reducing<00:01:32.729> throttle

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
a thermal right there reducing throttle

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.719 
a thermal right there reducing throttle
trying<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.540> catch<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:34.490> wish<00:01:35.490> there<00:01:35.610> was

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
trying to catch that I wish there was

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.250 
trying to catch that I wish there was
some<00:01:35.880> buzzards<00:01:36.150> out<00:01:36.450> here<00:01:36.659> not<00:01:36.930> Buzzard

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
some buzzards out here not Buzzard

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.680 
some buzzards out here not Buzzard
Twitty<00:01:37.470> call<00:01:37.680> them<00:01:37.860> Ravens<00:01:38.729> yeah<00:01:39.450> there's<00:01:39.630> a

Twitty call them Ravens yeah there's a

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.070 
Twitty call them Ravens yeah there's a
thermal<00:01:40.020> right<00:01:40.110> there<00:01:41.750> I'm<00:01:42.750> going<00:01:42.900> to<00:01:42.960> try<00:01:43.050> to

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
thermal right there I'm going to try to

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.960 
thermal right there I'm going to try to
stay<00:01:43.320> at<00:01:43.440> it<00:01:43.910> slow<00:01:44.910> circling<00:01:46.970> reducing

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
stay at it slow circling reducing

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.410 
stay at it slow circling reducing
throttle<00:01:48.300> even<00:01:48.330> further<00:01:49.580> I'm<00:01:50.580> right<00:01:50.880> overhead

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
throttle even further I'm right overhead

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.139 
throttle even further I'm right overhead
oh<00:01:51.690> this<00:01:52.080> this<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.160> much<00:01:53.369> fun<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.789> fly<00:01:53.970> I'm

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
oh this this is so much fun to fly I'm

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:10.400 
oh this this is so much fun to fly I'm
in<00:01:54.300> the<00:01:54.420> thermal<00:02:07.340> throttles<00:02:08.340> off<00:02:09.229> let's<00:02:10.229> see

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
in the thermal throttles off let's see

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:17.180 
in the thermal throttles off let's see
if<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.619> can<00:02:10.800> get<00:02:10.950> that<00:02:11.070> thermo<00:02:11.430> again<00:02:16.070> Liz<00:02:17.070> the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
if I can get that thermo again Liz the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.440 
if I can get that thermo again Liz the
right<00:02:17.340> but<00:02:17.519> yeah<00:02:17.760> I'm<00:02:17.910> gonna<00:02:18.030> have<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.269> go<00:02:18.360> up

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
right but yeah I'm gonna have to go up

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.410 
right but yeah I'm gonna have to go up
again<00:02:19.220> let's<00:02:20.220> try<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.459> left<00:02:20.700> turn<00:02:21.030> this<00:02:21.420> time

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
again let's try a left turn this time

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.550 
again let's try a left turn this time
let<00:02:24.420> me<00:02:24.450> try<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.690> keep<00:02:24.900> my<00:02:25.019> arms<00:02:25.260> in<00:02:25.410> position

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
let me try to keep my arms in position

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.800 
let me try to keep my arms in position
so<00:02:26.010> here<00:02:26.220> so<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:26.489> can<00:02:26.670> see<00:02:26.850> me<00:02:26.970> but<00:02:27.450> this<00:02:27.630> thing

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
so here so you can see me but this thing

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:28.940 
so here so you can see me but this thing
has<00:02:27.930> great<00:02:28.200> range<00:02:28.380> on<00:02:28.680> it

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
has great range on it

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.880 
has great range on it
200<00:02:29.370> meters<00:02:30.080> that's<00:02:31.080> all<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.350> need<00:02:31.500> for<00:02:31.530> this

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
200 meters that's all you need for this

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.580 
200 meters that's all you need for this
actually<00:02:32.540> this<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.750> going<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:33.930> be<00:02:34.019> so<00:02:34.170> much<00:02:34.350> fun

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
actually this is going to be so much fun

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.259 
actually this is going to be so much fun
up<00:02:34.830> in<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.070> canyons<00:02:35.940> oh<00:02:37.760> by<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.790> way<00:02:38.940> did<00:02:39.180> I

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
up in the canyons oh by the way did I

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:47.940 
up in the canyons oh by the way did I
tell<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:39.630> I've<00:02:39.720> been<00:02:39.780> practicing

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.780 

tried<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:49.040> do<00:02:49.190> it<00:02:49.310> at<00:02:49.400> home<00:02:49.550> in<00:02:49.700> there<00:02:51.640> but<00:02:52.640> it

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
tried to do it at home in there but it

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.900 
tried to do it at home in there but it
becomes<00:02:53.300> easier<00:02:53.720> to<00:02:53.780> fly<00:02:54.050> as<00:02:55.010> you<00:02:55.220> do<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:55.489> a<00:02:55.550> bit

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
becomes easier to fly as you do it a bit

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.520 
becomes easier to fly as you do it a bit
yeah<00:02:56.330> there's<00:02:56.599> where<00:02:56.780> that<00:02:56.810> thermal<00:02:57.260> is<00:02:57.349> right

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
yeah there's where that thermal is right

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.940 
yeah there's where that thermal is right
there<00:02:58.239> let's<00:02:59.239> try<00:02:59.330> to<00:02:59.450> get<00:02:59.599> that<00:02:59.750> again<00:02:59.989> always

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
there let's try to get that again always

you got to switch from those in the tail

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.530 
you got to switch from those in the tail
tail<00:05:09.990> out<00:05:10.320> you<00:05:11.220> can<00:05:11.370> lose<00:05:11.490> orientation<00:05:11.730> easily

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540

with these things easily but they are
fun<00:05:20.100> once<00:05:20.310> you<00:05:20.400> figure<00:05:20.669> them<00:05:20.790> on<00:05:20.970> let's<00:05:21.750> go<00:05:21.870> up
