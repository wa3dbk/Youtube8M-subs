going<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.659> need<00:01:12.840> some<00:01:13.049> TNT<00:01:14.330> so<00:01:15.650> place<00:01:16.650> TNT<00:01:17.490> on

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
going to need some TNT so place TNT on

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.260 
going to need some TNT so place TNT on
all<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.110> rows<00:01:19.549> except<00:01:20.549> for<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.939> last

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
all of the rows except for the last

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.530 
all of the rows except for the last
block<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:22.110> each<00:01:22.470> row<00:01:23.330> so<00:01:24.330> i'll<00:01:24.479> show<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.720> here

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
block in each row so i'll show you here

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.569 
block in each row so i'll show you here
all<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:28.049> way<00:01:28.080> down<00:01:30.049> but<00:01:31.049> do<00:01:31.320> not<00:01:31.590> put<00:01:32.070> one<00:01:32.310> in

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
all the way down but do not put one in

all the way down but do not put one in
the<00:01:32.790> last<00:01:32.970> block<00:01:33.420> there<00:01:34.040> because<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.250> will

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
the last block there because it will

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.120 
the last block there because it will
actually<00:01:35.759> stop<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.570> water<00:01:37.020> flow<00:01:37.350> entirely

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
actually stop the water flow entirely

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.359 
actually stop the water flow entirely
and<00:01:38.509> without<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.689> water<00:01:39.900> flow<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.500> will<00:01:40.740> blow

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
and without the water flow it will blow

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.969 
and without the water flow it will blow
everything<00:01:41.820> up<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.930> water<00:01:43.170> actually<00:01:43.439> nerfs

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
everything up the water actually nerfs

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.300 
everything up the water actually nerfs
the<00:01:44.340> damage<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.000> tnt<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.920> doesn't<00:01:47.100> blow

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
the damage of the tnt so it doesn't blow

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:55.770 
the damage of the tnt so it doesn't blow
anything<00:01:47.640> up<00:01:48.920> we<00:01:49.920> go<00:01:54.259> don't<00:01:55.259> worry

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
anything up we go don't worry

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.840 
anything up we go don't worry
you<00:01:55.810> do<00:01:55.990> accidentally<00:01:56.530> place<00:01:56.830> a<00:01:56.860> block<00:01:57.250> of<00:01:57.460> TNT

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
you do accidentally place a block of TNT

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.850 
you do accidentally place a block of TNT
in<00:01:58.030> this<00:01:58.270> one<00:01:58.690> spot<00:01:58.720> just<00:01:59.320> dig<00:01:59.560> a<00:01:59.590> hole

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
in this one spot just dig a hole

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.940 
in this one spot just dig a hole
underneath<00:02:00.930> put<00:02:01.930> some<00:02:02.080> more<00:02:02.229> water<00:02:02.470> in<00:02:02.740> there

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
underneath put some more water in there

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.789 
underneath put some more water in there
hit<00:02:03.159> the<00:02:03.190> TNT<00:02:03.760> and<00:02:03.970> that<00:02:04.119> should<00:02:04.360> work<00:02:04.799> so

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
hit the TNT and that should work so

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.609 
hit the TNT and that should work so
here's<00:02:06.369> my<00:02:06.460> launch<00:02:06.820> pad<00:02:07.119> it's<00:02:08.050> all<00:02:08.170> set<00:02:08.590> up

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
here's my launch pad it's all set up

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.670 
here's my launch pad it's all set up
nice<00:02:09.009> perfectly<00:02:09.640> fine<00:02:10.080> redstone<00:02:11.080> all<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.560> way

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
nice perfectly fine redstone all the way

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.130 
nice perfectly fine redstone all the way
down<00:02:11.890> connecting<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:12.850> a<00:02:12.880> pressure<00:02:13.180> plate<00:02:13.450> so

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
down connecting to a pressure plate so

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.900 
down connecting to a pressure plate so
when<00:02:14.260> I<00:02:14.290> step<00:02:14.650> on<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:14.920> pressure<00:02:15.100> plate<00:02:15.250> it

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
when I step on the pressure plate it

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.240 
when I step on the pressure plate it
will<00:02:16.090> ignite<00:02:16.239> all<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.959> TNT<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:18.300> blow<00:02:19.300> up<00:02:19.330> and

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
will ignite all the TNT and blow up and

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.229 
will ignite all the TNT and blow up and

anyways so here I go I'm going to step
on<00:04:27.430> the<00:04:27.759> pressure<00:04:27.970> plate<00:04:28.150> it's<00:04:28.870> going<00:04:29.110> to<00:04:29.139> set

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
on the pressure plate it's going to set

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.770 
on the pressure plate it's going to set
off<00:04:29.740> all<00:04:29.919> the<00:04:30.099> TNT<00:04:30.460> going<00:04:31.180> to<00:04:31.240> launch<00:04:31.419> into<00:04:31.660> the

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
off all the TNT going to launch into the

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.080 
off all the TNT going to launch into the
sky<00:04:32.110> and<00:04:32.349> I'm<00:04:32.560> going<00:04:32.740> to<00:04:32.800> aim<00:04:32.919> for<00:04:32.949> this<00:04:33.370> little

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
sky and I'm going to aim for this little

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.779 
sky and I'm going to aim for this little
water<00:04:34.419> pit<00:04:34.690> I've<00:04:34.870> created<00:04:35.340> really<00:04:36.340> quick

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
water pit I've created really quick

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:41.970 
water pit I've created really quick
crappy<00:04:37.509> water<00:04:37.720> pit<00:04:37.930> ok<00:04:38.620> so<00:04:38.680> here<00:04:39.039> I<00:04:39.099> go

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:48.510 

ah<00:04:45.780> see<00:04:46.780> you<00:04:46.810> get<00:04:47.110> launched<00:04:47.620> really<00:04:48.100> high<00:04:48.280> in

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
ah see you get launched really high in

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.890 
ah see you get launched really high in
for<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.150> water<00:04:49.330> bit<00:04:49.540> ya<00:04:50.170> did<00:04:50.950> it<00:04:51.420> ok<00:04:52.420> there<00:04:52.750> we

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
for the water bit ya did it ok there we

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.210 
for the water bit ya did it ok there we
are<00:04:53.050> and<00:04:53.910> now<00:04:54.910> everything's<00:04:55.840> good<00:04:56.680> because<00:04:57.100> of

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
are and now everything's good because of

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.910 
are and now everything's good because of
the<00:04:57.310> water<00:04:57.550> flowing<00:04:58.330> water<00:04:58.630> pushes<00:04:59.140> the<00:04:59.350> TNT

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
the water flowing water pushes the TNT

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.960 
the water flowing water pushes the TNT
so<00:05:00.760> it's<00:05:01.510> a<00:05:01.720> it's<00:05:02.650> a<00:05:02.710> really<00:05:02.920> neat<00:05:03.220> system<00:05:03.550> and

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
so it's a it's a really neat system and

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.250 
so it's a it's a really neat system and
if<00:05:04.930> you<00:05:05.110> want<00:05:05.320> to<00:05:05.500> even<00:05:05.830> go<00:05:06.780> make<00:05:07.780> it<00:05:07.930> even

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
if you want to even go make it even

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:16.290 
if you want to even go make it even
better<00:05:12.810> this<00:05:13.810> works<00:05:14.230> I<00:05:14.700> believe<00:05:15.700> a<00:05:15.730> little

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
better this works I believe a little

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.130 
better this works I believe a little
better<00:05:16.570> if<00:05:16.870> you<00:05:17.170> use<00:05:17.470> a<00:05:17.710> minecart<00:05:19.020> so<00:05:20.020> I'm

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
better if you use a minecart so I'm

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.040 
better if you use a minecart so I'm
going<00:05:20.320> to<00:05:20.350> set<00:05:21.340> it<00:05:21.370> all<00:05:21.610> up<00:05:21.640> again<00:05:21.940> and<00:05:22.300> try

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
going to set it all up again and try

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.670 
going to set it all up again and try
using<00:05:23.260> a<00:05:23.500> minecart<00:05:25.020> so<00:05:26.020> I've<00:05:26.110> done<00:05:26.320> this<00:05:26.470> in

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
using a minecart so I've done this in

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.320 
using a minecart so I've done this in
multiplayer<00:05:27.220> and<00:05:27.550> it<00:05:27.670> worked<00:05:27.910> way<00:05:28.300> better

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
multiplayer and it worked way better

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.110 
multiplayer and it worked way better
with<00:05:28.750> a<00:05:28.780> minecart<00:05:29.350> this<00:05:30.220> is<00:05:30.340> my<00:05:30.550> first<00:05:30.880> time

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
with a minecart this is my first time

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.360 
with a minecart this is my first time
trying<00:05:31.420> it<00:05:31.660> on<00:05:31.780> single<00:05:32.230> player<00:05:32.380> with<00:05:33.340> a

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
trying it on single player with a

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.200 
trying it on single player with a
minecart<00:05:34.530> so<00:05:35.530> let's<00:05:35.860> see<00:05:36.040> if<00:05:36.130> any<00:05:36.790> of<00:05:37.000> the

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
minecart so let's see if any of the

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.290 
minecart so let's see if any of the
results<00:05:37.360> vary<00:05:38.190> so<00:05:39.190> I'm<00:05:39.460> going<00:05:39.670> to<00:05:39.760> remove<00:05:40.090> that

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
results vary so I'm going to remove that

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.520 
results vary so I'm going to remove that
piece<00:05:40.540> of<00:05:40.600> redstone<00:05:42.540> let<00:05:43.540> me<00:05:43.660> spawn<00:05:44.080> some

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
piece of redstone let me spawn some

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:50.070
