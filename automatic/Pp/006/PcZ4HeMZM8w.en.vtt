00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
in the future has planned I think this

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:32.889 
in the future has planned I think this
is<00:01:30.979> also<00:01:31.159> put<00:01:31.579> the<00:01:31.880> nail<00:01:32.090> in<00:01:32.119> the<00:01:32.389> coffin<00:01:32.420> for

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
is also put the nail in the coffin for

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:34.899 
is also put the nail in the coffin for
the<00:01:33.139> indoctrination<00:01:33.380> of<00:01:33.829> the<00:01:34.009> area<00:01:34.249> I<00:01:34.279> think<00:01:34.340> I

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
the indoctrination of the area I think I

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.149 
the indoctrination of the area I think I
really<00:01:35.749> wanted<00:01:36.020> that<00:01:36.109> theory<00:01:36.469> to<00:01:36.529> be<00:01:36.590> true<00:01:36.679> it

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
really wanted that theory to be true it

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.019 
really wanted that theory to be true it
was<00:01:37.279> a<00:01:37.340> good<00:01:37.579> theory<00:01:37.969> it<00:01:38.299> made<00:01:38.959> sense<00:01:39.880> and<00:01:40.880> it

00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:41.029 
was a good theory it made sense and it

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:43.480 
was a good theory it made sense and it
made<00:01:41.179> the<00:01:41.329> ending<00:01:41.689> our<00:01:42.439> current<00:01:42.829> ending<00:01:43.130> not

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
made the ending our current ending not

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.279 
made the ending our current ending not
so<00:01:43.729> much<00:01:43.849> at<00:01:43.999> face<00:01:44.179> value<00:01:44.630> and<00:01:44.659> it<00:01:45.049> would<00:01:45.200> have

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
so much at face value and it would have

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.139 
so much at face value and it would have
been<00:01:45.349> brilliant<00:01:45.799> really<00:01:46.130> well<00:01:46.909> though<00:01:46.999> we've

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
been brilliant really well though we've

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.919 
been brilliant really well though we've
been<00:01:47.299> good<00:01:47.719> anyway<00:01:48.439> but<00:01:48.709> no<00:01:49.549> I<00:01:49.999> don't<00:01:50.630> think<00:01:50.719> so

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
this summer so we got a little while to

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.210 
this summer so we got a little while to
wait<00:02:40.750> yet<00:02:41.140> right<00:02:41.410> so<00:02:41.650> I<00:02:41.680> don't<00:02:41.920> think<00:02:42.100> they

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
wait yet right so I don't think they

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.920 
wait yet right so I don't think they
plan<00:02:42.490> this<00:02:42.700> from<00:02:42.910> a<00:02:42.940> start<00:02:43.270> which<00:02:43.450> is<00:02:43.600> kind<00:02:43.840> of

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
plan this from a start which is kind of

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.560 
plan this from a start which is kind of
sad<00:02:43.990> they<00:02:44.590> gave<00:02:44.860> us<00:02:45.100> this<00:02:45.250> ending<00:02:45.730> they

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
sad they gave us this ending they

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:47.640 
sad they gave us this ending they
actually<00:02:46.690> thought<00:02:46.990> it<00:02:47.050> would<00:02:47.230> be<00:02:47.320> good<00:02:47.470> enough

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
actually thought it would be good enough

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.530 
actually thought it would be good enough
oh<00:02:49.740> it's<00:02:50.740> not<00:02:50.950> holding<00:02:51.100> up<00:02:51.400> much<00:02:52.090> faith<00:02:52.510> in

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
oh it's not holding up much faith in

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.320 
oh it's not holding up much faith in
them<00:02:53.200> as<00:02:53.380> is<00:02:53.710> it<00:02:53.920> they<00:02:54.730> actually<00:02:54.910> thought<00:02:55.180> this

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
them as is it they actually thought this

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.460 
them as is it they actually thought this
would<00:02:55.510> be<00:02:55.540> good<00:02:55.720> enough<00:02:55.900> so<00:02:56.140> it's<00:02:56.350> actually

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
would be good enough so it's actually

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.720 
would be good enough so it's actually
taking<00:02:56.890> it's<00:02:57.100> going<00:02:57.220> to<00:02:57.280> take<00:02:57.400> them<00:02:57.490> quite<00:02:57.700> a

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
example Shepherd yeah loud enough that

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.610

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
what all the fuss is about I think that

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.360 
what all the fuss is about I think that
pretty<00:03:36.100> much<00:03:36.190> sums<00:03:36.610> it<00:03:36.760> up

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
pretty much sums it up

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.509 
pretty much sums it up
so<00:03:38.940> what<00:03:39.150> do<00:03:39.209> you<00:03:39.330> guys<00:03:39.480> think<00:03:39.540> is<00:03:40.370> this<00:03:41.370> going

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
so what do you guys think is this going

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:42.680 
so what do you guys think is this going
to<00:03:41.549> be<00:03:41.670> enough<00:03:41.909> for<00:03:42.090> you<00:03:42.239> or<00:03:42.450> were<00:03:42.629> you

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
to be enough for you or were you

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.509 
to be enough for you or were you
expecting<00:03:43.049> more<00:03:43.409> more<00:03:43.739> gameplay<00:03:43.950> or<00:03:44.190> your

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
expecting more more gameplay or your

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.740 
expecting more more gameplay or your
real<00:03:44.730> over<00:03:45.239> you're<00:03:45.480> really<00:03:45.840> counting<00:03:46.290> on<00:03:46.409> that

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
real over you're really counting on that

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.479 
real over you're really counting on that
indoctrination<00:03:48.750> theory<00:03:49.170> if<00:03:49.470> they<00:03:50.430> were

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
indoctrination theory if they were

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.130 
indoctrination theory if they were
planning<00:03:50.849> on<00:03:50.940> indoctrination<00:03:51.540> theory<00:03:51.900> and

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
planning on indoctrination theory and

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.110 
planning on indoctrination theory and
they're<00:03:52.230> still<00:03:52.470> trying<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.830> do<00:03:52.920> it<00:03:53.069> I<00:03:53.250> don't

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
they're still trying to do it I don't

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.410 
they're still trying to do it I don't
think<00:03:54.239> that<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.379> sixth<00:03:55.819> extended<00:03:56.819> cut

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
think that the the sixth extended cut

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.149 
think that the the sixth extended cut
scenes<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:58.140> epilogue<00:03:58.500> is<00:03:58.739> going<00:03:58.890> to<00:03:58.950> pull<00:03:59.129> it

00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 
scenes and epilogue is going to pull it

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:01.490 
scenes and epilogue is going to pull it
off<00:03:59.370> so<00:04:00.120> I<00:04:00.150> don't<00:04:00.390> think<00:04:00.659> that's<00:04:00.810> it<00:04:01.110> I<00:04:01.260> think

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
off so I don't think that's it I think

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.080 
off so I don't think that's it I think
they're<00:04:01.620> just<00:04:01.829> going<00:04:02.010> to<00:04:02.069> add<00:04:02.310> in<00:04:02.370> more

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
they're just going to add in more

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.170 
they're just going to add in more
answers<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:04.140> more<00:04:04.260> clarity<00:04:04.799> to<00:04:05.010> it<00:04:05.930> so<00:04:08.180> what

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
answers and more clarity to it so what

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
really hoping that Bioware can pull this

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.690 
really hoping that Bioware can pull this
extended<00:04:39.630> cut<00:04:39.870> off<00:04:40.729> so

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700

sooner<00:04:45.100> than<00:04:45.220> we<00:04:45.400> hope<00:04:45.610> and<00:04:47.010> I<00:04:48.010> wish<00:04:48.250> by<00:04:48.490> where

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
sooner than we hope and I wish by where

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:55.590 
sooner than we hope and I wish by where
all<00:04:49.000> the<00:04:49.180> luck<00:04:49.420> on<00:04:52.230> delivering<00:04:53.230> this<00:04:54.570> but<00:04:55.570> I

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
all the luck on delivering this but I

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.090 
all the luck on delivering this but I
think<00:04:55.840> some<00:04:56.290> people<00:04:56.590> are<00:04:56.710> going<00:04:56.890> to<00:04:56.980> be

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
think some people are going to be

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.370 
think some people are going to be
disappointed<00:04:57.250> and<00:04:58.120> well<00:04:58.630> this<00:04:59.050> could<00:04:59.290> be

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
disappointed and well this could be

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.800 
disappointed and well this could be
enough<00:04:59.620> for<00:04:59.770> some<00:04:59.950> people<00:04:59.980> I'm<00:05:00.430> I<00:05:00.790> think<00:05:01.720> this

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
enough for some people I'm I think this

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.020 
enough for some people I'm I think this
is<00:05:02.110> more<00:05:02.410> than<00:05:02.680> what<00:05:02.920> I<00:05:02.950> was<00:05:03.250> expecting<00:05:03.310> from

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
is more than what I was expecting from

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.080 
is more than what I was expecting from
them<00:05:04.240> I<00:05:05.550> was<00:05:06.550> hoping<00:05:06.970> I<00:05:07.150> get<00:05:07.210> more<00:05:07.660> but<00:05:07.990> again
