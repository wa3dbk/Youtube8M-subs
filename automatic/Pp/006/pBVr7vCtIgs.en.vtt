level but one of my levels is for

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.539 
level but one of my levels is for
germinating<00:00:12.929> seeds<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.530> what's<00:00:14.070> important

centimeters but this is a level where I
germinate<00:00:38.790> my<00:00:38.940> seeds<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.719> kale

germinate my seeds and this is kale
that's<00:00:40.290> coming<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.770> if<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.640> go<00:00:41.790> up<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.910> my<00:00:42.120> next

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
that's coming in if you go up to my next

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.459 
that's coming in if you go up to my next
level<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:43.520> use<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.789> for<00:00:45.329> seedlings<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.289> have

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
level I use this for seedlings that have

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.069 
level I use this for seedlings that have
been<00:00:46.590> growing<00:00:46.829> for<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.219> while<00:00:47.570> the<00:00:48.570> fluorescent

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
been growing for a while the fluorescent

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.520 
been growing for a while the fluorescent
bulb<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.620> about<00:00:50.460> four<00:00:51.120> inches<00:00:51.480> from<00:00:52.410> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
bulb is about four inches from the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.830 
bulb is about four inches from the
starting<00:00:52.920> mix<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.309> ten<00:00:53.489> centimeters<00:00:53.730> but<00:00:54.690> this

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
starting mix of ten centimeters but this

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.369 
starting mix of ten centimeters but this
is<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> bulbs<00:00:55.890> again<00:00:56.370> are<00:00:56.610> staying

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
is so that the bulbs again are staying

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.170 
is so that the bulbs again are staying
to<00:00:58.379> about<00:00:58.890> two<00:00:59.100> inches<00:00:59.399> maybe<00:00:59.640> three<00:00:59.969> inches

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
to about two inches maybe three inches

above the leaves in the faster growing
plants<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.300> can<00:01:03.420> see<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.809> they're<00:01:03.930> almost

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
plants you can see that they're almost

when<00:01:30.180> you're<00:01:30.329> germinating<00:01:30.930> seeds<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.530> your

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
when you're germinating seeds so your

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.460 
when you're germinating seeds so your
plants<00:01:32.040> don't<00:01:32.250> become<00:01:32.549> leggy<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.299> have<00:01:34.140> two

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
plants don't become leggy I have two

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.010 
plants don't become leggy I have two
fixtures<00:01:34.950> up<00:01:35.310> here<00:01:35.610> two<00:01:36.450> bulbs<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:36.900> each

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
fixtures up here two bulbs in each

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.929 
fixtures up here two bulbs in each
fixture<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.979> what<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.280> allows<00:01:38.579> me<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.909> do<00:01:40.939> is

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
fixture and what this allows me to do is

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.230 
fixture and what this allows me to do is
I<00:01:42.119> can<00:01:42.360> put<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:42.930> four<00:01:43.500> flats<00:01:44.000> going<00:01:45.000> all<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
I can put in four flats going all the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.670 
I can put in four flats going all the
way<00:01:45.329> across<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.689> that's<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.140> whole<00:01:46.500> lot<00:01:46.649> of

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
way across and that's a whole lot of

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.920 
way across and that's a whole lot of
seedlings<00:01:47.159> if<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.909> only<00:01:48.119> have<00:01:48.390> room<00:01:48.570> for<00:01:48.630> one

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
seedlings if you only have room for one

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.700 
seedlings if you only have room for one
fixture<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:50.100> just<00:01:50.310> have<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.579> put<00:01:50.759> your<00:01:51.710> self

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
fixture you just have to put your self

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.590 
fixture you just have to put your self
left<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.189> way<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.729> then<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.180> can<00:01:54.210> end<00:01:54.479> up

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
left this way and then you can end up

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.060 
left this way and then you can end up
putting<00:01:55.070> two<00:01:56.070> going<00:01:56.549> across<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:57.409> also<00:01:58.409> use<00:01:58.740> foil

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
putting two going across I also use foil

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.469 
putting two going across I also use foil
if<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.369> look<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.759> back<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.240> see<00:02:00.450> the

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
if you look in the back you see the

one with a foil all the way across and
that<00:02:30.880> will<00:02:31.030> reflect<00:02:31.330> light<00:02:31.630> back<00:02:31.660> up<00:02:31.990> so<00:02:32.380> when

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
that will reflect light back up so when

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.910 
that will reflect light back up so when
I<00:02:32.530> close<00:02:32.890> this<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:34.750> light<00:02:34.960> reflects<00:02:35.620> off<00:02:35.830> the
