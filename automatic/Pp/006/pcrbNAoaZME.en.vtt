00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.699 
mp3 file and then it directly sends
those<00:02:49.489> fights<00:02:49.850> to<00:02:50.769> the<00:02:51.769> BS<00:02:53.110> 1053<00:02:54.110> decoder

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
those fights to the BS 1053 decoder

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.180 
those fights to the BS 1053 decoder
through<00:02:55.250> SPI<00:02:55.819> and<00:02:56.269> then<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.380> decoder<00:02:57.860> and

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
through SPI and then the decoder and

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.180 
through SPI and then the decoder and
yeah<00:02:59.120> it<00:02:59.420> actually<00:02:59.630> does<00:03:00.049> the<00:03:00.230> rest<00:03:00.380> by

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
yeah it actually does the rest by

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:08.680 
yeah it actually does the rest by
decoding<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.940> mp3<00:03:02.390> file<00:03:02.600> and<00:03:07.690> I've

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
decoding the mp3 file and I've

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.280 
decoding the mp3 file and I've
implemented<00:03:09.530> so<00:03:09.950> if<00:03:10.670> you<00:03:10.970> write<00:03:11.150> if<00:03:11.540> you<00:03:12.049> write

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
implemented so if you write if you write

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.050 
implemented so if you write if you write
stop<00:03:12.709> or<00:03:13.310> just<00:03:14.269> s<00:03:14.739> it<00:03:15.739> will<00:03:16.010> stop<00:03:16.370> playing<00:03:16.700> but

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
stop or just s it will stop playing but

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.930 
stop or just s it will stop playing but
it<00:03:17.239> will<00:03:17.420> not<00:03:17.660> just<00:03:17.959> stop<00:03:18.739> it<00:03:19.040> will<00:03:19.310> fade<00:03:19.640> down

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
it will not just stop it will fade down

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:30.440 
it will not just stop it will fade down
and<00:03:21.190> try<00:03:22.190> and<00:03:22.489> listen

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.310 

and<00:03:32.340> then<00:03:33.340> it's<00:03:33.520> this<00:03:33.730> finished<00:03:34.180> plane<00:03:34.480> so<00:03:35.170> now

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
and then it's this finished plane so now

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.310 
and then it's this finished plane so now
I<00:03:35.350> can<00:03:35.500> play<00:03:35.830> another<00:03:36.010> song<00:03:36.430> I<00:03:37.050> got<00:03:38.050> another

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
I can play another song I got another

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.080 
I can play another song I got another
one<00:03:38.980> up<00:03:39.160> here<00:03:39.400> I<00:03:40.140> got<00:03:41.140> for<00:03:41.440> example<00:03:41.880> stain<00:03:42.880> on

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
one up here I got for example stain on

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.410 
one up here I got for example stain on
the<00:03:43.180> ground<00:03:43.710> so<00:03:44.710> let's<00:03:44.950> write<00:03:45.850> P<00:03:46.360> and<00:03:47.010> then

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
the ground so let's write P and then

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:57.960 
the ground so let's write P and then
stamp<00:03:50.970> top<00:03:51.970> mp3<00:03:52.270> and<00:03:53.940> enter<00:03:54.940> and<00:03:56.700> this<00:03:57.700> song

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
stamp top mp3 and enter and this song

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.540 
stamp top mp3 and enter and this song
has<00:03:58.540> a<00:03:58.600> weird<00:03:58.990> beginning<00:03:59.650> because<00:03:59.830> it<00:04:00.130> takes<00:04:00.400> a

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
has a weird beginning because it takes a

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.520 
has a weird beginning because it takes a
couple<00:04:00.670> of<00:04:00.850> seconds<00:04:01.270> before<00:04:01.420> the<00:04:01.870> song<00:04:02.110> starts

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
couple of seconds before the song starts

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.890 
couple of seconds before the song starts
but<00:04:02.709> actually<00:04:03.070> it<00:04:03.370> is<00:04:03.580> started<00:04:04.120> and<00:04:04.209> it<00:04:04.750> has

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
but actually it is started and it has

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.080 
but actually it is started and it has
starts<00:04:05.320> sending<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:05.920> mp3<00:04:06.430> data<00:04:06.700> to<00:04:07.390> the<00:04:07.560> vs

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
starts sending the mp3 data to the vs

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:27.590 
starts sending the mp3 data to the vs
1053<00:04:10.090> decoder<00:04:11.940> there<00:04:12.940> it<00:04:13.060> comes
