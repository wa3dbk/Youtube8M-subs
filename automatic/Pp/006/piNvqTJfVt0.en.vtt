00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.140 
sure
and<00:03:16.080> sometimes<00:03:16.590> I<00:03:16.739> will<00:03:16.950> use<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.250> flexi<00:03:17.670> but<00:03:18.120> I

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
and sometimes I will use the flexi but I

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.650 
and sometimes I will use the flexi but I
have<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:18.630> wound<00:03:18.870> all<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.470> way<00:03:19.590> out<00:03:20.510> so<00:03:21.510> that<00:03:21.540> my

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
have it wound all the way out so that my

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.720 
have it wound all the way out so that my
dog<00:03:21.900> has<00:03:22.230> lots<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.709> lots<00:03:22.890> of<00:03:23.040> room<00:03:23.220> but<00:03:23.670> I

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
dog has lots and lots of room but I

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.150 
dog has lots and lots of room but I
don't<00:03:23.970> let<00:03:24.090> it<00:03:24.120> retract<00:03:24.480> back<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:24.959> forth<00:03:25.200> and

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
don't let it retract back and forth and

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.479 
don't let it retract back and forth and
the<00:03:26.280> reason<00:03:26.700> is<00:03:26.940> show<00:03:27.840> you<00:03:27.989> real<00:03:28.200> quick<00:03:28.489> is

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
the reason is show you real quick is

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.210 
the reason is show you real quick is
that<00:03:29.550> you<00:03:29.850> can<00:03:30.030> see<00:03:30.300> at<00:03:31.140> all<00:03:31.350> times<00:03:31.739> when<00:03:32.070> my

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
that you can see at all times when my

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.840 
that you can see at all times when my

he's got it on look at his collar it's
always<00:03:39.750> tight<00:03:40.050> and<00:03:40.440> if<00:03:40.980> I<00:03:41.160> want<00:03:41.370> a<00:03:41.430> job<00:03:41.580> to

means a loose leash this flexi lead will

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.860 
means a loose leash this flexi lead will
never<00:03:46.860> teach<00:03:47.280> him<00:03:47.489> that<00:03:47.670> he's<00:03:48.269> always<00:03:48.510> gonna

never teach him that he's always gonna
learn<00:03:49.140> that<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:49.890> go<00:03:50.070> anywhere<00:03:50.400> he<00:03:50.459> has<00:03:50.820> to<00:03:51.030> pull

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
learn that to go anywhere he has to pull

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.600 
learn that to go anywhere he has to pull
I<00:03:51.510> mean<00:03:52.410> that<00:03:52.530> and<00:03:52.680> I'm<00:03:52.860> not<00:03:53.040> pulling<00:03:53.340> on<00:03:53.430> that

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
I mean that and I'm not pulling on that

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.580 
I mean that and I'm not pulling on that
I<00:03:53.910> can't<00:03:54.390> even<00:03:54.450> retract<00:03:54.870> it<00:03:54.989> in<00:03:55.110> that's<00:03:55.320> just

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
I can't even retract it in that's just

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.259 
I can't even retract it in that's just
the<00:03:55.680> standard<00:03:55.890> pull<00:03:56.760> that<00:03:56.970> you've<00:03:57.090> got<00:03:57.239> on

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
the standard pull that you've got on

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.330 
the standard pull that you've got on
this<00:03:57.570> I<00:03:57.840> don't<00:03:58.290> want<00:03:58.500> my<00:03:58.590> dog<00:03:58.769> learning<00:03:59.220> that

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
this I don't want my dog learning that

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.890 
this I don't want my dog learning that
the<00:03:59.640> collar<00:03:59.850> should<00:04:00.000> always<00:04:00.330> be<00:04:00.630> tight<00:04:00.870> for

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
the collar should always be tight for

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.820 
the collar should always be tight for
him<00:04:01.230> to<00:04:01.350> move

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
him to move

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.210 
him to move
so<00:04:02.340> I<00:04:02.670> rarely<00:04:03.420> use<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:04.290> flexi<00:04:04.680> leash<00:04:04.860> I

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
so I rarely use the flexi leash I

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.940 
so I rarely use the flexi leash I
typically<00:04:08.240> will<00:04:09.240> use<00:04:09.300> the<00:04:09.600> six<00:04:09.810> footer<00:04:10.050> or<00:04:10.800> the

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
typically will use the six footer or the

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.510 
typically will use the six footer or the
shorter<00:04:11.280> one<00:04:11.430> when<00:04:12.180> we<00:04:12.300> need<00:04:12.480> tight<00:04:13.380> spaces<00:04:13.890> so

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
shorter one when we need tight spaces so

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.479 
shorter one when we need tight spaces so
hopefully<00:04:15.620> this<00:04:16.620> has<00:04:16.769> helped<00:04:17.070> you<00:04:17.190> sort<00:04:17.430> of
