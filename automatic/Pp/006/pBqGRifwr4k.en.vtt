00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:04.720
 hello in the parish of power in the council of gozÃ³n in a park very 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.639
 beautiful with a beautiful landscape worth seeing and also to play because there 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.269
 few children 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.789
 but it is also a certain moment and a very curious story about the 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:17.749
 monument dedicated a count of the royal pleased percent 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:20.749
 reprogrammed around the world 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.220
 the monument to memory la mario Ã¡lvarez buylla count of real pleasure 

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:31.380
 without love the count's death made it difficult in 1948 for the poor a few meters from his 

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:34.109
 palace track located in what many years later 

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:38.329
 in 1997 it was transformed into a nice park with games for children 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.930
 no the count was not always count its origin is that of an emigrant who amassed 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.460
 A great fortune in Cuba and CaraguatÃ¡ in Spain says important favors 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.490
 economic to king Alfonso prat gay in gratitude granted him the title 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.320
 of the royal count 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.090
 apparently in power he exhibited the same arts with beds his fortunes 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.550
 buying for good ok for bad a large part of the lands of the 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.650
 parish so the neighbors do not keep the Count's good pleasure 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.590
 and this was reflected first in the face of the bust that presides over the 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.890
 monument and before a few years in the beheading of it 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.010
 the cove was sent to madrid for its restoration but fate made 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.170
 Missing shipping 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.530
 currently the decapitated bust remains on the ground resulting in a 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.080
 strange image for a participant 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.950
 and what is even more disturbing is the beautiful palace remains abandoned 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.780
 trapped by a conflict of roles that prevents his recovery and seeing how 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.450
 interesting elements such as the collection of old cars are lost 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.560
 found the deceased percent aided percent 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.560
 In the middle of nowhere 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.730
