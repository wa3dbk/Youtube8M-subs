late<00:01:07.200> in<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.530> game<00:01:08.070> but<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:08.970> believe<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.409> in

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
late in the game but I believe that in

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.090 
late in the game but I believe that in
Sweden<00:01:11.510> Sweden<00:01:12.510> will<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.140> open<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> bit

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
Sweden Sweden will have to open a bit

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.420 
Sweden Sweden will have to open a bit
mark<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.960> we<00:01:15.960> saw<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.409> big<00:01:16.710> difference<00:01:17.280> of

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
mark and we saw a big difference of

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.120 
mark and we saw a big difference of
quality<00:01:18.170> with<00:01:19.170> these<00:01:19.409> two<00:01:19.619> teams<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
quality with these two teams in the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.190 
quality with these two teams in the
field<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:21.150> believe<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.540> Portugal<00:01:22.049> we

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
field and I believe that Portugal we

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.880 
field and I believe that Portugal we
will<00:01:22.680> grab<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.880> opportunities<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.890> Sweden

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
will grab the opportunities that Sweden

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.330 
will grab the opportunities that Sweden
will<00:01:26.280> will<00:01:26.729> will<00:01:27.270> open<00:01:27.840> on<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.500> second<00:01:28.860> leg<00:01:29.009> so

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
bookies have pretty much got everything

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.480

are<00:01:50.700> low<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.210> definitely<00:01:51.869> think<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.140> value

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
are low I definitely think the value

are low I definitely think the value
does<00:01:52.649> lie<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.220> picking<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.790> winner<00:01:53.939> sweden<00:01:54.659> 2.63

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
does lie in picking a winner sweden 2.63

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.550 
does lie in picking a winner sweden 2.63
Portugal's<00:01:56.159> 2.88<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.930> you're<00:01:58.140> going<00:01:58.320> for<00:01:58.530> a

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
Portugal's 2.88 so you're going for a

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.300 
Portugal's 2.88 so you're going for a
draw<00:01:58.979> no<00:01:59.369> bet<00:01:59.659> that's<00:02:00.659> also<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.960> good<00:02:01.049> bet<00:02:01.469> so
