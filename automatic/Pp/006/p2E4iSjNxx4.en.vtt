00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
made out of we use actual sand so it

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.779

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
we'll go down the line we usually have

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.490 
we'll go down the line we usually have
these<00:00:52.920> lines<00:00:53.309> spray-painted<00:00:54.090> but<00:00:54.780> today

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
first base for space they're just the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.260 
first base for space they're just the
basis<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:03.930> we<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:04.409> are<00:01:04.559> just<00:01:04.799> um<00:01:05.040> like<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
basis that we have are just um like the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.820 
basis that we have are just um like the
throw<00:01:06.600> down<00:01:06.750> bases<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.380> can<00:01:07.530> get<00:01:07.650> it

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
throw down bases that you can get it

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.700 
throw down bases that you can get it
like<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> dicks<00:01:08.880> or<00:01:09.150> Dunham's<00:01:09.630> or<00:01:09.780> anywhere<00:01:10.080> so

like a dicks or Dunham's or anywhere so

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.840 
like a dicks or Dunham's or anywhere so
they're<00:01:11.070> pretty<00:01:11.340> nice<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.210> then<00:01:12.659> we<00:01:13.049> have<00:01:13.080> a

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
they're pretty nice and then we have a

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.560 
they're pretty nice and then we have a
foul<00:01:14.850> pole<00:01:15.150> which<00:01:15.840> we<00:01:16.110> made<00:01:16.320> out<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.570> yellow

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
spray paint and we attach the PVC pipes

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.520 
spray paint and we attach the PVC pipes
together<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:22.189> down<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.430> line<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:24.350> 56<00:01:25.350> feet

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
together and down the line is 56 feet

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.060 
together and down the line is 56 feet
but<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:27.420> might<00:01:27.960> be<00:01:28.110> short<00:01:28.350> but<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.799> have<00:01:28.950> to

them set up um there's another light
here<00:01:59.130> second<00:01:59.610> base<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:01.610> up<00:02:02.610> top<00:02:02.940> is<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.570> roof

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
here second base and up top is the roof

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.740 
here second base and up top is the roof
you<00:02:04.440> hit<00:02:04.620> it<00:02:04.710> on<00:02:04.830> the<00:02:04.890> roof<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.910> a<00:02:06.150> ground

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
you hit it on the roof it is a ground

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.700 
you hit it on the roof it is a ground
rule<00:02:06.900> double<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.500> two<00:02:08.310> dead<00:02:08.580> center<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.710> 85

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
rule double and two dead center is 85

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.410 
rule double and two dead center is 85
feet<00:02:11.010> so<00:02:11.490> you<00:02:11.520> have<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.820> get<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.000> over<00:02:12.180> the
