00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:12.909
 Sinamm of the first to the second 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.909
 march on the clutch until the end 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:21.900
 the first one is releasing not much 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.640
 slowly nor push the car will start 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.600
 the floor will only control by triggering 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:31.260
 clutch not only relied on the strength of the 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:35.160
 first gear march 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:40.320
 otto using nothing showed the spring break 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:43.610
 now the problem 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:49.559
 I'll go second without speeding up the car. 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:52.430
 only controlling clutch only controlling 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.430
 clutch 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:59.680
 the car with a little faster 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:04.830
 is no longer the first to say no to 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.689
 born and holy gives up pen 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:12.659
 controlling clutch does not release the 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:18.880
 all unused clutch on the throttle in 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:21.990
 Your strength of the same car will go to 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.990
 second after this 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:31.060
 saying second clutch 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.100
 but regaining control only in the 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:39.430
 clutch the car left a little more 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:43.799
 quick in the tone I 'm all alone with the 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.799
 car running force 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:54.020

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.020

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:02.680

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:21.959
 alexandru here the force of the march will say 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.959
 it's kinda bad a lot of rock and gravel 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.730
 it's exactly the only thing that people 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.160
 It needs to be calm. 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.940
 whenever you have the steering wheel calm and 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.819
 attention never lose your temper when you 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:49.700

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:12.920
