00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.120
 good morning guys this is a 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.980
 experiment a way to try to 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.990
 anticipate learning and learning times 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.830
 practice for the workouts we will go 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.960
 to do 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.750
 let's see how that goes 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.060
 I will illustrate what we will put in 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.820
 practice then tomorrow night in training 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.970
 so in the meantime we can already put it in 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:28.740
 head what I will try to give 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.590
 a floury on the type of zone defense 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.329
 this type of game is very effective if 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.710
 every single individual does his good 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.870
 task 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.140
 each player must have one 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.120
 very specific arrangement in the field the 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.129
 initial predisposition of ours 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.180
 team will always be that of the rhombus 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:52.800
 then red team where the central 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:55.410
 offensive also called pivot has the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.559
 task of making the diagonal and covering i 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.260
 Central steps to get it right will have to 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.129
 always follow the movement of the ball 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.920
 so if the ball is on the right the 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.619
 pivot makes the movement to the right 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.659
 if the ball goes to the left it was 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.960
 passed to the left the pivot makes the 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.540
 movement to the left 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.950
 this is very important because 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.479
 in fact if the pivot is exalted 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.049
 would be very dangerous for 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.060
 the whole team and secrets then of 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.700
 this role and never go out in 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.509
 pressing but always at least at one 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.700
 meter and a half away from the 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:41.909
 from the opponent and always cover the 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.720
 diagonals passing the sides and 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.180
 side have the task of putting 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.430
 pressure to those in possession of the ball e 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.330
 make a sort of alternating elastic a 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.520
 second if the 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.250
 lies on a band rather than on 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.920
 of another the movement in practice and 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:03.650
 this ball has moved to the left 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.810
 pivot movement to the left 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:11.580
 lateral to the right and to the right 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:13.800
 right side impression rooms on 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.920
 central defensive effects one 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.430
 shift to the right 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.060
 the side proposed to be made one 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.220
 also moving to the right 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:31.709
 almost side by side with the central 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:35.010
 defensive the same thing will be done 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.890
 for the other external if the ball goes 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.470
 to the left the same movement as 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.650
 pivot left side movement 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.990
 that should be impressed movement of the 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.080
 central defensive moving towards 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.900
 left movement the opposite side 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:58.230
 which goes almost side by side 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:03:01.860
 the central defensive is important for 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.950
 this type of game and close and stay 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.570
 tight and always close the spaces you see 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.850
 see both with regard to 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:17.180
 diagonals than for horizontal passages 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:24.690
 of the verticals of our adversaries 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:28.830
 the role instead of the central defensive is 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.560
 the most static role but which has one 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.640
 great importance because he is loud 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.630
 he must always command the defense 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.570
 recalling the laterals 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.660
 position and prevent the central 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.580
 offensive stretches too far forward 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.400
 so rightly more and more compact 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:51.060
 close our team the movements 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.820
 that we are going to do the more they will be 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.010
 tight spaces for our opponents 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:04:02.550
 which will therefore have many difficulties to 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:04.620
 penetrate c regarding the 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.040
 zone defense 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:11.340
 let's say these are the notions 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:14.720
 essential basic emotions which then 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.660
 a series of precautions will follow 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:21.730
 during 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:24.670
 the actual game on the pitch tomorrow night 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:28.330
 then we will continue with this discourse e 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:30.430
 we will try to put it into practice 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.090
 good day to all that always strength 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.090
 Magnificat
