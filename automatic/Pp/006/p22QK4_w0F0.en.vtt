00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
small things you know so I mean it's

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.250 
small things you know so I mean it's
like<00:02:13.550> let's<00:02:14.550> just<00:02:14.610> get<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.260> articulation

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
like let's just get to the articulation

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.690 
like let's just get to the articulation
and<00:02:16.349> i'll<00:02:16.500> show<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.910> figure<00:02:17.910> here<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:20.160> goes<00:02:20.430> up

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
and i'll show you figure here it goes up

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.000 
and i'll show you figure here it goes up
about<00:02:20.819> their<00:02:21.180> down<00:02:21.930> it's<00:02:22.290> pretty<00:02:22.860> much<00:02:22.950> what

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
about their down it's pretty much what

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.800 
about their down it's pretty much what
you're<00:02:23.190> going<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.400> get<00:02:23.520> left<00:02:24.239> to<00:02:24.360> right<00:02:24.569> and

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
you're going to get left to right and

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.059 
you're going to get left to right and
you<00:02:24.870> can<00:02:25.140> spit<00:02:25.349> on<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.530> way<00:02:25.590> around<00:02:25.890> if<00:02:25.980> you

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
you can spit on the way around if you

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:34.160 
you can spit on the way around if you
want<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.459> so<00:02:28.910> these<00:02:29.910> are<00:02:30.980> on<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.040> hinge<00:02:33.080> so<00:02:34.080> you

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
want to so these are on a hinge so you

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.050 
want to so these are on a hinge so you
can<00:02:34.440> move<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.890> figures<00:02:36.319> arms<00:02:37.319> outward<00:02:38.060> you

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
can move the figures arms outward you

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.190 
can move the figures arms outward you
can<00:02:39.150> get<00:02:39.270> it<00:02:39.390> probably<00:02:39.720> higher<00:02:39.870> than<00:02:40.080> average

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
can get it probably higher than average

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.720 
can get it probably higher than average
don't<00:02:40.560> feel<00:02:40.680> like<00:02:40.800> it<00:02:40.950> but<00:02:41.069> i<00:02:41.250> mean<00:02:41.430> i'm<00:02:41.670> sure

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
don't feel like it but i mean i'm sure

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.010 
don't feel like it but i mean i'm sure
you<00:02:42.030> can<00:02:43.519> upper<00:02:44.519> bicep<00:02:44.730> swivel

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
you can upper bicep swivel

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.200 
you can upper bicep swivel
works<00:02:46.740> pretty<00:02:46.890> well<00:02:47.780> if<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:49.670> open<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.790> arms<00:02:51.120> a

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
works pretty well if you open the arms a

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.760 
works pretty well if you open the arms a
little<00:02:51.240> bit<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.630> lift<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:51.930> up<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.380> still

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
little bit and lift it up you still

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:59.350 
little bit and lift it up you still
can't<00:02:52.920> get<00:02:53.040> any<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:54.150> know<00:02:54.210> lift<00:02:54.960> the<00:02:55.080> arms<00:02:55.380> up

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.440 

you<00:03:00.360> have<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.630> single<00:03:01.500> hands<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.830> elbow<00:03:02.450> you

why would you not give it an ab crunch
or<00:03:18.060> at<00:03:18.750> least<00:03:18.960> a<00:03:19.080> waste<00:03:19.320> swivel<00:03:19.970> get<00:03:20.970> down<00:03:21.150> to

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
or at least a waste swivel get down to

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.910 
or at least a waste swivel get down to
these<00:03:22.550> upper<00:03:23.550> thighs<00:03:23.960> you<00:03:24.960> practice<00:03:25.320> printing

these upper thighs you practice printing

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.130 
these upper thighs you practice printing
figures<00:03:26.400> legs<00:03:26.610> about<00:03:26.880> that<00:03:27.120> far<00:03:27.390> apart<00:03:27.510> which

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
figures legs about that far apart which

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.290 
figures legs about that far apart which
is<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.380> nice<00:03:28.770> improvement<00:03:29.520> over<00:03:29.730> what<00:03:29.760> DC

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
is a nice improvement over what DC
