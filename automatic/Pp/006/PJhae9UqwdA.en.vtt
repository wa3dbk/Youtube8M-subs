concealer with an eyeshadow fluffy brush

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.290 
concealer with an eyeshadow fluffy brush
and<00:00:48.600> it's<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.410> natural<00:00:49.590> hair<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.309> know<00:00:50.700> typically

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
and it's a natural hair I know typically

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.840 
and it's a natural hair I know typically
we<00:00:51.510> use<00:00:51.539> synthetic<00:00:51.899> which<00:00:52.379> works<00:00:52.800> as<00:00:53.039> well<00:00:53.100> but

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
we use synthetic which works as well but

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.389 
we use synthetic which works as well but
it<00:00:54.030> also<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.510> bit<00:00:54.719> more<00:00:54.899> dense<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.500> like<00:00:56.129> using

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
it also is a bit more dense I like using

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.029 
it also is a bit more dense I like using
the<00:00:56.879> shading<00:00:57.449> brush<00:00:57.570> because<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.559> gives<00:00:58.829> a

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
the shading brush because it gives a

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.220 
the shading brush because it gives a
more<00:00:59.219> softer<00:00:59.730> effect<00:01:00.090> think<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:00.930> as<00:01:00.989> like

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
more softer effect think of it as like

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.990 
more softer effect think of it as like
your<00:01:01.379> mini<00:01:01.649> buffing<00:01:02.129> brush<00:01:02.280> like<00:01:02.640> what<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.850> was

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
your mini buffing brush like what I was

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.770 
your mini buffing brush like what I was
using<00:01:03.210> in<00:01:03.420> my<00:01:03.539> foundation<00:01:04.140> video<00:01:04.549> so<00:01:05.570> you<00:01:06.570> want

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
using in my foundation video so you want

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.070 
using in my foundation video so you want
to<00:01:06.900> keep<00:01:07.020> blending<00:01:07.880> try<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.939> put<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.689> very

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
to keep blending try to put on is very

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.810 
to keep blending try to put on is very
little<00:01:10.350> as<00:01:10.619> possible<00:01:10.950> around<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.670> eye<00:01:11.700> area
