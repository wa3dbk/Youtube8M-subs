00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:13.800
 Ahead but there is in this role is 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:16.130
 I wonder why I was able to really keep thinking about Oiso 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.130
 Is it 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:25.310
 I agree 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.310
 Something Well I There is a lot of things 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:36.560
 Let me do something like this 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:39.040
 Something something but I lot of it is I'm the third is terrible Toka various I read the other customers 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.040
 But from the time 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:47.270
 Very Episode 3 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:48.730
 It looks a bit rough at first glance, but it's straight and hot 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.850
 Clumsy 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.590
 I can not express it well 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.940
 Wow or not 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.040
 Because 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:05.320
 It is very humanlike to say 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:12.820
 Because it is not a bad person after all seeing a sound that is a little bit lovable 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:16.020
 I feel like the underlying there is the fact that it also say was after before the happy result in idle 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:22.200
 Because after all the straight Saga 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:24.510
 I think it 's because something has always arrived first, so that I could keep thinking 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:30.010
 Do you mean 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:31.450
 How do ahead as viewed from the municipal road's that Daisuke's role 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.719
 Let's do it 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.590
 It is good, but always 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:39.830
 But is the wife of me but support it 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:45.800
 Yes Yes 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:47.010
 It is a very nice wife, and Mr. Konishi is also very calm and always smiling. 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.050
 like this 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:58.780
 That 's right I asked if there was a side but I asked something 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:58.780
 Because so much this not from the usual to be angry or fully aiming to take the emotion likely 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:09.220
 I think it 's also nice here 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.720
 Koiso or rather from even who usually earlier and close 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:16.630
 Such type 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:18.030
 I'm going to finish it, I'm not that kind of thing The roller is already delicious for now 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:25.200
 Eat things 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:29.580
 I'm going to go to bed and see if it is fine tomorrow I would like to start from scratch again 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:33.350
 In fact, it means that there is something wrong with the part that goes ahead 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:40.670
 How from you is whether I love's such people say the truth cookies 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:47.660
 What kind of argument was hot It was hot It was falling on the spot in what kind of feeling 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:53.340
 I thought that I was tired from the other side of the floor separately, though 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:57.840
 I have a desire to say men and women, I'm feeling ahead but my feet seem a bit confusing 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:00.960
 Yes Ishibe is likely to Joppa Hey, why is this minute 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:05.850
 In the scene of the first letter of rural letters 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:11.510
 I I was taking it read the letter but director message 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.510
 Yutti and burst into tears contains the voice 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:25.780
 Stroked Toka retake said in it even for that and empathy of the mother in the field about the 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:29.069
 Thank you for being a director who already told me that I can believe if I believe it. 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.940
 How are you from Mr. Nakamura? 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:35.860
 That's right after all very high 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:39.240
 High like a play life with a hot feeling 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.240
 Always hot coming line 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:49.010
 Because the feeling is transmitted somehow somehow the world of the director 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:52.450
 I had let me do it in I think that says so very close 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.450
 Thank you very much 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:09.290
 First of all thank you from the director Haietto really this work is of course I 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.310

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.270
 That a lot of the cast and staff, including the wave's that Shido Nakamura today 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:21.130
 Belief 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:24.160
 I wish you that all means best regards because it is a work which I am really not made with all your thoughts 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.730
 Thank you 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:31.360
 Thank you for continuing today, Hi that day 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:37.810
 The first time to meet everyone like after watching the 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:44.180
 Today is the first time, but I have a very warm expression and I feel a little relieved 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:48.970
 I think it would be nice if it was time to have even one thing left in mind 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.970
 Thank you very much, I was happy to meet you 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:57.330

 Thank you very much for today 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:05.230
 We actor staff packed with everyone's feelings 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:09.990
 It's not a flashy movie 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.990
 For example is the work that each thought was jammed 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:19.950
 I have no memory of making a great play at a certain address in my address 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:23.980
 Nature and its world character 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:28.900
 It was a work that I could enter 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:32.040
 I am glad if you can bring up this future 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.040
