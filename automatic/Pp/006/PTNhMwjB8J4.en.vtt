side-by-side we knew we had probably the
same<00:01:30.090> type<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.420> dinosaur<00:01:30.630> from<00:01:31.439> two<00:01:31.619> different

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
same type of dinosaur from two different

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.310

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
formations in two different countries so

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.749 
formations in two different countries so
if<00:01:34.439> you're<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.619> horn<00:01:34.890> dinosaur<00:01:35.310> like<00:01:35.430> Mercury

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
if you're a horn dinosaur like Mercury

Montana or Alberta the one thing you

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.940 
Montana or Alberta the one thing you

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
want to do is you become a teenager's be

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.429 
want to do is you become a teenager's be

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
able to attract a mate and if you were a

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.649 
able to attract a mate and if you were a
human<00:01:44.009> teenager<00:01:44.280> during<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.880> 1950's<00:01:45.570> you

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
human teenager during the 1950's you

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.300 
human teenager during the 1950's you
would<00:01:45.750> have<00:01:45.840> got<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:45.990> very<00:01:46.350> large<00:01:46.650> car<00:01:47.070> with

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
would have got a very large car with

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.280 
would have got a very large car with
these<00:01:47.400> big<00:01:47.670> fins<00:01:48.180> off<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.630> back<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:49.110> if

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
these big fins off the back of it if

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.929 
these big fins off the back of it if
you're<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.950> horn<00:01:50.220> dinosaur<00:01:50.640> during<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
you're a horn dinosaur during the

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.340 
you're a horn dinosaur during the
Cretaceous<00:01:51.420> your<00:01:51.630> only<00:01:51.840> option<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.320> to

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
Cretaceous your only option is to

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.050 
Cretaceous your only option is to
actually<00:01:52.500> modify<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.310> large<00:01:53.549> frill<00:01:53.850> on<00:01:53.970> the

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
actually modify that large frill on the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.999 
actually modify that large frill on the
back<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.329> your<00:01:54.420> skull<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.380> if<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.560> can<00:01:55.710> add<00:01:55.829> an

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
back of your skull so if you can add an

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.160 
back of your skull so if you can add an
extra<00:01:56.130> wing<00:01:56.610> or<00:01:56.939> an<00:01:57.090> extra<00:01:57.390> frill<00:01:57.659> on<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.930> side

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
extra wing or an extra frill on the side

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.109 
extra wing or an extra frill on the side
of<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.470> make<00:01:59.100> yourself<00:01:59.430> even<00:01:59.670> more

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
of that make yourself even more

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.480 
of that make yourself even more
elaborate<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:00.930> ornate<00:02:01.290> then<00:02:01.590> your<00:02:02.159> buddies

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
elaborate and ornate then your buddies

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.280 
elaborate and ornate then your buddies
are<00:02:02.670> chances<00:02:03.479> are<00:02:03.630> you're<00:02:03.780> gonna<00:02:03.869> have<00:02:04.110> the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
are chances are you're gonna have the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.740 
are chances are you're gonna have the
best<00:02:04.470> pick<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.340> herd<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:06.090> these<00:02:06.299> we<00:02:06.540> like

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
best pick of the herd so these we like

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.479
