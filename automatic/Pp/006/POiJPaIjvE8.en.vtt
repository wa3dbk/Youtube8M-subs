 the pellet of wood also called pellet 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.000
 is a fuel obtained by 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.860
 sawdust compression 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.960
 these features controlled by 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.520
 European standards gives it the same 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.850
 strong blow of automation and 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.320
 delivery as domestic fuel 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.880
 delivery is done through 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.210
 tanker trucks equipped with 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.160
 wind tunnel the company trans manu offers 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.280
 10 ton dedicated tanks on

 carrier 4.2 or 15 tons on carrier 6.2 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:47.100
 with directional axles the truck can 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:01:00.300
 blow the pellet up to a distance 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:01:02.640
 40 meters and a vertical drop of 8 m 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.589
 onboard weighing system certified by 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.880
 the drire allows to deliver a ticket 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.880
 from printers to delivery 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.709
 the trucks are equipped with a vacuum cleaner 

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:16.829
 in the case where the silos 

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:18.689
 are not filtering the couple munier 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:20.609
 rebels has just had a 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.509
 pellet boiler at the entrance of this 

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:24.270
 winter 2012 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.099
 we bought this house and put 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.850
 is now six years old 

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:30.400
 and when we bought it 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.570
 nor with a small cast iron stove that 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.189
 well heats the room in which one 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.939
 love and that does not heat at all 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.100
 adjoining rooms 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.170
 finally we chose to warm up at 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.210
 wood pellets because that is what 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.190
 we seemed the most effective the most 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.180
 suited to our house and then as well 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.940
 sure the least expensive 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.710
 we install a silo and fill it 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.220
 then everything is automatic everything 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.750
 do it alone 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.659
 he's just in his opinion lessons but 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.399
 once a month in our range we 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.570
 have three distinct types of products 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.330
 the plate 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.500
 the pellet and the log in this 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.390
 application we are on a 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.789
 boiler room which is equipped with a 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.009
 pellet boiler 35 km these 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:09.100
 pellet boilers are selected for 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.440
 their ease of installation and ease 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.330
 filling all our boilers 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.750
 has a 7 year warranty at these 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.640
 maneuvers 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.830
 it's warranty applies on all 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.030
 parts the electronic parts the 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.430
 mechanical parts and even parts 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.260
 of wear the workforce is ensured by 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.150
 a network of installers who implement 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.950
 work and follow our boilers for this 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.660
 which is the delivery and then the silo 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.510
 it is true that it is quite practical 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.000
 the truck he ranks the name of the 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.880
 house they do the connection and then 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.280
 in twenty minutes we had the cape town 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.370
 that were delivered easily it did not 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.600
 made of dust it was fast then 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.100
 in addition we do not need to be there so 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.100
 that is very practical too
