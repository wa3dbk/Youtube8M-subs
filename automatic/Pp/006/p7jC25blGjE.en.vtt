interesting we all seen a 3ds before but

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.870 
interesting we all seen a 3ds before but
here<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.750> this<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:45.810> Pikachu<00:01:46.560> with<00:01:47.189> his<00:01:47.399> not

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
here it is this is Pikachu with his not

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.870 
here it is this is Pikachu with his not
nipples<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:49.939> so<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.030> looks<00:01:51.180> like<00:01:51.240> front<00:01:52.170> and

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
nipples and so it looks like front and

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.209 
nipples and so it looks like front and
along<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.090> sides<00:01:54.619> you<00:01:55.619> know<00:01:55.649> this<00:01:55.950> is

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
along the sides you know this is

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.539 
along the sides you know this is
standard<00:01:56.579> 3d<00:01:56.820> s<00:01:56.969> fair<00:01:57.270> his<00:01:58.259> tail<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:58.829> on<00:01:59.369> the

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
standard 3d s fair his tail is on the

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.249 
standard 3d s fair his tail is on the
back<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.090> guess<00:02:00.329> that's<00:02:00.540> pretty<00:02:00.719> neat<00:02:01.020> and

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
back so I guess that's pretty neat and

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.100 
back so I guess that's pretty neat and
you<00:02:02.040> know<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.340> really<00:02:02.460> doesn't<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.750> doesn't<00:02:03.840> do

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
you know it really doesn't it doesn't do

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.130 
you know it really doesn't it doesn't do
