the<00:00:13.170> door<00:00:13.580> it<00:00:14.580> works<00:00:14.910> just<00:00:15.059> like<00:00:15.360> any<00:00:15.420> other

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
the door it works just like any other

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.790 
the door it works just like any other
normal<00:00:15.990> dog<00:00:17.810> and<00:00:18.810> then<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.230> password<00:00:19.770> protect

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
normal dog and then to password protect

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.109 
normal dog and then to password protect
your<00:00:20.400> door<00:00:20.609> we<00:00:21.600> just<00:00:21.810> stick<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.199> sign<00:00:22.380> here<00:00:23.119> s

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
your door we just stick the sign here s

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.960 
your door we just stick the sign here s
lemon<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.830> square<00:00:26.220> brackets<00:00:26.550> around<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.849> and

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
lemon and square brackets around it and

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.670 
lemon and square brackets around it and
then<00:00:27.090> everything<00:00:27.390> afterwards<00:00:27.960> comes<00:00:28.529> your

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
then everything afterwards comes your

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.890 
then everything afterwards comes your
password<00:00:29.119> so<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.150> can<00:00:30.390> put<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.660> on<00:00:30.810> the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
password so you can put that on the

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.049 
password so you can put that on the
second<00:00:31.260> line<00:00:31.349> if<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.590> want<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:31.949> say<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.309> little

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
second line if you want and say a little

second line if you want and say a little
message<00:00:33.239> on<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.540> top<00:00:33.719> with<00:00:34.320> your<00:00:34.440> pulse<00:00:34.649> with

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
message on the top with your pulse with

message on the top with your pulse with
them<00:00:34.950> underneath<00:00:37.010> so<00:00:38.010> when<00:00:38.160> you're<00:00:38.340> within

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
them underneath so when you're within

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.600 
them underneath so when you're within
range<00:00:39.270> least<00:00:39.660> sign<00:00:39.960> it's<00:00:40.950> not<00:00:41.100> based<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
three squares 3d cube you just type

password password here and googled or
local<00:00:56.300> not<00:00:57.300> normally<00:00:57.690> you've<00:00:57.870> got<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.230> use<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
local not normally you've got to use the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.029 
local not normally you've got to use the
bottle<00:00:59.629> and<00:01:00.629> that's<00:01:01.020> basically<00:01:01.289> how<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
bottle and that's basically how the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.319 
bottle and that's basically how the
planning<00:01:02.370> works<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.760> it's<00:01:02.850> very<00:01:03.000> very<00:01:03.239> simple

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
planning works and it's very very simple

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.500 
planning works and it's very very simple
plugin<00:01:04.339> nothing<00:01:05.339> else<00:01:05.519> needed<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.000> do<00:01:06.150> i<00:01:06.180> may

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
plugin nothing else needed to do i may

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.050 
plugin nothing else needed to do i may
add<00:01:06.659> more<00:01:06.840> features<00:01:07.159> in<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> future<00:01:08.610> but

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
add more features in the future but

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.250 
add more features in the future but
here's<00:01:09.240> some<00:01:09.360> applications<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.110> would

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
here's some applications of that would

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.630 
here's some applications of that would
work<00:01:11.780> this<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.020> diagram<00:01:13.979> showing<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.460> where

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
work this is a diagram showing you where

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.810 
work this is a diagram showing you where
you're<00:01:14.820> allowed<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.270> put<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.540> sign<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.020> it's

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
you're allowed to put the sign and it's

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.700 
you're allowed to put the sign and it's
directly<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.630> attach<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.259> any<00:01:19.439> tube

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
directly you can attach it to any tube

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.999 
directly you can attach it to any tube
directly<00:01:19.950> within<00:01:20.700> two<00:01:20.939> squares<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.390> door

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
directly within two squares of the door

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.980 
directly within two squares of the door
so<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.250> sign<00:01:23.460> has<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.790> be<00:01:24.030> attached<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.630> that

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
so the sign has to be attached to that

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.910 
so the sign has to be attached to that
tube<00:01:25.320> which<00:01:25.590> means<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.520> can<00:01:26.729> either<00:01:26.909> be<00:01:27.090> on

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
tube which means it can either be on

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.859 
tube which means it can either be on
that<00:01:28.920> as<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> wolf<00:01:29.340> sign<00:01:29.610> or<00:01:29.850> sitting<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.630> as

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
that as a wolf sign or sitting on it as

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.230 
that as a wolf sign or sitting on it as
a<00:01:31.560> sign<00:01:31.740> post<00:01:32.009> but<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.759> means<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:33.030> can't

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
a sign post but that means you can't

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.780 
a sign post but that means you can't
actually<00:01:33.420> have<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.689> signpost<00:01:34.460> next<00:01:35.460> year<00:01:35.579> all

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
actually have a signpost next year all

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.410 
actually have a signpost next year all
right<00:01:35.820> now<00:01:36.150> by<00:01:36.600> sitting<00:01:36.840> on<00:01:37.049> top<00:01:38.150> but<00:01:39.150> here's

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
right now by sitting on top but here's

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.960 
right now by sitting on top but here's
one<00:01:39.600> application<00:01:39.930> one<00:01:40.170> minute<00:01:40.820> and<00:01:41.820> I'll

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
one application one minute and I'll

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.510 
one application one minute and I'll
place<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.299> door<00:01:42.479> all<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.320> way<00:01:43.409> there<00:01:44.250> sign

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
place the door all the way there sign

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.210 
place the door all the way there sign
all<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.939> way<00:01:45.030> back<00:01:45.210> here<00:01:45.560> so<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.590> can<00:01:46.770> open<00:01:47.130> it

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
all the way back here so I can open it

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.639 
all the way back here so I can open it
from<00:01:47.250> far<00:01:47.579> back<00:01:47.790> all<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.930> way<00:01:49.049> this<00:01:49.200> far<00:01:49.470> away

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
from far back all the way this far away

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.999 
from far back all the way this far away
from<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.890> door<00:01:51.079> if<00:01:52.079> I'm<00:01:52.320> front<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.829> door

from the door if I'm front of the door

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.050 
from the door if I'm front of the door
can<00:01:53.280> work<00:01:53.399> them<00:01:53.579> in<00:01:53.790> unless<00:01:54.240> I'm<00:01:54.479> really<00:01:55.140> close

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
can work them in unless I'm really close

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.139
