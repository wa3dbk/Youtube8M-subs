00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:52.960 
this design on a detail they're kind of
boring<00:04:48.199> reduce<00:04:48.919> average<00:04:50.560> like<00:04:51.560> any<00:04:51.979> LPS<00:04:52.639> can

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
boring reduce average like any LPS can

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.360 
boring reduce average like any LPS can
for<00:04:53.330> this

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:05.350
