from<00:01:39.850> our<00:01:40.030> first<00:01:40.330> episode<00:01:40.540> I<00:01:41.110> talked<00:01:41.800> about

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
from our first episode I talked about

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.570

are<00:01:45.850> also<00:01:46.060> rafters<00:01:46.720> but<00:01:46.960> they<00:01:47.110> are<00:01:47.290> made

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
are also rafters but they are made

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.499 
are also rafters but they are made
differently<00:01:47.979> because<00:01:48.280> they<00:01:48.670> play<00:01:48.970> special

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
differently because they play special

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.590 
differently because they play special
roles<00:01:49.869> in<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.290> building<00:01:50.649> of<00:01:50.770> a<00:01:50.890> roof<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:52.210> how

roles in the building of a roof so how

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.620 
roles in the building of a roof so how
are<00:01:52.899> they<00:01:53.080> different<00:01:53.320> from<00:01:53.500> common<00:01:54.040> rafters

two roots intersect so one big
difference<00:02:18.130> is<00:02:18.610> that<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.970> common<00:02:19.390> rafters

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
difference is that the common rafters

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.470 
difference is that the common rafters
form<00:02:20.650> a<00:02:20.799> 90<00:02:21.220> degree<00:02:21.580> angle<00:02:21.610> with<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.299> wall

let's<00:02:29.110> review<00:02:29.410> some<00:02:29.650> facts<00:02:29.890> from<00:02:30.370> episode<00:02:30.970> one

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
let's review some facts from episode one

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.920 
let's review some facts from episode one
now<00:02:32.549> remember<00:02:33.549> that<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:34.060> pitch<00:02:34.299> of<00:02:34.480> a<00:02:34.570> common

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
now remember that the pitch of a common

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.009 
now remember that the pitch of a common
rafter<00:02:35.320> is<00:02:35.560> always<00:02:36.130> expressed<00:02:36.580> as<00:02:37.019> some

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
rafter is always expressed as some

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.150 
rafter is always expressed as some
number<00:02:38.260> over<00:02:38.680> 12

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
number over 12

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.300 
number over 12
this<00:02:39.790> ratio<00:02:40.060> refers<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:41.140> ratio<00:02:41.380> of<00:02:41.650> rise

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
this ratio refers to the ratio of rise

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.540 
this ratio refers to the ratio of rise
over<00:02:42.910> run

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
over run

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.210 
over run
in<00:02:44.610> this<00:02:45.450> particular<00:02:45.810> common<00:02:46.470> rafter<00:02:46.830> we<00:02:47.010> have

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
in this particular common rafter we have

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.240 
in this particular common rafter we have
a<00:02:47.250> rise<00:02:47.580> or<00:02:47.940> height<00:02:48.180> of<00:02:48.390> ten<00:02:48.660> inches<00:02:49.110> to<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:49.890> run

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
a rise or height of ten inches to a run

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.820 
a rise or height of ten inches to a run
length<00:02:50.610> of<00:02:50.820> 12<00:02:51.120> inches<00:02:51.570> and<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:52.410> pitch<00:02:52.650> of

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
length of 12 inches and the pitch of

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.600 
length of 12 inches and the pitch of
this<00:02:52.950> rafter<00:02:53.430> is<00:02:53.550> thus<00:02:53.820> 10<00:02:54.330> over<00:02:54.840> 12<00:02:55.280> so<00:02:56.280> for

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
this rafter is thus 10 over 12 so for

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.480 
this rafter is thus 10 over 12 so for
every<00:02:57.000> 12<00:02:57.300> inches<00:02:57.630> of<00:02:58.020> run<00:02:58.230> length<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:59.070> rafter

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
every 12 inches of run length the rafter

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.920 
every 12 inches of run length the rafter
rises<00:02:59.880> 10<00:03:00.240> inches<00:03:00.750> in<00:03:00.930> height<00:03:02.810> referring<00:03:03.810> to

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
rises 10 inches in height referring to

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.260 
rises 10 inches in height referring to
the<00:03:04.050> plan<00:03:04.290> view<00:03:04.430> remember<00:03:05.430> we<00:03:05.850> can<00:03:06.060> now

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
the plan view remember we can now

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.090 
the plan view remember we can now
determine<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:07.020> amount<00:03:07.380> of<00:03:07.560> board<00:03:07.860> lengths

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
determine the amount of board lengths

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.130 
determine the amount of board lengths
needed<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:08.730> make<00:03:08.880> our<00:03:08.910> common<00:03:09.510> rafter<00:03:09.870> shown

height or rise of the rafter is four

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.830 
height or rise of the rafter is four
times<00:05:19.710> ten<00:05:20.040> inches<00:05:20.430> or<00:05:20.610> 40<00:05:20.940> inches<00:05:21.240> just<00:05:21.630> like

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
times ten inches or 40 inches just like

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.930 
times ten inches or 40 inches just like
our<00:05:21.990> common<00:05:22.320> rafter<00:05:22.680> so<00:05:23.370> using<00:05:23.850> the

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
our common rafter so using the

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.300 
our common rafter so using the
Pythagorean<00:05:24.090> theorem<00:05:24.990> the<00:05:25.620> length<00:05:25.920> of<00:05:26.190> the

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
Pythagorean theorem the length of the

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.480 
Pythagorean theorem the length of the
slope<00:05:26.550> member<00:05:27.000> works<00:05:27.210> out<00:05:27.420> to<00:05:27.570> be<00:05:27.600> 78<00:05:28.350> and<00:05:28.650> 3/4

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
slope member works out to be 78 and 3/4

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.960 
slope member works out to be 78 and 3/4
inches

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
inches

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.300 
inches
this<00:05:30.420> proves<00:05:30.780> that<00:05:30.930> hip<00:05:31.260> and<00:05:31.440> Valley<00:05:31.650> rafters

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
this proves that hip and Valley rafters

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.910 
this proves that hip and Valley rafters
are<00:05:32.520> longer<00:05:32.910> than<00:05:33.030> common<00:05:33.480> rafters<00:05:33.960> because

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
are longer than common rafters because

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.410 
are longer than common rafters because
remembered<00:05:35.370> the<00:05:35.460> common<00:05:35.760> rafter<00:05:36.060> was<00:05:36.210> only

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
remembered the common rafter was only

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.830 
remembered the common rafter was only
sixty<00:05:36.810> two<00:05:36.930> and<00:05:36.960> a<00:05:37.110> half<00:05:37.290> inches<00:05:37.940> wow<00:05:38.940> that<00:05:39.690> was

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
sixty two and a half inches wow that was

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.590 
sixty two and a half inches wow that was
a<00:05:39.870> lot<00:05:40.080> to<00:05:40.260> take<00:05:40.440> in<00:05:40.670> but<00:05:41.670> not<00:05:41.820> to<00:05:42.000> fear<00:05:42.240> because

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
a lot to take in but not to fear because

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
a lot to take in but not to fear because
it<00:05:42.750> only<00:05:42.900> gets<00:05:43.140> better<00:05:43.380> from<00:05:43.560> here<00:05:43.770> on<00:05:44.130> out<00:05:45.620> to

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
it only gets better from here on out to

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:58.970 
it only gets better from here on out to
be<00:05:46.830> continued

00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:58.980 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:17.710 

we
