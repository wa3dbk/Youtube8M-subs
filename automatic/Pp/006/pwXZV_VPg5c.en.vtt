00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
another day Beverly 19th he was out here

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.160 
another day Beverly 19th he was out here
for<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.630> couple<00:00:09.690> hours<00:00:11.179> just<00:00:12.179> about<00:00:12.509> 10<00:00:12.929> minutes

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
for a couple hours just about 10 minutes

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.890 
for a couple hours just about 10 minutes
ago<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.530> finally<00:00:14.280> got<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.700> engine<00:00:15.059> off<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.480> had

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
ago I finally got the engine off I had

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.400 
ago I finally got the engine off I had
to<00:00:15.929> take<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.500> pull<00:00:16.740> it<00:00:16.830> off<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.250> act<00:00:17.670> like<00:00:18.410> the

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
to take the pull it off and act like the

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.560 
to take the pull it off and act like the
thing<00:00:19.650> was<00:00:19.800> so<00:00:20.100> on<00:00:20.340> there<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:20.850> had<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.359> use

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
thing was so on there that I had to use

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.620 
thing was so on there that I had to use
a<00:00:21.869> pair<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.260> vise<00:00:22.439> grips

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
a pair of vise grips

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.429 
a pair of vise grips
do<00:00:24.630> rip<00:00:25.590> around<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.980> pulley<00:00:26.930> so<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:27.990> could<00:00:28.140> undo

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
do rip around the pulley so I could undo

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.400 
do rip around the pulley so I could undo
it<00:00:28.560> with<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.830> socket<00:00:29.099> wrench<00:00:29.539> and<00:00:30.539> then<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.109> had

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
it with the socket wrench and then I had

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.229 
it with the socket wrench and then I had
to<00:00:31.590> take<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:32.009> hammer<00:00:32.279> there<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.820> bang<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.270> off

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
to take the hammer there and bang it off

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.549 
to take the hammer there and bang it off
the<00:00:36.239> hardest<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.930> was<00:00:37.140> probably<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
the hardest that I was probably the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.220 
the hardest that I was probably the
hardest<00:00:37.890> part<00:00:37.920> actually<00:00:38.309> like<00:00:38.850> it's<00:00:39.510> not<00:00:40.020> as

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
hardest part actually like it's not as

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.440 
hardest part actually like it's not as
impossible<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.489> lift<00:00:41.790> as<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.030> thought<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.360> would

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
impossible to lift as I thought it would

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.959 
impossible to lift as I thought it would
be<00:00:42.629> from<00:00:42.930> considering<00:00:43.890> what<00:00:44.250> strength<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.700> have

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
be from considering what strength I have

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.100 
be from considering what strength I have
or<00:00:45.899> what<00:00:46.110> little<00:00:46.260> strength<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.770> have<00:00:47.510> but<00:00:48.510> at

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
or what little strength I have but at

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.400 
or what little strength I have but at
least<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.350> got<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.620> off<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.980> then<00:00:51.320> noticing<00:00:52.320> all

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
least I got it off and then noticing all

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.010 
least I got it off and then noticing all
dirty<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.860> was<00:00:52.980> just<00:00:53.430> took<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.270> shot<00:00:54.480> back<00:00:54.750> clean

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
dirty it was just took a shot back clean

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.670 
dirty it was just took a shot back clean
up<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.350> bunch<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:56.600> flaked<00:00:57.600> off<00:00:57.780> rust<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.379> stuff

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
up a bunch of flaked off rust and stuff

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.180 
up a bunch of flaked off rust and stuff
like<00:00:59.250> even<00:00:59.550> more<00:00:59.730> than<00:00:59.879> I<00:00:59.969> got<00:01:00.329> before<00:01:01.070> so<00:01:02.070> it's

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
like even more than I got before so it's

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.329 
like even more than I got before so it's
nice<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.370> clean<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:02.879> there<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.080> should

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
nice and clean in there and I should

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.890 
nice and clean in there and I should
somehow<00:01:05.339> spray-paint<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> insiders<00:01:06.750> had

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
somehow spray-paint the insiders had

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.630 
somehow spray-paint the insiders had
stopped<00:01:07.140> trusting<00:01:07.439> out<00:01:09.650> better<00:01:10.650> if<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.189> keep<00:01:11.460> it

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
stopped trusting out better if I keep it

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.750 
stopped trusting out better if I keep it
under<00:01:11.909> cover<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:13.320> weather<00:01:13.650> maybe<00:01:14.580> this

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
under cover of the weather maybe this

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.840 
under cover of the weather maybe this
thing<00:01:14.909> will<00:01:15.030> last<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.330> few<00:01:15.479> more<00:01:15.659> years<00:01:16.850> but

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
thing will last a few more years but

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.520 
thing will last a few more years but
anyway<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.600> now<00:01:18.810> able<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.110> get<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.439> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
anyway and now able to get to the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.980 
anyway and now able to get to the
steering<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.979> little<00:01:20.189> better<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.720> get<00:01:21.960> a

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
steering a little better and I get a

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.960 
steering a little better and I get a
better<00:01:22.229> idea<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.619> what's<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:23.070> there<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.430> don't

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
better idea of what's in there I don't

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.359 
better idea of what's in there I don't
really<00:01:24.119> know<00:01:24.299> how<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.509> get<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.900> all<00:01:26.689> like

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
really know how to get that all like

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.950 
really know how to get that all like
that<00:01:29.369> right<00:01:29.640> there<00:01:29.670> I'm<00:01:30.270> not<00:01:30.509> sure<00:01:30.570> if<00:01:30.869> that's

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
that right there I'm not sure if that's

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.640 
that right there I'm not sure if that's
a<00:01:31.110> pin<00:01:31.470> or<00:01:34.310> what<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:36.290> at<00:01:37.290> least<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.530> can

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
a pin or what it is but at least I can

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.730 
a pin or what it is but at least I can
get<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.100> easier<00:01:38.400> now<00:01:41.930> there's<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:43.079> there's

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
get to it easier now there's a there's

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.370 
get to it easier now there's a there's
our<00:01:43.979> bushing<00:01:44.460> again

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
our bushing again

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.260 
our bushing again
you<00:01:47.380> can<00:01:47.469> see<00:01:47.679> the<00:01:47.829> oval<00:01:48.219> shape<00:01:48.609> I<00:01:48.880> got<00:01:49.179> to

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
you can see the oval shape I got to

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.450 
you can see the oval shape I got to
replace<00:01:49.600> that<00:01:49.899> like<00:01:50.829> I<00:01:50.950> said<00:01:51.189> in<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:51.310> previous

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
replace that like I said in the previous

00:01:51.460 --> 00:02:11.839 
replace that like I said in the previous
video<00:01:56.579> um-hmm<00:02:00.149> taking<00:02:01.149> it<00:02:01.240> off<00:02:01.329> Wasabi's

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.400 

there's<00:02:12.849> no<00:02:13.030> autofocus<00:02:13.660> on<00:02:13.780> this<00:02:13.870> camera<00:02:14.140> so<00:02:14.379> I

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
there's no autofocus on this camera so I

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:23.610 
there's no autofocus on this camera so I
apologize<00:02:19.200> hmm<00:02:20.579> well<00:02:21.579> I<00:02:21.849> guess<00:02:22.269> I'm<00:02:22.780> backing

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
apologize hmm well I guess I'm backing

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.650 
apologize hmm well I guess I'm backing
out<00:02:23.769> dig<00:02:24.130> deeper<00:02:24.549> into<00:02:24.730> trying<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.450> take<00:02:25.630> a

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
out dig deeper into trying to take a

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.319 
out dig deeper into trying to take a
look<00:02:25.930> at<00:02:26.019> that<00:02:26.280> maybe<00:02:27.280> all<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:27.610> engines<00:02:27.940> off<00:02:28.120> I

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
look at that maybe all the engines off I

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:34.170 
look at that maybe all the engines off I
can<00:02:28.739> clean<00:02:29.739> up<00:02:29.769> that<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:32.549> fill<00:02:33.549> fits<00:02:33.819> in

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
can clean up that that fill fits in

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:41.680 
can clean up that that fill fits in
there

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.390 

finally<00:02:42.350> got<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.620> little<00:02:42.860> bastard<00:02:43.280> out<00:02:45.370> now<00:02:46.370> I

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
finally got the little bastard out now I

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.800 
finally got the little bastard out now I
just<00:02:46.460> got<00:02:46.730> to<00:02:46.760> figure<00:02:47.060> out<00:02:47.090> how<00:02:47.300> it<00:02:47.450> all<00:02:47.570> comes

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
just got to figure out how it all comes

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.530 
just got to figure out how it all comes
apart<00:02:47.930> so<00:02:48.320> go<00:02:48.410> and<00:02:48.500> place<00:02:48.740> it<00:02:48.980> I<00:02:49.240> probably<00:02:50.240> went

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
apart so go and place it I probably went

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.220 
apart so go and place it I probably went
to<00:02:51.190> quite<00:02:52.190> some<00:02:52.220> extremes<00:02:52.970> that<00:02:53.360> she's<00:02:53.900> taking

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
to quite some extremes that she's taking

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.400 
to quite some extremes that she's taking
the<00:02:54.320> engine<00:02:54.470> off<00:02:54.830> to<00:02:55.220> get<00:02:55.400> to<00:02:55.550> this<00:02:55.640> but<00:02:55.850> I

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
the engine off to get to this but I

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.840 
the engine off to get to this but I
found<00:02:57.410> out<00:02:57.590> had<00:02:58.070> I<00:02:58.160> not<00:02:58.280> been<00:02:58.430> able<00:02:58.490> to<00:02:58.640> do<00:02:58.730> that

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
found out had I not been able to do that

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.430 
found out had I not been able to do that
I<00:02:59.030> wouldn't<00:02:59.270> be<00:02:59.360> able<00:02:59.420> to<00:02:59.540> use<00:02:59.660> this<00:02:59.810> giant

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
I wouldn't be able to use this giant

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.070 
I wouldn't be able to use this giant
cheater<00:03:01.040> pipe<00:03:01.540> which<00:03:02.540> made<00:03:02.750> it<00:03:02.900> a<00:03:02.930> whole<00:03:03.050> lot

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
cheater pipe which made it a whole lot

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.170 
cheater pipe which made it a whole lot
easier<00:03:03.290> to<00:03:03.530> get<00:03:03.710> those<00:03:03.860> rusted<00:03:04.550> bolts<00:03:04.670> off<00:03:04.970> I

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
easier to get those rusted bolts off I

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.510 
easier to get those rusted bolts off I
practiced<00:03:06.140> you<00:03:06.290> penetrate<00:03:06.770> well<00:03:06.950> I<00:03:07.220> didn't

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
practiced you penetrate well I didn't

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.840 
practiced you penetrate well I didn't
have<00:03:07.610> access<00:03:07.760> time<00:03:08.620> but<00:03:09.620> we<00:03:10.190> finally<00:03:10.580> come<00:03:10.790> to

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
have access time but we finally come to

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.420 
have access time but we finally come to
the<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:12.530> right<00:03:12.740> point<00:03:14.860> I'm<00:03:15.860> going<00:03:16.100> to<00:03:16.160> see

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
the the right point I'm going to see

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:25.180 
the the right point I'm going to see
what<00:03:17.090> else<00:03:17.270> I<00:03:18.610> have<00:03:19.610> to<00:03:19.670> do<00:03:20.000> I<00:03:24.040> really<00:03:25.040> don't

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
what else I have to do I really don't

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.700 
what else I have to do I really don't
know<00:03:25.340> how<00:03:25.490> that<00:03:25.550> comes<00:03:25.820> off<00:03:26.380> but<00:03:27.380> I'll<00:03:27.530> figure

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
know how that comes off but I'll figure

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:28.240 
know how that comes off but I'll figure
it<00:03:27.830> out

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
it out

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.490 
it out
I<00:03:28.280> probably<00:03:28.700> remove<00:03:29.210> the<00:03:29.330> gear<00:03:29.570> because<00:03:30.020> or

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
I probably remove the gear because or

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.890 
I probably remove the gear because or
there's<00:03:31.040> a<00:03:32.140> clip<00:03:33.140> ring<00:03:33.440> there<00:03:33.680> so<00:03:34.690> we'll<00:03:35.690> see

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
there's a clip ring there so we'll see

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.380 
there's a clip ring there so we'll see
what<00:03:36.050> I<00:03:36.080> can<00:03:36.260> do
