00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:11.250
 hello to you all day and continue or 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.790
 Beretta and probably need to make a 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.820
 the tradition of the beginning of each video speaks 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.060
 that all the same it's not a gun battle 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.510
 a toy 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.810
 so that inadvertently somebody is wrong 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.170
 understood and did not solder my cocaine article for 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.880
 this thing again say that the gun 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.489
 outwardly only will be like a battle 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.730
 yet inside he will have absolutely 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.980
 harmless and nothing like with combat 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.510
 the gun tied will not last 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.230
 the series we settled on us 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.530
 you need to make a radius on the gate 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.460
 I will do it on the grinding machine 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.289
 abrasive wheel, here's 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.000
 voiced 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:56.640
 abrasive wheel radius radius 7 a 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.930
 here is the radius r fits well and here 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.149
 now this circle 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.769
 we will actually grind our radius 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.939
 radius on the abrasive wheel was made 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.770
 special gadget with a diamond needle 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:14.220
 shutter has been set to patient radius 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.909
 abrasive wheel and here's the process itself 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.970
 grinding 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.690
 the upper part of the constipation there is also a radius 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.270
 while there is a curly figure grinding 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.070
 own the same method i will 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.920
 grind and the top and narrow gate 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.900
 but it will still be there soon but in the meantime we 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.020
 Need to milling two holidays here 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.420
 sobsno returning to our 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:40.100
 jig boring machine and milling 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:43.670
 my , I have it 2 minutes 2 millimeters 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:47.300
 do the puzzles that will walk 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:52.120
 our law and here are the Pasik ready radius 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:55.550
 ready so now we see the result 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:59.300
 That radius turned out two small 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:07.400
 right there will admit here a bunch of you can see well 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:11.320
 paziki radius itself so here we dress and here 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:16.100
 went here so it will start 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.420
 from the shutter is so big enough that 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.350
 allow us to use 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:24.050
 piston millimeter at 40 and thought would be 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.239
 I will use the piston 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.450
 the most rigid about his wife that 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.370
 can be entered manually shutter i 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.890
 I hope this is somehow secured under 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.819
 some kind of destructive power and then I do not know 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.579
 meters cook 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.620
 cardboard dolls are not punched that we 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:43.489
 let's see initially I thought more just 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.280
 create a mockup but it would be very easy 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:50.010
 more interesting to experience the map shot 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:53.219
 next we go to the holes here 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.069
 here are the holes of the subcortex itself 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:58.889
 almost go and 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:02.549
 the old method I fed now 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:04.230
 let's see what happened 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.739
 holes now need them just more 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.060
 exactly mark up find their central centers 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.060
 how do you like more and 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:19.200
 let's drill drilled key 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:24.040
 center and I found after this their kermen 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:27.940
 here are our markup ready for a swirl 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:31.510
 drillings here these longitudinal crept 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.430
 need to be done on the milling but 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.690
 it will not be soon in the future 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.320
 sometime and so empty marked out also 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.740
 still on 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.320
 framework of our toy gun i 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:46.090
 marked out actually from pic will be here 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.860
 9mm which will be 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:54.420
 the dollar is inserted our gun you 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.420
 will be 10 millimeters deep and 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.790
 In this groove 4 grooves would be made as in 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.740
 shutter which actually think will 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.750
 to be fixed 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.000
 come back nasir vovku and here's a little 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:11.170
 drill and machine tool 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:15.340
 1 hole is drilled for us under the lever 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:18.070
 shutter will he 8mm drill bit 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.549
 by 8 millimeters but some diameter 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.919
 It turns out he is very big possible that 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.090
 there are bronze bushings on 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:29.020
 original gun 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:31.580
 so that the metal does not mix so much then 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.669
 School is there some kind of muscle is 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.789
 honey my opinion it thinks that there 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:40.389
 Most likely these bronze bushings are worth 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:44.030
 but maybe I am mistaken I have not seen this 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:46.849
 shutter mechanism but I 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:50.479
 invented such what is my further 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:53.449
 I show you and the difficult project is obtained 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:56.689
 in fact, the further the work goes 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:05:00.320
 the harder it is to think out 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:02.889
 there is how to do it redo 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.310
 Motik u 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:08.259
 called up think yourself and the name is already 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.590
 put on practice that is two the same 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:14.919
 just that I sit back and just thought 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.080
 What should I do next $ 1 chain 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:19.499
 again openings on the server on now i'm 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.629
 I'll drill everything else further already 

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:25.599
 let's see what happened so the holes 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:28.210
 drilled the main character proper 8 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:30.490
 millimeters is a hole four with 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.770
 half three millimeters on the trigger 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:38.110
 hook and under the trigger five and a half 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:39.180
 millimeters hole drilled poorly 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.680
 like 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:46.150
 yourself here these are all three cups pin and 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.969
 they will already be made when 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.840
 here are all the components are ready 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:56.100
 fixing for now let's move on 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:58.950
 groove milling breath 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:02.250
 so now the process itself is happy 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:08.550
 milling but well the same as on the gate 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:10.710
 firewall this will be the last 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:16.560
 operations in this release 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:18.780
 and the next issue I already think about 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.960
 It was not invented begins 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.750
 undermine our business somehow 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:28.880
 customized by these various went away so 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:33.570
 Here you will be ready for now 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:37.020
 will be ours and is our toy here 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:40.590
 This quilted jacket Leopard on actually have another 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.550
 20 gun barrel so here we go 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.370
 look at 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:46.160
 the drawing that's actually this groove and 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:48.350
 here in the depot tochechki 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:52.590
 who will dress and 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:56.260
 lock our trunk need them 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:58.920
 play our 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.920
 century 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:04.610
 here they will be located 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.430
 dress no so about 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.590
 intake . 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:11.600
 here we see that there appeared a hole on 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.200
 channel 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.620
 delivered in ufa chuck 

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:18.860
 I can not remove. and on the trunk 

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:21.770
 will also be theon sample 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:24.289
 and power will be aligned shoulders will 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:26.349
 to turn and actually live 

00:07:24.289 --> 00:07:28.729
 up will be the trunk itself 

00:07:26.349 --> 00:07:32.090
 Here is such a way I am 

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:34.360
 probably do this until everything is 

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:37.580
 special thanks to the water Borisycha 

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:40.449
 which is promoting my channel soci new 

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:43.370
 viewers have increased significantly 

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:46.840
 thank you very much and see you in 

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:46.840
 next release bye bye
