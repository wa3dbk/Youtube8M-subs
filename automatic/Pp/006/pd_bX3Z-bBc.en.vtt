00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
that the arm holes are small enough so

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.460 
that the arm holes are small enough so
all<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.820> did<00:01:11.939> was<00:01:12.210> put<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.510> dress<00:01:12.750> on<00:01:12.930> inside

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
out on Megan pinned it where I want the

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.359 
out on Megan pinned it where I want the
armhole<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.020> hit<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.439> then<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.950> just<00:01:17.130> sew<00:01:17.340> a

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
armhole to hit and then you just sew a

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.789 
armhole to hit and then you just sew a
diagonal<00:01:18.150> line<00:01:18.360> from<00:01:18.600> where<00:01:18.869> your<00:01:19.049> PIN<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.320> all

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
diagonal line from where your PIN is all

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.920 
diagonal line from where your PIN is all
the<00:01:20.100> way<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.549> outer<00:01:20.729> seam<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.570> dress

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
the way to the outer seam of the dress

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.020 
the way to the outer seam of the dress
and<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.590> should<00:01:22.799> help<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.159> kind<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.430> lay<00:01:23.610> flat

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
and that should help it kind of lay flat

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.210 
and that should help it kind of lay flat
once<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.450> have<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.780> seam<00:01:25.080> there<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:26.009> next

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
once you have that seam there so next

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.679 
once you have that seam there so next
we're<00:01:26.700> going<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.909> go<00:01:26.970> back<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.390> belt

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
we're going to go back to that belt

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.200 
we're going to go back to that belt
piece<00:01:27.990> take<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.590> remnant<00:01:29.100> fold<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.759> over<00:01:29.909> on

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
piece take that remnant fold it over on

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.330 
piece take that remnant fold it over on
itself<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.810> half<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.439> right<00:01:31.770> sides<00:01:32.159> are

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
itself in half so that right sides are

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.190 
itself in half so that right sides are
together<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.970> then<00:01:33.299> as<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.659> can<00:01:33.750> see<00:01:33.810> all<00:01:34.170> I

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
together and then as you can see all I

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.649 
together and then as you can see all I
did<00:01:34.470> was<00:01:34.680> take<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.979> seam<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.880> just<00:01:36.390> stitch

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
did was take a seam and just stitch

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.260 
did was take a seam and just stitch
those<00:01:36.900> two<00:01:37.170> raw<00:01:37.439> edges<00:01:37.680> together<00:01:38.100> then<00:01:38.850> flip

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
those two raw edges together then flip

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.940 
those two raw edges together then flip
that<00:01:39.450> whole<00:01:39.780> thing<00:01:40.020> inside<00:01:40.439> out<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:40.829> you're

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
that whole thing inside out so you're

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.490 
that whole thing inside out so you're
left<00:01:41.100> with<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.280> long<00:01:41.579> tube<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.240> fabric<00:01:42.420> iron<00:01:43.170> it

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
left with a long tube of fabric iron it

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.499 
left with a long tube of fabric iron it
and<00:01:43.619> top<00:01:43.979> stitch<00:01:44.220> shut<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.909> ends<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.420> then

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
and top stitch shut the ends and then

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.929 
and top stitch shut the ends and then
you'll<00:01:45.630> have<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.840> belt<00:01:46.110> for<00:01:46.470> your<00:01:46.560> dress<00:01:46.880> next<00:01:47.880> I

you'll have a belt for your dress next I

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.850 
you'll have a belt for your dress next I
needed<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.329> finish<00:01:48.509> off<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.960> armhole<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:49.740> we

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
needed to finish off the armhole so we

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.920 
needed to finish off the armhole so we
didn't<00:01:50.070> have<00:01:50.189> just<00:01:50.399> raw<00:01:50.670> cut<00:01:51.119> arm<00:01:51.390> holes<00:01:51.689> and

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
didn't have just raw cut arm holes and

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.810 
didn't have just raw cut arm holes and
to<00:01:52.229> do<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.560> just<00:01:52.860> take<00:01:53.040> your<00:01:53.220> fabric<00:01:53.399> take

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
to do that just take your fabric take

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.969 
to do that just take your fabric take
the<00:01:54.000> raw<00:01:54.180> edge<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.450> fold<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.200> under<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.710> sew

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
the raw edge and fold it under and sew

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.639 
the raw edge and fold it under and sew
it<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.280> then<00:01:56.820> fold<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.329> under<00:01:57.689> again<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.320> sew

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
it and then fold it under again and sew

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.649 
it and then fold it under again and sew
that<00:01:58.829> in<00:01:58.890> place<00:01:59.280> so<00:02:00.000> this<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.299> what<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.509> looks

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
that in place so this is what it looks

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.330 
that in place so this is what it looks
like<00:02:00.780> from<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.020> inside<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.829> dress<00:02:02.130> it's

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
like from the inside of the dress it's

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.069 
like from the inside of the dress it's
called<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.610> rolled<00:02:02.880> hem<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.750> will<00:02:03.869> give<00:02:03.990> you

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
called a rolled hem and it will give you

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.730 
called a rolled hem and it will give you
a<00:02:04.140> nice<00:02:04.409> finished<00:02:04.979> edge<00:02:05.219> on<00:02:05.579> those<00:02:05.790> arm<00:02:06.149> holes

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
a nice finished edge on those arm holes

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.320 
a nice finished edge on those arm holes
okay<00:02:07.740> finally<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.250> went<00:02:08.580> back<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.030> sleeves

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330
