00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.940
 several of its cartridges and in all the 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.239
 internal memory of the game placed the

 the symptoms suffered by children 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.530
 prior to the suicide they seemed to be 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.630
 induced by music that sounded like 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.450
 enter the band town 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.670
 apparently the melody had some picks 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.180
 of tonal intensity that only children 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.309
 pre pubes can hear the 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.140
 combination of strident sounds and 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.780
 overwhelming produced in the players 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.220
 strong headaches or even 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.830
 migraines accompanied by insomnia 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.470
 the next state that was suffering was and 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.240
 reactivity accompanied by insomnia 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.270
 addiction to gambling and in many cases 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.720
 nose bleeding finally the 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.990
 affected suffered nausea and vomiting an 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.260
 very strong depression something pretty weird 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.510
 in children of this age 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.580
 it was that loss of attachment to life and 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.910
 this discomfort what led to many 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.890
 children to suicide without form game of the 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.470
 supposed effects produced by this 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.630
 music they corrected the melody in 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.460
 following versions of the game included 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.600
 the red and blue version of europe and usa 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.090
 that we all know 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.759
 our melody is very similar to 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.340
 seem only lacks an assumption 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.159
 murmur that causes two melodies be 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.930
 tonal in the original song 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:08.030
 including the tones that we no longer 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.030
 we can listen because of age
