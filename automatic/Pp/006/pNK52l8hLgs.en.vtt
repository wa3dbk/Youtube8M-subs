seconds<00:02:17.159> but<00:02:17.430> with<00:02:17.780> two<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.900> us<00:02:18.989> in<00:02:19.170> here<00:02:19.290> on<00:02:19.469> a

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
seconds but with two of us in here on a

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.259 
seconds but with two of us in here on a
pretty<00:02:19.769> hot<00:02:20.040> day<00:02:20.069> I<00:02:20.280> think<00:02:20.700> that's<00:02:20.879> probably

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
pretty hot day I think that's probably

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:22.459 
pretty hot day I think that's probably
not<00:02:21.390> going<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.569> happen<00:02:21.689> but<00:02:21.930> here<00:02:22.079> we<00:02:22.140> go

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:22.469 
not going to happen but here we go

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.720 
not going to happen but here we go
I'm<00:02:23.129> just<00:02:23.370> flooring<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.790> there<00:02:24.030> goes<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.180> turbo

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
I'm just flooring it there goes a turbo

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.470 
I'm just flooring it there goes a turbo
there's<00:02:26.730> 40

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
there's 40

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.550 
there's 40
here<00:02:28.439> comes<00:02:28.769> 50<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.790> 60<00:02:31.969> 7.5<00:02:32.969> for<00:02:33.540> which<00:02:34.319> feels

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
here comes 50 and 60 7.5 for which feels

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.770 
here comes 50 and 60 7.5 for which feels
about<00:02:34.799> right<00:02:34.879> with<00:02:35.879> two<00:02:36.060> people<00:02:36.389> in<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.569> car

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
about right with two people in the car

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.369 
about right with two people in the car
and<00:02:37.139> runthe<00:02:38.010> warm<00:02:38.430> bang<00:02:38.700> that's<00:02:39.569> not<00:02:40.139> bad

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
and runthe warm bang that's not bad

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.170 
and runthe warm bang that's not bad
that's<00:02:40.650> actually<00:02:41.010> pretty<00:02:41.189> fast<00:02:41.459> for<00:02:41.790> what<00:02:42.060> is

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
that's actually pretty fast for what is

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.589 
that's actually pretty fast for what is
it<00:02:42.329> essence<00:02:42.959> a<00:02:43.049> family<00:02:43.349> sedan<00:02:44.480> so<00:02:45.480> the

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
it essence a family sedan so the

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.990 
it essence a family sedan so the
question<00:02:45.989> is<00:02:46.139> how<00:02:47.069> will<00:02:47.129> it<00:02:47.400> do<00:02:47.519> up<00:02:47.700> here<00:02:47.849> now

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
question is how will it do up here now

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.879 
question is how will it do up here now
normally<00:02:48.389> we<00:02:48.540> lose<00:02:48.750> about<00:02:48.930> two<00:02:49.200> seconds<00:02:49.680> but

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
normally we lose about two seconds but

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:51.349 
normally we lose about two seconds but
in<00:02:49.980> this<00:02:50.099> case<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.489> don't<00:02:50.549> think<00:02:50.819> we<00:02:50.939> will<00:02:51.090> all

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
in this case I don't think we will all

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.839 
in this case I don't think we will all
right<00:02:51.900> let's<00:02:52.109> find<00:02:52.260> out<00:02:52.500> just<00:02:53.280> go<00:02:53.400> for<00:02:53.609> it<00:02:53.700> dude

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
right let's find out just go for it dude

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.860 
right let's find out just go for it dude
7.5<00:02:54.599> for<00:02:55.049> can<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:55.620> beat<00:02:55.859> it<00:02:56.239> is<00:02:57.239> that<00:02:57.389> forward

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
7.5 for can you beat it is that forward

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.000 
7.5 for can you beat it is that forward
that's<00:02:58.079> for<00:02:58.319> it<00:02:58.409> all<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.560> way<00:02:58.650> down<00:02:58.799> I<00:02:58.919> went

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
that's for it all the way down I went

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.229 
that's for it all the way down I went
straight<00:02:59.250> down<00:02:59.280> it's<00:02:59.879> got<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.060> regular

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
straight down it's got a regular

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.910 
straight down it's got a regular

Wow that is very surprising Wow you know

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.400 
Wow that is very surprising Wow you know
that<00:03:08.240> means<00:03:08.510> I'm<00:03:09.290> a<00:03:09.350> crappy<00:03:09.800> driver<00:03:10.070> because

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
that means I'm a crappy driver because

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.720 
that means I'm a crappy driver because
we<00:03:12.410> just<00:03:12.620> did<00:03:12.740> it<00:03:12.860> in<00:03:13.480> 7.5<00:03:14.480> old<00:03:15.190> 7.5<00:03:16.190> oh<00:03:16.220> that<00:03:16.550> is

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
we just did it in 7.5 old 7.5 oh that is

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.000 
we just did it in 7.5 old 7.5 oh that is
phenomenal<00:03:17.150> that<00:03:17.810> is<00:03:18.230> remarkable<00:03:18.770> there's

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
phenomenal that is remarkable there's

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.650 
phenomenal that is remarkable there's
two<00:03:19.160> of<00:03:19.310> us<00:03:19.400> we're<00:03:19.610> not<00:03:19.730> like<00:03:20.000> as<00:03:20.180> many<00:03:20.360> of<00:03:20.540> you

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
two of us we're not like as many of you

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.080 
two of us we're not like as many of you
point<00:03:20.870> out<00:03:20.960> and<00:03:21.350> we're<00:03:22.160> in<00:03:22.220> high<00:03:22.340> altitude<00:03:22.850> yet

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
point out and we're in high altitude yet

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.950 
point out and we're in high altitude yet
I<00:03:23.360> mean<00:03:23.840> dude<00:03:24.740> this<00:03:25.130> thing<00:03:25.370> pulls<00:03:26.000> ass

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
I mean dude this thing pulls ass

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.120 
I mean dude this thing pulls ass
yeah<00:03:27.230> and<00:03:27.440> you<00:03:27.500> know<00:03:27.530> there<00:03:27.740> were<00:03:27.800> two<00:03:27.950> of<00:03:28.040> us

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
yeah and you know there were two of us

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.610 
yeah and you know there were two of us
in<00:03:28.340> California<00:03:28.940> so<00:03:29.120> that<00:03:29.300> isn't<00:03:29.990> the<00:03:30.230> variable

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
in California so that isn't the variable

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.440 
in California so that isn't the variable
we<00:03:30.710> can<00:03:30.800> take<00:03:31.010> out<00:03:31.220> I<00:03:31.400> think<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:32.060> lesson<00:03:32.420> here

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
we can take out I think the lesson here

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.650 
we can take out I think the lesson here
is<00:03:32.660> there's<00:03:33.350> no<00:03:33.590> such<00:03:33.920> thing<00:03:34.310> as<00:03:34.550> a<00:03:34.610> zero<00:03:35.180> to<00:03:35.300> 60

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
is there's no such thing as a zero to 60

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.020 
is there's no such thing as a zero to 60
time<00:03:35.870> because<00:03:36.230> way<00:03:36.800> too<00:03:36.860> many<00:03:37.190> variables<00:03:37.430> and

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
time because way too many variables and

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.850 
time because way too many variables and
it<00:03:38.090> depends<00:03:38.600> on<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.900> day<00:03:39.080> on<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.380> driver<00:03:39.620> on

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
it depends on the day on the driver on

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.230 
it depends on the day on the driver on
the<00:03:39.950> surface<00:03:40.400> on<00:03:40.610> the<00:03:40.700> temperature<00:03:41.120> of<00:03:41.180> the
