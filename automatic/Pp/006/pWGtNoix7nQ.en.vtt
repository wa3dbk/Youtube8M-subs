another really cool product for Mercedes
vehicles<00:00:07.940> for<00:00:08.940> export<00:00:09.719> radar<00:00:10.349> detector

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
vehicles for export radar detector

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.950 
vehicles for export radar detector
integration<00:00:11.759> so<00:00:12.120> you<00:00:12.330> don't<00:00:12.480> have<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.780> have

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
integration so you don't have to have

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.870 
integration so you don't have to have
any<00:00:13.500> separate<00:00:13.889> displays<00:00:14.280> we<00:00:14.490> can<00:00:14.610> actually

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
any separate displays we can actually

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.160 
any separate displays we can actually
integrate<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.360> into<00:00:15.509> your<00:00:15.660> instrument

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
integrate it into your instrument

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.340 
integrate it into your instrument
cluster<00:00:16.730> so<00:00:17.730> I'm<00:00:18.090> gonna<00:00:18.330> grab<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.750> camera<00:00:19.140> and

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
cluster so I'm gonna grab the camera and

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.330 
cluster so I'm gonna grab the camera and
John<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.220> gonna<00:00:20.369> show<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:20.760> how<00:00:21.300> cool<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:21.840> is

John is gonna show you how cool this is

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.880 
John is gonna show you how cool this is
so<00:00:23.340> here<00:00:24.330> we<00:00:24.480> are<00:00:24.570> we're<00:00:24.840> in<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.019> car<00:00:25.260> I'm

so here we are we're in the car I'm
gonna<00:00:26.010> get<00:00:26.160> over<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.580> instrument<00:00:26.970> cluster

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
gonna get over to the instrument cluster

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:47.170 
gonna get over to the instrument cluster
alright<00:00:32.180> start<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.239> car

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:56.710 

ready<00:00:47.830> very<00:00:48.830> good<00:00:54.190> there's<00:00:55.190> your<00:00:55.720> radar

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
ready very good there's your radar

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.820 
ready very good there's your radar
detector<00:00:58.030> indications<00:00:59.230> right<00:01:00.230> on<00:01:00.500> your

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
detector indications right on your

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.610 
detector indications right on your
instrument<00:01:01.370> cluster<00:01:01.810> very<00:01:02.810> cool<00:01:03.110> stuff<00:01:03.290> so

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
instrument cluster very cool stuff so

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.400 
instrument cluster very cool stuff so
now<00:01:04.520> I'm<00:01:04.699> gonna<00:01:05.210> actually<00:01:05.660> show<00:01:06.080> you<00:01:06.140> what's

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
now I'm gonna actually show you what's

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.900 
now I'm gonna actually show you what's
gonna<00:01:06.530> happen<00:01:07.040> if<00:01:07.250> you<00:01:07.400> were<00:01:07.520> a<00:01:07.550> hit<00:01:07.730> with

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
gonna happen if you were a hit with

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.060 
gonna happen if you were a hit with
radar<00:01:08.360> or<00:01:08.660> if<00:01:08.810> you<00:01:08.930> were<00:01:08.990> hit<00:01:09.230> with<00:01:09.410> laser<00:01:09.680> and

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
radar or if you were hit with laser and

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:22.210 
radar or if you were hit with laser and
how<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.760> system<00:01:11.150> won't<00:01:11.240> protect<00:01:11.600> you

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:30.060 

so<00:01:22.760> here's<00:01:23.030> John<00:01:23.360> aiming<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.410> gun<00:01:26.110> here's<00:01:27.110> our

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.100 

very<00:01:31.070> cool<00:01:31.430> and<00:01:31.970> now<00:01:32.450> we're<00:01:32.630> gonna<00:01:32.750> hit<00:01:33.050> it

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
very cool and now we're gonna hit it

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:42.520 
very cool and now we're gonna hit it
with<00:01:33.230> the<00:01:33.470> laser<00:01:36.850> and<00:01:37.850> there's<00:01:40.720> and<00:01:41.720> what

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
with the laser and there's and what

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.790 
with the laser and there's and what
that's<00:01:42.770> actually<00:01:42.950> doing<00:01:43.520> is<00:01:44.440> basically<00:01:45.440> it's

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
that's actually doing is basically it's

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.340 
that's actually doing is basically it's
jamming<00:01:46.400> you<00:01:46.850> know<00:01:46.970> shifting<00:01:47.570> is<00:01:47.720> a<00:01:47.750> fancy<00:01:48.230> way

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
jamming you know shifting is a fancy way

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.560 
jamming you know shifting is a fancy way
of<00:01:48.380> saying<00:01:48.530> that<00:01:48.860> we're<00:01:49.160> not<00:01:49.880> allowing<00:01:50.300> the

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
of saying that we're not allowing the

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.420 
of saying that we're not allowing the
officer<00:01:51.080> to<00:01:51.260> get<00:01:51.350> an<00:01:51.500> accurate<00:01:51.980> reading<00:01:52.190> on

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
officer to get an accurate reading on

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.040 
officer to get an accurate reading on
your<00:01:52.550> vehicle<00:01:52.970> so<00:01:53.240> you've<00:01:53.360> got<00:01:53.540> a<00:01:53.570> chance<00:01:53.900> to

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
your vehicle so you've got a chance to

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.710 
your vehicle so you've got a chance to
slow<00:01:54.380> down<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:55.120> the<00:01:56.120> nicest<00:01:56.330> thing<00:01:56.660> about

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
slow down and the nicest thing about

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.710 
slow down and the nicest thing about
this<00:01:57.080> is<00:01:57.350> all<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:57.890> integration<00:01:58.640> is<00:01:58.790> right<00:01:59.060> in

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
this is all the integration is right in

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.750 
this is all the integration is right in
instrument<00:02:00.260> clusters<00:02:00.620> so<00:02:00.920> as<00:02:01.220> you<00:02:01.370> can<00:02:01.460> see<00:02:01.520> in

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
instrument clusters so as you can see in

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.450 
instrument clusters so as you can see in
the<00:02:01.850> interior<00:02:02.330> there<00:02:02.930> are<00:02:02.990> you<00:02:03.890> know<00:02:04.010> no

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
the interior there are you know no

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.220 
the interior there are you know no
separate<00:02:04.940> displays<00:02:05.390> everything<00:02:05.990> looks

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
separate displays everything looks

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.070 
separate displays everything looks
totally<00:02:06.830> stock<00:02:07.330> so<00:02:08.330> it's<00:02:08.479> a<00:02:08.570> really<00:02:08.840> seamless

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
totally stock so it's a really seamless

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.710 
totally stock so it's a really seamless
integration<00:02:09.950> in<00:02:10.160> this<00:02:10.729> vehicle<00:02:10.970> we<00:02:11.240> actually

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
integration in this vehicle we actually

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.350 
integration in this vehicle we actually
also<00:02:11.960> did<00:02:12.410> window<00:02:12.800> tinting<00:02:13.250> which<00:02:14.180> is

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
also did window tinting which is

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.690 
also did window tinting which is
something<00:02:14.540> that<00:02:14.690> we<00:02:15.140> are<00:02:15.170> offering<00:02:15.590> now<00:02:16.100> with
