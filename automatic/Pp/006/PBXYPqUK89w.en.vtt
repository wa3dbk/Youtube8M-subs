00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hi how about how skinned are they 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:07.160
 welcome to 1 video of goods and we're going 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.160
 to talk about gta 5 online 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.770
 the same if we are going to talk about if it is 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.790
 of 5 in first person both from the 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.620
 new generation or in the old 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.090
 generation will possibly come out for the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.560
 old generation but let's talk a 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.210
 little these aspects so that is that not 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.610
 there are people who are saying the gift of 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.110
 a liar so let's start gta 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.670
 It has always been a third game 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.490
 person except in gta dodd the high 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.349
 forget gta 2 beautiful memories where you 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.789
 look from the sky and they were plans that 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.499
 they come to us we believe in this 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.270
 moment will be a console or rather 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:34.950
 this game was from playstation one was 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.350
 quite entertaining in those already coming out 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.880
 me from the game or leaving me from the subject 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.710
 the game is always handled a 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.910
 third person perspective at times 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.500
 when we are driving a motorbike 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.359
 car we have the option to place it in 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.460
 first person there is nothing else 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:49.050
 obviously I think that in gta they already had 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.969
 provided the first person but to see 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.590
 let's analyze a topic that gives you 5 no 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.359
 I think that there is in the period that goes to 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.859
 follow playstation 4 imagined 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.170
 that they were going to just throw the first 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:59.969
 person to the first person was already 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.769
 list or they were going to throw him was something 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.110
 innovative all objective because 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.309
 17 to 5 did not say an innovative gta 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.320
 what is in all its versions 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.090
 previous except san andreas maybe 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.740
 as very similar true then what 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.880
 was what happened to see it and leave the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.800
 new generations and albert 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.990
 developed four years this game 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.640
 but we can not make a game equal to 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.040
 previous or rather, people are not going to 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.810
 buy a gta 5 of playstation 4 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.640
 knowing that it is the same of playstation3 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.260
 is that they said we are not going to leave what 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.650
 is the first person only to 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.240
 playstation 4 or xbox band ipc ok 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.710
 before let's analyze a topic here not 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.630
 they threw it because they just do not 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.430
 they wanted to leave it better than a game 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.170
 If it were the same as another, I explained that 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.790
 console was equal to another is 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.770
 obviously the graphs of 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.050
 Playstation 4 are much better than 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.030
 of playstation 3 the funny thing this is with 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.820
 a gta singh trailer where they compared 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.530
 the playstation playstation 4 console in 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.630
 our a graphic where the 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.030
 playstation 4 hairline example page 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.140
 playstation3 and pass the playstation 4 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.910
 shit shit 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.560
 that simple where we see the inside of 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.970
 a car in the first person we already know 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.250
 that shows what the bar of 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.230
 playstation3 of the bar of 16 in 4 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.270
 that leaves us a lot of doubts can be that 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.880
 in the future they can get an extension 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.950
 where we can add new things where 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.930
 we could buy the first person in 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.580
 a playstation store I if one of the 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.470
 people I want consoles to come out 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.700
 new consoles try them out your 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.620
 improved version as they have done 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.250
 previously people mind some day of 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.410
 rockstar 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.790
 exclusive content that if you pay for it 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.890
 obviously you will have it and they will do 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.870
 much better things is a knot that gives them 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.730
 I leave there possibly I can leave the 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.410
 first person for playstation3 or the 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.780
 old generation but my doubt is no 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.310
 I think rockstar or rather, because 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.110
 videogame company wants to take out 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.030
 a game similar to what the 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.650
 people will always want to go beyond 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.420
 because they are going to go much further but 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.220
 it came that the playstation3 or the old 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.140
 generation history has a lot to 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.030
 explore or have a lot to explore it 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.770
 park my opinion and I want you 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.360
 give me your comments down here and we 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.010
 let's see in a next video not 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.250
 forget to subscribe to the air this 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.250
