00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
unveiled an open hardware platform for

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.100 
unveiled an open hardware platform for
building<00:00:46.920> modular<00:00:47.219> smartphones<00:00:48.180> basically

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
building modular smartphones basically

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.080 
building modular smartphones basically
what<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.739> means<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.730> can<00:00:50.910> now

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
what that means is that you can now

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.959 
what that means is that you can now
build<00:00:51.480> your<00:00:51.750> smartphone<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.500> modules<00:00:53.309> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
build your smartphone in modules the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.639 
build your smartphone in modules the
concept<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.539> pretty<00:00:54.600> simple<00:00:54.809> there<00:00:55.350> are<00:00:55.469> two

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
concept is pretty simple there are two

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.139 
concept is pretty simple there are two
parts<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.129> one<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.730> exoskeleton

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
parts to it one is the exoskeleton

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.090 
parts to it one is the exoskeleton
basically<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.230> body<00:00:58.410> that's<00:00:58.680> going<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.920> hold

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
basically the body that's going to hold

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.189 
basically the body that's going to hold
all<00:00:59.250> these<00:00:59.399> modules<00:00:59.910> together<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.660> second

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
all these modules together the second

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.290 
all these modules together the second
part<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.649> as<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.129> just<00:01:02.309> mentioned<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.850> modules

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
part is as I just mentioned the modules

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.780 
part is as I just mentioned the modules
themselves<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:04.350> there<00:01:04.860> will<00:01:05.010> be<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.129> module<00:01:05.580> for

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
themselves so there will be a module for

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.030 
themselves so there will be a module for
a<00:01:05.820> camera<00:01:06.119> for<00:01:06.420> example<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.900> module<00:01:07.320> for<00:01:07.740> a

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
a camera for example a module for a

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.460 
a camera for example a module for a
display<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:09.000> also<00:01:09.119> allows<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.960> choose<00:01:10.229> how

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
display it also allows you to choose how

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.440 
display it also allows you to choose how
your<00:01:10.650> phone<00:01:10.890> looks<00:01:11.280> maybe<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.939> want<00:01:12.150> my<00:01:12.240> phone

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
your phone looks maybe I want my phone

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.480 
your phone looks maybe I want my phone
blue<00:01:12.720> maybe<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.200> want<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.500> red<00:01:13.740> maybe<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.220> want

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
blue maybe I want it red maybe I want

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.130 
blue maybe I want it red maybe I want
little<00:01:14.790> pieces<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.330> be<00:01:15.450> red<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.930> little

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
little pieces to be red and little

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.649 
little pieces to be red and little
pieces<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.590> be<00:01:16.680> blue<00:01:16.950> rbirtle<00:01:17.729> go<00:01:18.090> cruising

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
pieces to be blue rbirtle go cruising

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.200 
pieces to be blue rbirtle go cruising
the<00:01:18.930> results<00:01:19.320> will<00:01:19.470> be<00:01:19.619> basically<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.310> faster

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
the results will be basically a faster

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.719 
the results will be basically a faster
innovation<00:01:21.869> process<00:01:22.409> meaning<00:01:22.799> if<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.430> want<00:01:23.640> a

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
and buy a new module there's literally

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.719 
and buy a new module there's literally
no<00:01:27.750> reason<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.259> buy<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.409> new<00:01:28.680> phone<00:01:28.890> just<00:01:29.070> get<00:01:29.700> a

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729
