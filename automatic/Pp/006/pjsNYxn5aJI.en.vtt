00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 Yes, it is especially if or if with this 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.279
 been if this is minecraft we are at 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.440
 motorcycle day you know that all 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.210
 days all always always always 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.870
 there is always always a mod 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.120
 well not always in the event that I 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.830
 I own a car I have an accident 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.810
 whatever it would be it would be wind in has 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.460
 aroma but if it does not pass any kind of 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.740
 misfortune no event 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.880
 etcetera etcetera you will always have a 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.949
 mod over here 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.930
 before starting of shots that this mod 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.609
 it's interesting that there's this village like 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.439
 always in the plane worlds is a 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.300
 damn village and this mountain is 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.100
 interesting is different is worth trying 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.160
 over water on the properties of 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.440
 water according to that means you include me you know 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.790
 that water does not have property, that is, 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.160
 fire cure water and 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.140
 and infinite water forever courageous 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.240
 he has a 10 of my bow when he pulled the 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.490
 street if the one of a vest I pick up with a 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.740
 glass of water I remove water to whoever comes if 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.490
 you pick up a puddle with a bucket not 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.220
 kitazawa 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.810
 it's infinite, so here we apply a 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.790
 little the water properties of 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.700
 agreement so let's start it has me 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.479
 It seemed curious to bring this way worth 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.390
 because when he leaves also the 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:10.300
 properties of the lava because of some 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.610
 form is different from the rest of mods in 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.710
 the aspect that the amounts that always 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.210
 we usually bring is there are new blocks 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.520
 interesting things new but 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.890
 properties of objects when never 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.650
 it's the same everyone you're doing 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.210
 mods and others to look for any 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.119
 property as long as it does not have logic and 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.369
 I applied it so you know how 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.830
 different minecraft is worth a new 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.010
 challenge to play with this mode is a challenge 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.930
 because it changes a little bit 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.700
 everything goes for some things are the 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.420
 facilities and for other things maybe 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.300
 be more of an inconvenience for example you 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.840
 we give here 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.170
 and the water falls obviously according to 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.450
 we have thrown this block here of water 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:57.009
 and has covered this area worth 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:01.820
 several six a block of water is this 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:04.880
 what's happening here you see that I have a 3 for 1 2 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.429
 3 4 is worth 3 for 4 and here I have a 1 2 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.830
 3 4 for 3 that is to say all this water is 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.140
 all this water agree if I broke a 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.640
 block here will have to be removed or 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.959
 here is going to be done as a kind of 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.170
 current because I'm going to remove a block 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:23.040
 of water or aller we have 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.110
 and we go not now yes now now yes yes 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.209
 we have removed two and since to be filled 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.540
 Well, to stay with rent and remove a 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:33.599
 third and obviously there we have it 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.930
 ok in this case I see him a little bit 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:39.239
 of hits because we have one two three 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.250
 four five or six blocks of water one 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.650
 two three and three are nine 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.550
 and then it's supposed to be and here it would be 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.750
 one not for you to look 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:54.800
 there is the one that is missing 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.210
 You see all the water is removed and that's 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.950
 two there that are you can not access 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.740
 since it would be the other voucher that is the 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:04.850
 current is ok then it's fine 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.770
 agree there is no good hits no 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.880
 only this one adds the motel mont also in 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:13.970
 this case if I for example did so 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.240
 You see the cube that goes down here 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.160
 down 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.080
 and we would have had the water as 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.020
 you see is an easy way to remove this 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.900
 type of currents 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:28.020
 and to give that property to the water there 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.910
 we have there it stayed perfect then 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.020
 also the good thing that we have is you 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.750
 when you have a bucket of water 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:39.280
 you usually come up here and from the 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:41.400
 you take it in this case here 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.530
 you can never catch it 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.500
 to see there well there is a field to choose it 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.360
 but I come down here and I do and what 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.010
 lame and disappears this can be a 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.040
 very good help is enough to remove the 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.170
 beginning little things of agreement 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.450
 for example you have this garbage here 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.549
 the one that has started from paya to 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.310
 get or be able to put a block and 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.680
 soon I remove and zoom in and it's ready 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.969
 your problem is worth the same thing would happen with the 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.500
 aval spoke with many other things that 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:10.290
 find you this trash valley is like 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.709
 yuck then come here and be one 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.390
 it's worth less and that's it 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.000
 add the mod 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.769
 seeds with nonsense 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.989
 in that aspect well you say today it does not have 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.100
 a lot of sense but then applied 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.830
 really to minecraft 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:30.040
 If you have sab sense perhaps to plant 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.930
 those things I lost it would bother but 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.040
 for the rest of things I think it's 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.210
 quite interesting because for example 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.340
 you imagine that you have this 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.360
 you arrive at a village and there is a troll that 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.360
 has done this well 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.410
 all this crap in some ways like 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.880
 what disgust are you going to hell are you 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:56.260
 this is like you have to say 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:56.260
 the alien or useless and useful and very well 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:09.180
 hello I'm sorry to see very good I was 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:11.430
 around here and already thematically 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.780
 you remove them you see the one below and 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.080
 will automatically begin to lower the 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.550
 level in this case like you have below no 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.620
 you have to climb up with wants from 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.590
 below you will remove the help from my 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.590
 point of view this seems to me the invention 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.110
 perfect 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.120
 I put everyone here and another one here and 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.220
 will begin to disappear to lower the 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.890
 lava levels take in this case is 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.950
 burning the village is indifferent but 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:38.270
 well come here to take it off and start 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.850
 lower the water level then that's why 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.110
 I tell you to look that it has already disappeared 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.820
 it's quite interesting and it's pretty 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.710
 cool from my point of view to me 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:49.330
 like quite new guys this has been 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.330
 the amount and if you like like subscribe 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.330
 if I entertain of the sarlinga tweet 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.100
 etcetera etcetera etcetera and not boys
