00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.420 
i understand that the gamebryo engine is
extremely<00:05:29.230> inefficient<00:05:29.620> its<00:05:29.980> inefficient

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
extremely inefficient its inefficient

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.320 
extremely inefficient its inefficient
all<00:05:30.550> around<00:05:30.850> and<00:05:31.000> i'm<00:05:31.060> kind<00:05:31.210> of<00:05:31.240> disappointed

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
all around and i'm kind of disappointed

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.540 
all around and i'm kind of disappointed
that<00:05:31.750> they're<00:05:31.870> using<00:05:32.140> it<00:05:32.260> to<00:05:32.890> begin<00:05:33.160> with<00:05:33.340> but

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
that they're using it to begin with but

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.490 
that they're using it to begin with but
it's<00:05:34.150> inefficient<00:05:34.480> for<00:05:34.930> multiplayer<00:05:35.380> is

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
it's inefficient for multiplayer is

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.270 
it's inefficient for multiplayer is
missing<00:05:35.830> a<00:05:35.919> lot<00:05:36.070> of<00:05:36.130> the<00:05:36.490> subsystems<00:05:37.210> that

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
missing a lot of the subsystems that

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.000 
missing a lot of the subsystems that
that<00:05:39.280> multiplayer<00:05:39.790> tends<00:05:40.240> to<00:05:40.390> need<00:05:40.570> however

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
that multiplayer tends to need however

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.560 
that multiplayer tends to need however
let's<00:05:42.010> not<00:05:42.160> forget<00:05:42.430> to<00:05:42.490> drift<00:05:42.820> was<00:05:43.270> built<00:05:43.479> on

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
let's not forget to drift was built on

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.770 
let's not forget to drift was built on
gamebryo<00:05:43.960> so<00:05:44.710> i<00:05:45.120> don't<00:05:46.120> know<00:05:46.240> how<00:05:46.360> but<00:05:46.479> us<00:05:46.660> if

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
gamebryo so i don't know how but us if

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.240 
gamebryo so i don't know how but us if
you'd<00:05:46.870> have<00:05:47.020> a<00:05:47.050> really<00:05:47.380> viable<00:05:47.590> excuse<00:05:48.130> for

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
you'd have a really viable excuse for

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.420 
you'd have a really viable excuse for
this<00:05:48.340> at<00:05:48.550> this<00:05:48.910> point<00:05:49.210> and<00:05:50.040> not<00:05:51.040> that<00:05:51.220> they<00:05:51.310> had

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
this at this point and not that they had

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.830 
this at this point and not that they had
one<00:05:51.640> to<00:05:51.790> begin<00:05:51.880> with<00:05:52.180> because<00:05:52.330> they're<00:05:52.660> a

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
one to begin with because they're a

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.050 
one to begin with because they're a
triple<00:05:53.320> a<00:05:53.440> company<00:05:53.919> you<00:05:54.070> have<00:05:54.280> virtually

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
triple a company you have virtually

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.900 
triple a company you have virtually
unlimited<00:05:56.130> resources<00:05:57.130> you<00:05:57.430> have<00:05:57.460> all<00:05:57.790> the

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
unlimited resources you have all the

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.870 
unlimited resources you have all the
talent<00:05:58.060> the<00:05:58.300> world<00:05:58.479> you<00:05:58.600> make<00:05:58.750> great<00:05:59.050> games

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
talent the world you make great games

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.100 
talent the world you make great games
but<00:06:00.880> people<00:06:01.060> really<00:06:01.360> want<00:06:01.690> this<00:06:01.840> it's<00:06:02.050> a

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
but people really want this it's a

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.450 
but people really want this it's a
feature<00:06:02.320> that<00:06:02.470> you<00:06:02.650> should<00:06:03.010> not<00:06:03.250> be<00:06:03.760> ignoring

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
feature that you should not be ignoring

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.490 
feature that you should not be ignoring
so<00:06:06.460> i'm<00:06:06.940> i'm<00:06:07.180> pretty<00:06:07.600> disappointed<00:06:07.780> in<00:06:08.320> them

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
so i'm i'm pretty disappointed in them

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.490

there are three there are three basic
options<00:06:17.740> that<00:06:17.919> you<00:06:18.010> could<00:06:18.160> do<00:06:18.250> for<00:06:18.280> co-op<00:06:18.640> to

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:18.729 
options that you could do for co-op to

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:20.790 
options that you could do for co-op to
fall<00:06:18.880> out<00:06:18.910> for<00:06:19.150> the<00:06:19.630> most<00:06:19.810> apparent<00:06:20.530> option

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
fall out for the most apparent option

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.719 
fall out for the most apparent option
from<00:06:20.860> what<00:06:21.010> you've<00:06:21.160> already<00:06:21.250> revealed<00:06:21.580> this

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.750 
by a second person now that's pretty
lame<00:06:25.930> overall<00:06:26.830> but<00:06:27.040> it<00:06:27.100> could<00:06:27.220> still<00:06:27.250> be<00:06:27.460> a<00:06:27.580> lot

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.760
