board<00:02:51.459> yet<00:02:51.610> you<00:02:51.730> guys<00:02:51.910> this<00:02:52.150> is<00:02:52.330> a<00:02:52.360> very<00:02:52.840> very

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
board yet you guys this is a very very

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.370 
board yet you guys this is a very very
exciting<00:02:54.459> board<00:02:54.730> for<00:02:55.360> one<00:02:55.600> particularly

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
exciting board for one particularly

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.830 
exciting board for one particularly
important<00:02:57.310> reason<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:57.850> that<00:02:57.940> is<00:02:58.000> the

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
important reason and that is the

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.050 
important reason and that is the
gorgeous<00:02:59.470> matte<00:03:00.280> black<00:03:00.520> piece<00:03:00.790> you<00:03:00.970> know

gorgeous matte black piece you know

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.340 
gorgeous matte black piece you know
that's<00:03:01.270> not<00:03:01.450> actually<00:03:01.630> it<00:03:01.930> so<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.200> matte

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
that's not actually it so the matte

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.290 
that's not actually it so the matte
black<00:03:02.380> PCB<00:03:02.770> is<00:03:03.040> good<00:03:03.220> but<00:03:03.550> let's<00:03:03.730> go<00:03:03.970> let's

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
black PCB is good but let's go let's

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.030 
black PCB is good but let's go let's
talk<00:03:04.510> about<00:03:04.750> what<00:03:04.989> makes<00:03:05.170> this<00:03:05.350> board<00:03:05.560> special

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
strongly recommended ok so you want to

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
use an Ivy Bridge processor if you're

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
with an Ivy Bridge chip you've got this

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.400 
with an Ivy Bridge chip you've got this
is<00:05:47.830> a<00:05:47.860> fully<00:05:48.280> PCIe<00:05:49.060> board<00:05:49.570> so<00:05:49.960> you've<00:05:50.080> got<00:05:50.170> four

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
is a fully PCIe board so you've got four

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.220 
is a fully PCIe board so you've got four
PCI<00:05:50.740> you<00:05:50.920> want<00:05:51.100> X<00:05:51.220> slots<00:05:51.520> and<00:05:51.820> then<00:05:52.330> three<00:05:52.690> PCIe

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.230 
PCI you want X slots and then three PCIe

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.680 
PCI you want X slots and then three PCIe
16x<00:05:53.590> slots<00:05:54.220> however<00:05:54.550> physically<00:05:55.060> they're<00:05:55.210> 16

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
16x slots however physically they're 16

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.150 
16x slots however physically they're 16
or<00:05:55.930> 8<00:05:56.620> 8<00:05:57.000> 4<00:05:58.000> and<00:05:58.210> this<00:05:58.960> 4<00:05:59.020> runs<00:05:59.470> off<00:05:59.620> the<00:05:59.770> chipset

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
or 8 8 4 and this 4 runs off the chipset

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.380 
or 8 8 4 and this 4 runs off the chipset
so<00:06:00.190> it's<00:06:00.430> not<00:06:00.550> as<00:06:00.700> good<00:06:00.850> of<00:06:00.970> a<00:06:01.030> force<00:06:01.270> so

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390 
so it's not as good of a force so

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.090 
so it's not as good of a force so
basically<00:06:01.720> this<00:06:01.900> is<00:06:02.080> a<00:06:02.110> dual<00:06:02.380> card<00:06:02.770> board

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.100 
basically this is a dual card board

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.550 
basically this is a dual card board
moving<00:06:03.910> right<00:06:04.210> along<00:06:04.360> to<00:06:04.510> this<00:06:04.810> is<00:06:05.020> actually<00:06:05.380> I

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
moving right along to this is actually I

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.260 
moving right along to this is actually I
think<00:06:05.830> this<00:06:05.920> is<00:06:06.070> the<00:06:06.190> best<00:06:06.400> matte<00:06:06.670> black<00:06:06.850> PCB

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
think this is the best matte black PCB

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.600 
think this is the best matte black PCB
I've<00:06:07.540> yet<00:06:08.020> seen<00:06:08.440> so<00:06:08.950> let's<00:06:09.100> give<00:06:09.280> me<00:06:09.490> the

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
I've yet seen so let's give me the

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.220 
I've yet seen so let's give me the
thumbs<00:06:09.850> up<00:06:10.030> because<00:06:10.330> it's<00:06:10.510> so<00:06:10.720> clean<00:06:10.960> like<00:06:11.140> you

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:11.230 
thumbs up because it's so clean like you

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.590 
thumbs up because it's so clean like you
can<00:06:11.380> hardly<00:06:11.680> even<00:06:11.890> see<00:06:12.220> the<00:06:12.370> traces<00:06:12.790> it<00:06:13.330> just

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 
can hardly even see the traces it just

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.030 
can hardly even see the traces it just
looks<00:06:13.810> like<00:06:13.990> if<00:06:14.110> I<00:06:14.230> change<00:06:14.620> the<00:06:14.770> angle<00:06:14.800> a

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.040 
looks like if I change the angle a

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.170 
looks like if I change the angle a
little<00:06:15.220> bit<00:06:15.310> you<00:06:15.400> can<00:06:15.550> see<00:06:15.700> the<00:06:15.820> traces

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
little bit you can see the traces

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.730 
little bit you can see the traces
sometimes<00:06:16.570> probably<00:06:16.900> but<00:06:17.260> then<00:06:17.410> other<00:06:17.560> times

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
sometimes probably but then other times

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.400 
sometimes probably but then other times
you<00:06:17.920> can<00:06:18.100> it's<00:06:18.280> like<00:06:18.370> very<00:06:19.270> stealthy<00:06:20.080> looking

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.410 
you can it's like very stealthy looking

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:21.900 
you can it's like very stealthy looking
let's<00:06:20.800> have<00:06:20.920> a<00:06:20.980> look<00:06:21.130> at<00:06:21.220> the<00:06:21.310> twin<00:06:21.520> froze<00:06:21.790> or

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.910 
let's have a look at the twin froze or

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.580 
let's have a look at the twin froze or
for<00:06:22.120> inspired<00:06:22.540> cooler<00:06:22.900> so<00:06:23.050> it's<00:06:23.200> got<00:06:23.320> a<00:06:23.350> very

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
for inspired cooler so it's got a very

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.110 
for inspired cooler so it's got a very
neat<00:06:23.770> shape<00:06:24.010> to<00:06:24.190> it<00:06:24.220> that<00:06:24.460> actually<00:06:24.790> gives<00:06:24.970> it

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
neat shape to it that actually gives it

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.670 
neat shape to it that actually gives it
a<00:06:25.180> lot<00:06:25.360> of<00:06:25.540> surface<00:06:25.870> area<00:06:26.020> even<00:06:26.350> really<00:06:26.590> you

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
a lot of surface area even really you

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.740 
a lot of surface area even really you
can't<00:06:26.890> see<00:06:27.100> a<00:06:27.130> lot<00:06:27.340> of<00:06:27.460> it<00:06:27.580> and<00:06:27.730> it's<00:06:28.390> using<00:06:28.690> a

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
can't see a lot of it and it's using a

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.300 
can't see a lot of it and it's using a
nice<00:06:28.990> thick<00:06:29.500> heat<00:06:29.890> pipe

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
nice thick heat pipe

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.670 
nice thick heat pipe
I<00:06:30.340> think<00:06:30.880> MSI<00:06:31.510> is<00:06:31.570> branding<00:06:32.110> for<00:06:32.290> this<00:06:32.380> used<00:06:32.590> to

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:32.680 
I think MSI is branding for this used to

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.020 
I think MSI is branding for this used to
be<00:06:32.770> super<00:06:32.950> pipe<00:06:33.280> but<00:06:33.460> I<00:06:33.490> haven't<00:06:33.700> seen<00:06:33.940> them

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.030 
be super pipe but I haven't seen them

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:35.310 
be super pipe but I haven't seen them
really<00:06:34.300> used<00:06:34.510> that<00:06:34.720> lately

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320 
really used that lately

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.350 
really used that lately
checking<00:06:35.980> out<00:06:36.070> these<00:06:36.310> LEDs<00:06:36.760> so<00:06:37.000> you<00:06:37.060> can<00:06:37.210> see

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 
checking out these LEDs so you can see

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.360 
checking out these LEDs so you can see
how<00:06:37.510> many<00:06:37.570> of<00:06:37.810> your<00:06:38.020> 12<00:06:38.260> flowerpower<00:06:38.830> phases

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370 
how many of your 12 flowerpower phases

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.150 
how many of your 12 flowerpower phases
are<00:06:40.050> active<00:06:41.050> on<00:06:41.170> the<00:06:41.290> CPU<00:06:41.590> at<00:06:41.680> any<00:06:41.770> given<00:06:41.980> time

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 
are active on the CPU at any given time

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.410 
are active on the CPU at any given time
so<00:06:42.370> when<00:06:42.460> you're<00:06:42.580> doing<00:06:42.670> something<00:06:42.910> intensive

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:43.420 
so when you're doing something intensive

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.700 
so when you're doing something intensive
those<00:06:43.540> are<00:06:43.660> going<00:06:43.780> to<00:06:43.840> crank<00:06:44.080> up<00:06:44.230> to<00:06:44.410> the<00:06:44.530> top

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
those are going to crank up to the top

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:45.870 
those are going to crank up to the top
and<00:06:45.100> when<00:06:45.220> you're<00:06:45.340> not<00:06:45.490> they're<00:06:45.700> going<00:06:45.820> to

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 
and when you're not they're going to

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.950 
and when you're not they're going to
stay<00:06:46.000> right<00:06:46.150> down<00:06:46.300> near<00:06:46.480> the<00:06:46.510> bottom<00:06:46.840> it<00:06:46.930> just

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 
stay right down near the bottom it just
