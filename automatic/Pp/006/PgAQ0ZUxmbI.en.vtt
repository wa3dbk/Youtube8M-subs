00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
running cloak then you might have to

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.070 
running cloak then you might have to
kind<00:01:36.160> of<00:01:36.220> wait<00:01:36.429> which<00:01:37.360> will<00:01:37.599> kind<00:01:37.720> of<00:01:37.810> get<00:01:37.899> into

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
kind of wait which will kind of get into

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.469 
kind of wait which will kind of get into
here<00:01:38.319> in<00:01:38.410> a<00:01:38.440> bit<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.640> it<00:01:39.759> also<00:01:39.910> allows<00:01:40.209> players

to<00:01:40.599> take<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:40.959> path<00:01:41.170> less<00:01:41.860> traveled<00:01:42.489> so<00:01:42.700> you

00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:43.209 
to take the path less traveled so you

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:44.639 
to take the path less traveled so you
can<00:01:43.330> kind<00:01:43.450> of<00:01:43.509> be<00:01:43.599> a<00:01:43.630> sneaky<00:01:44.050> beaver<00:01:44.289> if<00:01:44.530> you

SMG<00:03:13.389> and<00:03:14.389> the<00:03:14.930> car<00:03:15.139> SMG<00:03:15.620> I've<00:03:15.829> also<00:03:16.010> used

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
SMG and the car SMG I've also used

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.429 
SMG and the car SMG I've also used
shotgun<00:03:16.760> with<00:03:17.090> active<00:03:17.449> radar<00:03:17.599> pole<00:03:17.870> snipers

shotgun with active radar pole snipers
and<00:03:18.680> I<00:03:19.219> wouldn't<00:03:19.609> use<00:03:19.730> their<00:03:20.030> smart<00:03:20.389> pistol

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.319 
and I wouldn't use their smart pistol
can<00:03:20.900> work<00:03:21.139> but<00:03:21.319> I<00:03:21.379> think<00:03:21.680> that<00:03:21.859> the<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.329> HUD

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
can work but I think that the the HUD

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.530 
can work but I think that the the HUD
kind<00:03:24.049> of<00:03:24.139> interferes<00:03:24.799> with<00:03:25.220> that<00:03:25.879> lock<00:03:26.209> on

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
kind of interferes with that lock on

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.689 
kind of interferes with that lock on
that<00:03:26.569> you<00:03:26.840> get<00:03:27.019> with<00:03:27.409> using<00:03:28.189> the<00:03:28.280> smart<00:03:28.459> pistol

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:28.699 
that you get with using the smart pistol

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:30.429 
that you get with using the smart pistol
so<00:03:29.030> you<00:03:29.540> know<00:03:29.659> use<00:03:29.840> that<00:03:30.019> at<00:03:30.139> your<00:03:30.259> own<00:03:30.409> risk

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:30.439 
so you know use that at your own risk

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:33.819 
so you know use that at your own risk
now<00:03:31.400> one<00:03:32.090> thing<00:03:32.120> with<00:03:32.419> the<00:03:32.509> carbine<00:03:32.930> or<00:03:33.199> any

I<00:05:21.690> am<00:05:22.350> typically<00:05:23.130> playing<00:05:23.760> hard<00:05:24.000> defense<00:05:24.360> or

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
I am typically playing hard defense or

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.520 
I am typically playing hard defense or
mid<00:05:24.750> d<00:05:24.930> I<00:05:25.550> use<00:05:26.550> it<00:05:26.729> quite<00:05:27.060> a<00:05:27.270> bit<00:05:27.330> when<00:05:28.169> i'm

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
mid d I use it quite a bit when i'm

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.290 
mid d I use it quite a bit when i'm
running<00:05:28.919> car<00:05:29.310> SMG<00:05:29.789> i<00:05:29.820> play<00:05:30.060> quite

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
running car SMG i play quite

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.390 
running car SMG i play quite
aggressively<00:05:30.780> so<00:05:31.500> you<00:05:31.830> know<00:05:31.919> I'll<00:05:32.009> typically

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
aggressively so you know I'll typically

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.900 
aggressively so you know I'll typically
run<00:05:32.759> at<00:05:32.970> players<00:05:33.560> or<00:05:34.560> set<00:05:34.860> myself<00:05:35.039> up<00:05:35.370> so<00:05:35.580> I<00:05:35.610> can

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
run at players or set myself up so I can

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.580 
run at players or set myself up so I can
cut<00:05:36.090> players<00:05:36.330> off<00:05:36.630> and<00:05:36.900> that's<00:05:37.020> how<00:05:37.229> you<00:05:37.289> want

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
cut players off and that's how you want

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.969 
cut players off and that's how you want
to<00:05:37.620> kind<00:05:37.740> of<00:05:37.830> play<00:05:37.949> flag<00:05:38.360> and<00:05:39.360> the<00:05:39.510> reason<00:05:39.750> I'm

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
to kind of play flag and the reason I'm

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:42.439 
to kind of play flag and the reason I'm
typically<00:05:40.979> playing<00:05:41.370> aggressively<00:05:42.270> is

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:42.449 
typically playing aggressively is

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.689 
typically playing aggressively is
because<00:05:42.720> if<00:05:42.840> I<00:05:42.930> get<00:05:43.110> the<00:05:43.199> jump<00:05:43.410> on<00:05:43.560> them<00:05:43.680> and<00:05:43.860> I

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:44.699 
because if I get the jump on them and I

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:46.400 
because if I get the jump on them and I
happen<00:05:45.060> to<00:05:45.090> die<00:05:45.389> let's<00:05:45.750> say<00:05:45.870> they<00:05:46.020> kill<00:05:46.229> me

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
happen to die let's say they kill me

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.010 
happen to die let's say they kill me
then<00:05:46.919> I<00:05:47.010> respawn<00:05:47.460> in<00:05:47.639> a<00:05:47.729> location<00:05:48.270> where<00:05:48.479> okay

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
then I respawn in a location where okay

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.320 
then I respawn in a location where okay
I<00:05:49.050> know<00:05:49.139> their<00:05:49.380> last<00:05:49.620> known<00:05:49.889> position<00:05:50.159> and<00:05:50.699> I

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
I know their last known position and I

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.790 
I know their last known position and I
can<00:05:51.510> still<00:05:51.780> get<00:05:51.990> back<00:05:52.139> to<00:05:52.289> the<00:05:52.380> flag<00:05:52.590> before

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
can still get back to the flag before

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.350 
can still get back to the flag before
they<00:05:53.039> get<00:05:53.130> a<00:05:53.190> touch<00:05:53.430> now<00:05:53.669> if<00:05:53.760> they<00:05:53.849> kill<00:05:54.090> me<00:05:54.210> as

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
they get a touch now if they kill me as

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.120 
they get a touch now if they kill me as
I'm<00:05:54.960> in<00:05:55.080> the<00:05:55.169> flag<00:05:55.409> room<00:05:55.680> when<00:05:55.949> I'm<00:05:56.039> playing

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
I'm in the flag room when I'm playing

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.610 
I'm in the flag room when I'm playing
hard<00:05:56.490> defense<00:05:56.880> and<00:05:57.150> I<00:05:57.240> die<00:05:57.300> that<00:05:58.199> means<00:05:58.380> when<00:05:58.530> I

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
hard defense and I die that means when I

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.290 
hard defense and I die that means when I
respawn<00:05:59.070> I<00:05:59.099> might<00:05:59.370> not<00:05:59.520> be<00:05:59.580> in<00:05:59.760> a<00:05:59.849> position<00:05:59.880> to

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
respawn I might not be in a position to

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.379 
respawn I might not be in a position to
cut<00:06:00.510> them<00:06:00.690> off<00:06:00.840> so<00:06:01.050> it<00:06:01.289> kind<00:06:01.500> of<00:06:01.560> gives<00:06:01.650> me<00:06:01.860> two

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:02.389 
cut them off so it kind of gives me two

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:04.969 
cut them off so it kind of gives me two
opportunities<00:06:03.389> to<00:06:03.570> play<00:06:03.720> you<00:06:04.320> know<00:06:04.409> kind<00:06:04.770> of<00:06:04.830> a

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
opportunities to play you know kind of a

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.070 
opportunities to play you know kind of a
defensive<00:06:05.849> stance<00:06:06.449> I<00:06:06.570> think<00:06:06.690> that<00:06:06.780> I<00:06:06.840> can<00:06:06.900> make

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
defensive stance I think that I can make

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.990 
defensive stance I think that I can make
call-outs<00:06:07.470> to<00:06:07.650> my<00:06:07.740> teammates<00:06:08.430> if<00:06:08.639> I've<00:06:08.789> died

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
call-outs to my teammates if I've died

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.670 
call-outs to my teammates if I've died
and<00:06:09.060> we<00:06:09.510> have<00:06:09.630> a<00:06:09.659> guy<00:06:09.810> playing<00:06:10.050> hard<00:06:10.320> d<00:06:10.470> so

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
and we have a guy playing hard d so

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.890 
and we have a guy playing hard d so
that's<00:06:11.430> kind<00:06:11.610> of<00:06:11.639> how<00:06:11.729> I<00:06:11.760> play<00:06:12.150> with<00:06:12.300> my<00:06:12.360> play

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
that's kind of how I play with my play

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.200 
that's kind of how I play with my play
style<00:06:13.110> again<00:06:14.039> I<00:06:14.250> told<00:06:14.520> you<00:06:14.580> guys<00:06:14.699> my<00:06:14.849> weapons<00:06:15.150> I

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
style again I told you guys my weapons I

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.610 
style again I told you guys my weapons I
mean<00:06:15.330> typically<00:06:15.720> using<00:06:15.960> carve<00:06:16.169> some<00:06:16.380> g

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
mean typically using carve some g

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.189 
mean typically using carve some g
carbine<00:06:17.580> i'll<00:06:17.789> use<00:06:18.030> depending<00:06:18.510> on<00:06:18.599> the<00:06:18.690> map<00:06:18.930> if

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 
carbine i'll use depending on the map if

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:20.960 
carbine i'll use depending on the map if
i<00:06:19.289> have<00:06:19.470> active<00:06:19.800> radar<00:06:19.949> pulse<00:06:20.220> for<00:06:20.460> example

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
i have active radar pulse for example

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.680 
i have active radar pulse for example
nexus<00:06:21.900> i<00:06:22.050> don't<00:06:22.289> find<00:06:22.470> very<00:06:22.620> good<00:06:23.070> for<00:06:23.340> the

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
nexus i don't find very good for the

nexus i don't find very good for the
SMGs<00:06:24.690> typically<00:06:25.289> because<00:06:25.560> you<00:06:25.680> have<00:06:25.830> so<00:06:25.979> much

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:26.099 
SMGs typically because you have so much

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:27.620 
SMGs typically because you have so much

building on building action it's like

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.589 
building on building action it's like
cross<00:06:27.900> the<00:06:28.080> map<00:06:28.260> crossfire<00:06:28.889> so<00:06:29.849> it's<00:06:30.030> not<00:06:30.270> very

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 
cross the map crossfire so it's not very

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:32.540 
cross the map crossfire so it's not very

good in those situations and active

good in those situations and active

radar pulse isn't going to help you that

radar pulse isn't going to help you that
much<00:06:34.380> you<00:06:34.860> know<00:06:34.979> if<00:06:35.070> they're<00:06:35.190> out<00:06:35.340> of<00:06:35.370> range<00:06:35.669> of

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 
much you know if they're out of range of

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.250 
much you know if they're out of range of
it<00:06:36.030> you<00:06:36.150> pretty<00:06:36.599> much<00:06:36.659> have<00:06:36.930> wasted<00:06:37.080> your

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:37.260 
it you pretty much have wasted your

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.719 
it you pretty much have wasted your
ability<00:06:37.740> so<00:06:37.889> you<00:06:37.949> might<00:06:38.099> as<00:06:38.190> well<00:06:38.220> use<00:06:38.580> either

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:38.729 
ability so you might as well use either

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:41.779 
ability so you might as well use either
stem<00:06:39.150> or<00:06:39.870> cloak<00:06:40.169> depending<00:06:40.650> on<00:06:40.740> the<00:06:40.830> map<00:06:40.979> so<00:06:41.280> it

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:41.789 
stem or cloak depending on the map so it

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:44.959 
stem or cloak depending on the map so it
can<00:06:42.029> be<00:06:42.210> CQC<00:06:43.279> dependent<00:06:44.279> again<00:06:44.729> because

00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:44.969 
can be CQC dependent again because

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:46.610 
can be CQC dependent again because
there's<00:06:45.150> that<00:06:45.330> range<00:06:45.690> on<00:06:45.990> the<00:06:46.200> active<00:06:46.469> radar

there's that range on the active radar
pulse<00:06:46.860> and<00:06:46.979> then<00:06:47.099> the<00:06:47.190> last<00:06:47.400> major<00:06:47.580> tip

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940 
pulse and then the last major tip

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.400 
pulse and then the last major tip
think<00:06:48.090> most<00:06:48.270> of<00:06:48.360> you<00:06:48.450> guys<00:06:48.510> know<00:06:48.600> this<00:06:48.930> is<00:06:49.170> that

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:49.410 
think most of you guys know this is that

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.500 
think most of you guys know this is that
you<00:06:50.280> cannot<00:06:50.580> see<00:06:50.820> enemy<00:06:51.060> players<00:06:51.300> when

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:51.510 
you cannot see enemy players when

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.120 
you cannot see enemy players when
they've<00:06:51.630> activated<00:06:51.990> the<00:06:52.290> cloak<00:06:52.500> ability<00:06:52.890> so

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.130 
they've activated the cloak ability so

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:54.740 
they've activated the cloak ability so
if<00:06:53.550> you're<00:06:53.730> playing<00:06:53.940> hard<00:06:54.060> defense<00:06:54.480> with<00:06:54.630> that

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:54.750 
if you're playing hard defense with that

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.110 
if you're playing hard defense with that
ability<00:06:54.960> be<00:06:55.380> weary<00:06:55.740> of<00:06:55.860> cloak<00:06:56.400> flag<00:06:56.700> runners

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 
ability be weary of cloak flag runners

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.990 
ability be weary of cloak flag runners
or<00:06:58.080> uh<00:06:58.140> you<00:06:59.010> know<00:06:59.100> objective<00:06:59.550> players<00:06:59.760> that

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 
or uh you know objective players that

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.840 
or uh you know objective players that
use<00:07:00.030> that<00:07:00.960> on<00:07:01.230> a<00:07:01.290> hard<00:07:01.830> point<00:07:02.010> for<00:07:02.310> example<00:07:02.670> I

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:02.850 
use that on a hard point for example I

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.760 
use that on a hard point for example I
don't<00:07:03.030> really<00:07:03.360> use<00:07:03.480> it<00:07:03.510> too<00:07:03.750> much<00:07:03.900> on<00:07:04.140> pilot

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:04.770 
don't really use it too much on pilot

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.520 
don't really use it too much on pilot
hunter<00:07:04.980> I<00:07:05.010> think<00:07:05.310> cloak<00:07:05.880> or<00:07:06.120> stem<00:07:06.990> work<00:07:07.290> better

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:07.530 
hunter I think cloak or stem work better

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.440 
hunter I think cloak or stem work better
in<00:07:07.710> those<00:07:07.830> situations<00:07:08.430> but<00:07:08.580> they<00:07:08.760> can<00:07:09.000> be<00:07:09.030> used

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:09.450 
in those situations but they can be used

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:10.730 
in those situations but they can be used
there<00:07:09.690> I<00:07:09.720> just<00:07:10.020> think<00:07:10.200> that<00:07:10.350> you<00:07:10.650> know

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:10.740 
there I just think that you know

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.500 
there I just think that you know
sometimes<00:07:11.100> the<00:07:11.220> grunt<00:07:11.490> stuff<00:07:11.820> kind<00:07:12.420> of

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:12.510 
sometimes the grunt stuff kind of

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.320 
sometimes the grunt stuff kind of
confuses<00:07:13.050> players<00:07:13.680> so<00:07:14.040> that's<00:07:14.910> all<00:07:15.030> i<00:07:15.060> got<00:07:15.270> for

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:15.330 
confuses players so that's all i got for

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:16.910 
confuses players so that's all i got for
