harry potter and the goblet of fire
which<00:06:00.409> i<00:06:00.619> believe<00:06:00.679> is<00:06:01.039> one<00:06:01.459> of<00:06:01.550> the<00:06:01.639> best<00:06:01.879> in

which i believe is one of the best in

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:04.899 
which i believe is one of the best in
the<00:06:02.029> franchise<00:06:02.949> but<00:06:03.949> that<00:06:04.339> does<00:06:04.550> not<00:06:04.580> change

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:04.909 
the franchise but that does not change

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:07.059 
the franchise but that does not change
my<00:06:05.689> opinion<00:06:05.719> about<00:06:06.169> how<00:06:06.439> this<00:06:06.589> movie<00:06:06.919> will

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:07.069

my opinion about how this movie will
turn<00:06:07.249> out<00:06:07.490> I<00:06:08.050> do<00:06:09.050> admit<00:06:09.559> however<00:06:09.769> this<00:06:10.219> film

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
turn out I do admit however this film

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.399 
turn out I do admit however this film
does<00:06:10.550> have<00:06:10.909> some<00:06:11.089> impressive<00:06:11.539> visuals<00:06:11.929> but<00:06:12.139> i

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:12.409 
does have some impressive visuals but i

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:13.899 
does have some impressive visuals but i
believe<00:06:12.529> that<00:06:12.830> while<00:06:13.219> you're<00:06:13.399> watching<00:06:13.580> it

00:06:15.549 --> 00:06:15.559 
it'll get just as distracting as the

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:17.609 
it'll get just as distracting as the
visuals<00:06:15.889> and<00:06:16.009> transformers<00:06:16.580> one<00:06:16.759> and<00:06:16.909> two<00:06:17.029> did

00:06:17.609 --> 00:06:17.619 
visuals and transformers one and two did
