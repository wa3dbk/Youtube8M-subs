00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
little bit insane when you come to think

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.510 
little bit insane when you come to think
about<00:01:15.600> sequel<00:01:16.170> two<00:01:16.380> people<00:01:16.830> could<00:01:17.009> share<00:01:17.040> one

joypad<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.780> believe<00:01:19.619> me<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:19.920> mean<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.340> actually

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
joypad and believe me I mean I actually

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.539 
joypad and believe me I mean I actually
did<00:01:20.939> play<00:01:21.240> with<00:01:21.680> seven<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.890> people<00:01:23.310> and

gone through something of a graphical

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.630 
gone through something of a graphical
overhaul<00:01:53.340> but<00:01:54.320> what<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.530> developers<00:01:56.159> managed

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
overhaul but what the developers managed

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.080 
overhaul but what the developers managed
to<00:01:56.850> do<00:01:57.030> was<00:01:57.479> they<00:01:58.020> managed<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.590> still<00:01:58.860> retain

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090

playability

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.630

and<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:01.500> appeal<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.659> the<00:02:03.659> original<00:02:04.170> game<00:02:04.640> in

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
and the appeal of the original game in

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.730 
and the appeal of the original game in
my<00:02:05.850> opinion<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.479> graphics<00:02:06.960> in<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.290> don't

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
my opinion the graphics in this don't

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.410 
my opinion the graphics in this don't
get<00:02:08.039> in<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.369> way

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
get in the way

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.260 
get in the way
quite<00:02:09.989> often<00:02:10.200> when<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.619> game<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:10.920> remade

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
quite often when a game is remade

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.140 
quite often when a game is remade
the<00:02:13.230> developers<00:02:13.860> focus<00:02:14.340> too<00:02:14.580> much<00:02:14.610> on

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
the developers focus too much on

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.390 
the developers focus too much on

the essence of what made the game so
grey<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:34.100> it's<00:02:35.100> an<00:02:35.310> absolute<00:02:35.760> joy<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:36.090> play

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
grey and it's an absolute joy to play

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.550 
grey and it's an absolute joy to play
it's<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.930> bit<00:02:37.080> strange<00:02:38.570> at<00:02:39.570> first<00:02:39.600> playing<00:02:40.380> it

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
it's a bit strange at first playing it

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.190 
it's a bit strange at first playing it
on<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.770> PlayStation<00:02:41.460> joypad<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.270> it's

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
on the PlayStation joypad and it's

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.160 
on the PlayStation joypad and it's
simply<00:02:43.620> because<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.160> d-pad<00:02:44.640> is<00:02:44.970> what<00:02:45.840> feels

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
simply because the d-pad is what feels

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.440 
simply because the d-pad is what feels
considerably<00:02:47.010> different<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:50.640> Mega<00:02:51.120> Drive

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
considerably different to the Mega Drive

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.330 
considerably different to the Mega Drive
one<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:52.310> so<00:02:53.990> at<00:02:54.990> first<00:02:55.320> I<00:02:55.800> was<00:02:55.920> thinking<00:02:55.980> it

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
one and so at first I was thinking it

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.730 
one and so at first I was thinking it
doesn't<00:02:56.550> feel<00:02:57.120> as<00:02:57.180> responsive<00:02:58.140> but<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.530> aids

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
doesn't feel as responsive but it aids

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.850 
doesn't feel as responsive but it aids
when<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.280> get<00:02:59.430> used<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.850> it<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.210> is<00:03:00.680> equally<00:03:01.680> as

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
when you get used to it it is equally as

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.660 
when you get used to it it is equally as
responsive<00:03:02.640> as<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.900> Mega<00:03:04.140> Drive<00:03:04.470> piece<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:05.400> is

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
responsive as the Mega Drive piece it is

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.670 
responsive as the Mega Drive piece it is
an<00:03:05.910> exceptionally<00:03:06.720> good<00:03:06.750> game<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.500> it<00:03:07.590> is

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
an exceptionally good game and it is

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.770 
an exceptionally good game and it is
very<00:03:08.040> well<00:03:08.280> put<00:03:08.520> together<00:03:09.710> graphically<00:03:10.710> is

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
very well put together graphically is

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.340 
very well put together graphically is
excellent<00:03:12.780> too<00:03:13.080> and<00:03:13.380> I<00:03:14.160> mean<00:03:14.850> it's<00:03:15.000> not

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
excellent too and I mean it's not

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.690 
excellent too and I mean it's not
pushing<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.620> graphical<00:03:17.070> limits<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.580> the

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
pushing the graphical limits of the

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.460 
pushing the graphical limits of the
PlayStation<00:03:18.450> in<00:03:18.540> any<00:03:18.690> way<00:03:18.870> shape<00:03:19.170> or<00:03:19.410> form

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
PlayStation in any way shape or form

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.550 
PlayStation in any way shape or form
poor<00:03:20.240> neither<00:03:21.240> did<00:03:21.450> Micro<00:03:21.870> Machines<00:03:22.020> on<00:03:22.470> the

poor neither did Micro Machines on the

poor neither did Micro Machines on the
Mega<00:03:22.740> Drive<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.280> was<00:03:23.430> never<00:03:23.730> about<00:03:23.990> being<00:03:24.990> a

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
Mega Drive it was never about being a

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.750 
Mega Drive it was never about being a
graphical<00:03:27.980> showcasing<00:03:28.980> game<00:03:29.220> II<00:03:29.250> was<00:03:29.610> all

about<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.240> craziness<00:03:31.140> it<00:03:31.410> was<00:03:31.500> all<00:03:31.620> about<00:03:31.860> the

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
about the craziness it was all about the

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.240 
about the craziness it was all about the
playability<00:03:32.460> I<00:03:33.030> mean<00:03:33.960> like<00:03:34.170> this<00:03:34.710> here<00:03:34.980> racing
