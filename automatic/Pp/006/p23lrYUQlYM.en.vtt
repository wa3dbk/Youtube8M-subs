00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:08.410
 had a buoy idea and few really 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:12.040
 to meaning but laughter occurred and 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:16.630

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.840

 never truck goodbye but one until 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.769

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:55.390

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:57.940
 food made me the relationship of these with the 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.810
 service increasingly knowledge 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:04.959

 due to increased longevity 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.709
 we have an immense challenge in our hands 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:24.280
 because we are small compared to 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:27.760
 profit-only organizations 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.350

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.850
 this profession 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:36.280
 we have the task of identifying 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:40.990
 information or mistakenly disclosed 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.660
 but taken as certain information gestures 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.900
 which may compromise 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.300
 the health of individuals as our 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.240
 serve the opponent 's 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:55.110
 Valesca teacher born in the profession 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:59.640
 and from now on we have it difficult 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:08.040
 but a beautiful mission for health 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:11.610
 that's why today we are here in abc 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:16.230
 but this production because we believe that 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:20.460
 can save lives be 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:23.250
 mail promotion of health and prevention 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:27.210
 treatment of diseases related to 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:30.180
 food and nutrition clinic scenario 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:33.480
 in the position of repercussions on health 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:36.210
 public in the research area or in 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:40.530
 any other name of the 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:43.410
 Nutritionist the main focus 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:46.440
 healthy food second 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:53.000
 nationalist is to know that food does not 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:57.890
 it's just the trio but it's about pleasure emotions 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.590
 Remember to be a nationalist to be a friend. 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:04.640
 guide the steps on the way 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:08.450
 food education believe that 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:11.150
 the smile with each victory won 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:15.350
 according to the nutritionist to believe that 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:18.980
 people change the world believe good 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:22.070
 improvement in notification than before 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:24.920
 it was not like that I have everything to give 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:29.270
 wrong and convert to the right 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:33.590

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:36.040
 attitudes and provide health nutrition and 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.040
 love 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:07:00.890
 and how you missed it, it was no longer strong 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:07:05.240
 what feels is worrying to know the river 

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:08.690
 from now on everything gets more difficult 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:12.740
 the problems of victory are much more 

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:16.730
 nice of your own but I'm not 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:19.700
 less difficult from now on 

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:22.940
 our mistakes will no longer be points 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:24.500
 lost in a test is what it said 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.470
