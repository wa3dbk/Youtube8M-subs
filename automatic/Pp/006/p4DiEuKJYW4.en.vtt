00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.300
 artisans can be found everywhere in the 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.150
 Spanish city 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.540
 They make up about 50 to 70 percent of the 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.189
 total population 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.090
 The craft is the economic 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.740
 engine of the city 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.239
 it gives people work and 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.650
 guarantees the supply of 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.640
 Population with vital 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.640
 products 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.390
 The market is the central hub 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.760
 for the products of artisans 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.530
 raw material for these fabrics becomes the 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.460
 Example of flax or hemp fibers 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.649
 won 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.649
 the dried plants are brought along 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.629
 millstones and crushed by hand 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:04.940
 Natural fibers are then processed with 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:06.800
 spindles continue to cook the most 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.710
 artisans manufacture their products in 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.590
 own house like this cobbler live 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.960
 and work is not too separate 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.649
 people work 12 to 16 every day 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.360
 hours 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.890
 but they do that voluntarily because the 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.940
 Urban craftsmen are not 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.520
 more serfs 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.320
 These goldsmiths can do it on their own 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.270
 to bring power to prosperity 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.660
 mostly the whole family helps 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.789
 craft business with 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.619
 this also applies to the youngest ones in place 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.450
 many start to go to school 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:44.899
 boys already at the age of seven 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:46.550
 teach as the wagon wheel maker here 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.479
 Most craftsmen have themselves 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.939
 specialized 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.310
 from raw material to the finished product 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:55.070
 all work processes are in 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.960
 a hand is the quality of work 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.570
 crucial from industrial 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.020
 mass production and assembly line work is 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.020
 you are far away 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.050
 The master craftsmen are in associations 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.130
 the so-called guilds 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.910
 together 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.440
 At the top stands a janitor 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.750
 the membership is in the guild 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.570
 Duty it is obligatory 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:29.950
 the order regulates working hours 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:32.020
 Wages and prizes to test the Zunftmeister 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.120
 Regularly the quality of the products 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.120
 here for example with the winemakers 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.989
 also in the production of the products 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.850
 the guild masters are there and 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.730
 control the winemakers at the 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.380
 vintage the regulations of the guilds 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.540
 prevent competition between the 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.670
 guild members and everyone 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.890
 winemaker work and a just 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:01.989
 income with bare feet become the 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.500
 Grapes mashed and in the kelter 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.500
 pressed 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.299
 wine comes on the wine market 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.700
 barrels for sale with a large one 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:23.590
 load crane loads the barrels on the 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:25.420
 dare the buyer the market is the one 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.780
 center of the late medieval 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.420
 instead of 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.000
 We will dress dishes 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.859
 and everything else vital 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.269
 exchanged and sold 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.290
 farmers from the surrounding area offer their 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.840
 products 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.409

 market times while the market is running 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.969
 to clear market peace 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.440
 In the Middle Ages, there is not just one 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.200
 general market are typical special 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:03.720
 markets on which only fish only 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.720
 Herbs or just a lot to be sold 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.950
 the municipal council represents the 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.410
 Market people a scale available 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.750
 as well as the possibility to change money 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.580

 to enter city debt books too 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.940
 to let 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.519
 the council also sets the prices for 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.430
 the staple foods this 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.130
 so-called fair price guarantees the 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.110
 supply even the poorer 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.210
 populations at the portal of the 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.240
 Freiburg Münster is the market right 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.310
 The city ​​in stone also carved the 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.110
 Dimensions of the city are fixed here 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.040
 to which the dealers had to keep 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:44.139
 for example for a charcoal production 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.600
 whether a sharp way or a loaf of bread 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:51.280
 the prescribed size could have on 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:54.100
 Münster be checked at any time 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.880
 Compliance with the size of the controlled market 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.500
 overseer 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.360
 he organizes the whole 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.050
 takes place in the market and collects 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.050
 was due 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.779
 the market overseer still exists today 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:13.749
 he is an urban employee and 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:16.669
 monitors the construction and dismantling of the stands 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:20.449
 Check the quality of the goods and 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:22.219
 pay attention to the hygiene in the sale too 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:24.529
 he still draws his paychecks as in 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:27.249
 middle ages from every single dealer 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:27.249
 personality 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:47.090
 not because she has to pay again 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:49.540
 from coghlan the china as well as beautiful 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.540
 dates 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.850
 even in the middle ages you pay the 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:01.210
 were the big difference with money 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.530
 There is no single currency 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:08.630
 many cities have their own 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:11.660
 coins to shape the source material 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.610
 for the common coins to silver in 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.630
 The coin workshops will be there 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.360
 processed 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:19.520
 The silver blanks are in the embossing 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:30.740
 stock clamped and stamped 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:32.540
 shaped the silver for the coin 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.800
 Workshops will be in nearby 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.560
 won mines 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.610
 For example, there were big ones in the Black Forest 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.980
 silver occurrences 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:43.310
 Freiburg also owed its wealth 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:45.080
 long time are the silver mining today 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.700
 the occurrences are exhausted and the 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.700
 Mining tunnels are empty 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:10.099
 there are so many different things in the Middle Ages 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.099
 currencies are in circulation you have to
