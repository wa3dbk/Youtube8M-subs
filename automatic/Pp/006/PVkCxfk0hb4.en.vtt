00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.549
 hello friends and friends welcome to a 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.109
 new mb games video as you can see 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.780
 Now I'm going to teach you how to put the 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.820
 wisin 2 in Spanish the subtitles in 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.009
 Spanish the home screen and all that 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.679
 because as it is a game of capcom 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.630
 capcom never translates its games to 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:21.080
 Spanish at least the audio does not 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.119
 always with the subtitles and the screen 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.940
 start and things to choose from 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.680
 part of the signs and all that 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.090
 in changing the language is very easy 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.400
 many of us have the problem that when 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.260
 we install the game stays in full 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.510
 English apart even though we installed 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.850
 in Spanish they remain compatible to change 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.230
 this is very easy the problem is that there 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.540
 many who can not find the folder 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.350
 capcom which is exactly what I'm going 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.949
 to teach now how can you see 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.480
 this English infection and to put have 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.339
 missed is very simple now the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.960
 they teach well to put it in Spanish is 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:54.030
 very simple we have to go to run 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.219
 for those who have windows 8 and do not know 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.500
 how to go to execute is done by putting the 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.990
 Start key plus r 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.610
 we write regedit it does not matter in 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.280
 lowercase capitals is the same 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.300
 result is said to be the editor of 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.700
 registry 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.350
 well what we have to do is say 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.189
 here that the local machine 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.990
 software well the problem is that many 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.479
 do not leave the capcom folder like 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.190
 that to me and directly here should 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.600
 appear here the cap folder with and 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.090
 many are lost and they think that 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.960
 there is solution the folder is actually 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.100
 here in wow 6.432 nou in case you do not 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.740
 find him here because he simply 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.730
 come down here they go pick up how should 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.710
 to be 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.159
 software 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.530
 here is layer of rising 2 we go to 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:48.490
 language we have to change the value 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.780
 to 3,000 82 and the subtitles would already be 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.000
 in Spanish on the home screen in 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.979
 Spanish well in case you do not 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.200
 find the folder here what they have 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.820
 what to do is very simple once 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.790
 select select the folder 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.790
 software they go to edition search and write 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.500
 or directly write 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.190
 d 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.020
 rising 2 once they do they give in 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.410
 look for next I do not do it because the 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.790
 last time I did it is a mistake but 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.160
 you do it and you should open them 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.390
 here directly and to the folder very 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.570
 simple now I'm going to show you that 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.530

 capcom reserved all rights 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.530
 we have to wait for the 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.720
