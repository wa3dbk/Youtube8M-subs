 apron lift the board 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.360
 will overtake 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.910
 homework 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.210
 best regards from the studies 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.430
 sergio live stations of the less channel 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.590
 visited doctorals like you already 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.080
 you will know and good ladies and gentlemen has 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.370
 come the big day we are on Wednesday 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:39.350
 April 22, 2015 today are the return of 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.850
 the quarterfinals of the Champions 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.660
 league 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.480
 remember yesterday two games were played 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.730
 matches fc.barcelona 2 paris saint 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.210
 germain 0 easy match for the barça 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.680
 that already had the tie on track 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.200
 and well he had no problems for 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.800
 get rid of the weight that easily 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.920
 and the bayern of Munich that got him 6 to 1 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.890
 to port after having been defeated 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.430
 idea 3 to 1 came the criticisms against 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.260
 the bayern but yesterday in 40 minutes already 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.330
 they had beaten five goals to Porto in 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.190
 a real football bath 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.070
 total and absolute steamroller that was the 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.470
 bayern yesterday a bayern that scares because 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.510
 already thrashed the shaktar donest in eighth 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.550
 final got him 7 yesterday to put 6 at 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.100
 port and beware of the bayern that goes to 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.310
 for all 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.100
 has its weaknesses of the bayern but 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.080
 Of course it 's a team that has a 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.240
 disproportionate brutal attack yesterday 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.880
 he had many casualties and it still did not matter 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.409
 He was an authentic dora person and 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.580
 got an authentic I'm marked at 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.750
 port that he could not do absolutely 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.050
 nothing not 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.350
 and good today we have the 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:52.280
 monaco juve remember that the idea is not 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.200
 juventus 10 and good can happen all 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.290
 we'll see what happens and then 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.960
 we have the key and important party the 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.380
 day that is the real madrid-athletic of 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.920
 Madrid 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.080
 Ladies and Gentlemen 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.360
 very difficult match for Real Madrid 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.990
 because nothing more and nothing less than has 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.540
 four very important casualties of the eleven 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.870
 regular owner who are marcelo by 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:21.620
 sanction remember a card that 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.240
 they brought for me quite unfair 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.340
 look now 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.900
 seen the closing match good if 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.910
 we have a low nothing happens but of course 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.650
 is what you have now the calico that 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.230
 you have now mounted and it's a real 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.220
 disaster we do not have marcelo for 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.350
 sanction we have a gareth bale injured 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.840
 we have benzema injured we have to 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.180
 modric injured and that is four 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.390
 titular players and key can not be 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.390
 tell 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.350
 really nobody gets things 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.810
 the athletic one of madrid very difficult 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.440
 has the low of mario suárez I do not know if 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.120
 have some more I think not 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.490
 but come on there's no comparison between 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.100
 have four injured starters and 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.510
 sanctioned with mario suárez is a 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.890
 substitutable box in the athletic of 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.750
 madrid that if he does not play, nothing happens 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.840
 there is no color not so to the real madrid 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:18.360
 it makes things very complicated 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.360
 this is the eleven holder that I would put 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.630
 and you see is formed by iker boxes 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.940
 to iker boxes I really would not put it 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.540
 but I know it went down like that I tell you so what 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.969
 I put in the eleven 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.010
 and it's that iker squares to watch the match 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:35.170
 what do you do today but let's go to cheetah 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.980
 that the kid is going to rachid to go 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.980
 years a spectacular thing the subject 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.430
 carvajal from the right lateral sergio 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.680
 bouquets and bar and as central bar and 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.260
 that made a spectacular one-way game 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.440
 it was the best of real madrid the other day 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.410
 pepe saw that gave a level enough 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.410
 low in league so I could bar before 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.750
 holder and good on the left side 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.519
 you have the option of putting arbeloa 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.650
 that usually performs quite well in the 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.900
 left band or aqua entered a 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.870
 player that is absolutely past from 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.129
 all since he never plays I do not know if he is 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.599
 because he does not feel like playing something that 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:15.310
 does not measure up to the workouts but 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:18.130
 the kid passes but good when he plays 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.930
 it also performs well so it would put 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:24.790
 Coentrao at first although good 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.800
 either one of them is worth 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.470
 in the midfield I would put a line of 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.750
 four with the two pivots that would be 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.030
 cross and lucas silva that I think that 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.030
 lucas silva will not play for much 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.200
 I say the coach is not going to put 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.700
 you know is a player who has signed up for 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.490
 the real madrid for nothing I believe but 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.710
 good things that life has had to 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.000
 casemiro last year but hey he 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.000
 they decided to get rid of him 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:54.290
 james on the right isco for the 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.870
 left and top chicharito that has 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.680
 won the post with two balls and 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.020
 Cristiano Ronaldo 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:05.250
 on another occasion I would have put gs but 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.259
 s since the injury because I repeat again 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.860
 what he has said many times is 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:11.770
 giving the size 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.509
 and is offering a good level if 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.819
 wants you see it in shape but it's that 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:17.889
 does not work with the attitude that yes that 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:20.979
 you see chicharito for example that the 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:22.930
 another day there is a great match fighting 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:25.000
 absolutely everyone and contributing over 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.759
 in the game so the kid knows what 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.469
 won and that has been dotted with the 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:31.870
 fourteenth century throughout the season but 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:34.000
 the kid when he plays it works like that 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.289
 that I would put it and that is what God 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.860
 want the truth that we have all the 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:39.650
 to lose 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.599
 how we scored a goal the athletic soon 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.520
 things are going to get very raw 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:46.159
 about the mother because she is going to enter 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:49.969
 hurry up and you'll have to mark two 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:52.490
 goals so we're going to see why it's 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:53.689
 the complicated thing is clear that the 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.820
 athletic does not have to score a goal 

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:58.220
 because as he scored a goal already 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.410
 it gets one thing 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.770
 in the end it will be a very difficult match 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:05.570
 the real madrid I do not like 200 of the 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.210
 I did not like the result at all 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.490
 but seeing already the losses that it has then 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.530
 more complicated still will not do the 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.290
 the coach's job motivating the 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:17.600
 players and tell them that the casualties do not and 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:20.480
 they do not matter at all that they 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.250
 they play in Real Madrid they have 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.620
 quality to play in real madrid and that 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.990
 they have to go out in the field to die already 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.540
 prove that they are deserving players 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.010
 wear that shield on your chest and that's 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.720
 Coach's job that sometimes and 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.340
 he knows how to motivate them because how they come out with 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.810
 the empanada and with the fear of today we're going 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.810
 to lose because we have many casualties 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:41.660
 Well, better not to go to the field in 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:44.600
 end a greeting for all and see you the 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.960
 next video and good to pray that is what 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.960
 who plays
