00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.490 
just means that if you use that card
since<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:24.720> don't<00:02:24.840> have<00:02:24.960> it<00:02:25.200> your<00:02:25.320> opponent

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
since you don't have it your opponent

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.410 
since you don't have it your opponent
can<00:02:25.830> challenge<00:02:26.160> that<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.700> if<00:02:26.850> they<00:02:27.000> challenge

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
can challenge that and if they challenge

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.380 
can challenge that and if they challenge
that<00:02:27.630> then<00:02:28.520> you<00:02:29.520> have<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.760> reveal<00:02:30.030> one<00:02:30.210> of<00:02:30.270> your

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
that then you have to reveal one of your

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.060 
that then you have to reveal one of your
cards<00:02:30.600> so<00:02:30.780> it's<00:02:30.900> all<00:02:31.020> about<00:02:31.260> trying<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.650> reveal

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
cards so it's all about trying to reveal

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.220 
cards so it's all about trying to reveal
your<00:02:32.250> opponent's<00:02:32.370> two<00:02:32.820> cards<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:33.480> here<00:02:33.750> he

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
your opponent's two cards so here he

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.720 
your opponent's two cards so here he
attempts<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.620> steal<00:02:34.980> some<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.220> our<00:02:35.400> coins

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
attempts to steal some of our coins

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.630 
attempts to steal some of our coins
we're<00:02:35.910> going<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.120> try<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.330> challenge<00:02:37.640> actually

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
we're going to try to challenge actually

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.710 
we're going to try to challenge actually
now<00:02:38.700> we're<00:02:38.820> gonna<00:02:38.910> try<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.150> block<00:02:39.390> as<00:02:39.600> the

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
now we're gonna try to block as the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.870 
now we're gonna try to block as the
ambassador<00:02:40.230> we<00:02:40.800> have<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.100> Ambassador<00:02:41.340> card

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
ambassador we have the Ambassador card

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.540 
ambassador we have the Ambassador card
so<00:02:42.660> we<00:02:42.840> can<00:02:42.990> block<00:02:43.290> them<00:02:43.980> trying<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.340> steal

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
so we can block them trying to steal

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.950 
so we can block them trying to steal
something<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.060> they<00:02:45.240> can<00:02:45.390> potentially

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
something and they can potentially

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.670 
something and they can potentially
challenge<00:02:46.560> our<00:02:46.770> block<00:02:47.070> and<00:02:47.540> if<00:02:48.540> they<00:02:48.690> do<00:02:48.750> then

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
challenge our block and if they do then

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.760 
challenge our block and if they do then
we<00:02:49.710> automatically<00:02:50.340> win<00:02:50.580> since<00:02:50.910> we<00:02:51.090> have<00:02:51.270> the

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
we automatically win since we have the

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.560 
we automatically win since we have the
Ambassador<00:02:52.770> card<00:02:55.310> then<00:02:56.310> they<00:02:56.790> have<00:02:57.209> to<00:02:57.360> reel

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
Ambassador card then they have to reel

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.449 
Ambassador card then they have to reel
one<00:02:57.810> of<00:02:57.930> their<00:02:58.080> cards<00:02:58.440> so<00:02:58.860> it's<00:02:59.010> kind<00:02:59.190> of<00:02:59.250> hard

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
one of their cards so it's kind of hard

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.440 
one of their cards so it's kind of hard
to<00:02:59.490> explain<00:02:59.880> I'm<00:03:00.000> not<00:03:00.120> sure<00:03:00.270> if<00:03:00.360> you're

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
to explain I'm not sure if you're

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.170 
to explain I'm not sure if you're
getting<00:03:00.600> it<00:03:01.100> but<00:03:02.100> they<00:03:02.430> have<00:03:02.580> many<00:03:02.910> there's

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
getting it but they have many there's

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.580 
getting it but they have many there's
like<00:03:03.300> three<00:03:03.540> different<00:03:03.570> tutorials<00:03:04.320> in<00:03:04.470> the

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
like three different tutorials in the

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.770 
like three different tutorials in the
game<00:03:04.770> so<00:03:05.070> if<00:03:05.400> it<00:03:05.880> looks<00:03:06.060> interesting<00:03:06.600> to<00:03:06.630> you

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
game so if it looks interesting to you

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.440 
game so if it looks interesting to you

and it will guide you right through
you're<00:03:12.120> not<00:03:12.240> gonna<00:03:12.330> be<00:03:12.480> confused<00:03:12.840> at<00:03:12.930> all<00:03:13.490> you

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
you're not gonna be confused at all you

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.860 
you're not gonna be confused at all you
can<00:03:14.640> pretty<00:03:14.910> much<00:03:15.000> start<00:03:15.240> as<00:03:15.360> many<00:03:15.570> games<00:03:15.750> as

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
can pretty much start as many games as

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.780 
can pretty much start as many games as
you'd<00:03:16.050> like<00:03:16.230> there<00:03:16.860> are<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.040> reputation

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
you'd like there are the reputation

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.420 
you'd like there are the reputation
points<00:03:18.209> or<00:03:18.510> reps<00:03:18.870> that<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:19.830> have<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.070> use<00:03:20.220> to

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
points or reps that you have to use to

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.790 
points or reps that you have to use to
start<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.730> game<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.150> win<00:03:21.590> twice<00:03:22.590> the

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
start the game and you win twice the

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.530 
start the game and you win twice the
amount<00:03:22.860> that<00:03:23.070> you<00:03:23.220> paid<00:03:23.459> for<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.880> game<00:03:24.030> so<00:03:24.300> I

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
amount that you paid for the game so I

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.250 
amount that you paid for the game so I
think<00:03:25.290> these<00:03:25.530> games<00:03:25.739> are<00:03:25.890> 50<00:03:26.190> reps<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:27.080> if<00:03:28.080> you

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260
