00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
this and then you have infamous which

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.710 
this and then you have infamous which
the<00:03:56.500> first<00:03:56.710> one<00:03:56.950> was<00:03:57.070> great<00:03:57.310> you<00:03:57.850> know<00:03:57.880> second

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
the first one was great you know second

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.450 
the first one was great you know second
one<00:03:58.900> was<00:03:59.170> just<00:03:59.380> more<00:03:59.590> of<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.740> same<00:03:59.860> you<00:04:00.430> know

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
one was just more of the same you know

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.010 
one was just more of the same you know
it<00:04:00.700> but<00:04:01.060> he<00:04:01.150> didn't<00:04:01.480> have<00:04:01.630> that<00:04:01.870> much

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
it but he didn't have that much

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.740 
it but he didn't have that much
innovation<00:04:02.350> it<00:04:02.920> just<00:04:03.160> wasn't<00:04:03.490> an<00:04:03.750> outstanding

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
innovation it just wasn't an outstanding

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.160 
innovation it just wasn't an outstanding
sequel<00:04:05.430> um<00:04:06.430> so<00:04:06.970> overall<00:04:07.300> I<00:04:07.450> think<00:04:07.570> this<00:04:07.780> bundle

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
sequel um so overall I think this bundle

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.340 
sequel um so overall I think this bundle
is<00:04:08.440> probably<00:04:09.690> depending<00:04:10.690> on<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:10.870> price<00:04:11.140> I

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
is probably depending on the price I
