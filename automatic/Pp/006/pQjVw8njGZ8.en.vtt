00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.560
 Y 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:16.049
 hello friends in this opportunity 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.050
 I come to bring a good modification not 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.919
 I know whether to call it modification 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.529
 this is rather an enablement of 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:28.939
 our windows operating system 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.250
 in this case windows x windows seven 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.950
 to enable our cores 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.510
 what do I want many of us to say 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.070
 time to buy our equipment with 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.040
 windows 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.120
 with windows in this case offers us 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.590
 very good equipment sean core i7 core i5 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.350
 but a lot if we do not know this 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.270
 that do not come the cores do not come 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.879
 activity by default what does it mean 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.710
 with the cores our processors do not 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.180
 they are activated by default 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.330
 this is solved very easily 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.989
 simply what we have to do is 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.989
 enter 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.260
 as follows the configuration 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.260
 first of all we have to enter 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:14.910
 run and put the following ms config 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.170
 as it appears on the screen if it is 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.790
 who can not see it because they are 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.550
 reproducing in low quality in lalin 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.640
 in the description I'm going to let you put 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.890
 in running we press uninter and we 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.990
 system configuration will appear what 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.360
 what we have to do is the following 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.880
 go to the start tab 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.160
 we direct to advanced options and activate 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.680
 number of processors in this case I 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.990
 I have a core i3 and I have four cores 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.960
 active the four at the time of 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.150
 finish we press accept 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.610
 then accept again and ask us 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.979
 restart it when you restart in 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.110
 our team we will realize that the 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.080
 ignition speed and open to 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.520
 moment that the programs are opened is 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.190
 noticeably higher depending on the number 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.380
 of teachers who have activated clear 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.759
 that this amounts to reducing the time of 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.890
 life of our teams but believe me 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.229
 it is very worthwhile because the system of 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.929
 by itself makes the nuclei 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.319
 exchange for a moment I love 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.319
 start better 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.430
 when a core is activated or let's say 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:20.319
 it's overloaded it goes to the next one and 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.970
 so on maybe you can not 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.940
 understand much better 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.430
 but good if you have activated already 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.590
 I let them how to do and that's all 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.880
 friends if you liked the video do not forget 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.000
 subscribe please 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.610
 it would really help a lot to activate the 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.240
 partner and be able to put our logo on the 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.850
 upper part 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.790
 also give me I like to put favorites and 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.650
 pass on to your friends in the description I've 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.200
 left social networks to be 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.430
 subscribe and well that's all we see 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.060
 the next video I hope that I have 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.060
 served pretty
