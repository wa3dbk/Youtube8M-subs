breeding the Amano shrimp is rather hard
and<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:47.390> reason<00:01:47.840> for<00:01:48.020> this<00:01:48.200> is<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:49.550> young

and the reason for this is the young

and the reason for this is the young
shrimp<00:01:50.360> do<00:01:50.900> not<00:01:51.110> have<00:01:51.440> is<00:01:51.860> small<00:01:52.400> versions<00:01:52.909> of

these<00:01:59.570> larvae<00:02:00.050> require<00:02:00.470> saltwater<00:02:01.070> to<00:02:01.340> grow
