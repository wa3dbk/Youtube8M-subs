00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.780 
cream again provided that I knew was a
setting<00:03:29.720> powder<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:30.260> you<00:03:31.040> will<00:03:31.370> need<00:03:31.640> to

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
setting powder and you will need to

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.339 
setting powder and you will need to
retouch<00:03:32.090> all<00:03:32.360> throughout<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:32.810> day<00:03:32.959> so<00:03:33.019> that's

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
retouch all throughout the day so that's

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.770 
retouch all throughout the day so that's
just<00:03:33.560> like<00:03:33.709> 5<00:03:34.130> hours<00:03:34.549> and<00:03:34.790> then<00:03:34.970> this<00:03:35.540> is<00:03:35.660> how

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
just like 5 hours and then this is how

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.170 
just like 5 hours and then this is how
it<00:03:35.900> looks<00:03:36.110> like<00:03:36.200> with<00:03:36.530> setting<00:03:37.010> powder<00:03:37.220> on<00:03:37.519> the

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
it looks like with setting powder on the

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.460 
it looks like with setting powder on the
coverage<00:03:38.569> is<00:03:38.690> pretty<00:03:38.959> much<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.349> same<00:03:41.470> so

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
coverage is pretty much the same so

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.960 
coverage is pretty much the same so
given<00:03:42.769> the<00:03:42.860> price<00:03:43.069> of<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.310> BB<00:03:43.489> cream<00:03:43.730> which<00:03:43.940> is

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
given the price of the BB cream which is

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.839 
given the price of the BB cream which is
168<00:03:44.900> I<00:03:45.079> think<00:03:45.290> it<00:03:45.440> is<00:03:45.530> a<00:03:45.620> good<00:03:45.799> buy<00:03:46.040> but<00:03:46.069> it<00:03:46.640> is

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
168 I think it is a good buy but it is

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:48.670 
168 I think it is a good buy but it is
definitely<00:03:47.390> not<00:03:47.420> suitable<00:03:48.140> for<00:03:48.200> people<00:03:48.440> with

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
definitely not suitable for people with

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.949 
definitely not suitable for people with
oily<00:03:48.829> skin<00:03:49.040> type<00:03:49.459> just<00:03:49.670> because<00:03:50.030> I<00:03:50.269> have<00:03:50.750> dry

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959

oily skin type just because I have dry
skin<00:03:51.200> types<00:03:51.410> and<00:03:51.530> then<00:03:51.709> this<00:03:51.890> is<00:03:52.010> what<00:03:52.190> its

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
skin types and then this is what its

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.940
