to determine what how much and and the
volume<00:03:51.790> that<00:03:51.940> we<00:03:52.030> put<00:03:52.240> out<00:03:52.390> based<00:03:53.080> on<00:03:53.290> the

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
volume that we put out based on the

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.280 
volume that we put out based on the
forage<00:03:53.710> goals<00:03:54.010> that<00:03:54.220> we<00:03:54.370> want<00:03:54.610> to<00:03:54.730> achieve<00:03:55.290> the

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
forage goals that we want to achieve the

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.450 
forage goals that we want to achieve the
main<00:03:56.470> limiting<00:03:56.800> element<00:03:57.040> that<00:03:57.340> we<00:03:57.430> have

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
main limiting element that we have

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.250 
main limiting element that we have
within<00:03:57.850> the<00:03:58.000> litter<00:03:58.210> is<00:03:58.390> the<00:03:58.540> phosphorus<00:03:59.080> and

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
within the litter is the phosphorus and

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.960 
within the litter is the phosphorus and
so<00:03:59.380> we<00:03:59.500> monitor<00:03:59.680> that<00:03:59.860> very<00:04:00.040> closely<00:04:00.520> through

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
so we monitor that very closely through

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.900 
so we monitor that very closely through
annual<00:04:01.120> soil<00:04:01.570> samples<00:04:02.340> for<00:04:03.340> over<00:04:03.610> 20<00:04:03.880> years

annual soil samples for over 20 years

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.160 
annual soil samples for over 20 years
now<00:04:04.150> we've<00:04:04.450> been<00:04:04.480> able<00:04:04.720> to<00:04:04.810> keep<00:04:04.960> our

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
now we've been able to keep our

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.960 
now we've been able to keep our
phosphorous<00:04:05.590> in<00:04:05.710> check<00:04:05.950> by<00:04:06.310> using<00:04:06.730> this

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970
