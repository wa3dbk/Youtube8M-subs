00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
fabric itself is very thin so I would

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.760 
fabric itself is very thin so I would
suggest<00:01:23.850> layering<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:24.720> colder<00:01:25.020> weather<00:01:25.200> as

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
suggest layering in colder weather as

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.100 
suggest layering in colder weather as
far<00:01:25.830> as<00:01:26.190> warm<00:01:26.550> or<00:01:26.820> even<00:01:26.910> hot<00:01:27.330> weather<00:01:27.810> goes

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
far as warm or even hot weather goes

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.749 
far as warm or even hot weather goes
these<00:01:28.500> would<00:01:28.680> be<00:01:28.770> perfect<00:01:29.160> compression

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
shorts for that it's so light and thin

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.260

it<00:01:31.560> kind<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.890> raises<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> red<00:01:32.430> flag<00:01:32.490> for<00:01:33.000> me<00:01:33.030> I

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
it kind of raises a red flag for me I

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.900

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.280 
wear that compression shorts usually go
through<00:01:38.310> laying<00:01:39.180> out<00:01:39.420> getting<00:01:39.840> stretched
