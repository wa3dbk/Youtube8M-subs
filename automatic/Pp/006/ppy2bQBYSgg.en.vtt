00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
to apply this all over my lid and then

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.290 
to apply this all over my lid and then
I'm<00:00:31.560> just<00:00:31.679> going<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.890> kind<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.250> slightly<00:00:32.520> blend

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
I'm just going to kind of slightly blend

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.840 
I'm just going to kind of slightly blend
it<00:00:33.420> out<00:00:33.570> on<00:00:33.809> around<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.350> edges<00:00:34.530> with<00:00:35.010> my<00:00:35.460> brush

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
it out on around the edges with my brush

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.869 
it out on around the edges with my brush
with<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:37.110> flat<00:00:37.350> brush<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.860> then<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:38.340> take<00:00:38.640> a

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
with the flat brush and then I take a

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.389 
with the flat brush and then I take a
fluffy<00:00:39.809> blending<00:00:40.230> brush<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.920> has<00:00:41.040> nothing

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
fluffy blending brush that has nothing

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.299 
fluffy blending brush that has nothing
on<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.940> just<00:00:42.510> use<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:43.050> blend<00:00:43.410> out<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
on it and just use that to blend out the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.010 
on it and just use that to blend out the
color<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.910> soften<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.420> up<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:45.690> there's<00:00:45.899> no

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
color and soften it up so there's no

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.799 
color and soften it up so there's no
harsh<00:00:46.289> line<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.860> then<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.219> go<00:00:47.430> into<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.149> kind

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
harsh line and then I go into this kind

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.049 
harsh line and then I go into this kind
of<00:00:48.899> rusty<00:00:49.379> brown<00:00:49.680> color<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.460> use<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.820> as

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
of rusty brown color and I use this as

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.600 
of rusty brown color and I use this as
my<00:00:51.270> crease<00:00:51.570> color<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:53.070> think<00:00:53.340> this<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.460> a

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
my crease color and I think this is a

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.670 
my crease color and I think this is a
pretty<00:00:53.879> transition<00:00:54.570> from<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.960> brown<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.590> I

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
pretty transition from the brown and I

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.560 
pretty transition from the brown and I
basically<00:00:55.949> just<00:00:56.219> use<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:57.000> blend<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.390> all

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
basically just use this to blend it all

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.430 
basically just use this to blend it all
the<00:00:58.140> way<00:00:58.230> up<00:00:58.440> towards<00:00:58.800> my<00:00:58.949> brow<00:00:59.250> and<00:01:00.260> I<00:01:01.260> just

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
the way up towards my brow and I just

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.210 
the way up towards my brow and I just
let<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.739> fade<00:01:01.920> out<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.629> then<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.960> use<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.559> color

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
let it fade out and then I use the color

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.590 
let it fade out and then I use the color
over<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.820> side<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.240> kind<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.450> like<00:01:06.540> a

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
over on the side it's kind of like a

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.080 
over on the side it's kind of like a
really<00:01:06.840> soft<00:01:07.200> soft<00:01:07.560> brown<00:01:07.890> tannish<00:01:08.549> color<00:01:08.580> and

really soft soft brown tannish color and

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.859 
really soft soft brown tannish color and
I<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.330> put<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.510> underneath<00:01:09.930> my<00:01:10.790> brow<00:01:11.790> bone
