00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
play basketball in them and then the

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.290 
play basketball in them and then the
second<00:04:46.070> one<00:04:46.220> I<00:04:46.250> have<00:04:46.400> laced<00:04:46.880> all<00:04:47.060> the<00:04:47.150> way<00:04:47.240> to

the top kind of just left untied and

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.920 
the top kind of just left untied and
that's<00:04:49.610> probably<00:04:49.910> how<00:04:50.090> I<00:04:50.120> would<00:04:50.300> wear<00:04:50.690> these

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
that's probably how I would wear these

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.200 
that's probably how I would wear these
as<00:04:51.860> far<00:04:52.010> as<00:04:52.130> these<00:04:52.310> shoes<00:04:52.550> being<00:04:52.820> a<00:04:52.910> good<00:04:53.060> pair

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
as far as these shoes being a good pair

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.460 
as far as these shoes being a good pair
of<00:04:53.240> shoes<00:04:53.480> to<00:04:53.600> wear<00:04:53.660> with<00:04:53.840> a<00:04:53.900> pair<00:04:54.080> of<00:04:54.110> shorts

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.150 
of shoes to wear with a pair of shorts
I'm<00:04:55.430> not<00:04:55.670> too<00:04:55.910> convinced<00:04:56.450> of<00:04:56.570> that<00:04:57.100> Jordan<00:04:58.100> I

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
I'm not too convinced of that Jordan I

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.290 
I'm not too convinced of that Jordan I
and<00:04:58.280> like<00:04:58.340> I<00:04:58.460> said<00:04:58.520> kind<00:04:58.730> of<00:04:58.850> has<00:04:58.940> that<00:04:59.060> boot

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
and like I said kind of has that boot

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.540 
and like I said kind of has that boot
look<00:04:59.600> to<00:04:59.840> it<00:04:59.990> and<00:05:00.290> especially<00:05:00.620> in<00:05:01.130> this<00:05:01.310> very

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
look to it and especially in this very

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.610 
look to it and especially in this very
bright<00:05:01.880> red<00:05:01.940> color<00:05:02.420> way<00:05:02.630> I'm<00:05:03.140> not<00:05:03.410> sure<00:05:03.470> that

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
bright red color way I'm not sure that

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.050 
bright red color way I'm not sure that
they<00:05:03.860> would<00:05:03.890> look<00:05:04.160> all<00:05:04.340> that<00:05:04.520> great<00:05:04.760> while

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
they would look all that great while

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.580 
they would look all that great while
wearing<00:05:05.240> them<00:05:05.450> with<00:05:05.540> a<00:05:05.600> pair<00:05:05.810> of<00:05:05.840> shorts<00:05:06.200> at

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
wearing them with a pair of shorts at

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.960 
wearing them with a pair of shorts at
least<00:05:06.770> I<00:05:06.920> don't<00:05:06.980> think<00:05:07.160> I<00:05:07.430> would<00:05:07.610> wear<00:05:07.760> them

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
least I don't think I would wear them

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.000 
least I don't think I would wear them
with<00:05:08.120> shorts<00:05:08.440> obviously<00:05:09.440> I<00:05:09.500> have<00:05:09.650> the<00:05:09.800> black

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
with shorts obviously I have the black

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.980 
with shorts obviously I have the black
Jordan<00:05:10.400> sock<00:05:10.610> on<00:05:10.880> which<00:05:11.360> I<00:05:11.450> think<00:05:11.480> look<00:05:11.780> pretty

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
Jordan sock on which I think look pretty

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.780 
Jordan sock on which I think look pretty
good<00:05:12.110> matches<00:05:12.590> the<00:05:12.710> shoe<00:05:12.860> pretty<00:05:13.130> good<00:05:13.310> but

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
good matches the shoe pretty good but

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:14.920 
good matches the shoe pretty good but
again<00:05:14.000> as<00:05:14.180> far<00:05:14.270> as<00:05:14.420> wearing<00:05:14.570> these<00:05:14.750> with

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
again as far as wearing these with

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.150 
again as far as wearing these with
shorts<00:05:15.140> if<00:05:15.380> I<00:05:15.470> wasn't<00:05:15.680> gonna<00:05:15.890> be<00:05:15.980> playing

basketball<00:05:16.340> in<00:05:16.790> them<00:05:16.940> I<00:05:17.120> don't<00:05:17.750> think<00:05:17.900> I<00:05:17.960> would

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.900 
feet while wearing a pair of pants and
honestly<00:05:27.560> this<00:05:27.770> is<00:05:27.920> this<00:05:28.190> is<00:05:28.370> a<00:05:28.400> way<00:05:28.610> I<00:05:28.640> think

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
honestly this is this is a way I think

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.130 
honestly this is this is a way I think
these<00:05:29.030> shoes<00:05:29.240> were<00:05:29.420> made<00:05:29.570> to<00:05:29.720> be<00:05:29.810> worn

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
these shoes were made to be worn

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.380 
these shoes were made to be worn
especially<00:05:30.830> in<00:05:30.980> this<00:05:31.130> colorway<00:05:31.490> at<00:05:32.030> least<00:05:32.240> if

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.390 
especially in this colorway at least if

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
especially in this colorway at least if
you're<00:05:32.510> not<00:05:32.690> gonna<00:05:32.840> be<00:05:32.960> playing<00:05:33.140> basketball

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
you're not gonna be playing basketball

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:34.470 
you're not gonna be playing basketball
in<00:05:34.010> them

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
in them

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
in them
obviously<00:05:35.480> they<00:05:35.600> look<00:05:35.780> really<00:05:36.050> really<00:05:36.380> good

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
obviously they look really really good

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.840 
obviously they look really really good
in<00:05:36.620> my<00:05:36.710> opinion<00:05:36.830> to<00:05:37.130> have<00:05:37.250> them<00:05:37.370> laced<00:05:37.580> up<00:05:37.670> two

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 
in my opinion to have them laced up two

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.340 
in my opinion to have them laced up two
different<00:05:38.120> ways<00:05:38.210> again<00:05:38.540> I<00:05:38.750> kind<00:05:39.110> of<00:05:39.140> have<00:05:39.260> them

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
different ways again I kind of have them

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.630 
different ways again I kind of have them
wearing<00:05:39.620> pants<00:05:39.950> a<00:05:40.070> little<00:05:40.130> bit<00:05:40.250> differently

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
wearing pants a little bit differently

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.130 
wearing pants a little bit differently
obviously<00:05:41.180> this<00:05:41.540> one's<00:05:41.750> laced<00:05:41.990> up

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
obviously this one's laced up

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.510 
obviously this one's laced up
traditionally<00:05:42.770> with<00:05:42.950> the<00:05:43.040> pants<00:05:43.310> kind<00:05:43.400> of

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
traditionally with the pants kind of

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.880 
traditionally with the pants kind of
over<00:05:43.790> top<00:05:44.060> not<00:05:44.660> necessarily<00:05:45.050> tucked<00:05:45.410> in<00:05:45.620> and

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:45.890 
over top not necessarily tucked in and

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.560 
over top not necessarily tucked in and
the<00:05:45.950> other<00:05:46.070> one<00:05:46.250> had<00:05:46.430> laced<00:05:47.060> up<00:05:47.210> all<00:05:47.420> the<00:05:47.510> way

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
the other one had laced up all the way

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.390 
the other one had laced up all the way
to<00:05:47.630> top<00:05:47.840> left<00:05:48.170> them<00:05:48.350> kind<00:05:48.530> of<00:05:48.590> untied<00:05:49.100> through

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
to top left them kind of untied through

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.440 
to top left them kind of untied through
then<00:05:49.550> they're<00:05:49.700> kind<00:05:49.850> of<00:05:49.940> tucked<00:05:50.150> in<00:05:50.300> a<00:05:50.420> little

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
then they're kind of tucked in a little

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.240 
then they're kind of tucked in a little
bit<00:05:50.720> either<00:05:51.260> way<00:05:51.560> they're<00:05:51.800> gonna<00:05:51.860> look<00:05:52.040> really

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
bit either way they're gonna look really
