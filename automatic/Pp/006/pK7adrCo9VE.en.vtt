 as you can see, it just starts like this 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.379
 a little tutorial for you to get the 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.660
 The game is only there to use the hand 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.730

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.870

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:47.559
 nothing very difficult the game is all in 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:51.400
 side has not much to do in 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:55.140
 start I'll just take it off it goes to the 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:58.180
 background alone is an automatic movement 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.210
 The game is there, it's about 100 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:05.350
 you're nothing more than that 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.610
 The game is very cool with graphics. 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.220
 much to do with the movie has the 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.430

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:16.060

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.270
 turtle ninja you 

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:30.549
 in the beginning it will not take much work 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.570
 game is very easy then complicating 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.899
 enough 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.840
 how does any cold start then? 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.990
 Go early in the beginning, there's this robozÃ£o there. 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.530
 who watched the movie reminds 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:47.590
 and you're going to have to go there and learn from 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.499
 Your rabiola in it 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.700
 It's not very difficult because you're in the 

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:53.229
 beginning 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.340
 So enjoy the game, I will not talk 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:01.409
 It does not give a tune there to see if you 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.409
 do you like to download 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.560
 he gives a lock he had it is like that 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:19.360
 even I do not know why maybe a 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:22.170
 update improves this in some 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.959
 special weapons that you can use as 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:31.990
 to call for help from more friendly robots 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:35.020
 You're crazy, this is a menu. 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:38.590
 Simple to improve your weapons for you to give 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.300
 an upgrade on the weapons you already have or 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.570
 Then buy new weapons, huh? 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.730
 there is the game characters you will 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.920
 have to eliminate one by one 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.150
 there are several have enough character there 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:55.390
 I think I'll play a good game. 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:59.320
 time here already shows the game already 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:04.959
 complicating a little energy though 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:08.140
 fast already very low energy starts 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:13.049
 It's a wonder, but then you know, right? 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.049
 everything for you to go there and see if you pay 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:23.350
 then the guy comes to shoot the same one too 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:29.920
 was already targeted the reported robot mission 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:32.560
 failed early and has this mission 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.709
 It's also a robot with a gun. 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.750
 special loan to 12 already to show 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:47.950
 that there is not only my child in the 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:50.320

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.660
 nothing from another world but the movement 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.090
 not so much but the game is very cool 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:59.650
