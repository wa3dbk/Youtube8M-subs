00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.250
 yes 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.070
 hello everyone how about in this video we're going 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.680
 to see an express care for the face 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.769
 for the face to erase the signs of 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.180
 tiredness when we have the face of 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.580
 this after having slept a little 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.970
 so whatever it is and we'll see that we have 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.790
 the skin off let's go we can do 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.470
 this express care where we will notice 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:31.040
 that face suddenly 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.350
 you will see it good we will need is 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.200
 very simple we are going to need 2 goals 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.109
 in a bowl we are going to put water very 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.610
 hot and two bags of mint pennyroyal 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:44.460
 there you can see it 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.380
 I have put the water in the teapot in the 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.970
 moment when the teapot begins to whistle 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.920
 the water begins to boil we missed 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.560
 in the bowl with the two mint bags 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.940
 pennyroyal and we let it infuse nothing a 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.740
 little water to take the 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.080
 properties of the mint has to be 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.400
 pretty hot ok we need what 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.890
 that is boiling but that the water is 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:06.379
 hot and in the other let's put a 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.379
 bowl with ice water with ice 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.220
 so we have two goals one with water 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.600
 very hot and another with very cold water and 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.119
 in the very hot water we have 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.310
 infused mint pennyroyal and now we're going to 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.350
 also need a wipe of these 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.820
 small for the face 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.250
 well we take the towel we bend it and the 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.110
 let's put in the bowl of water 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.950
 hot we put it in there is soak well 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.950
 with hot water 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.039
 yes 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.499
 well soaked you see the water for example 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:45.509
 it's hot so I notice it very 

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:49.829
 I warm my fingers but I do not burn 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:54.090
 good and we're going to drain it well 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:57.050
 It does not have much science but at least 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.960
 we ran them well 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:04.100
 and once elusive 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.900
 we are going to put it on his face 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.549
 we place it like this when depending on the 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.069
 size of the towel mine has been 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.590
 We are going to put it on the 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.690
 face and we will hold there two minutes 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.459
 we lie down, we relax, you know that 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.770
 natural care needs time 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.989
 and relaxation and it's not a thing and express 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.860
 of wing I put it on and that's it then 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:27.720
 we put it on our face like this 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.720
 and we leave it two minutes 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:37.430
 relax though I'm talking now 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:39.560
 I tell you we would be lying down and relaxed 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.540
 well you have to say they have that I have the 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.909
 face washed and without any kind of 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.069
 product I wash my face and now I do 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:48.349
 this treatment 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.299
 and while we have the wipe 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.189
 Above I have already told you other times with 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.260
 all natural care do not speak 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.510
 stay relaxed lying down without talking 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.599
 two minutes nothing more in these two 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.469
 minutes the skin due to the heat 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:05.659
 they are going to open the pores the skin is going to 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:07.879
 extend to relax then we leave it 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.769
 so two minutes and two minutes later 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:13.480
 we remove the towel and put it in the 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:16.920
 icy water and in the water with the heavens 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:20.690
 we put it 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.690
 we drain it very well 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.210
 and we put on the icy towel again 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.070
 on the face and now we're going to 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:34.150
 stay with the towel 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:36.820
 over for 5 minutes we put it 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.270
 well cool and we're going to stay 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.480
 so 5 minutes 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.720
 five minutes later we removed it and 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.610
 you will notice the effect of this heat 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.370
 also with the pennyroyal mint that is very 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.350
 good to soothe the skin and then the 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.450
 cold effect of towel with ice 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.640
 you will notice how the skin what it does is 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.100
 as I told you to relax and then 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.980
 contract and you will notice an effect of 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.350
 good instant face you already know two 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.330
 minutes with the hot and then five 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.700
 Minutitos with the cold always lying down and 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.740
 relaxed a very important thing if 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.760
 you have beni problems you are dilated 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.020
 on the skin 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.090
 then you should not do this 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.549
 treatment is worth it because that problem is 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.620
 can accentuate if you do not have this kind of 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.690
 problem is indicated for all kinds of 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.490
 skins and you can do it too much 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.910
 in the morning as in the evening with this 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.520
 a careful flashes as there is no need to 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.710
 have no special care is good 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.360
