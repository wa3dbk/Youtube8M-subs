00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
pretty tight and put quite a bit of

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.999 
pretty tight and put quite a bit of
pressure<00:01:45.299> on<00:01:45.570> my<00:01:45.750> ears<00:01:46.020> which<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.530> really

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
pressure on my ears which is really

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.760 
pressure on my ears which is really
kinda<00:01:47.520> not<00:01:48.090> comfortable<00:01:48.720> as<00:01:48.899> I've<00:01:49.320> said<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.649> my

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
kinda not comfortable as I've said in my

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.069 
kinda not comfortable as I've said in my
review<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.460> HD<00:01:50.880> ones<00:01:51.119> these<00:01:51.420> are<00:01:51.659> by<00:01:52.049> far

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
review of the HD ones these are by far

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.440 
review of the HD ones these are by far
the<00:01:52.560> most<00:01:52.890> comfortable<00:01:53.610> headphones<00:01:54.240> that

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450

the most comfortable headphones that
I've<00:01:54.570> ever<00:01:54.810> worn<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:55.619> this<00:01:55.799> comparison

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
I've ever worn and in this comparison

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.630 
I've ever worn and in this comparison
they<00:01:56.729> hands-down<00:01:57.390> win<00:01:57.960> once<00:01:58.530> again<00:01:59.009> but<00:01:59.490> where

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
they hands-down win once again but where

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.520 
they hands-down win once again but where
things<00:01:59.850> really<00:01:59.969> begin<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.630> get<00:02:00.840> interesting

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
things really begin to get interesting

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.770

between<00:02:01.680> these<00:02:02.070> two<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.549> sound<00:02:03.149> quality

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
between these two is sound quality

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.260 
between these two is sound quality

although the 0 2 HD retailed for about

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.979 
although the 0 2 HD retailed for about
$90<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.290> HD<00:02:07.740> one<00:02:07.950> are<00:02:08.099> only<00:02:08.459> 49<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.479> extra
