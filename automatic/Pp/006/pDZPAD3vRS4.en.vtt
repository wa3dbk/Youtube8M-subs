00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
we certainly a very Punk had a huge part

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.869 
we certainly a very Punk had a huge part
to<00:00:46.230> play<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.500> my<00:00:46.710> formative<00:00:47.160> years<00:00:47.370> and

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
to play in my formative years and

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.389

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
therefore that kind of attitude and

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.340 
therefore that kind of attitude and
ethic<00:00:50.820> he's<00:00:51.030> sort<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.570> DNA<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.199> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
ethic he's sort of in the DNA of the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.290 
ethic he's sort of in the DNA of the
coal<00:00:52.559> as<00:00:52.829> much<00:00:53.309> as<00:00:53.460> we're<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.640> rock<00:00:53.789> band<00:00:54.120> and

coal as much as we're a rock band and

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.630 
coal as much as we're a rock band and
that's<00:00:54.390> what<00:00:54.629> we<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:54.960> we<00:00:55.949> never<00:00:56.160> let<00:00:56.399> punk

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640
