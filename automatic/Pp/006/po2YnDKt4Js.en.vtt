00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
things but this new website cost

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.630 
things but this new website cost
significantly<00:06:01.030> more<00:06:01.810> than<00:06:02.800> it<00:06:02.950> did<00:06:03.400> in<00:06:03.460> the

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
significantly more than it did in the

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.510 
significantly more than it did in the
past<00:06:03.960> so<00:06:04.960> the<00:06:05.440> monthly<00:06:05.800> rates<00:06:06.070> have<00:06:06.220> gone<00:06:06.250> up

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
past so the monthly rates have gone up

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.909 
past so the monthly rates have gone up
big<00:06:06.729> time<00:06:06.940> but<00:06:07.780> it's<00:06:08.020> definitely<00:06:08.289> worth<00:06:08.770> it

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 
big time but it's definitely worth it

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:10.200 
big time but it's definitely worth it
because<00:06:09.070> of<00:06:09.190> all<00:06:09.340> the<00:06:09.490> futures<00:06:09.789> have<00:06:09.910> added

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210
