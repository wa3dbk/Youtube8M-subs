bird<00:02:47.189> scent<00:02:47.489> at<00:02:47.700> that<00:02:47.879> distance<00:02:48.269> and<00:02:48.540> so<00:02:49.170> they

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
bird scent at that distance and so they

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.539 
bird scent at that distance and so they
start<00:02:49.560> picking<00:02:49.680> their<00:02:49.950> head<00:02:50.099> up<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:50.400> they

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
start picking their head up and they

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.280 
start picking their head up and they
start<00:02:50.849> using<00:02:51.090> those<00:02:51.389> that<00:02:51.599> wind<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:52.170> their

getting them to pick something up is not

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
a little bit of training to get them to

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.670 
a little bit of training to get them to
hold<00:06:14.990> that<00:06:15.850> bird<00:06:16.850> softly<00:06:17.630> and<00:06:17.870> deliver<00:06:18.380> it<00:06:18.530> to

hold that bird softly and deliver it to

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.410 
hold that bird softly and deliver it to
you<00:06:18.830> and<00:06:19.280> that's<00:06:19.670> really<00:06:19.850> where<00:06:20.030> the<00:06:20.150> training

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:20.420

you and that's really where the training

great experiences you get to a point
with<00:06:30.680> a<00:06:30.710> relationship<00:06:31.070> where<00:06:31.730> one<00:06:32.030> will<00:06:32.360> know

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:32.540 
with a relationship where one will know

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.290 
with a relationship where one will know
intuitively<00:06:33.140> what<00:06:33.470> the<00:06:33.590> other<00:06:33.800> is<00:06:33.920> thinking

intuitively what the other is thinking

intuitively what the other is thinking
the<00:06:35.300> time<00:06:35.540> you<00:06:35.780> put<00:06:35.960> into<00:06:36.080> training<00:06:36.410> and

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:36.590 
the time you put into training and

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.950 
the time you put into training and

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
fieldwork will really pay off when it
