00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
speaking of recycling this is a really

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.109 
speaking of recycling this is a really
green<00:01:32.159> product<00:01:32.820> because<00:01:33.689> one<00:01:34.350> canister<00:01:35.119> this

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
green product because one canister this

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.230 
green product because one canister this
comes<00:01:36.840> with<00:01:37.200> your<00:01:37.439> SodaStream<00:01:37.920> system<00:01:38.640> this

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
comes with your SodaStream system this

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.609 
comes with your SodaStream system this
will<00:01:39.890> this<00:01:40.890> will<00:01:41.189> carbonate<00:01:41.939> 60<00:01:42.810> liters<00:01:43.320> of

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
will this will carbonate 60 liters of

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.149 
will this will carbonate 60 liters of
soda<00:01:43.880> so<00:01:44.880> think<00:01:45.119> about<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.770> one<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:47.009> these

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
soda so think about that one of these

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.569 
soda so think about that one of these
cartridges<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.909> going<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.119> do<00:01:48.270> 16<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.350> these<00:01:49.590> so

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
cartridges is going to do 16 of these so

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.940 
cartridges is going to do 16 of these so
that's<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.119> lot<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.479> soda<00:01:51.689> for<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.500> this
