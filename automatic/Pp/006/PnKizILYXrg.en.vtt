00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
the shoe the bottom of it doesn't

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.010 
the shoe the bottom of it doesn't
actually<00:00:15.450> have<00:00:15.900> any<00:00:16.039> kind<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.130> carbon<00:00:17.640> plate

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
actually have any kind of carbon plate

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.310 
actually have any kind of carbon plate
but<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:20.010> doesn't<00:00:20.490> really<00:00:20.699> been<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
but it doesn't really been in the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.410 
but it doesn't really been in the
mid-foot<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:23.130> it's<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.760> might<00:00:24.000> as<00:00:24.150> well<00:00:24.180> have

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
mid-foot so it's it might as well have

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.589 
mid-foot so it's it might as well have
one<00:00:24.990> or<00:00:25.949> an<00:00:26.099> axe<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.400> same<00:00:26.670> as<00:00:26.880> if<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.180> did<00:00:27.420> have

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
one or an axe the same as if it did have

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.759 
one or an axe the same as if it did have
one<00:00:27.869> but<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.830> doesn't<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:30.230> you<00:00:31.230> know<00:00:31.349> you're

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769

I<00:00:40.250> mean<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.340> can<00:00:41.489> tell<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:41.850> not<00:00:41.910> fin<00:00:42.410> it<00:00:43.410> does

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
I mean you can tell it's not fin it does

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.369 
I mean you can tell it's not fin it does
have<00:00:43.770> pushing<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:45.059> know<00:00:45.899> it's<00:00:46.170> not

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
have pushing on it so you know it's not

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.010 
have pushing on it so you know it's not
just<00:00:46.489> flimsy<00:00:47.489> but<00:00:48.180> as<00:00:48.300> far<00:00:48.510> as<00:00:48.570> more

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
just flimsy but as far as more

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.220 
just flimsy but as far as more
cushioning<00:00:49.440> goes<00:00:50.420> if<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.600> remember<00:00:52.020> from<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
cushioning goes if you remember from the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.979 
cushioning goes if you remember from the
hyperdunk<00:00:52.949> 2010's<00:00:53.789> they<00:00:54.480> had<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.660> kind<00:00:54.960> of

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
hyperdunk 2010's they had a kind of

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.430 
hyperdunk 2010's they had a kind of
padding<00:00:55.500> on<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.920> tongue<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.870> on<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.050> top<00:00:58.410> of

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
padding on the tongue and on the top of

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.740 
padding on the tongue and on the top of
the<00:00:58.649> tongue<00:00:58.859> it's<00:00:59.520> broke<00:00:59.879> up<00:01:00.090> into<00:01:00.270> three

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
the tongue it's broke up into three

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.070 
the tongue it's broke up into three
stripes<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.829> go<00:01:01.949> across<00:01:02.420> and<00:01:03.420> it's<00:01:03.960> about

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
stripes that go across and it's about

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.440 
stripes that go across and it's about
the<00:01:04.439> same<00:01:04.619> thickness<00:01:04.979> as<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.400> hybrid<00:01:05.850> out<00:01:05.970> 20

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the same thickness as the hybrid out 20

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.980 
the same thickness as the hybrid out 20
of<00:01:06.950> pins<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.880> tongue<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.479> little<00:01:09.840> bit

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
of pins the tongue is a little bit

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.480 
of pins the tongue is a little bit
different<00:01:10.439> material<00:01:10.920> though<00:01:11.040> it's<00:01:11.220> more

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
different material though it's more

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.539 
different material though it's more
bluesy<00:01:12.420> feeling<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:14.720> but<00:01:15.720> but<00:01:16.140> what<00:01:17.130> what's

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
bluesy feeling and but but what what's

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.770 
bluesy feeling and but but what what's
better<00:01:17.820> than<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.210> hybrid<00:01:18.509> out<00:01:19.250> 2010<00:01:20.540> is<00:01:21.540> that

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
better than the hybrid out 2010 is that

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.609 
better than the hybrid out 2010 is that
they<00:01:21.930> have<00:01:22.140> padding<00:01:23.040> right<00:01:23.780> here<00:01:24.780> this

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
they have padding right here this

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.679 
they have padding right here this
section<00:01:26.009> out<00:01:26.130> here<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:27.090> can<00:01:27.240> tell<00:01:27.450> if<00:01:27.540> it's

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
section out here you can tell if it's

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.080 
section out here you can tell if it's
raised<00:01:28.759> right

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
raised right

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.770 
raised right
or<00:01:30.149> not<00:01:30.359> but<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.140> does<00:01:31.289> have<00:01:31.700> padding<00:01:32.700> all<00:01:33.509> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
or not but it does have padding all the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.620 
or not but it does have padding all the
way<00:01:33.899> down<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:35.130> tongue<00:01:35.399> rather<00:01:35.729> than<00:01:35.969> just<00:01:36.299> on

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
way down the tongue rather than just on

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.620 
way down the tongue rather than just on
the<00:01:36.750> top<00:01:37.039> where<00:01:38.039> your<00:01:38.189> ankle<00:01:38.549> would<00:01:38.670> be<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.299> it

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
the top where your ankle would be so it

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.249 
the top where your ankle would be so it
has<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.840> more<00:01:40.200> complete<00:01:40.789> cushioned<00:01:41.789> tongue<00:01:42.259> so

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
has a more complete cushioned tongue so

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.410 
has a more complete cushioned tongue so
it's<00:01:43.979> better<00:01:44.310> in<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.700> respect<00:01:45.179> also<00:01:47.420> but

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
it's better in that respect also but

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.569 
it's better in that respect also but
yeah<00:01:48.569> that's<00:01:48.750> all<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.110> really<00:01:49.380> wanted<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.829> touch

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
yeah that's all I really wanted to touch

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.609 
yeah that's all I really wanted to touch

but another thing that's different about
this<00:02:06.989> shoe<00:02:07.579> wrong<00:02:08.579> side<00:02:08.849> is<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.410> has<00:02:10.649> a

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
this shoe wrong side is that it has a

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.390 
this shoe wrong side is that it has a
heel<00:02:11.700> outrigger<00:02:12.269> which<00:02:12.599> is<00:02:12.810> different<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.799> I

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
heel outrigger which is different and I

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.039 
heel outrigger which is different and I
