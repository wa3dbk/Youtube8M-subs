00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
pair of vise grips

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.490

grab<00:04:12.110> ahold<00:04:12.260> of<00:04:12.500> that<00:04:12.650> pin<00:04:13.010> and<00:04:13.250> just<00:04:14.500> wiggle

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
grab ahold of that pin and just wiggle

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:22.990 
grab ahold of that pin and just wiggle
it<00:04:15.890> free<00:04:16.100> the<00:04:16.970> rest<00:04:17.209> of<00:04:17.390> the<00:04:17.480> way<00:04:20.410> or<00:04:21.820> first<00:04:22.820> a

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000

it free the rest of the way or first a
bit<00:04:23.150> like<00:04:23.270> I'm<00:04:23.420> about<00:04:23.660> to<00:04:23.720> do

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:35.969 

that's<00:04:32.110> why<00:04:33.659> these<00:04:34.659> chains<00:04:35.050> are<00:04:35.349> pretty<00:04:35.680> tough

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
that's why these chains are pretty tough

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.559 
that's why these chains are pretty tough
I<00:04:36.309> can't<00:04:36.580> see<00:04:36.879> how<00:04:37.779> it<00:04:37.960> damaged<00:04:38.409> it<00:04:39.569> vice

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:40.569 
I can't see how it damaged it vice

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:43.379 
I can't see how it damaged it vice
material<00:04:41.199> isn't<00:04:41.379> the<00:04:42.249> sturdiest<00:04:42.729> I've<00:04:43.089> had<00:04:43.240> to

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
material isn't the sturdiest I've had to

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:53.040 
material isn't the sturdiest I've had to
repair<00:04:43.719> this<00:04:43.870> vise<00:04:44.169> a<00:04:44.199> few<00:04:44.529> times<00:04:44.770> ah<00:04:52.050> there

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
repair this vise a few times ah there

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.339 
repair this vise a few times ah there
you<00:04:53.080> go

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:53.349 
you go

00:04:53.349 --> 00:05:00.629 
you go
and<00:04:54.210> you<00:04:55.210> are<00:04:55.449> ready<00:04:55.749> to<00:04:57.270> link<00:04:58.270> it<00:04:58.449> up<00:04:58.599> with<00:04:59.639> a

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
and you are ready to link it up with a

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:07.020 
and you are ready to link it up with a
master<00:05:01.089> link<00:05:01.330> I<00:05:03.419> hope<00:05:04.419> that<00:05:04.629> helped
