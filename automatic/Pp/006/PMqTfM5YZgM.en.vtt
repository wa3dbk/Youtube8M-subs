00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.590
 Today I'm going to do a set to do the video 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.009
 of course or if that's the blue thumb 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.440

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.420
 pick up and let go so now 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.480
 well of course i start with my 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.660
 display and the first the wild shoe 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.650
 what you see is the syncmaster ph 350 from 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.850
 samsung 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.400
 this is a not too large screen 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.809
 also download it extended after 24 inches 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.460
 then the next screen that it 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.420
 actually my head dead screen that is 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.550
 the pro lite a 2483 hs from pajamas it 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.199
 is therefore a 24 inch screen and this 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.059
 You can actually see the image three times 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.040
 so I have to go two more times 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.000
 of these displays copper to a whole 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.650
 complete on off 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.190
 then I have my third screen here 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.469
 the think was the 2032 pw also from samsung 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.270
 and this dress is also elaborate nania ma 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.190
 Vampires will agree to agree there 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.570
 to complete with it 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.509
 then have my webcam here that is the 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.280
 logitec c9 20 that's one of the best 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.720
 webcams right now and with this webcam 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.759
 you already have reasonably good ones 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.259
 exposure and of course it is full hd 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.240
 through my keyboard where actually it 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.580
 Be least proud of my entire setup 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.259
 that's the sharkoon tactics is only 10 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.460
 euro that is of course a real bargain 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.840
 but yes you do not have that beautiful 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.160
 lights and all the trimmings 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.780
 daughter not true faith is very fat 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.250
 standing only thing you have is so here 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.840
 those rubber desserts that you put on extra 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.280
 give a grip during the one that is 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.740
 the van fine to then we have here 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.689
 my mouse that is the cm storm 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.009
 inferno and I am still very sorry 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.540
 maybe just happy with this mouse 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.890
 nice in the hand and it is still greasy 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.240
 also so actually I can not 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.470
 says a lot of negative about it 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.720
 and with this mouse of course I have too 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.810
 bought a cm storm inferno mouse god 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.430
 so that it fits well together 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.920
 then i have my microphone that is the 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.420
 salvage C1 and it really could be one 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.740
 very good microphone still too 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.720
 have some competition problems with it 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.490
 that he stood a little day just sounds 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.960
 luckily I don't have that problem myself 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.479
 I almost have a windscreen microphone 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.710
 purchased a php windshield and now 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.030
 which is also very cheap 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.530
 and of course I also have a tripod 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.079

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.120

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:14.070
 screwed into my desk and that's it 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.950
 this is just super nice as well 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.780
 here my headset the logitech g35 and me 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.820
 must be really honest this is one of the 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.620
 best that I have ever hung 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.300
 he is slightly heavy on your head but 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.190
 it does n't bother me 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.630
 the sound is so super good and i already have it 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.650

 then my sound blocks that are the 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.410
 logitech z 313 bidding I'm really super 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.910
 happy with this purchase because it knows the 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.860
 f youth expected a lot of pleasure 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.760
 of course exclusively for land on one 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.320
 want to run boxing 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.820
 there is also a nice taste 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.740
 which makes me really fit 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.810
 that in my room my tv is from it 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.280
 mark toshiba find it very stupid he comes 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.320
 nowhere to find the name and I have 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.450
 not see him on the TV itself but 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.490
 this TV is 24 once and it hangs 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.890
 of course on the wall above my set 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.840
 he secretly sits behind my TV then the 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.250
 elgato this is of course connected to 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.980
 my playstation 4 that you will go later 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.570
 but it's a 60 fps elgato tis 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.700
 so the very latest and so belongs 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.170
 also until my put my white ps4 here 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.610
 then of course yes what can I actually do 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.350
 say more about it 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.940

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.530

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.540
 super happy with that of course I have gas 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.150
 no boxing in a video yet 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.830
 and yes that is my playstation after 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.750
 of course what is not to be forgotten 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.560
 of course my pc where basically everything 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.150
 is about 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.920
 I naturally liked to have an i7 in it 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.330
 want to have a flat and March 5 on 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.459
 moment that I didn't have enough money 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.830
 but I'm really happy with 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.989
 this PC and of course of course also 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.820
 I have another set to complete 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.709
 LED lighting at the bottom of the desk 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.420
 and behind my desk behind my desk 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.860
 lace in different colors and too 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.690
 of course on my desk with a whole one 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.550
 easy remote control on the wall 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.989
 did I adjust the studio foam daily 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.430
 of course also a video from me 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.110
 entered this study or persists 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.610
 of course a lot of your sound against and 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.530
 is really super useful because it is still 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.020
 always of course to your touch 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.300
 and then of course my seat 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.340
 really one of the best seats i have 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.560
 have ever signed that it is not normal 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.209
 this chair fits so nicely during it 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.580
 I never have problems with my back again 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.930
 and never leaf comes from a wooden or how 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.370
 you call that 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.989
 this is really one of the best then the 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.290
 what I've ever been on and certainly for 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.290
 this price 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.970
 well that was the video if you myset 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.100
 of course you still have questions 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.480
 especially you coming down the back in the me 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.100
 try to get as much of the question as possible 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:29.410
 so wherever I am here is now 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.410
 for watching and I say later
