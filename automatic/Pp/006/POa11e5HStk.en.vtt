shocked<00:01:54.390> if<00:01:54.630> we<00:01:54.840> get<00:01:55.020> any<00:01:55.229> zombie<00:01:55.890> beta<00:01:56.100> access

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
shocked if we get any zombie beta access

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.120 
shocked if we get any zombie beta access
cuz<00:01:57.060> ambia<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.509> always<00:01:57.810> such<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.020> close<00:01:58.409> hush

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
cuz ambia is always such a close hush

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.249 
cuz ambia is always such a close hush
hush<00:01:59.369> operation<00:02:00.180> i<00:02:00.329> don't<00:02:00.899> think<00:02:01.110> we'll<00:02:01.170> get

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
hush operation i don't think we'll get

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.679 
hush operation i don't think we'll get
any<00:02:01.530> taste<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.130> zombies<00:02:02.549> maybe<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:03.149> guess<00:02:03.570> we

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
any taste of zombies maybe I guess we

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.420 
any taste of zombies maybe I guess we
could<00:02:03.930> maybe<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.380> tease<00:02:04.710> maybe<00:02:05.130> they'll<00:02:05.340> give

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
could maybe a tease maybe they'll give

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.980 
could maybe a tease maybe they'll give
us<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.610> tease<00:02:05.820> but<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:06.240> think<00:02:06.600> it's<00:02:06.780> mainly

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
us a tease but I think it's mainly

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.139 
us a tease but I think it's mainly
multiplayer<00:02:07.829> maybe<00:02:08.220> even<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.700> beta<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.119> the

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
multiplayer maybe even a beta to the

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.050 
multiplayer maybe even a beta to the
campaign

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
campaign

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.640 
campaign
but<00:02:10.209> I<00:02:10.239> really<00:02:10.330> can't<00:02:11.110> see<00:02:11.349> them<00:02:11.500> doing

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
but I really can't see them doing

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.699 
but I really can't see them doing
anything<00:02:11.920> for<00:02:12.870> zombies<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:14.410> I<00:02:14.470> think<00:02:14.650> this

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
anything for zombies and I think this

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.650 
anything for zombies and I think this
might<00:02:14.920> be<00:02:14.950> an<00:02:15.250> incentive<00:02:15.970> for<00:02:16.180> them<00:02:16.330> to<00:02:16.420> try

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
might be an incentive for them to try

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.510 
might be an incentive for them to try
and<00:02:16.750> get<00:02:16.870> people<00:02:16.989> back<00:02:17.319> to<00:02:17.380> call<00:02:17.680> duty<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.400> give

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
and get people back to call duty to give

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.220 
and get people back to call duty to give
them<00:02:18.670> beta<00:02:18.910> access<00:02:19.480> kind<00:02:19.810> of<00:02:19.900> like<00:02:19.989> they<00:02:20.080> did

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
them beta access kind of like they did

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.800 
them beta access kind of like they did
for<00:02:20.260> destiny<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:21.010> then<00:02:21.489> reel<00:02:22.150> us<00:02:22.300> back<00:02:22.569> in

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
for destiny and then reel us back in

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.360 
for destiny and then reel us back in
saying<00:02:23.110> oh<00:02:23.230> I<00:02:23.260> was<00:02:23.530> pretty<00:02:23.680> good<00:02:23.860> i<00:02:23.890> think<00:02:24.099> i<00:02:24.310> do

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
more interesting is so far for this

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.800

pre-order the only things announced has

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.759 
pre-order the only things announced has
been<00:02:34.989> xbox<00:02:35.560> one<00:02:35.830> playstation<00:02:36.069> 4<00:02:36.700> in<00:02:37.080> pc<00:02:38.080> now

been xbox one playstation 4 in pc now
that's<00:02:38.980> interesting<00:02:39.430> because<00:02:39.670> we<00:02:39.910> might<00:02:40.090> be

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
that's interesting because we might be

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.539 
that's interesting because we might be
going<00:02:40.360> fully<00:02:40.870> next<00:02:41.319> gen<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:41.920> i<00:02:42.130> really<00:02:42.400> hope

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
I mean I'm just I'm almost at a loss for

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.410 
I mean I'm just I'm almost at a loss for
words<00:03:18.100> when<00:03:18.310> it<00:03:18.489> comes<00:03:18.670> to<00:03:18.820> this<00:03:18.940> because<00:03:19.180> it's

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
words when it comes to this because it's

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.599 
words when it comes to this because it's
like<00:03:19.570> wow<00:03:19.810> this<00:03:20.290> is<00:03:20.470> a<00:03:20.500> big<00:03:20.859> step<00:03:21.280> in<00:03:21.459> a<00:03:21.579> very

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
like wow this is a big step in a very

different<00:03:22.299> direction<00:03:22.510> for<00:03:22.989> call<00:03:23.140> duty<00:03:23.380> and<00:03:23.980> I

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
different direction for call duty and I

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.559 
different direction for call duty and I
think<00:03:24.280> it's<00:03:24.400> a<00:03:24.519> long<00:03:24.700> time<00:03:24.940> coming<00:03:24.970> that<00:03:25.390> call

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
think it's a long time coming that call

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.360 
think it's a long time coming that call
duty<00:03:25.750> does<00:03:26.049> new<00:03:26.560> things<00:03:26.859> and<00:03:27.010> innovates

duty does new things and innovates

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.490 
duty does new things and innovates
