00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.669 
to do here we just go to the Panda Base
was<00:01:51.700> like<00:01:52.210> eight<00:01:52.509> hours<00:01:52.659> after<00:01:53.140> we<00:01:53.229> landed

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
was like eight hours after we landed

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.529 
was like eight hours after we landed
right<00:01:54.159> do<00:01:54.310> it<00:01:54.399> like<00:01:54.579> in<00:01:54.759> the<00:01:54.850> morning<00:01:55.000> so<00:01:55.450> we

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
right do it like in the morning so we

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.239 
right do it like in the morning so we
can<00:01:55.689> only<00:01:55.780> do<00:01:56.079> that<00:01:56.109> but<00:01:56.469> hopefully<00:01:56.619> be<00:01:57.159> able

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:57.249 
can only do that but hopefully be able

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:00.719 
can only do that but hopefully be able
to<00:01:57.429> do<00:01:57.520> that<00:01:57.670> later<00:01:58.859> so<00:01:59.859> is<00:02:00.009> this<00:02:00.130> year<00:02:00.460> its

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
to do that later so is this year its

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.569 
to do that later so is this year its
first<00:02:01.119> WCTU<00:02:02.079> event<00:02:02.289> no<00:02:02.979> it's<00:02:03.189> actually<00:02:03.460> my

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
first WCTU event no it's actually my

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.230 
first WCTU event no it's actually my
third<00:02:03.759> person<00:02:04.299> watching<00:02:04.899> them

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
third person watching them

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.479 
third person watching them
so<00:02:07.110> how<00:02:07.409> does<00:02:07.470> this<00:02:07.619> compare<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.220> your

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
so how does this compare to your

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.449 
so how does this compare to your
previous<00:02:08.759> events<00:02:09.950> it's<00:02:10.950> not<00:02:11.069> too<00:02:11.250> different

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
previous events it's not too different

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.420 
previous events it's not too different
super<00:02:12.450> loud<00:02:12.599> beyond<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.110> game<00:02:13.319> going<00:02:14.220> on<00:02:14.340> the

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
super loud beyond the game going on the

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.699 
super loud beyond the game going on the
background<00:02:14.660> 24-7<00:02:15.660> actually<00:02:16.470> they've<00:02:16.590> been

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
background 24-7 actually they've been

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:17.960 
background 24-7 actually they've been
cutting<00:02:16.860> down<00:02:17.130> on<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.520> which<00:02:17.670> is<00:02:17.700> good

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
cutting down on that which is good

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:56.380 

someone<00:03:45.580> named

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:13.220 

you<00:03:57.390> mean<00:03:57.540> like<00:03:57.569> if<00:03:57.959> they<00:03:58.230> come<00:03:58.950> out<00:03:59.129> of<00:03:59.340> groups

mindset at all how are you going to

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.090 
mindset at all how are you going to
perform<00:04:29.780> all<00:04:30.780> I<00:04:30.840> mean<00:04:31.140> I<00:04:31.470> don't<00:04:31.860> know<00:04:31.920> what

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
perform all I mean I don't know what

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.380 
perform all I mean I don't know what
they're<00:04:32.280> thinking<00:04:32.490> they're<00:04:32.730> ones<00:04:33.090> playing

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
they're thinking they're ones playing

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.690 
they're thinking they're ones playing
but<00:04:33.690> in<00:04:33.780> my<00:04:33.900> opinion<00:04:34.050> is<00:04:34.350> pretty<00:04:34.650> it's<00:04:35.610> pretty

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
but in my opinion is pretty it's pretty

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.490 
but in my opinion is pretty it's pretty
easy<00:04:35.970> group<00:04:36.240> I<00:04:36.420> mean<00:04:36.570> it<00:04:36.660> was<00:04:36.750> getting

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
easy group I mean it was getting

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.810 
easy group I mean it was getting
basically<00:04:37.800> decided<00:04:38.250> who<00:04:38.370> was<00:04:38.460> going<00:04:38.550> to<00:04:38.670> get

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
basically decided who was going to get

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.990 
basically decided who was going to get
first<00:04:39.090> and<00:04:40.160> who<00:04:41.160> was<00:04:41.280> going<00:04:41.430> to<00:04:41.490> get<00:04:41.610> first<00:04:41.820> and

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
first and who was going to get first and

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.280 
first and who was going to get first and
he<00:04:42.060> was<00:04:42.180> going<00:04:42.300> to<00:04:42.360> get<00:04:42.480> sick<00:04:42.690> and<00:04:42.870> then<00:04:42.930> from

he was going to get sick and then from

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.840 
he was going to get sick and then from
now<00:04:43.320> on<00:04:43.440> should<00:04:43.800> be<00:04:43.980> a<00:04:44.010> couple<00:04:44.190> easy<00:04:44.550> games

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
now on should be a couple easy games

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.700 
now on should be a couple easy games
would<00:04:45.510> have<00:04:45.600> been<00:04:45.690> a<00:04:45.780> little<00:04:46.140> nicer<00:04:46.320> if<00:04:46.620> they

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
would have been a little nicer if they

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.530 
would have been a little nicer if they
got<00:04:46.860> to<00:04:46.980> play<00:04:47.160> kind<00:04:47.640> of<00:04:47.730> a<00:04:47.790> warm-up<00:04:48.150> games<00:04:48.360> at

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
it's going to be pretty hard actually

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.210 
it's going to be pretty hard actually
because<00:05:08.910> of<00:05:09.060> the<00:05:09.630> second<00:05:10.620> place<00:05:10.770> on<00:05:10.890> the<00:05:10.950> group

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220
