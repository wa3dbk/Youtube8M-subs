 person it has a little gameplay 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.910
 difficult in relation to others of the genus

 despite being a fighting game their 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.100
 commands are very basic but require a 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.840
 certain level of agility for attacks 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.320
 more powerful or defense 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.320

 the scenario is quite broad and well 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.200
 elaborate 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.970
 Batman Arkham Origin is a fighting game 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.190
 quite similar where chances but 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:55.610

 differences in their new gameplay 3 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.180
 It is also a shooter first 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.860
 the gameplay is easier if 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.450
 compared to modern combat but still 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.790
 this is a challenging game 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.240
 the graphics are very well built

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.040
 heated beyond the normal and during the 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.080
 nearly 40 minutes of testing had a 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.850
 14% battery consumption 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.380
 the only problem observed was the 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.510
 the speaker positioning that 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.880
 often covered by your finger 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.460
 during games what ends up getting 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.990
 the position of the headphone jack 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:52.300
 It can also be a problem at this time. 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:54.310
