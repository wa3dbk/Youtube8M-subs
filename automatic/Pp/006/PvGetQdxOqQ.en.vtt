00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
which is I'm going to make a little bit

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.860 
which is I'm going to make a little bit
more<00:01:02.070> complicated<00:01:02.370> with<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:02.940> aftermarket

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
more complicated with that aftermarket

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.200 
more complicated with that aftermarket
industry<00:01:04.229> but<00:01:04.409> typically<00:01:05.159> twin<00:01:05.700> outlets<00:01:06.060> on

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
industry but typically twin outlets on

industry but typically twin outlets on
the<00:01:06.299> back<00:01:06.479> very<00:01:06.750> similar<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.380> STI<00:01:07.710> that's

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
the back very similar to the STI that's

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.530 
the back very similar to the STI that's
coming<00:01:08.340> out<00:01:08.510> the<00:01:09.510> single<00:01:10.110> piece<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:12.210> front

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
coming out the single piece of the front

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.420 
coming out the single piece of the front
with<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> resonator<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.560> middle<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
with a resonator in the middle the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.130 
with a resonator in the middle the
flexible<00:01:14.909> joint<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.360> actually<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> lot<00:01:15.869> further

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
flexible joint is actually a lot further

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.810 
flexible joint is actually a lot further
back<00:01:16.500> now<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:16.860> part<00:01:17.100> here<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.400> very<00:01:17.610> very

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
back now this part here is very very

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.340 
back now this part here is very very
important<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> lot<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.360> aftermarket<00:01:18.750> exhaust

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
important a lot of aftermarket exhaust

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.260 
important a lot of aftermarket exhaust
systems<00:01:19.740> leave<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.460> part<00:01:20.759> out<00:01:20.880> but<00:01:21.090> if<00:01:21.180> I

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
systems leave this part out but if I

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.480 
systems leave this part out but if I
move<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.630> far<00:01:21.990> enough<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.979> can<00:01:23.130> see<00:01:23.310> that's

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
move that far enough you can see that's

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.859 
move that far enough you can see that's
actually<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.820> ball<00:01:24.060> joint<00:01:24.299> with<00:01:24.540> spring-loaded

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
actually a ball joint with spring-loaded

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.539 
actually a ball joint with spring-loaded
Springs<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.530> keep<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.860> tight<00:01:26.040> together<00:01:26.369> it's

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
Springs to keep it tight together it's

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.789 
Springs to keep it tight together it's
very<00:01:26.759> very<00:01:26.970> important<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.509> insulate<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.439> back

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
very very important to insulate the back

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.499 
very very important to insulate the back
of<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.220> exhaust<00:01:29.520> system<00:01:29.880> which<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.180> hanging

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
of the exhaust system which is hanging

into the secondary cap because this is

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.359 
into the secondary cap because this is
that<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.479> back<00:01:54.630> remember<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.350> then<00:01:56.040> what<00:01:56.280> is

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
that the back remember and then what is

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.550 
that the back remember and then what is
different<00:01:56.729> now<00:01:56.880> goes<00:01:57.119> around<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.810> side<00:01:58.110> and

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
different now goes around the side and

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.410 
different now goes around the side and
into<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.520> turbo<00:01:59.909> now<00:02:00.090> you've<00:02:00.210> got<00:02:00.329> to

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
into the turbo now you've got to

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.100 
into the turbo now you've got to
remember<00:02:00.750> on<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.770> previous<00:02:02.250> ej20<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.360> ej<00:02:03.630> 25

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
remember on the previous ej20 and ej 25

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.230 
remember on the previous ej20 and ej 25
as<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.350> whole<00:02:04.560> turbo<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.520> manifold<00:02:05.969> were<00:02:06.119> all

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
as a whole turbo and manifold were all

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.059 
as a whole turbo and manifold were all
up<00:02:06.420> here<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:06.990> exhaust<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.680> go<00:02:07.799> around

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
up here and this exhaust is to go around

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.540 
up here and this exhaust is to go around
the<00:02:08.190> side<00:02:08.399> here<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:08.729> just<00:02:08.879> get<00:02:08.970> my<00:02:09.090> camera

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
the side here and I just get my camera

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.550 
the side here and I just get my camera
you'll<00:02:09.700> see<00:02:09.880> there's<00:02:10.450> almost<00:02:10.600> this<00:02:10.900> huge<00:02:11.230> hole

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
you'll see there's almost this huge hole

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.800 
you'll see there's almost this huge hole
here<00:02:11.860> left<00:02:12.100> now<00:02:12.250> where<00:02:12.520> there's<00:02:13.000> no<00:02:13.150> turbo<00:02:13.630> up

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
here left now where there's no turbo up

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.750 
here left now where there's no turbo up
here<00:02:14.020> anymore

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
here anymore

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.720 
here anymore
but<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:16.630> turbo<00:02:17.020> is<00:02:17.200> now<00:02:17.380> this<00:02:18.010> assembly<00:02:18.490> here

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
but the turbo is now this assembly here

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.590 
but the turbo is now this assembly here
which<00:02:19.030> is<00:02:19.240> normally<00:02:19.750> covered<00:02:20.020> by<00:02:21.600> aluminium

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
which is normally covered by aluminium

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.470 
which is normally covered by aluminium
under<00:02:23.590> tray<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:24.490> the<00:02:25.410> plastic<00:02:26.410> lower<00:02:27.480> cover

under tray and the plastic lower cover

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.870 
under tray and the plastic lower cover
obviously<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.500> under<00:02:29.860> trays<00:02:30.100> to<00:02:30.310> protect<00:02:30.760> it

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
obviously the under trays to protect it

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.630 
obviously the under trays to protect it
from<00:02:31.000> damage<00:02:31.240> now<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:32.470> turbo<00:02:32.890> is<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.340> lowest

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
from damage now the turbo is the lowest

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.220 
from damage now the turbo is the lowest
part<00:02:33.850> in<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.090> engine<00:02:34.360> this<00:02:34.540> is<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.930> sump

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
part in the engine this is the sump

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.530 
part in the engine this is the sump
which<00:02:35.530> has<00:02:35.770> got<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.190> vacuum<00:02:36.730> fittings<00:02:37.300> to

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
which has got the vacuum fittings to

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.570 
which has got the vacuum fittings to
pull<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.110> drained<00:02:38.500> oil<00:02:38.770> out<00:02:38.980> of<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.160> turbo

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
pull the drained oil out of the turbo

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.300 
pull the drained oil out of the turbo
back<00:02:39.790> up<00:02:39.970> into<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.300> engine<00:02:40.980> have<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.040> look<00:02:42.220> at

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
back up into the engine have a look at

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.560 
back up into the engine have a look at
the<00:02:42.400> still<00:02:42.700> photos<00:02:43.090> because<00:02:43.270> you'll<00:02:43.420> notice

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
the still photos because you'll notice

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.630 
the still photos because you'll notice
the<00:02:43.810> turbo<00:02:44.170> outlet<00:02:44.200> on<00:02:44.680> this<00:02:44.830> car<00:02:45.070> no<00:02:45.280> longer

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
the turbo outlet on this car no longer

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.980 
the turbo outlet on this car no longer
has<00:02:45.880> a<00:02:46.440> separate<00:02:47.440> waste<00:02:47.740> gate<00:02:48.070> and<00:02:48.990> exhaust

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
has a separate waste gate and exhaust

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.650 
has a separate waste gate and exhaust
housing<00:02:50.550> outlet<00:02:51.550> they<00:02:51.730> actually<00:02:52.060> merge<00:02:52.330> into

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
housing outlet they actually merge into

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.990 
housing outlet they actually merge into
one<00:02:52.810> area<00:02:53.350> with<00:02:53.530> one<00:02:53.740> single<00:02:54.010> outlet<00:02:54.520> it's<00:02:54.940> a

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
one area with one single outlet it's a

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.390 
one area with one single outlet it's a
very<00:02:55.300> very<00:02:55.510> big<00:02:55.720> flange<00:02:56.080> we<00:02:56.620> are<00:02:56.770> designing<00:02:57.160> a

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
very very big flange we are designing a

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.100 
very very big flange we are designing a
very<00:02:57.580> complicated<00:02:58.000> splitter<00:02:58.600> to<00:02:58.750> keep<00:02:58.930> them

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
very complicated splitter to keep them

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.960 
very complicated splitter to keep them
separate<00:02:59.500> but<00:03:00.070> you'll<00:03:00.250> see<00:03:00.430> in<00:03:00.550> that<00:03:00.580> photo

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
separate but you'll see in that photo

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.870 
separate but you'll see in that photo
how<00:03:01.270> they<00:03:01.480> are<00:03:01.660> different<00:03:01.900> but<00:03:02.890> this<00:03:03.280> turbo<00:03:03.730> is

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
how they are different but this turbo is

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.510 
how they are different but this turbo is
part<00:03:04.240> of<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:05.080> exhaust<00:03:05.440> manifold<00:03:05.980> which<00:03:06.340> is

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
part of the exhaust manifold which is

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.070 
part of the exhaust manifold which is
obviously<00:03:07.000> at<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.210> bottom<00:03:07.450> of<00:03:07.570> the<00:03:07.660> engineer

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
obviously at the bottom of the engineer

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.110 
obviously at the bottom of the engineer
but<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.770> interesting<00:03:09.190> part<00:03:09.430> again<00:03:09.910> like

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
but the interesting part again like

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.870 
but the interesting part again like

the thing that we've got to take into

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.780 
the thing that we've got to take into
account<00:03:54.260> is<00:03:54.769> if<00:03:54.890> you<00:03:54.980> put<00:03:55.129> a<00:03:55.159> bigger<00:03:55.370> exhaust

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
account is if you put a bigger exhaust

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.960 
account is if you put a bigger exhaust
on<00:03:56.150> a<00:03:56.569> standard<00:03:57.260> tuned<00:03:57.500> car<00:03:57.830> does<00:03:58.580> it<00:03:58.730> put<00:03:58.879> it

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
on a standard tuned car does it put it

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.330 
on a standard tuned car does it put it
in<00:03:59.060> in<00:03:59.209> an<00:03:59.299> area<00:03:59.599> where<00:03:59.840> it<00:04:00.170> will<00:04:00.409> risk<00:04:01.040> over

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
in in an area where it will risk over

a dramatic effect on fuel consumption
will<00:04:06.200> it<00:04:06.349> give<00:04:07.220> you<00:04:07.340> the<00:04:07.459> power<00:04:07.700> that<00:04:07.879> you

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
will it give you the power that you

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.610 
will it give you the power that you
expect<00:04:08.390> some<00:04:08.569> of<00:04:08.659> these<00:04:08.750> newer<00:04:09.019> technology

market<00:04:22.790> exhaust<00:04:23.090> this<00:04:23.240> so<00:04:23.360> on<00:04:23.479> that<00:04:23.630> doesn't

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
market exhaust this so on that doesn't

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.750 
market exhaust this so on that doesn't
make<00:04:24.380> any<00:04:24.620> difference<00:04:24.770> because<00:04:25.130> the<00:04:25.610> back

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
make any difference because the back

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.330 
make any difference because the back
pressure<00:04:26.139> is<00:04:27.139> not<00:04:27.530> that<00:04:27.770> much<00:04:28.039> of<00:04:28.100> a

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340

earlier so these are the things that

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.860 
earlier so these are the things that
we've<00:04:31.910> got<00:04:32.000> to<00:04:32.090> test<00:04:32.270> on<00:04:32.389> this<00:04:32.510> car<00:04:32.750> because

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
we've got to test on this car because

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.689 
we've got to test on this car because
