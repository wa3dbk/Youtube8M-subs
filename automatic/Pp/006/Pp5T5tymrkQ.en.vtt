00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.750
 be a zombie again this year 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.540
 make-up for that I put my hair under 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.900
 the bridge current disappear and pull 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:25.480
 me a bald on of the smooth 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.010
 I fix myself with mastic that's me 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.080
 in this one has with the finger that goes 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.180
 just faster and stick it 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.070
 as carefully as possible 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.720
 I 'll do it for the camera in front 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.239
 usually that did of course 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.030
 other around and cut me 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.460
 whole in contour somewhere else in there 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.920
 I do not need my purposes 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.900
 Anyway, I'll leave eyebrows with me 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.760
 mastix stories again briefly about it 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.750
 Go Fast Pictures and One 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.900
 Glaze very close to brushes 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.299
 and then bald and face with the 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.019
 macondo I have the color 50 each 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:04.470
 everything is well primed one thing 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:07.120
 have good base to work 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.470
 the transitions I can not so 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.790
 nice there again with left 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:15.880
 gone over it 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:17.200
 sachs does that best 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.090
 we introduce you did not like 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.790
 Just give it over with the 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.630
 the macula and then thoroughly 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.220
 fix 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.920
 then I just take last normal 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.680
 transparent brother and eyebrows 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.510
 I wanted to build up a bit or 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.970
 eyebrow pulse then takes 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.620
 Glue for a halloween party is 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.630
 probably it does better but for 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:42.100
 the camera is reached and before me 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.370
 plastic so small sausages I then 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.260
 bring on and with the asparagus something 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.120
 Connect with the skin and then again 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.210
 best communicate with the singer 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.820
 so I then often go mostly the 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.600
 theme culture bak cream the really nice 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.630
 press 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.220
 I do the same and I have 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.450
 let me be inspired by this 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.680
 jazz that's really funny and 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.690
 became such a small treatise 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.300
 again with in the boat over the whole 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.020
 wanted must provide to the one who before 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.600
 glue sausages from plastic form and 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:23.210
 press with the asparagus and then the 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:26.340
 finger everything smooth again 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:29.190
 I am now working on the well-being 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.930
 This is a product of 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.080
 green loading which I love very much the same 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.730
 like the blood money and the effect bugs all 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.650
 These are the three products I have 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.600
 absolutely recommend for the halloween 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.980
 Mecca one can already see the 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.620
 well come again for 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.720
 clearly out and on the edge it will 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.570
 all a bit bashful and fingering 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.210
 blinds super realistic and big 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.430
 light without much to do 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.760
 to make it all the more bloody the 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.630
 I go over here again with the blood 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:03.720
 that will get a fresher as well 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.920
 just quite disgusting note I as yes 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.310
 so much 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.180
 Of course you should not miss if you 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.120
 so blood smeared always 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.090
 distribute generously and what bothered the 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.760
 medicine blended I thought then 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.600
 even a few bumps are really funny 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.250
 namely that effect max 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.620
 presses in the same form as with 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.060
 rich plastic on the stop is 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.100
 a bit sticky so there you need 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.920
 then really cream or make-up 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.830
 It does not have to be so fat sticking 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.450
 everywhere asparagus careful 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.000
 press on and with the finger and 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:43.410
 mediator then the transitions nice 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.970
 work clean if you have a technique 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.890
 I am particularly interested in it 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.810
 like to know the comments then do it 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.410
 I again a separate turn 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.830
 step by step show how exactly this is possible 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.380
 but a little bit 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.700
 further you to be doing the 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.560
 blackheads are now once again 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.890
 bit joked with black 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.860
 eyeshadow from my sz a palette 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.990
 from sleep I want the easy 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.950
 black is still a bit 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:14.830
 purple and blue and draw me 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.080
 eye rings and the poor and I bead 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.430
 have at the beginning rather placed with 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.780
 also a bit contoured 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:25.230
 to make it look evil and smoky 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.970
 those with it will now be with blood 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.240
 provides plenty of links from there 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.010
 to give objective 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.380
 I completely use the remnants of 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:38.610
 puzzle around her specific face face 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:41.200
 to make plastic again 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.490
 and everywhere I blew my blood 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.250
 of course I go with my driver 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.660
 beloved blood go over it again 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.230
 and bite is enough especially for the 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.280
 border and dabbed it so completely 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.620
 Careful as we do that one quite 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.080
 soft transition gets and the face 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.870
 me in a plane white and pale 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.390
 then acts as a very special deep 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.240
 gets and a very special structure 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:07.000
 also likes to show the blood kiel 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.830
 always just not me the transitions 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.440
 liked or where you see it sooner 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:16.000
 the effect of the marx or the soft 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:18.130
 plastic to knowledge, I thought as I 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.780
 nor that my cards are supplied with blood 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.530
 that's why I want to have a few 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:26.080
 blood vessels drawn first with blue 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.320
 for that I used it super cool 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:33.550
 is a normal feather and makeup 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.270
 in the second step then take red for it 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:40.040
 I then the blood applies to the 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.450
 have worked in the whole time 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.640
 next step I have 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:47.060
 I can use contact lenses 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.620
 but best without kawara in red for it 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.290
 you look very nice again that me 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:55.490
 a bit more with the player 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:58.220
 rush a few training and also the 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:02.840
 nostrils a bit bigger and so on 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:05.240
 small bit defiantly out of the nose with 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.650
 was bleeding I give to make up as the 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.830
 Last finish in which I also one 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.790
 a bit under the eyes directly on and 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.520
 can tap 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:15.530
 bloody line draws to like 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.980
 rarely white teeth have of course still 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.090
 tame black bread below 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:22.640
 now really only the effective missing 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:25.780
 I'm still having fun with the make-up 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.780
 all products
