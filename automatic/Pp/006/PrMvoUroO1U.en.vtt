00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.590
 the kidney cells already sanitized we started 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.930

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.800

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:56.030
 economic and it's a way one 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.030

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.530

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.380

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:35.380
 actors pressing 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.430

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.560
 and that he did as when he passes the cap to 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.569
 will if you want to put it wrong or 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.790
 directly you do not put anything you can 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.190
 leave alone with the green or it would be good 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.959
 lower the fire a little here and that already 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.840
 It's like finished because with the same 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.840
 heat fix the cream to the werder or 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.390
 blessed cubes milestones as they should be eaten 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.239
 are not big at all but neither 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.760
 those recognized toner carts we have it 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.670
 there if at 18 minutes approximately 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.950
 He has put the pan in the oven 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.410
 with rice you did not have to do 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.830
 absolutely nothing but cover it 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.319
 It can be covered with a lid that does not 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.080
 have wood and in this case with a little 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.489
 of the paper this one download and 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.080
 then unlike pilaf rice 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.510
 so let's face it if you 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.910
 they seem like guards that everything has just come out 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.480
 from the oven 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.460
 the characteristic is saved 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.850
 the characteristic of society 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:09.150

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.300
 the juice of the kidneys so I put on 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.980
 there as a kind of shirt 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.920
 and now we go with the kidneys with the 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.670
 sauce with green or 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.670
