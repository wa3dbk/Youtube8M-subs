your guitar so if you want to check out
extra<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.330> storage<00:02:38.660> inside<00:02:39.020> of<00:02:39.200> it

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.340 

that's<00:03:15.180> just<00:03:15.420> one<00:03:15.690> of<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.870> tongues<00:03:16.110> that<00:03:16.200> we

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
that's just one of the tongues that we

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.020 
that's just one of the tongues that we
can<00:03:16.530> get<00:03:16.680> from<00:03:16.740> the<00:03:16.890> Hat<00:03:17.070> if<00:03:17.460> we<00:03:17.670> go<00:03:17.790> over<00:03:18.000> here

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
can get from the Hat if we go over here

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.720 
can get from the Hat if we go over here
to<00:03:18.270> the<00:03:18.600> infinite<00:03:19.290> cheek<00:03:19.560> feature<00:03:19.860> I<00:03:20.220> move<00:03:20.610> it

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
to the infinite cheek feature I move it

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.970 
to the infinite cheek feature I move it
more<00:03:20.880> to<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.090> right<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:21.870> we<00:03:22.410> discover<00:03:22.890> a

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
more to the right and we discover a

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.960 
more to the right and we discover a
totally<00:03:23.550> different<00:03:24.120> tone<00:03:25.610> and<00:03:26.610> turn<00:03:26.790> it<00:03:26.910> up

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
totally different tone and turn it up

00:03:26.970 --> 00:04:10.140 
totally different tone and turn it up
just<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.270> little<00:03:27.300> bit<00:03:27.690> here

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.880 

very<00:04:11.150> throaty<00:04:11.630> we've<00:04:11.870> got<00:04:12.020> a<00:04:12.050> lot<00:04:12.320> of<00:04:12.470> gain<00:04:12.680> a

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
very throaty we've got a lot of gain a

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.440 
very throaty we've got a lot of gain a
lot<00:04:13.160> of<00:04:13.190> distortion<00:04:13.610> just<00:04:14.030> like<00:04:14.150> I<00:04:14.240> said

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
lot of distortion just like I said

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.420 
lot of distortion just like I said
before<00:04:14.810> but<00:04:15.380> yet<00:04:15.560> it<00:04:15.650> still<00:04:15.830> retains<00:04:16.250> its

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
before but yet it still retains its

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.560 
before but yet it still retains its
clarity<00:04:16.730> and<00:04:16.940> I<00:04:17.030> think<00:04:17.270> those<00:04:17.420> are<00:04:17.540> the

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
clarity and I think those are the

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.930 
clarity and I think those are the
strongest<00:04:17.989> points<00:04:18.350> of<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:18.590> HD<00:04:18.950> 100<00:04:19.489> in

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
strongest points of the HD 100 in

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.460 
strongest points of the HD 100 in
addition<00:04:20.360> to<00:04:20.420> that<00:04:20.540> you<00:04:20.750> can<00:04:20.780> get<00:04:21.020> this<00:04:21.170> tone

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
addition to that you can get this tone

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.890 
addition to that you can get this tone
at<00:04:21.709> bedroom<00:04:22.160> level<00:04:22.370> volumes<00:04:22.970> using<00:04:23.390> the

at bedroom level volumes using the

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.890
