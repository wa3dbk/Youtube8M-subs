00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.619 

curves<00:00:01.050> are<00:00:01.230> very<00:00:02.129> useful<00:00:02.669> object<00:00:03.240> type<00:00:03.449> in

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
curves are very useful object type in

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.960 
curves are very useful object type in
blender<00:00:03.990> for<00:00:04.319> modeling<00:00:05.040> things<00:00:05.339> like<00:00:05.609> wires

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
blender for modeling things like wires

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.450 
blender for modeling things like wires
and<00:00:06.390> pipes<00:00:06.750> we<00:00:07.649> use<00:00:07.859> them<00:00:08.010> quite<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.220> lot<00:00:08.429> in

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
and pipes we use them quite a lot in

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.830 
and pipes we use them quite a lot in
elfin<00:00:08.940> stream<00:00:09.300> so<00:00:10.200> let's<00:00:10.950> just<00:00:11.190> go<00:00:11.719> click<00:00:12.719> the

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
elfin stream so let's just go click the

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.350 
elfin stream so let's just go click the
space<00:00:13.080> bar<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.559> add<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.250> curve<00:00:14.700> my<00:00:15.030> favorite

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
space bar and add a curve my favorite

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.370 
space bar and add a curve my favorite
one<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.809> Bezier<00:00:16.199> curve<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:18.020> as<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.170> can

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
one is the Bezier curve and as you can

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.830 
one is the Bezier curve and as you can
see<00:00:19.410> now<00:00:19.890> we<00:00:19.949> can<00:00:20.369> just<00:00:20.550> keep<00:00:21.150> on<00:00:21.330> adding

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
see now we can just keep on adding

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.140 
see now we can just keep on adding
points<00:00:22.350> by<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.800> by<00:00:23.490> control<00:00:23.910> clicking

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
points by a by control clicking

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.670 
points by a by control clicking
somewhere<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.490> we<00:00:26.490> can<00:00:26.640> move<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.939> handles<00:00:27.390> to

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
somewhere and we can move the handles to

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.269 
somewhere and we can move the handles to
control<00:00:28.680> our<00:00:28.830> curve<00:00:29.660> but<00:00:31.040> really<00:00:32.040> want<00:00:32.189> to

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
control our curve but really want to

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.680 
control our curve but really want to
have<00:00:32.430> more<00:00:32.940> control<00:00:33.149> over<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.469> there<00:00:35.399> are

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
have more control over it so there are

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.030 
have more control over it so there are
variety<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.719> options<00:00:37.110> for<00:00:37.559> control<00:00:38.460> points

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
variety of options for control points

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.729 
variety of options for control points
that<00:00:41.040> can<00:00:41.160> be<00:00:41.219> accessed<00:00:41.489> here<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.739> for

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
that can be accessed here and for

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.639 
that can be accessed here and for
example<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:44.160> can<00:00:44.489> switch<00:00:45.180> control<00:00:46.050> point<00:00:46.350> to

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
example you can switch control point to

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.700 
example you can switch control point to
vector<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.780> will<00:00:48.780> make<00:00:48.930> him<00:00:49.079> look<00:00:49.230> like<00:00:49.410> that

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
vector I will make him look like that

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.700 
vector I will make him look like that
it's<00:00:50.670> just<00:00:50.760> select<00:00:51.270> everything<00:00:51.570> for<00:00:51.989> now<00:00:52.140> and

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.950 

my<00:00:55.710> favorite<00:00:56.100> option<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.780> actually<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
my favorite option is actually the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.819 
my favorite option is actually the
automatic<00:00:58.920> handle<00:00:59.309> interpolation<00:01:00.829> because

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
automatic handle interpolation because

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.830 
automatic handle interpolation because
now<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.550> handles<00:01:02.940> are<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:03.300> adjusted

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
now the handles are just adjusted

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.350 
now the handles are just adjusted
wherever<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.379> curve<00:01:04.589> points<00:01:05.129> are<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:06.090> now<00:01:06.299> we

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
wherever the curve points are and now we

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.230 
wherever the curve points are and now we
can<00:01:06.570> just<00:01:06.600> add<00:01:06.930> points<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.939> we<00:01:08.939> don't<00:01:09.060> really

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
can just add points and we don't really

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.670 
can just add points and we don't really
have<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.630> care<00:01:09.869> about<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.229> handles<00:01:10.560> at<00:01:10.710> all

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.920 

this<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.830> also<00:01:17.009> extremely<00:01:17.430> useful<00:01:17.930> for

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
this is also extremely useful for

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.450 
this is also extremely useful for
example<00:01:19.229> if<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.380> go<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.740> edit<00:01:20.130> buttons

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
example if you go to the edit buttons

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.350 
example if you go to the edit buttons
and<00:01:22.070> you<00:01:23.070> can<00:01:23.220> see<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.580> little<00:01:23.790> option<00:01:24.210> down

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
and you can see this little option down

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.399 
and you can see this little option down
here<00:01:24.979> says<00:01:25.979> draw<00:01:26.729> handles<00:01:27.180> we<00:01:27.659> can<00:01:27.840> disable

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
here says draw handles we can disable

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.859 
here says draw handles we can disable
that<00:01:28.740> now<00:01:29.520> we<00:01:29.579> don't<00:01:29.759> see<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.360> hand<00:01:30.570> the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
that now we don't see the hand the

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.410 
that now we don't see the hand the
handles<00:01:31.259> anymore<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:31.939> it's<00:01:32.939> also<00:01:33.119> quite

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
handles anymore so it's also quite

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:43.870 
handles anymore so it's also quite
useful

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.300 

now<00:01:44.880> by<00:01:45.329> itself<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.840> curves<00:01:46.130> don't<00:01:47.130> get

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
now by itself the curves don't get

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.039 
now by itself the curves don't get
vendor<00:01:47.670> at<00:01:47.759> all<00:01:48.259> so<00:01:50.299> to<00:01:51.299> do<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.450> we<00:01:51.899> have<00:01:52.020> to

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
vendor at all so to do that we have to

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.679 
vendor at all so to do that we have to
give<00:01:52.289> them<00:01:52.380> some<00:01:52.679> thickness<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:54.179> easiest

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
give them some thickness and the easiest

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.840 
give them some thickness and the easiest
way<00:01:54.929> to<00:01:54.990> do<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.469> just<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:56.460> give<00:01:56.610> them<00:01:56.820> a

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
way to do that is just to give them a

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.450 
way to do that is just to give them a
bevel<00:01:57.509> object<00:01:57.960> bevel<00:01:58.740> object<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.220> just

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
bevel object bevel object is just

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.630 
bevel object bevel object is just
another<00:01:59.700> curve<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.899> let's<00:02:01.289> just<00:02:01.530> add<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.710> busier

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
another curve so let's just add a busier

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:16.509 
another curve so let's just add a busier
circle<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:06.259> we<00:02:07.259> call<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:08.099> circle<00:02:10.009> bevel

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.860 

let's<00:02:17.519> just<00:02:17.610> scale<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.060> down<00:02:18.209> a<00:02:18.450> little<00:02:18.660> bit

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
let's just scale it down a little bit

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.259 
let's just scale it down a little bit
and<00:02:21.590> now<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.739> only<00:02:22.980> thing<00:02:23.099> you<00:02:23.640> have<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.819> do<00:02:24.030> is

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
and now the only thing you have to do is

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.600 
and now the only thing you have to do is
just<00:02:24.930> insert<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.470> name<00:02:25.739> here<00:02:26.040> down<00:02:26.310> in<00:02:26.519> the

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
just insert that name here down in the

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.370 
just insert that name here down in the
bevel<00:02:27.480> options<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.590> be<00:02:29.250> e<00:02:29.280> tap<00:02:30.030> tap<00:02:30.900> completion

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
bevel options so be e tap tap completion

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.520 
bevel options so be e tap tap completion
is<00:02:31.500> pretty<00:02:31.680> useful<00:02:31.829> enter<00:02:33.049> now<00:02:34.049> you<00:02:34.110> can<00:02:34.319> see

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
is pretty useful enter now you can see

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.009 
is pretty useful enter now you can see
the<00:02:34.709> curve<00:02:34.950> has<00:02:35.940> some<00:02:36.239> thickness<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.840> and

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
the curve has some thickness to it and

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.630 
the curve has some thickness to it and
we<00:02:37.950> can<00:02:38.069> even<00:02:38.160> see<00:02:38.459> that<00:02:38.579> in<00:02:38.760> edit<00:02:39.030> mode<00:02:40.430> so<00:02:41.430> now

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
we can even see that in edit mode so now

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.059 
we can even see that in edit mode so now
as<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:41.910> can<00:02:42.060> see<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.450> curves<00:02:42.750> only<00:02:43.019> on<00:02:43.560> that

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
as you can see the curves only on that

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.370 
as you can see the curves only on that
an<00:02:44.610> hour<00:02:44.819> flat<00:02:45.560> Judy<00:02:46.560> plane<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:48.109> to<00:02:49.109> make<00:02:49.260> it

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
an hour flat Judy plane and to make it

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.960 
an hour flat Judy plane and to make it
actually<00:02:49.560> move<00:02:49.889> in<00:02:50.010> 3d<00:02:50.400> we<00:02:50.519> just<00:02:50.730> have<00:02:50.850> to

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
actually move in 3d we just have to

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.960 
actually move in 3d we just have to
press<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.359> 3d<00:02:51.630> button<00:02:51.870> here<00:02:52.519> now<00:02:53.519> we<00:02:53.579> can<00:02:53.819> move

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
press the 3d button here now we can move

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:23.160 
press the 3d button here now we can move
everything<00:02:54.269> around

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.530 

now<00:03:24.170> there's<00:03:24.620> also<00:03:24.860> something<00:03:25.160> you<00:03:25.580> can<00:03:26.000> do<00:03:26.180> to

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
now there's also something you can do to

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.540 
now there's also something you can do to
control<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:27.290> thickness<00:03:27.590> of<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.040> curve<00:03:28.250> a<00:03:28.400> bit

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
control the thickness of the curve a bit

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.320 
control the thickness of the curve a bit
better<00:03:28.730> which<00:03:29.450> is<00:03:29.680> found<00:03:30.680> under<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.490> bevel

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
better which is found under the bevel

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.710 
better which is found under the bevel
options<00:03:32.750> it's<00:03:33.110> a<00:03:33.320> taper<00:03:33.890> object<00:03:34.340> and<00:03:34.720> again

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
options it's a taper object and again

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.810 
options it's a taper object and again
taper<00:03:36.080> object<00:03:36.500> is<00:03:36.620> just<00:03:36.860> another<00:03:37.100> curve<00:03:37.340> so

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
taper object is just another curve so

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.140 
taper object is just another curve so
let's<00:03:38.690> say<00:03:38.960> we<00:03:39.260> insert<00:03:40.130> another<00:03:40.340> bzo<00:03:40.880> curve

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
let's say we insert another bzo curve

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:48.660 
let's say we insert another bzo curve
here<00:03:41.600> and<00:03:42.970> we<00:03:43.970> call<00:03:44.210> this<00:03:44.450> one<00:03:44.780> taper<00:03:45.170> I

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.520 

actually<00:03:49.670> misspelled<00:03:50.240> that<00:03:50.330> haha<00:03:51.110> sorry<00:03:53.530> keep

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
actually misspelled that haha sorry keep

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.740 
actually misspelled that haha sorry keep
doing<00:03:54.830> that<00:03:54.920> quite<00:03:55.220> a<00:03:55.280> lot<00:03:55.370> especially<00:03:56.270> when

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
doing that quite a lot especially when

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.680 
doing that quite a lot especially when
the<00:03:56.870> screen<00:03:57.230> is<00:03:57.260> so<00:03:57.560> far<00:03:57.830> away<00:03:57.980> as<00:03:58.370> it<00:03:59.360> is<00:03:59.480> right

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
the screen is so far away as it is right

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.490 
the screen is so far away as it is right
now<00:03:59.750> okay<00:04:00.620> taper<00:04:00.920> and<00:04:01.660> we<00:04:02.660> just<00:04:02.900> insert<00:04:03.320> that

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
now okay taper and we just insert that

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.490 
now okay taper and we just insert that
name<00:04:03.680> here<00:04:03.950> again<00:04:04.450> t8<00:04:05.450> tap<00:04:07.600> now<00:04:08.600> this<00:04:09.020> Grove

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
name here again t8 tap now this Grove

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.730 
name here again t8 tap now this Grove
here<00:04:10.040> let's<00:04:10.640> just<00:04:10.990> enable<00:04:11.990> the<00:04:12.110> curve<00:04:12.320> points

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
here let's just enable the curve points

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.330 
here let's just enable the curve points
again<00:04:13.780> now<00:04:14.780> this<00:04:14.959> curve<00:04:15.290> here<00:04:15.590> just<00:04:15.890> controls

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
again now this curve here just controls

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.310 
again now this curve here just controls
the<00:04:16.519> thickness<00:04:16.880> of<00:04:17.000> that<00:04:17.180> curve<00:04:17.450> so<00:04:18.140> that's

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
the thickness of that curve so that's

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.400 
the thickness of that curve so that's
also<00:04:18.680> really<00:04:18.859> useful<00:04:19.600> especially<00:04:20.600> if<00:04:21.200> you

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
also really useful especially if you

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:41.570 
also really useful especially if you
want<00:04:22.040> to<00:04:22.190> model<00:04:22.490> organic<00:04:23.270> things<00:04:23.600> like<00:04:24.230> plants

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.460 

the<00:04:42.120> resolution<00:04:42.599> of<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:42.990> curve<00:04:43.259> is

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
the resolution of the curve is

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.230 
the resolution of the curve is
determined<00:04:43.949> by<00:04:44.099> this<00:04:44.340> setting<00:04:44.639> here<00:04:44.970> it's

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
determined by this setting here it's

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.899 
determined by this setting here it's
called<00:04:45.449> the<00:04:45.659> default<00:04:46.139> resolution<00:04:46.349> and<00:04:46.979> it's

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:47.909 
called the default resolution and it's

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:51.110 
called the default resolution and it's
just<00:04:48.689> a<00:04:48.810> default<00:04:49.139> resolution<00:04:49.500> for<00:04:50.009> a<00:04:50.039> 3<00:04:50.280> 3d

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
just a default resolution for a 3 3d

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.659 
just a default resolution for a 3 3d
viewport<00:04:51.719> but<00:04:52.020> also<00:04:52.169> for<00:04:52.830> rendering<00:04:53.159> if<00:04:53.400> this

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
viewport but also for rendering if this

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.420 
viewport but also for rendering if this
option<00:04:53.939> is<00:04:54.180> not<00:04:54.240> set<00:04:54.750> so<00:04:55.379> if<00:04:55.710> you<00:04:55.949> want<00:04:56.129> to<00:04:56.250> have

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
option is not set so if you want to have

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.119 
option is not set so if you want to have
a<00:04:56.460> different<00:04:56.729> render<00:04:57.180> resolution<00:04:57.330> then<00:04:58.129> let's

00:04:59.119 --> 00:04:59.129 
a different render resolution then let's

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:02.030 
a different render resolution then let's
say<00:04:59.250> in<00:04:59.310> your<00:04:59.400> three<00:04:59.669> of<00:04:59.849> you
