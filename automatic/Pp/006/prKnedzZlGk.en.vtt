so the idea here is to toast the
couscous<00:00:55.610> so<00:00:55.820> we'll<00:00:55.970> give<00:00:56.090> it<00:00:56.180> about<00:00:56.239> five

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360

stir<00:00:58.460> it<00:00:58.520> around<00:00:58.640> so<00:00:59.180> that<00:00:59.360> each<00:00:59.840> little<00:01:00.230> pearl

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
stir it around so that each little pearl

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.670 
stir it around so that each little pearl
gets<00:01:00.950> a<00:01:01.040> little<00:01:01.309> bit<00:01:01.430> of<00:01:01.520> oil<00:01:02.410> which<00:01:03.410> will<00:01:03.559> help

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
gets a little bit of oil which will help

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.300
