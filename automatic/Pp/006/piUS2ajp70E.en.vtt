 drunk drivers who get rid of 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.860
 punishment thanks to judges who put 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.070

 but three fire crimes 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.050
 importance that this act is 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.930

 I heard you listen to the file 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.930
 definitive 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.850
 I was in the early hours of 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.160
 last Saturday in block 5 of the 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.590

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.250
 that before had reached to take a 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.250
 beer but nothing more 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.340
 the present day 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:45.110
 and before taking the record a 5 cup 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:47.990
 scola and although some accepted so 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:52.180
 less have drunk a couple of glasses other 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.180
 I just lost patience 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.210
 this is extremely uncomfortable 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.140
 I just took away in five minutes 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.870
 I wanna go 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.090
 I have about ten people who are 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:25.270
 recording they do not want to make a 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.270
 marisa period I have no idea it's okay 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.660
 the alcohol 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.150
 modify all the behavior of the 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.070
 person and body that height 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.470
 directly on the nervous system 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:45.070
 central and alters all the senses and 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.070
 alters perception 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.430
 Most cases are drivers 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.860
 reincidentes the case of america 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:58.340

 driving papers in the state of 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:06.870
 drunkenness and simply in total the power 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:10.710
 court was delayed so much that he sent his 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:13.140
 case to oblivion an efficiency a slowness 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:16.680
 of the trial apparatus especially that 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:20.430
 Fucked and we had a closer player 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:23.550
 of 250 causes that these players like 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:25.650
 long before we return fruits to 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.380
 ask ourselves we have to hope that 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:32.390
 there are injured or dead to sanction 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.390
 to these drunken drivers 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:40.410
 according to information from the division of 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.509
 prevention and accident investigation 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:45.330
 of the national police as regards the 

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:47.250
 that goes of the year there have been 358 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.990
 deaths comparing it with the figures of 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.669
 last year in the same period it 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.130
 they recorded three hundred and sixty-three 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:54.840
 deceased on the bore tracks despite 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.870
 the continuous operatives that the police 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.849
 performs operations that are aimed at 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.800
 alcohol intake especially 

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:03.830
 weekends to those over 1 past 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.270
 of glasses take the keys of your vehicle 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:08.300
 turning the streets into land of 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.300
 no one 

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:13.439
 how are these people who in a state of 

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:15.330
 Drunkenness ended up under a trailer 

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:17.519
 at the height of block 36 of the 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.019
 avenue javier meadow this apparently the 

00:07:17.519 --> 00:07:20.999
 fatigue and alcohol intake 

00:07:19.019 --> 00:07:23.729
 they made the driver blink at 

00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:26.579
 being able to end up in a major tragedy 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:29.669
 as the operative sanitoriums 730 

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:31.799
 made of the school while throwing 

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:35.610
 a value considered not the positives in 

00:07:31.799 --> 00:07:39.089
 the matters that we carry in which only 

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:41.069
 4 111 positive but although incredible 

00:07:39.089 --> 00:07:42.449
 it seems that alcohol is not in these 

00:07:41.069 --> 00:07:44.459
 moments the main cause of 

00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:46.919
 accidents according to the list drawn up by 

00:07:44.459 --> 00:07:49.019
 the police is the head of 

00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:51.779
 recklessness of the driver in second 

00:07:49.019 --> 00:07:54.179
 place the speeding followed by 

00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:56.669
 the drunkenness of the fourth pedestrian the 

00:07:54.179 --> 00:07:59.519
 imprudence of the pedestrian and fifth the 

00:07:56.669 --> 00:08:01.409
 drunk the driver however not 

00:07:59.519 --> 00:08:03.300
 you must lower your guard and make 

00:08:01.409 --> 00:08:05.729
 standards are met and taken out of the streets 

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:08.039
 to those responsible for the steering wheel before 

00:08:05.729 --> 00:08:10.339
 that one of them take us out of this 

00:08:08.039 --> 00:08:10.339
 world
