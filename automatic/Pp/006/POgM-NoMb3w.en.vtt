00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
too big but not too small and perhaps

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.240 
too big but not too small and perhaps
that<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.570> little<00:01:03.780> bit<00:01:04.019> different<00:01:04.589> but<00:01:04.769> isn't

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
that is a little bit different but isn't

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.180 
that is a little bit different but isn't
too<00:01:05.309> expensive<00:01:05.990> why<00:01:06.990> not<00:01:07.200> consider<00:01:07.590> an<00:01:07.800> Alfa

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
too expensive why not consider an Alfa

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.850 
too expensive why not consider an Alfa
