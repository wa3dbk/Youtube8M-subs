00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:12.009
 so happen now in Mayschoß framed by the two works if 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.549
 you look around then this is the scene of 2004 was Ali Cologne 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.550
 Ahrweiler in winter temperatures and so you look such a big one 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.760
 Menschenentraube is there you will usually find a double 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.939
 world champion rally and that is the waltz election continues to welcome 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:27.410
 at the Rally Cologne Ahrweiler 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.710
 Duisburg 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.220
 a lot should be running that was the first sentence and rally Cologne Ahrweiler that is 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.220
 so a little bit of program we talk about it then everything is 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.460
 already said twice world rally champion that is quite a few 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.570
 Years ago but he always wanted to go out again 1 MWp is still there 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.300
 again and again he could lay 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.680
 what makes the appeal of this rally out yes they can sometimes it is already 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.010
 quite a few cult naturally so tens of percent 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.330
 really everything in the last years 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.870
 who and Emma and Jan Temme Alain fooled out the 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.050
 somewhere here she also appreciated very interesting 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.360
 the Speedy season makes the rally even more 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.119
 Percent very difficult 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.890
 and fitting to pessimistic I am here 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.490
 on in this sector for me the best thing in Germany lives 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.210
 that of course he likes the organizers of the Rally Cologne 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.950
 Ahrweiler 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.359
 but that was the weather talked about this late season 

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:20.780
 So the track conditions 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.890
 the change will be how can you imagine that 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.930
 you have to expect it 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.010
 Paderborn 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.410
 that is maybe even wet 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.440
 in Burrweiler hot tip it is big problems of course what he is here 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.100
 that is comparable 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.030
 At times, Monte Carlo Brogli's snow was just as dangerous 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.530
 Neubau Contzen each differ so Probst up to buy the suburbs only damp 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.380
 is 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.299
 should have been in the past times in the prophecy there was of course a whole 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.170
 A lot of pressure behind you also felt as a factory driver 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.180
 relatively successful or very successful recently 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.320
 Millennium AG driver of the MGW etc as one can on the homepage beings 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.820
 It used to be driven with a note with a kind of prayer book 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.530
 has read the passenger maybe for the audience something was in there 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.730
 what can you imagine you have to imagine that percent 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.549
 almost who survives 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.499
 Percent important from the 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:15.969
 3000 km was driven there by the federal balanced again special stage 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.279
 where to express 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:18.519
 it shows that of 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.299
 You can not remember this in your head 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:23.319
 and then the Tipper the driver a FOC 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.759
 Assets but witnesses that NATO is talking to the fireplace 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:29.669
 the charm is the short Davis is on the 4th 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:32.959
 and the nocturnal forms he came across in an uncanny teamwork 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.139
 between forms and and and calls 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:37.889
 and most percent the Beatles and the one big help 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:41.090
 that is when this area book is created in the lake or in the 

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:42.839
 Driver dictating to the passenger 

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:47.159
 You can take this exam before Dagmar paradise Verden in one 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.500
 normal pace »Button for not at race pace 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.890
 that means you have to be patient when Banks drive on how fast it is 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.629
 ultimately in the area of ​​flies 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.279
 according to the rules in the traffic it was possible in advance 

00:02:57.279 --> 00:02:59.659
 from the Rally Cologne Ahrweiler hear and read 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:01.569
 that there is no prayer book 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.669
 Yes, the Cologne opera reader is the Titanic laid hands 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:08.319
 Finally, Stevic wanted to do the fourth for the fourth time 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.329
 Tests nevertheless one knows what in the latter the women 

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:14.980
 and our profile i have them north 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.540
 and also banned over before 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.550
 and usually the networks of ours have gotten it's like that, too 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.580
 Hooters steadily increasing 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.249
 90 percent think lightweight has 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:27.880
 that is the experience of the last years but also 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.540
 the distance you have in mind can be a white shutter 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.440
 needs a prayer book he knows exactly where to go, yes in the title 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.060
 Europe itch dozen Didi Thurau can get prescribed at 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.369
 brought with him that he has his formal form any lie 

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:42.369
 and that meant to do things in front of these people 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.939
 What is more interesting for the near-by driver or rally pilot if you do 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:50.479
 has a prayer book and can really try the last tenth of a second 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:52.650
 Still to get out of the material 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.849
 or if you really without interesting interesting who without missing it 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.079
 the suns it's only interesting if i know 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.650
 the audio let pull 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.689
 if I know Wipro changes centralism goes and it is not 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:06.219
 good and interesting then suddenly the desire 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:09.049
 when I'm for pop singer billion 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.739
 the goats the hamburger that I come there as a young lad children 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.250
 he begs me to beat mobile phones in the world now and then 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.190
 happy a little better instructs little in the car over 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.379
 gone and the Audi area cool head 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:24.180
 by Torben Koch theologically 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.680
 a special feature of the Rally Cologne Ahrweiler is indeed a track or a 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.979
 Special stage that you really can not train 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.839
 that is in part on the nürburgring-nordschleife upside down 

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:35.979
 Actually drove against the direction you otherwise get out of bed and scared 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.720
 Percentage knows there is a special charm there for sure - and that is 

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:41.909
 So it's very interesting 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:43.370
 where both hands 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.590
 how I drove so many thousands of customers in the right direction 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.220
 let us imagine well in the opposite direction but still is 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.270
 lead the voice out again 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.389
 The rally is actually a 1a of the organizer, however, is today 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:59.210
 Evening in the run-up before tomorrow morning starts on Saturday 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.100
 driven a special stage it is already dark there are the headlights 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.160
 Asked for now again while just talked about the charm with whether 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.389
 or without prayer 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.210
 What's better for the racing driver Walter Röhrl in the dark? 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.900
 drive 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.599
 just to see everything lit up, or rather say a moment over 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:17.059
 Isensee province e-mail to come today 

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:20.219
 then dark of Garnier blew so funny because it brought her nothing more 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.539
 so Xie has to worry 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.189
 I've often thought about it lately, but I can wait until the World Cup 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:30.509
 drive the full rent during the day 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:34.110
 So he knows that there there are only this project for the thumb this evening 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.740
 Eyes open is yes only at a risk to the crown say first 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.509
 Thanks once Arno Balzer because we both can but the 2004 in May 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:40.699
 lap
