00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 at anja for this tablet blog.de in 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.660
 this video we want that sony xperia 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.560
 z3 that we have here right now 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.830
 was presented 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.509
 compare with the sony xperia z2 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.759
 that at the mobile world congress 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.540
 So I can show it 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.550
 long ago 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.490
 Half a year, for example, a bit cheaper 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.100
 as in this video, we want to 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.660
 compare the two devices 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.400
 but there are too big differences 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.289
 I can not tell you that in advance 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.130
 I would say that he is bold 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.110
 small upgrade behrens 2 on none 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.660
 case to access z3 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.250
 They both have 52 inches here 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.620
 big display legs a full hd 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.460
 resolution and both have a snapdragon 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.440
 801 processor from qualcomm in her 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.850
 housing in it 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.000
 However, this year has a clock frequency 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.780
 of 2 5 gigahertz is currently pushing and that 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.969
 z2 of 2.3 ghz if you 're there on the real 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.590
 use really big differences 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.870
 both performance Pechstein 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.070
 I strongly doubt both 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.159
 By the way, there are three gigabytes 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.350
 Memory 16 GB memory even the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.920
 same 20 7 megapixel camera on the 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.070
 back 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.390
 So here are really only minimal 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.759
 determine differences 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:20.820
 some differences is the thick because 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.159
 That Sony's PS3 is almost a millimeter 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.009
 thinner not quite but almost one 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:32.070
 millimeter thinner than the z2 with me 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:33.030
 my 7.5 millimeter 73 mm even and yes 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.420
 it's also a bit easier 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.079
 the set tragic only 152 grams but me 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.909
 have to say 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.320
 but you differed mcclain gates 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.240
 it remains an illusion 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.869
 but you can tell if that is a bit 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.710
 easier is at least subjectively seen 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.549
 that's just in this moment 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.080
 well let's go for a bit 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.729
 get around it we see that's happening 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.710
 design has changed a bit for me 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.750
 personally like az 3 just better 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.580
 I do not know maybe a new one 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.330
 but what you write here in the 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.250
 Comments 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.979
 otherwise we will see that for the most part 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.200
 same connections while you are micro 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.440
 sd card slot power button 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.850
 volume rocker dedicated camera 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.569
 buttons then we have connection here 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.349
 for accessories a micro-usb connection 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.390
 is in this case, of course 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.370
 behind the flap here and there is then 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.319
 also the sim card slot housed 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.870
 Here we have a headset port and 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.670
 yes you see the things are 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.560
 all seen in the same spot 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.940
 maybe a little different and 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.580
 this also applies to the smartphone here 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.319
 itself is mostly everything 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.180
 the same thing at least the internal one 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.340
 hardware operation is a difference 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.440
 still through the angry spring z3 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.540
 better visible in the sun outside 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.000
 should be more visible and also the 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.850
 battery life should be longer and you 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.829
 should come through with good two days 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.180
 see again his real use 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.470
 looks like we can at the fair 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.220
 the battery life, of course, next 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.230
 test 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.549
 well it 's a nice comparison of that 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:06.620
 first heard eg with the son x200 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.620
 thank you for seeing blog
