00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.929
 so hi to all of you 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.940
 mantis today we find ourselves for 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.380
 a new gameplay on modern warfare 2 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.539
 change a little bit of block 2/4 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.060
 summons some gameplay from seine me 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.130
 I'm tired of playing it and so we play 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.810
 domination in territory war so 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.390
 of a work has nine on the map this 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.000
 kiss fashion that frankly I love 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.660
 no more than the others and here after the 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.590
 little massacre 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.210
 I will show you from 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.290
 now frankly I'm going to be 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.550
 quite happy why I put a 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.340
 counter simply because it's 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.200
 a 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.030
 attempt luc exploits at least I have not 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.860
 say attempt because I have not 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.970
 really tried to do it in express 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.200
 we will rather say it's a struggle 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.720
 the express and I put the meter 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.250
 extracts so here it is if I'm already 4 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.660
 0 I told myself we're going to go for it 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.200
 directly in the ground like that we're going 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.270
 not hanging out 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.640
 and why I made this little video 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.660
 is why I propose two three 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.870
 community channels first of all 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.010
 because the nape of the neck has to be 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.000
 very fast otherwise I will not get it 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.830
 counter so I do not know a 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.840
 louis xi sport issue freeze or not 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.180
 I had of course wondered what is 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.040
 storyteller but it's also for you 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.590
 live idle happened at the end you have 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.729
 end of the month I was still pretty 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.590
 means you understand Morocco are 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.300
 summoned what's going on here I run 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.710
 my arrival I say good but 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.090
 directly the sprints will not call back 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.740
 of worry I ask my shit buddy 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.140
 a little bit 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.229
 these people due to the moisture during 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.549
 I'm in a building apparently that 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.290
 is not the case so I'm quiet 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.909
 I will launch my approach to 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.950
 machine gunners and diplo can call him 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.630
 as you want I hope a hatch 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.579
 yeah I know but hey it's machine gunner 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.039
 helicopter of nv200 profits at small fire 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.240
 anyway all the noodles that 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:44.770
 general we see it's like that but 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.110
 why do I present ccif first because 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.789
 that she is fast and then although 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.740
 you have a little trick at the end that has 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:51.970
 a little bit annoying here - I have a 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.500
 little bit of that I was telling myself less 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.090
 sure both buildings but I had 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.039
 luck they laughed this pole a guy to 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.840
 the outside that makes that I will be able 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:02.319
 limit from now on so a 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.289
 minute 24 for two sets of the uimm 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:08.530
 so the night 24 shot that's when 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:10.660
 even a pretty good gameplay I find 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.069
 even if you go to see a little blue a 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.480
 that here I do not know if the holy oils 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.970
 hermance the other is a party lobby 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.470
 or at least someone had the lobby 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.330
 in the part where there was a big bug 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.239
 I do not understand anything that happens 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.310
 what happens is player excluded brief 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.870
 I hope these little express videos 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.099
 you will have liked it is the one she 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.420
 do not hesitate to subscribe to my 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.500
 chain I tell you to the next well 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.500
 bring you well ciao
