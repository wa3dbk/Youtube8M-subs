PDK transmission now this is a 2 clutch
system<00:03:38.030> let<00:03:38.840> me<00:03:38.930> tell<00:03:39.110> you<00:03:39.170> how<00:03:39.319> it<00:03:39.440> works

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
system let me tell you how it works

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.039 
system let me tell you how it works
let's<00:03:40.400> say<00:03:40.610> for<00:03:40.879> example<00:03:41.299> you're<00:03:41.480> in<00:03:41.569> second

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
let's say for example you're in second

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:43.599 
let's say for example you're in second
gear<00:03:42.170> the<00:03:42.590> other<00:03:42.769> clutch<00:03:43.129> actually

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
gear the other clutch actually

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.160 
gear the other clutch actually
pre-selects<00:03:44.269> third<00:03:44.659> gear

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
pre-selects third gear

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.380 
pre-selects third gear
so<00:03:45.440> the<00:03:45.590> shifts<00:03:45.980> between<00:03:46.340> gears<00:03:46.579> it's<00:03:47.000> that

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
so the shifts between gears it's that

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.180 
so the shifts between gears it's that
quick<00:03:47.720> it's<00:03:47.959> that<00:03:48.170> instant<00:03:48.470> there's

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
quick it's that instant there's

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.520 
quick it's that instant there's
absolutely<00:03:49.609> no<00:03:49.819> friction<00:03:50.420> loss<00:03:50.599> between<00:03:51.109> gear

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
absolutely no friction loss between gear

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.380 
absolutely no friction loss between gear
shifts<00:03:51.920> but<00:03:52.340> not<00:03:52.549> only<00:03:52.730> that<00:03:52.819> we<00:03:52.970> get<00:03:53.269> the
