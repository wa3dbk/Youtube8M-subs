PDX<00:00:14.370> 1<00:00:14.639> segmenting<00:00:15.420> slug<00:00:15.750> well<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:16.500> slug<00:00:16.770> is

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
PDX 1 segmenting slug well this slug is

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.090 
PDX 1 segmenting slug well this slug is
a<00:00:17.039> one-out<00:00:17.460> slug<00:00:17.820> it's<00:00:18.090> at<00:00:18.960> 1600<00:00:19.740> feet<00:00:19.859> per

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
a one-out slug it's at 1600 feet per

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.000 
a one-out slug it's at 1600 feet per
second<00:00:20.520> it's<00:00:21.390> like<00:00:21.960> your<00:00:22.170> standard<00:00:22.380> foster

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
second it's like your standard foster

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.429 
second it's like your standard foster
slug<00:00:23.279> but<00:00:23.850> what<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.150> does<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.600> differently<00:00:25.260> is

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
slug but what it does is differently is

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.859 
slug but what it does is differently is
it's<00:00:25.619> segmented<00:00:25.890> on<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.519> front<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.029> inside

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
it's segmented on the front and inside

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.620 
it's segmented on the front and inside
and<00:00:28.470> what<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.189> does<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.849> allows<00:00:30.390> that

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
and what that does is it allows that

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.990 
and what that does is it allows that
slug<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.170> segment<00:00:31.560> upon<00:00:31.800> impact<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.730> your

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
slug to segment upon impact of your

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.240 
slug to segment upon impact of your
target<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.840> know<00:00:34.230> standard<00:00:34.800> slug<00:00:35.070> you

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
target so you know standard slug you

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.770 
target so you know standard slug you
might<00:00:35.399> get<00:00:35.610> eighteen<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.360> twenty<00:00:36.660> inch

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
might get eighteen to twenty inch

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.630 
might get eighteen to twenty inch
penetration<00:00:37.440> which<00:00:37.649> in<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.070> self-defense

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
penetration which in a self-defense

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.369 
penetration which in a self-defense
situation<00:00:38.879> may<00:00:39.480> be<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.629> little<00:00:39.899> bit<00:00:40.020> too<00:00:40.200> deep

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
situation may be a little bit too deep

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.440 
situation may be a little bit too deep
whereas<00:00:41.160> with<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.430> slug<00:00:41.700> here<00:00:42.000> it's<00:00:42.239> going

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
whereas with this slug here it's going

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.020 
whereas with this slug here it's going
to<00:00:42.510> segment<00:00:42.690> into<00:00:42.989> three<00:00:43.200> equal<00:00:43.320> pieces<00:00:43.620> about

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
to segment into three equal pieces about

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.479 
to segment into three equal pieces about
135<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.239> 150<00:00:45.870> grains<00:00:46.079> each<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.950> they're<00:00:47.370> all

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
135 to 150 grains each and they're all

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.799 
135 to 150 grains each and they're all
going<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.730> segment<00:00:48.000> between<00:00:48.410> 14<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.440> 18<00:00:49.980> inches

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
going to segment between 14 to 18 inches

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.680 
going to segment between 14 to 18 inches
so<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.050> could<00:00:52.320> get<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.500> massive<00:00:53.160> energy

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
so you could get a massive energy

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.689 
so you could get a massive energy
deposit<00:00:54.690> on<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:55.199> target<00:00:55.559> but<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.399> don't<00:00:56.579> get

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
deposit on that target but you don't get

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.729 
deposit on that target but you don't get
that<00:00:56.910> over<00:00:57.149> penetration<00:00:57.809> that's<00:00:58.620> an

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
that over penetration that's an

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:59.810 
that over penetration that's an
important<00:00:59.100> consideration<00:00:59.309> when<00:00:59.670> you're

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
important consideration when you're

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.400 
important consideration when you're
talking<00:01:00.059> about<00:01:00.149> self<00:01:00.420> defense<00:01:00.570> right<00:01:01.020> right

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
talking about self defense right right

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.689 
talking about self defense right right
certainly<00:01:01.890> don't<00:01:02.160> want<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.370> hit<00:01:02.489> someone

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
certainly don't want to hit someone

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.280 
certainly don't want to hit someone
you're<00:01:02.879> not<00:01:02.969> intending<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.449> exactly<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.140> hit

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
you're not intending to exactly you hit

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.240 
you're not intending to exactly you hit
your<00:01:04.409> intended<00:01:04.680> target

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250

your intended target
how's<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.240> thing<00:01:06.420> doing<00:01:06.570> watermelons<00:01:07.229> well

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
how's this thing doing watermelons well

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.320 
how's this thing doing watermelons well
we're<00:01:07.979> going<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.159> shoot<00:01:08.310> water<00:01:08.549> alright<00:01:09.000> and

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
we're going to shoot water alright and

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.780 
we're going to shoot water alright and
what<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:09.810> will<00:01:09.960> do<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.250> when<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.340> shoot<00:01:11.580> this

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
what this will do is when you shoot this

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.760 
what this will do is when you shoot this
slug<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.330> stays<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.810> one<00:01:12.960> piece<00:01:13.200> downrange

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
slug it stays in one piece downrange

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.140 
slug it stays in one piece downrange
it's<00:01:13.920> just<00:01:14.100> like<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.250> regular<00:01:14.430> slug<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.000> your

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
it's just like a regular slug so your

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.300 
it's just like a regular slug so your
accuracy<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.900> similar<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> foster<00:01:16.890> slug<00:01:17.100> so

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
accuracy is similar to a foster slug so

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.580 
accuracy is similar to a foster slug so
you<00:01:17.759> know<00:01:17.880> 50<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.540> 100<00:01:18.869> yards<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.409> should

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
you know 50 to 100 yards you should

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.469 
you know 50 to 100 yards you should
still<00:01:19.860> expect<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.490> same<00:01:20.729> type<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:20.939> accuracy

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
still expect the same type of accuracy

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.820 
still expect the same type of accuracy
that<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.750> see<00:01:21.900> with<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.110> standard<00:01:22.439> Fox<00:01:22.650> right

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
that you see with a standard Fox right

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.230 
that you see with a standard Fox right
look<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.490> what<00:01:23.640> you're<00:01:23.729> going<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.880> do<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.119> when

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
look so what you're going to do is when

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.719 
look so what you're going to do is when
you<00:01:24.299> shoot<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:25.009> watermelon<00:01:26.009> here<00:01:26.400> it's

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
you shoot this watermelon here it's

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.130 
you shoot this watermelon here it's
going<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.970> be<00:01:27.030> just<00:01:27.150> like<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> regular<00:01:27.570> slug<00:01:27.960> but

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
going to be just like a regular slug but

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.420 
going to be just like a regular slug but
what<00:01:28.290> we're<00:01:28.380> going<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.590> try<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.799> do<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.130> see<00:01:29.400> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
what we're going to try to do is see the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.310 
what we're going to try to do is see the
three<00:01:29.790> pieces<00:01:30.210> come<00:01:30.509> through<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
three pieces come through this the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.319 
three pieces come through this the
watermelon<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:31.920> we<00:01:32.369> got<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.700> board<00:01:32.970> up<00:01:33.150> there

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
watermelon so we got that board up there

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.330 
watermelon so we got that board up there
probably<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.930> lot<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.259> watermelon<00:01:34.829> bits<00:01:35.009> and

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
probably a lot of watermelon bits and

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.740 
probably a lot of watermelon bits and
all<00:01:35.460> right<00:01:35.640> little<00:01:35.939> bits<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.210> chunks<00:01:36.600> but

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
all right little bits of chunks but

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.120 
all right little bits of chunks but
hopefully<00:01:37.470> we'll<00:01:37.590> be<00:01:37.680> able<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.860> show<00:01:38.070> you

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
hopefully we'll be able to show you

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:57.000 
hopefully we'll be able to show you
where<00:01:38.340> those<00:01:38.460> pieces<00:01:38.670> sing<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.270> let's<00:01:39.479> do<00:01:39.600> it

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010
