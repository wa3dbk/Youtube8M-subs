for<00:00:24.150> medicine<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.869> knew<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:26.010> gave<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.400> lecture

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
for medicine I knew you gave the lecture

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.990 
for medicine I knew you gave the lecture
this<00:00:27.420> morning<00:00:27.529> and<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:28.830> my<00:00:28.949> first<00:00:29.429> question<00:00:29.880> is

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
this morning and so my first question is

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.020 
this morning and so my first question is
really<00:00:30.390> looking<00:00:31.140> back<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.610> early<00:00:32.880> days

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
really looking back to to the early days

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.440 
really looking back to to the early days
of<00:00:33.360> pioneering<00:00:34.010> technology<00:00:35.010> development<00:00:35.790> how

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
of pioneering technology development how

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.470 
of pioneering technology development how
does<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.840> feel<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.890> receive<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.309> prize<00:00:38.670> in

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
does it feel to receive a prize in

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.080 
does it feel to receive a prize in
medicine<00:00:39.770> well<00:00:40.770> thank<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.219> first<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.640> all<00:00:41.760> and

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
medicine well thank you first of all and

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.389 
medicine well thank you first of all and
yeah<00:00:42.750> it's<00:00:42.989> um<00:00:43.290> it's<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.890> very<00:00:44.070> good<00:00:44.190> feeling

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
yeah it's um it's a very good feeling

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.709 
yeah it's um it's a very good feeling
yeah<00:00:45.110> yeah<00:00:46.110> so<00:00:46.410> our<00:00:47.190> ambitions<00:00:47.700> when<00:00:47.940> we

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
yeah yeah so our ambitions when we

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.170 
yeah yeah so our ambitions when we
started<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.110> long<00:00:49.200> time<00:00:49.260> ago<00:00:49.730> with<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:50.879> mass

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
started a long time ago with this mass

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.619 
started a long time ago with this mass
spec<00:00:51.449> technologies<00:00:53.000> were<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.239> we<00:00:54.390> could

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
spec technologies were that we could

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.630 
spec technologies were that we could
perhaps<00:00:55.410> do<00:00:55.680> something<00:00:55.890> good<00:00:56.039> for<00:00:56.100> protein

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
perhaps do something good for protein

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.610 
perhaps do something good for protein
science<00:00:57.239> right<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.600> was<00:00:57.840> our<00:00:58.079> ambition<00:00:58.500> and

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
science right that was our ambition and

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.000 
science right that was our ambition and
that<00:00:58.770> was<00:00:58.890> already<00:00:59.359> pretty<00:01:00.359> or<00:01:00.629> -<00:01:00.840> OH<00:01:01.140> -<00:01:01.199> yes<00:01:01.710> at

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
that was already pretty or - OH - yes at

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.390 
that was already pretty or - OH - yes at
that<00:01:02.399> time<00:01:02.640> but<00:01:02.910> but<00:01:03.870> then<00:01:04.049> we<00:01:04.739> saw<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.100> work

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
that time but but then we saw this work

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.160 
that time but but then we saw this work
quite<00:01:05.670> well<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.090> then<00:01:06.210> actually<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.840> for<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
quite well and then actually a for the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.760 
quite well and then actually a for the
last<00:01:08.090> five<00:01:09.090> years<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.420> would<00:01:09.570> say<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.930> myself

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
last five years I would say of myself

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.950 
last five years I would say of myself
because<00:01:10.950> come<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.820> believe<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.119> maybe<00:01:12.780> this

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
because come to believe that maybe this

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.230 
because come to believe that maybe this
has<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> kind<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.979> place<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.760> clinic<00:01:15.060> but

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
has a kind of a place in the clinic but

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.170 
has a kind of a place in the clinic but
but<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:15.990> still<00:01:16.350> needs<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.740> be<00:01:16.860> proven<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.790> I

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
but that still needs to be proven so I

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.760 
but that still needs to be proven so I
think<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.689> technology<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.200> pretty<00:01:19.409> good<00:01:19.560> but

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
think the technology is pretty good but

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.710 
think the technology is pretty good but
but<00:01:20.520> whether<00:01:20.700> if<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:20.939> will<00:01:21.210> be<00:01:21.299> used<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
but whether if you will be used in the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.810 
but whether if you will be used in the
clinic<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.170> another<00:01:23.130> question<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.549> do<00:01:23.700> you

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
clinic is another question in do you

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.330 
clinic is another question in do you
think<00:01:23.880> there<00:01:24.180> will<00:01:24.570> be<00:01:24.630> applications<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:25.619> you

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
think there will be applications in you

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.810 
think there will be applications in you
know<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.990> personalized<00:01:27.990> medicine<00:01:28.820> yeah

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
know in personalized medicine yeah

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.390 
know in personalized medicine yeah
that's<00:01:30.030> definitely<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.479> hope<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.530> mean

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
that's definitely the hope and I mean

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.710 
that's definitely the hope and I mean
more<00:01:32.970> accurate<00:01:34.549> classification<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:36.210> patients

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
more accurate classification of patients

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.230 
more accurate classification of patients
for<00:01:36.930> instance<00:01:37.200> in<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.770> already<00:01:38.040> existing

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
for instance in the already existing

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.730 
for instance in the already existing
subtypes<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.450> would<00:01:39.750> help<00:01:39.900> already<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.380> think

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
subtypes that would help already I think

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.280 
subtypes that would help already I think
that<00:01:41.460> that's<00:01:41.759> our<00:01:41.880> near-term<00:01:42.390> goal<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:43.049> I

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
that that's our near-term goal so I

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.889 
that that's our near-term goal so I
mentioned<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.280> my<00:01:44.310> talk<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.750> something<00:01:45.750> like

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
mentioned in my talk that something like

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.620 
mentioned in my talk that something like
10%<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.530> women<00:01:46.799> are<00:01:47.100> still<00:01:47.270> misclassified<00:01:48.270> in

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
10% of women are still misclassified in

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.550 
10% of women are still misclassified in
in<00:01:49.470> breast<00:01:49.829> cancer<00:01:50.240> into<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.479> main<00:01:51.689> types<00:01:52.110> and

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
in breast cancer into the main types and

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.830 
in breast cancer into the main types and
if<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.460> misclassified<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.240> also<00:01:54.420> receive

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
if you misclassified you also receive

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.190 
if you misclassified you also receive
the<00:01:54.869> wrong<00:01:55.170> treatment<00:01:55.549> so<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.210> something

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
the wrong treatment so that is something

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.200 
the wrong treatment so that is something
that<00:01:58.259> should<00:01:58.560> be<00:01:58.590> addressed<00:01:59.460> well<00:01:59.880> now<00:02:00.030> by

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
that should be addressed well now by

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.139 
that should be addressed well now by
these<00:02:00.390> techniques<00:02:00.869> in<00:02:01.560> for<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.369> normal<00:02:02.729> bench

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
these techniques in for the normal bench

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.749 
these techniques in for the normal bench
scientist<00:02:03.719> will<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.740> be<00:02:04.860> possible<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.399> just

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
scientist will it be possible to just

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:06.550 
scientist will it be possible to just
have<00:02:05.969> a

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
have a

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.979 
have a
a<00:02:06.619> machine<00:02:07.310> on<00:02:07.490> the<00:02:07.579> bench<00:02:07.790> to<00:02:08.179> do<00:02:08.630> sample

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
a machine on the bench to do sample

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.250 
a machine on the bench to do sample
preparation<00:02:09.259> injected<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:11.360> do<00:02:11.599> the<00:02:11.750> analyzes

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
preparation injected and do the analyzes

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.780

very<00:02:12.440> simply<00:02:12.860> because<00:02:13.220> it<00:02:13.489> seems<00:02:13.700> that

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
very simply because it seems that

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.930 
very simply because it seems that
proteomics<00:02:14.180> is<00:02:14.450> always<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:15.050> lot<00:02:15.890> of<00:02:16.040> investment

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
proteomics is always a lot of investment

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.910 
proteomics is always a lot of investment
in<00:02:17.180> technology<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.840> expertise<00:02:18.319> I<00:02:18.530> don't<00:02:18.739> see

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
in technology and expertise I don't see

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.710 
in technology and expertise I don't see
why<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:19.220> shouldn't<00:02:19.550> be<00:02:19.700> possible<00:02:19.849> it<00:02:20.330> will

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
why it shouldn't be possible it will

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.710 
why it shouldn't be possible it will
probably<00:02:21.410> require<00:02:22.010> one<00:02:22.459> more<00:02:22.510> generation<00:02:23.510> of

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
probably require one more generation of

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.949 
probably require one more generation of
things<00:02:24.260> at<00:02:24.500> least<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:28.700> does<00:02:29.569> requires

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
things at least and it does requires

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.780 
things at least and it does requires
some<00:02:30.290> expertise<00:02:30.920> but<00:02:31.130> but<00:02:32.060> not<00:02:32.269> more<00:02:32.510> than

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
some expertise but but not more than

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.640 
some expertise but but not more than
confocal<00:02:34.790> microscopy<00:02:35.239> or<00:02:35.569> so<00:02:35.870> in<00:02:36.019> the<00:02:36.290> future

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650

so turning to you now you are I think

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.370 
so turning to you now you are I think
your<00:02:40.130> education<00:02:40.730> he<00:02:40.970> was<00:02:41.390> first<00:02:41.660> in<00:02:41.900> physics

you you decided to work in biology do

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.520 
you you decided to work in biology do
you<00:02:49.250> think<00:02:49.519> that<00:02:49.700> this<00:02:50.290> transdisciplinary<00:02:51.290> or

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
you think that this transdisciplinary or

you think that this transdisciplinary or
multidisciplinary<00:02:52.209> expertise<00:02:53.209> is<00:02:53.989> something

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
multidisciplinary expertise is something

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.740 
multidisciplinary expertise is something
that<00:02:54.739> is<00:02:54.950> more<00:02:55.340> frequent<00:02:55.880> maybe<00:02:56.120> nowadays<00:02:56.540> or

that is more frequent maybe nowadays or

that is more frequent maybe nowadays or

be developed by more let's say hard

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.070 
be developed by more let's say hard
scientists<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:07.489> then<00:03:07.610> then<00:03:08.269> it<00:03:08.420> moves<00:03:08.630> into

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
scientists and then then it moves into

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.500 
scientists and then then it moves into
the<00:03:09.799> biology<00:03:10.250> and<00:03:10.519> the<00:03:10.700> people<00:03:10.940> can<00:03:11.060> move<00:03:11.209> with

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
the biology and the people can move with

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.960 
the biology and the people can move with
it<00:03:11.540> if<00:03:11.750> they<00:03:11.930> choose<00:03:12.200> that<00:03:12.500> that's<00:03:13.430> what<00:03:13.579> I<00:03:13.609> did

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
it if they choose that that's what I did

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.210 
it if they choose that that's what I did
and<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:15.290> we're<00:03:15.440> seeing<00:03:15.650> maybe<00:03:16.040> an

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
and and we're seeing maybe an

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.920 
and and we're seeing maybe an
opportunity<00:03:16.400> again<00:03:16.820> with<00:03:17.209> with<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.570> systems

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
opportunity again with with the systems

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.180 
opportunity again with with the systems
biology<00:03:18.140> with<00:03:18.620> a<00:03:18.650> little<00:03:18.980> bit<00:03:19.070> more

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
biology with a little bit more

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.289 
biology with a little bit more
quantitative<00:03:19.840> aspects<00:03:20.840> large<00:03:21.079> datasets<00:03:21.880> so<00:03:22.880> I

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
quantitative aspects large datasets so I

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.690 
quantitative aspects large datasets so I
think<00:03:23.959> it<00:03:24.260> will<00:03:24.350> be<00:03:24.500> expected<00:03:25.010> from<00:03:25.489> both

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
think it will be expected from both

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.460 
think it will be expected from both
sides<00:03:26.000> actually<00:03:26.450> so<00:03:26.630> it<00:03:26.750> there<00:03:27.140> will<00:03:27.260> still<00:03:27.410> be

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
sides actually so it there will still be

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.020 
sides actually so it there will still be
opportunities<00:03:28.160> for<00:03:28.370> people<00:03:28.549> with<00:03:28.760> different

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
opportunities for people with different

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.390 
opportunities for people with different
backgrounds<00:03:29.600> coming<00:03:29.870> into<00:03:29.989> biology<00:03:30.500> but<00:03:31.340> also

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
backgrounds coming into biology but also

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.420 
backgrounds coming into biology but also
it<00:03:32.090> will<00:03:32.239> be<00:03:32.560> required<00:03:33.560> of<00:03:33.709> biologists<00:03:34.310> to

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
it will be required of biologists to

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.479 
it will be required of biologists to
have<00:03:34.609> open<00:03:35.389> mind<00:03:35.630> at<00:03:35.810> least<00:03:35.930> about<00:03:36.489> modeling

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
have open mind at least about modeling

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.180 
have open mind at least about modeling
and<00:03:37.760> large<00:03:37.910> large<00:03:38.480> datasets<00:03:38.900> loft<00:03:39.889> ideas

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
and large large datasets loft ideas

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.129 
and large large datasets loft ideas
already<00:03:40.400> out<00:03:40.670> there<00:03:40.880> on<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:41.510> internet<00:03:41.930> that

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
already out there on the internet that

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.949 
already out there on the internet that
they<00:03:42.290> should<00:03:43.040> use<00:03:43.069> in<00:03:43.970> in<00:03:44.269> their<00:03:44.480> research<00:03:44.780> if

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
they should use in in their research if

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.629 
they should use in in their research if
they<00:03:45.109> don't<00:03:45.380> there<00:03:45.530> will<00:03:45.620> be<00:03:45.650> a<00:03:45.920> competitive

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:46.639 
they don't there will be a competitive

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:49.420 
they don't there will be a competitive
disadvantage<00:03:47.079> and<00:03:48.079> now<00:03:48.350> we<00:03:48.410> we<00:03:48.950> really<00:03:49.250> look
