hear that it's just buzzing and is not
making<00:01:47.100> its<00:01:47.369> connection<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.470> you<00:01:49.470> want<00:01:49.680> to

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
making its connection so you want to

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
replace that you usually get a second a

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.940 
replace that you usually get a second a
moderate<00:01:51.780> 10<00:01:52.020> pounds<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.470> hasn't<00:01:52.710> going<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.890> be

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
moderate 10 pounds it hasn't going to be

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.280 
moderate 10 pounds it hasn't going to be
off<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.340> off<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:54.270> make<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.750> model<00:01:55.020> but<00:01:55.140> it

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
off of it off that make and model but it

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.950 
off of it off that make and model but it
probably<00:01:55.530> fit<00:01:55.799> better<00:01:55.950> if<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.219> do<00:01:56.750> both<00:01:57.750> sort

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
probably fit better if you do both sort

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.850 
probably fit better if you do both sort
of<00:01:58.020> any<00:01:58.250> starter<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.460> would<00:02:00.060> do<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.240> job<00:02:00.860> so

of any starter so I would do the job so

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.420 
of any starter so I would do the job so
that's<00:02:02.009> that's<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.490> job<00:02:02.700> coming<00:02:02.939> up<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:04.430> also

foot<00:02:26.070> pegs<00:02:26.340> on<00:02:26.490> I'll<00:02:26.640> notice<00:02:27.000> there<00:02:27.240> so<00:02:27.480> it's<00:02:28.290> a

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
foot pegs on I'll notice there so it's a

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.670 
foot pegs on I'll notice there so it's a
bit<00:02:28.560> sort<00:02:28.800> of<00:02:28.860> that<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.360> would<00:02:30.360> say<00:02:30.570> I<00:02:30.680> practice

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
bit sort of that I would say I practice

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.560 
bit sort of that I would say I practice
me<00:02:31.830> with<00:02:32.010> that<00:02:32.130> there's<00:02:32.400> also<00:02:32.550> on<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.120> fairing

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
me with that there's also on the fairing

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.810 
me with that there's also on the fairing
screws<00:02:34.080> there's<00:02:34.380> two<00:02:34.620> things<00:02:34.860> grew<00:02:35.340> bracket

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
screws there's two things grew bracket

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.730 
screws there's two things grew bracket
which<00:02:35.970> are<00:02:36.090> not<00:02:36.210> lined<00:02:36.480> up<00:02:36.660> on<00:02:36.840> there<00:02:37.050> I<00:02:37.230> don't

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
which are not lined up on there I don't

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.200 
which are not lined up on there I don't
have<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.920> screws<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.340> give<00:02:38.580> in<00:02:38.700> there<00:02:38.880> but<00:02:39.060> the

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
have the screws to give in there but the

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.490 
have the screws to give in there but the
fairing<00:02:39.510> feels<00:02:39.750> firm<00:02:40.020> enough<00:02:40.320> but

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
fairing feels firm enough but

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
nevertheless it looks good with its

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.050 
nevertheless it looks good with its
screws<00:02:42.300> missing<00:02:42.480> there<00:02:43.610> took<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.730> biking

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
screws missing there took the biking

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.540 
screws missing there took the biking
with<00:02:45.150> mot<00:02:45.600> test<00:02:45.930> day<00:02:46.710> before<00:02:47.010> yes<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.430> it

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
with mot test day before yes and it

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.510 
with mot test day before yes and it
failed<00:02:47.760> it's<00:02:47.940> mot<00:02:48.000> on<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:49.560> front<00:02:49.890> right<00:02:50.130> disc

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
failed it's mot on the front right disc

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.400 
failed it's mot on the front right disc
which<00:02:50.730> has<00:02:50.970> got<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.480> couple<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:51.840> cracks<00:02:52.110> in<00:02:52.290> the

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
which has got a couple of cracks in the

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.110 
which has got a couple of cracks in the
disc<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.920> also<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.310> front<00:02:53.550> wheel<00:02:53.730> bearings

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
disc and also the front wheel bearings

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.930 
disc and also the front wheel bearings
are<00:02:54.240> worn<00:02:54.270> so<00:02:55.040> you<00:02:56.040> could<00:02:56.190> either<00:02:56.340> just<00:02:56.520> buy<00:02:56.910> a

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
are worn so you could either just buy a

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.610 
are worn so you could either just buy a
second-hand<00:02:57.660> front<00:02:58.020> wheel<00:02:58.230> which<00:02:58.500> is

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
second-hand front wheel which is

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.410 
second-hand front wheel which is
obviously<00:02:58.890> got<00:02:59.040> disks<00:02:59.520> on<00:02:59.640> it<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.030> will<00:03:00.180> bones

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
obviously got disks on it and will bones

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.640 
obviously got disks on it and will bones
in<00:03:00.630> it<00:03:00.660> and<00:03:00.900> just<00:03:01.020> stick<00:03:01.170> it<00:03:01.260> straight<00:03:01.410> on

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
in it and just stick it straight on

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.980 
in it and just stick it straight on
there<00:03:01.890> or<00:03:02.130> you<00:03:02.700> could<00:03:02.880> get<00:03:03.090> some<00:03:03.330> bearings<00:03:03.780> and

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
there or you could get some bearings and

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.810 
there or you could get some bearings and
another<00:03:04.230> discordant<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.130> do<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.430> job<00:03:05.459> there

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
another discordant and do the job there

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.300 
another discordant and do the job there
but<00:03:05.970> apart<00:03:06.240> and<00:03:06.360> that<00:03:06.450> it<00:03:06.570> will<00:03:06.630> pass<00:03:06.900> over

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
but apart and that it will pass over

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.750 
but apart and that it will pass over
there<00:03:08.310> we<00:03:08.430> go<00:03:08.550> good<00:03:09.060> luck<00:03:09.120> with<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.420> bidding
