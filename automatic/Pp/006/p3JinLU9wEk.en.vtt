00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.490
 Modern technology is developed for many things here in the United States 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.650
 and well here we are with him played explain the novelties he has 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.040
 in the cross 2 thousand 12 of 2012 we have two new engines one of times 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.450
 It is 3 points 6 liters 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.550
 we also have points four four cylinders with days ago and that 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.730
 wait and toilets 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.730
 10s its system that we have for 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.210
 improve field efficiency 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.830
 and the better this improvement, as 32% are foreign 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.940
 economy of the city 23% in the coffee economy quite and as the 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.040
 that is achieved is saving gas 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.100
 we have an electric motor in the band an engine 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.420
 it helps the engine with a need more we can more power on the road 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.310
 like 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.600
 off 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.690
 the motor 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.020
 of fuels does not pay when 1 10 to 1 still 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.020
 to one side to see for example to open for mons 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.020
 I am totally 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.400
 there the engine was turned off 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.640
 end it is an engine 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.400
 and now the start you do not hear anything how to get a car a gasoline engine 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.840
 new race inside the cabin the tension between the wind 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.480
 make a well car 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.540
 I do not know 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.840
 that are not our mutual friends 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.620
 and that other novelties have nothing 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.900
 also for this year is saying the entertainment system 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.480
 especially more than 120 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.710
 it is a system that emits 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.049
 with this they are a means of telephones then commit until 1 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.720
 inti in the united states to the current internet for systems like pandora 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.280
