00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.529 
what I have so it's it's actually a
little<00:05:46.190> higher<00:05:46.400> than<00:05:46.669> the<00:05:46.759> paper<00:05:47.000> as<00:05:47.210> you<00:05:47.330> can

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 
little higher than the paper as you can

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:52.149 
little higher than the paper as you can
see<00:05:49.479> again<00:05:50.479> the<00:05:50.960> picture<00:05:51.349> does<00:05:51.530> not<00:05:51.560> have<00:05:51.979> to

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159 
see again the picture does not have to

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:57.730 
see again the picture does not have to
be<00:05:52.900> completely<00:05:53.900> encased<00:05:54.440> in<00:05:55.750> the<00:05:56.750> frame<00:05:57.050> you
