so<00:02:01.229> you're<00:02:01.350> gonna<00:02:01.469> have<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:02.009> loop<00:02:02.219> on<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.880> end

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
so you're gonna have the loop on the end

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.969 
so you're gonna have the loop on the end
of<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.240> right<00:02:04.049> here<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.500> your<00:02:04.619> ends<00:02:04.829> on<00:02:04.890> the

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
of it right here and your ends on the

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.740 
of it right here and your ends on the
other<00:02:05.159> end<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.909> just<00:02:06.090> set<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.329> down<00:02:06.390> for

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
other end you just set that down for

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.050 
other end you just set that down for
right<00:02:06.840> now<00:02:06.869> okay<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.979> go<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.640> pull<00:02:08.879> off

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
right now okay you go and you pull off

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.650 
right now okay you go and you pull off
like<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.750> can<00:02:09.780> have<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.110> up

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
like you can have it up

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.200 
like you can have it up
here<00:02:10.840> you<00:02:11.680> can<00:02:11.830> have<00:02:11.950> it<00:02:12.010> anywhere<00:02:12.850> near<00:02:13.000> here

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
here you can have it anywhere near here

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.500 
here you can have it anywhere near here
I<00:02:13.330> prefer<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.870> have<00:02:14.020> them<00:02:14.320> down<00:02:14.890> below<00:02:15.480> so<00:02:16.480> you

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
I prefer to have them down below so you

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.790 
I prefer to have them down below so you
pull<00:02:16.780> off<00:02:16.870> a<00:02:16.900> little<00:02:17.080> section<00:02:17.410> this<00:02:17.590> might

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
pull off a little section this might

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.060 
pull off a little section this might
actually<00:02:17.980> be<00:02:18.190> a<00:02:18.280> little<00:02:18.340> too<00:02:18.850> much<00:02:19.030> um<00:02:20.070> but

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
actually be a little too much um but

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.190 
actually be a little too much um but
like<00:02:21.190> this<00:02:21.460> okay<00:02:22.180> so<00:02:22.240> you<00:02:22.420> pull<00:02:22.630> it<00:02:22.720> off

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
like this okay so you pull it off

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.080 
like this okay so you pull it off
and<00:02:23.470> I<00:02:23.770> make<00:02:23.920> sure<00:02:24.070> that<00:02:24.100> it's<00:02:24.490> like<00:02:24.820> comb

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
and I make sure that it's like comb

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.450 
and I make sure that it's like comb
through<00:02:25.360> or<00:02:25.780> whatever<00:02:26.140> before<00:02:26.980> you<00:02:27.100> do<00:02:27.250> it<00:02:27.340> and

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
through or whatever before you do it and

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.460 
through or whatever before you do it and
you<00:02:27.970> pull<00:02:28.150> your<00:02:28.270> hair<00:02:28.390> off<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.960> the<00:02:29.050> one<00:02:29.200> side

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
you pull your hair off to the one side

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.960 
you pull your hair off to the one side
okay<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:30.550> then<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:31.810> pick<00:02:32.080> up<00:02:32.410> your<00:02:33.280> beats<00:02:33.580> and

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
okay and then you pick up your beats and

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.270 
okay and then you pick up your beats and
you're<00:02:34.960> going<00:02:35.080> to<00:02:35.110> stick<00:02:35.290> your<00:02:35.380> hair<00:02:35.680> through

you're going to stick your hair through

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.720 
you're going to stick your hair through
the<00:02:36.310> loop<00:02:36.990> okay<00:02:38.070> so<00:02:39.070> your<00:02:39.190> hair<00:02:39.340> is<00:02:39.490> through

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
the loop okay so your hair is through

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.720 
the loop okay so your hair is through
the<00:02:39.850> loop<00:02:40.030> and<00:02:40.530> then<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:42.160> want<00:02:42.340> to<00:02:42.400> pull<00:02:42.550> it<00:02:42.580> up

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
the loop and then you want to pull it up

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.050 
the loop and then you want to pull it up
kind<00:02:42.970> of<00:02:43.060> high<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.830> then<00:02:44.830> you<00:02:45.490> pull<00:02:45.760> on<00:02:45.940> the

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
kind of high and then you pull on the

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.110 
kind of high and then you pull on the
beads<00:02:47.400> okay<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:48.610> when<00:02:48.700> you<00:02:48.760> pull<00:02:48.940> on<00:02:49.030> the

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
beads okay and when you pull on the

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.090 
beads okay and when you pull on the
beads<00:02:49.300> it's<00:02:49.540> gonna<00:02:49.630> pull<00:02:49.930> your<00:02:50.110> hair<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.890> loop

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
beads it's gonna pull your hair the loop

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.980 
beads it's gonna pull your hair the loop
is<00:02:51.280> gonna<00:02:51.430> pull<00:02:51.610> your<00:02:51.730> hair<00:02:51.880> through<00:02:52.060> so<00:02:52.270> once

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
is gonna pull your hair through so once

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.330 
is gonna pull your hair through so once
you<00:02:53.110> get<00:02:53.260> it<00:02:53.350> tight<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:53.740> take<00:02:53.950> it<00:02:54.100> and<00:02:54.250> you

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
you get it tight you take it and you

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.080 
you get it tight you take it and you
pull<00:02:54.550> it<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:55.050> then<00:02:56.050> your<00:02:56.140> hair<00:02:56.320> pulls<00:02:56.560> through

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
pull it and then your hair pulls through

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.560 
pull it and then your hair pulls through
like<00:02:58.090> that<00:02:58.270> so<00:02:58.540> you've<00:02:58.660> got<00:02:58.810> your<00:02:58.960> hair<00:02:59.200> down

I put your hair tie in so you would just
pretend<00:03:13.240> like<00:03:13.390> you<00:03:13.540> had<00:03:13.660> a<00:03:13.690> little<00:03:13.840> rubber

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
pretend like you had a little rubber

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.380 
pretend like you had a little rubber
band<00:03:14.380> I<00:03:14.650> just<00:03:14.680> have<00:03:15.280> this<00:03:15.430> really<00:03:15.490> big<00:03:16.090> huge

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
band I just have this really big huge

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.050 
band I just have this really big huge
one<00:03:16.770> but<00:03:17.770> you<00:03:17.950> just<00:03:18.130> tie<00:03:18.400> it<00:03:18.459> around<00:03:18.700> a<00:03:19.030> couple

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
one but you just tie it around a couple

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.110 
one but you just tie it around a couple
times<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:20.040> then<00:03:21.040> what<00:03:21.190> you<00:03:21.310> do<00:03:21.490> is<00:03:21.520> for<00:03:22.000> the

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
times and then what you do is for the

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.650 
times and then what you do is for the
last<00:03:22.330> one<00:03:22.780> you<00:03:23.320> take<00:03:23.530> it<00:03:23.590> and<00:03:24.360> you're<00:03:25.360> supposed

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
last one you take it and you're supposed

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.790 
last one you take it and you're supposed
to<00:03:25.930> go<00:03:26.590> around<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:28.630> last<00:03:28.870> bead<00:03:29.230> so<00:03:29.500> you<00:03:29.590> take

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
to go around the last bead so you take

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.840 
to go around the last bead so you take
it<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:30.180> you<00:03:31.180> pull<00:03:31.420> it<00:03:31.510> through<00:03:32.610> so<00:03:33.610> it<00:03:33.700> goes

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
it and you pull it through so it goes

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.900 
it and you pull it through so it goes
around<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.390> last<00:03:34.570> bead<00:03:35.250> so<00:03:36.250> it'll<00:03:36.520> keep<00:03:36.610> it<00:03:36.790> in

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
around the last bead so it'll keep it in

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.730 
around the last bead so it'll keep it in
place<00:03:37.180> but<00:03:37.450> you<00:03:37.510> know<00:03:37.690> it'll<00:03:38.170> be<00:03:38.260> better<00:03:38.410> when

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
place but you know it'll be better when

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.979 
place but you know it'll be better when
you<00:03:38.950> don't<00:03:39.130> have<00:03:39.340> a<00:03:39.700> big<00:03:40.000> giant<00:03:40.420> hair<00:03:40.660> tie<00:03:40.810> when

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
you don't have a big giant hair tie when

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.780 
you don't have a big giant hair tie when
