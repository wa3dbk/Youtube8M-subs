and<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.719> like<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.079> because<00:00:37.500> they're<00:00:37.770> already

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
and I like this because they're already

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.350 
and I like this because they're already
sharp<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.340> pointy<00:00:38.640> on<00:00:38.730> one<00:00:38.879> end<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.239> could

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
sharp and pointy on one end so you could

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.610 
sharp and pointy on one end so you could
actually<00:00:39.480> stick<00:00:39.840> them<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.110> ground<00:00:40.140> and

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
actually stick them in the ground and

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.280 
actually stick them in the ground and
then<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.250> wind<00:00:41.640> could<00:00:41.910> make<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.360> pinwheels

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
then the wind could make the pinwheels

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.470 
then the wind could make the pinwheels

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
stays on the back and you'll see why in

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:13.920 
stays on the back and you'll see why in
just<00:04:12.519> a<00:04:12.730> second<00:04:13.060> and<00:04:13.150> then<00:04:13.660> you're<00:04:13.780> going<00:04:13.870> to

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.670 
fold up at the corners that you punched
the<00:04:15.700> holes<00:04:15.910> on<00:04:16.209> remember<00:04:16.989> we<00:04:17.109> only<00:04:17.229> did<00:04:17.410> every

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
the holes on remember we only did every

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.860 
the holes on remember we only did every
other<00:04:17.709> flap<00:04:18.359> and<00:04:19.359> you<00:04:19.479> want<00:04:19.630> to<00:04:19.690> pull<00:04:19.840> that

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
into the center now if you find any

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.150 
into the center now if you find any
areas<00:04:22.450> where<00:04:22.479> the<00:04:22.840> glue<00:04:23.140> just<00:04:23.650> didn't<00:04:23.919> bond

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
areas where the glue just didn't bond

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.800 
areas where the glue just didn't bond
like<00:04:24.430> right<00:04:24.610> there<00:04:24.820> you<00:04:25.030> go<00:04:25.300> in<00:04:25.479> with<00:04:25.599> a<00:04:25.660> glue

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
like right there you go in with a glue

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.879 
like right there you go in with a glue
stick<00:04:25.840> and<00:04:26.169> reattached

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
stick and reattached

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.839 
stick and reattached
that's<00:04:27.189> not<00:04:27.370> a<00:04:27.400> big<00:04:27.639> deal<00:04:29.099> I'll<00:04:30.099> pull<00:04:30.310> every

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:30.849 
that's not a big deal I'll pull every

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:37.589 
that's not a big deal I'll pull every
corner<00:04:31.479> in<00:04:35.879> alright<00:04:36.879> so<00:04:37.060> now<00:04:37.210> it<00:04:37.330> looks<00:04:37.389> like<00:04:37.569> a

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:37.599 
corner in alright so now it looks like a

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.570 
corner in alright so now it looks like a
pinwheel<00:04:37.900> okay<00:04:38.650> my<00:04:38.800> hands<00:04:39.009> on<00:04:39.159> the<00:04:39.219> way<00:04:39.340> there

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
pinwheel okay my hands on the way there

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.589 
pinwheel okay my hands on the way there
you<00:04:39.699> go<00:04:39.819> you<00:04:40.029> can<00:04:40.120> see<00:04:40.240> it<00:04:40.330> looks<00:04:40.419> like<00:04:40.509> a

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:40.599 
you go you can see it looks like a

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:41.969 
you go you can see it looks like a
pinwheel<00:04:40.779> now<00:04:41.379> you<00:04:41.439> want<00:04:41.590> to<00:04:41.620> put<00:04:41.770> it<00:04:41.860> on

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
pinwheel now you want to put it on

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.070 
pinwheel now you want to put it on
another<00:04:42.159> bead<00:04:42.460> I'll<00:04:43.419> just<00:04:43.689> use<00:04:43.810> one<00:04:43.840> that

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
another bead I'll just use one that

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.779 
another bead I'll just use one that
matched<00:04:44.259> the<00:04:44.439> first<00:04:44.650> bead<00:04:44.830> that<00:04:44.979> I<00:04:45.039> put<00:04:45.219> on<00:04:45.249> and

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
matched the first bead that I put on and

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.179 
matched the first bead that I put on and
then<00:04:46.479> you<00:04:46.569> want<00:04:46.749> to<00:04:46.840> grip<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.770> ends<00:04:48.069> of<00:04:48.129> the

00:04:48.179 --> 00:04:48.189 
then you want to grip the ends of the

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:52.230 
then you want to grip the ends of the
wire<00:04:48.370> with<00:04:48.789> a<00:04:49.050> needlenose<00:04:50.050> plier<00:04:50.529> and<00:04:51.240> just

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
wire with a needlenose plier and just

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.379 
wire with a needlenose plier and just
start<00:04:52.629> twisting<00:04:53.319> it<00:04:53.469> in<00:04:54.069> towards<00:04:54.879> the<00:04:54.939> center

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
start twisting it in towards the center

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.360 
start twisting it in towards the center
so<00:04:55.599> this<00:04:56.349> is<00:04:56.439> what's<00:04:56.620> gonna<00:04:56.710> hold<00:04:56.979> that<00:04:57.069> bead

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
so this is what's gonna hold that bead

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.980 
so this is what's gonna hold that bead
on<00:04:57.639> and<00:04:57.999> you<00:04:58.240> don't<00:04:58.330> want<00:04:58.509> it<00:04:58.569> too<00:04:58.719> tight

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
on and you don't want it too tight

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.510 
on and you don't want it too tight
because<00:04:59.020> you<00:04:59.349> want<00:04:59.650> that<00:04:59.710> bead<00:04:59.979> to<00:05:00.129> spin<00:05:00.400> you

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
because you want that bead to spin you

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.850
