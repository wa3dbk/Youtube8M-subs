2014 Fiesta is the same nimble package
that<00:02:20.010> we've<00:02:20.250> loved<00:02:20.490> for<00:02:20.760> quite<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.000> while<00:02:21.240> now

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
that we've loved for quite a while now

that we've loved for quite a while now
as<00:02:21.810> for<00:02:22.560> that<00:02:22.709> engine<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.520> certainly<00:02:24.180> is<00:02:24.540> a

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
as for that engine it certainly is a

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.350 
as for that engine it certainly is a
torque<00:02:25.410> II<00:02:25.560> feeling<00:02:26.220> it's<00:02:26.459> really<00:02:27.120> good

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
torque II feeling it's really good

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.050 
torque II feeling it's really good
especially<00:02:27.870> when<00:02:28.440> driving<00:02:28.830> up<00:02:29.280> on<00:02:29.459> hills<00:02:29.760> and

especially when driving up on hills and

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.520 
especially when driving up on hills and
that's<00:02:30.240> something<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.720> really<00:02:30.750> appreciate

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
that's something you really appreciate

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.320 
toss it around as for the new engine
well<00:02:45.810> it's<00:02:46.110> definitely<00:02:46.800> torquing<00:02:47.670> it's<00:02:47.850> great

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
well it's definitely torquing it's great

you up that even in some pretty high
gears<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:53.910> that's<00:02:54.330> something<00:02:54.600> unusual<00:02:55.350> in

really on the gas unfortunately you do

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.460 
really on the gas unfortunately you do
get<00:03:04.739> a<00:03:04.769> muted<00:03:05.519> version<00:03:06.090> of<00:03:06.269> that<00:03:06.480> growl<00:03:06.930> sound

almost all the time out of this car a

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.530 
almost all the time out of this car a
lot<00:03:10.320> like<00:03:10.709> a<00:03:10.950> diesel<00:03:11.280> engine<00:03:11.880> and<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.360> gets

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
lot like a diesel engine and it gets

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.830 
lot like a diesel engine and it gets
pretty<00:03:12.840> tiring<00:03:13.290> for<00:03:13.739> a<00:03:13.800> long<00:03:14.130> commute<00:03:14.840> along

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
pretty tiring for a long commute along

also<00:03:20.570> surprisingly<00:03:21.570> smooth<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:22.620> that's<00:03:23.100> only

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
also surprisingly smooth and that's only

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.449 
also surprisingly smooth and that's only
partially<00:03:24.750> true<00:03:24.780> if<00:03:25.530> you're<00:03:25.860> just<00:03:26.130> driving

feel it all the way through the car I do

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.770 
feel it all the way through the car I do
not<00:03:50.040> normally<00:03:50.519> complain<00:03:51.120> about<00:03:51.299> getting<00:03:51.690> a
