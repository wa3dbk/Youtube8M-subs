00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
here to here a lot more wall here so

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.789 
here to here a lot more wall here so
each<00:03:05.670> side<00:03:05.940> is<00:03:05.970> weight<00:03:06.360> fair<00:03:06.569> inside<00:03:06.930> okay<00:03:07.620> on

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
each side is weight fair inside okay on

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.530 
each side is weight fair inside okay on
this<00:03:08.040> particular<00:03:08.430> horse<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.299> weight-bearing

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
this particular horse the weight-bearing

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.039 
this particular horse the weight-bearing
who<00:03:10.200> shift<00:03:10.560> into<00:03:10.950> his<00:03:11.099> the<00:03:11.549> opposite<00:03:12.090> side<00:03:12.330> but

he's flaring right here so this is your

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.300 
he's flaring right here so this is your
weight-bearing<00:03:15.390> he<00:03:15.930> ok<00:03:16.290> so<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.920> way<00:03:17.099> he's

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
weight-bearing he ok so the way he's

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.690 
weight-bearing he ok so the way he's
walking<00:03:17.340> you<00:03:18.329> can<00:03:18.569> see<00:03:18.810> he's<00:03:19.019> glaring<00:03:19.319> here<00:03:20.010> so

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.000 
walking you can see he's glaring here so
he's<00:03:20.940> breaking<00:03:21.480> right<00:03:21.840> here<00:03:22.140> see<00:03:22.590> this<00:03:22.799> is

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
he's breaking right here see this is

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.699 
he's breaking right here see this is
thinner<00:03:23.340> here<00:03:24.109> ok<00:03:25.109> so<00:03:25.170> he's<00:03:25.500> actually

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
from just about the fourth nail right Oh

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.059 
from just about the fourth nail right Oh
what<00:03:35.910> bus<00:03:36.150> do<00:03:36.329> i<00:03:36.359> think<00:03:36.690> that<00:03:36.930> is<00:03:37.109> they<00:03:37.349> do<00:03:37.530> how

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
what bus do i think that is they do how

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.430 
what bus do i think that is they do how
wide<00:03:38.400> it<00:03:38.700> is<00:03:38.730> this<00:03:39.209> is<00:03:39.329> good<00:03:39.510> flare<00:03:39.870> right<00:03:40.230> here

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
wide it is this is good flare right here

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.470 
wide it is this is good flare right here
so<00:03:41.040> this<00:03:41.190> is<00:03:41.400> our<00:03:41.549> weight<00:03:41.760> bearing<00:03:42.030> surface

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
so this is our weight bearing surface

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.020 
so this is our weight bearing surface
and<00:03:42.780> it's<00:03:42.989> getting<00:03:43.170> straight<00:03:43.650> up<00:03:43.859> here<00:03:44.190> but

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
and it's getting straight up here but

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.210 
and it's getting straight up here but
yet<00:03:45.239> he's<00:03:45.450> breaking<00:03:46.049> wrong<00:03:46.530> or<00:03:46.799> either<00:03:47.069> the

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
yet he's breaking wrong or either the

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.640 
yet he's breaking wrong or either the
last<00:03:47.549> time<00:03:47.790> to<00:03:47.910> trim<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.269> trim<00:03:48.569> to<00:03:48.750> rock<00:03:48.930> so

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
last time to trim the trim to rock so
