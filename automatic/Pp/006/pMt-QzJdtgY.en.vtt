00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.509
 basil important parents 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.370
 there are well over 60 pages of 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.630
 basilica here we have the classic 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.250
 basil genovese basil itself is 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.939
 so a bit the diva under the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.670
 plants 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.260
 she does not have too much water at all 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.199
 little water does not like the 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.420
 drafts but has money sun at all 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.739
 very strong sun makes them very much 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:38.520
 often limp and moody I would have 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.149
 Now how to know that everyone 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.149
 this route 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.260
 grown from a single seed 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:51.100
 that is, I cut this one 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:55.329
 stemmeler does not grow anymore 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:58.670
 what does this mean for the heritage? 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.620
 only harvest preferably over one 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.159
 plate 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:06.500
 You can see that very well here, that's one 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.259
 so-called flat axel there are big ones 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.070
 leaves and here come little baby 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:15.950
 leaves out is to get the where 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.679
 basil continues to grow again that is 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.800
 always reap over such a place axis 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:25.690
 never under the last place axel with it 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:29.990
 basil plant can continue to grow 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:33.920
 clip the tip off the plant 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:37.390
 like bushy ie ideally earthy 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.800
 basil always first from the top 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.319
 then always over a blade axis 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.780
 located 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:46.520
 a single confusion of the 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.200
 leaves bring very little and 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.929
 worst case, the plant can even 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.880
 no longer grow 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.860
 since she can have the plate axel more and 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.619
 for example, harvested from below 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.099
 has and then reaped above and thus sooner 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:03.170
 awkward the whole trunk carl is like that 

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:07.399
 kampa victory to grow up and down 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.830
 wide grow and prosper and one has 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:13.010
 also for several weeks for months 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:17.420
 fresh during the warm summer months 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.459
 basil of urban data more practice 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.160
