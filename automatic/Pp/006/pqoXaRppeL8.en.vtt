00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.560
 hello everyone how have you been waiting for 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.259
 they have gone well to absolutely all 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:24.029
 today I bring you a video tutorial of how 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:26.980
 know what video card they use first 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:32.220
 we are going to start 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:35.910
 here we write of x day 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:40.400
 or for those who have windows xp here 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.400
 they keep something from running they save 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.510
 and you can also find it 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:50.440
 and they write of X days 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.440
 they give accept 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:59.880
 and as you see they start to load a 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.880
 Direct x diagnostic window 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.460
 on the tabs to the top 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:11.130
 let's click on screen 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:17.409
 and this is the name of your card 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:20.819
 video that is ati radeon hd 3200 graphic 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:25.720
 it's mine you do not know maybe it appears 

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:31.390
 intel or I do not know and this is the 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:33.580
 total memory that they still have in their 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.960
 Graphic card 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.130
 this is the acceleration of direct grau 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.270
 but they are characteristics of 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:47.320
 character 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.320
 that in itself of rectorado and direct city 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:54.290
 almost the same because they already come together 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.600
 starting from direct x 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.730
 and 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.650
 well there are my pets barking 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:06.810
 and good if I told you that this is coming 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:09.570
 together from the vertex 7 so 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.040
 it would be almost the same good I hope that you 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.569
 have liked this tutorial and if you 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:17.569
 it served like 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.819
 Give light 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.819
 good and next
