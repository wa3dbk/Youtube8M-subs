confident right now you know physically

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.729 
confident right now you know physically
in<00:00:49.160> the<00:00:49.460> spring<00:00:49.760> is<00:00:50.030> his<00:00:50.780> problems<00:00:51.260> all<00:00:51.469> stem

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
in the spring is his problems all stem

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.319 
in the spring is his problems all stem
from<00:00:51.769> his<00:00:52.129> from<00:00:52.399> his<00:00:52.430> footwork<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.030> he's<00:00:53.179> done

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
from his from his footwork and he's done

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:54.790 
from his from his footwork and he's done
a<00:00:53.359> really<00:00:53.570> good<00:00:53.750> job<00:00:53.809> over<00:00:54.230> the<00:00:54.350> break<00:00:54.559> of

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
a really good job over the break of

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.770 
a really good job over the break of
trying<00:00:55.579> to<00:00:55.730> break<00:00:55.910> some<00:00:56.120> bad<00:00:56.239> habits<00:00:56.480> and

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
trying to break some bad habits and

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.000 
trying to break some bad habits and
those<00:00:56.960> still<00:00:57.140> show<00:00:57.350> up<00:00:57.379> every<00:00:57.710> now<00:00:57.829> and<00:00:57.980> again

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
those still show up every now and again

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.790 
those still show up every now and again
but<00:00:58.219> I<00:00:58.940> think<00:00:59.539> he's<00:00:59.690> a<00:00:59.719> lot<00:01:00.019> more<00:01:00.050> mentally

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
but I think he's a lot more mentally

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.079 
but I think he's a lot more mentally
confident<00:01:01.399> and<00:01:01.489> you<00:01:01.550> can<00:01:01.730> see<00:01:01.910> a<00:01:01.940> little

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
confident and you can see a little

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.930 
confident and you can see a little
bounce<00:01:02.300> in<00:01:02.539> his<00:01:02.690> step<00:01:02.719> and<00:01:03.220> he<00:01:04.220> certainly<00:01:04.640> got

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
bounce in his step and he certainly got

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.150 
bounce in his step and he certainly got
to<00:01:05.089> still<00:01:05.300> got<00:01:05.420> a<00:01:05.449> long<00:01:05.570> ways<00:01:05.780> to<00:01:05.930> go<00:01:05.960> but<00:01:06.440> you

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160

I think bid when we came out I'd say
it's<00:02:01.229> comparable<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.920> probably<00:02:02.460> like<00:02:02.640> the

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
it's comparable to probably like the

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.810 
it's comparable to probably like the
10th<00:02:03.030> or<00:02:03.210> 11th<00:02:03.600> day<00:02:03.720> of<00:02:03.750> practice<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.820> spring

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820
