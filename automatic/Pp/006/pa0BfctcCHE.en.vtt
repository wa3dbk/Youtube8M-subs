00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:20.609
 Hi, we are removing another unpacking 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:26.730
 Today came the package wrapper in her column 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.689
 what is there for $ 6 and column 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.329
 order for the first time 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:42.809
 I wonder what kind of us. per unit 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:49.530
 senge penalty opens something somehow 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:51.570
 here see micro mini speakers for 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:57.989
 expected more though the size of the site 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:59.059
 indicated micro sd tf yusb bfm digital 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.439
 speaker 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:08.180
 etc. in 26 black color even reached 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:16.040
 okay, I didn't crack the scatter 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:16.040
 let's open to look it still 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.400
 column 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:28.500
 so here it is column 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:35.750
 here we still have to think 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.750
 the tip is a separate box in a box 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:50.590
 cable boxes are such a cable with 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:54.340
 one side and the other side of usb and 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:02:01.539
 this jack is three layers 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:09.140
 so but you have to look like a man like a column 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:18.440
 so the voltage should be 5 volts izb as 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:22.930
 metal column scratched here 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.930
 on emblem let them still for viewing 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:36.080
 protection no coats yes see 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.080
 there is plenochka include 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.590
 sang for 1 column 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:04.140
 the speakers sang the bottom blinked different 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:08.520
 diodes well, cool thing but this 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:15.140
 Prepared card must be inserted 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:15.140
 try immediately discovered 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:30.700
 sushi but she plays pretty zealously 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:34.320
 loud cool thing i will order myself on 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.320
 work necessarily carries such 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.599
 basik so it 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:44.970
 column really doesnâ€™t cool 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:48.560
 I expected such a little thing like that 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:54.360
 interesting sound is even nothing 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:59.040
 unit purchase unit can call 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:01.590
 A good link will be in the description than you 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.959
 reviews say this thing does 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.519
 no sense no can be given by 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.810
 functions than we see here yes that is 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.390
 let's get around right away 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:15.150
 go over the top antenna for and from 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:23.250
 receiver on the left side of the audio input 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:27.660
 audio output 5 mini usb and slot for micro 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:29.850
 sd card from the back speaker from the right side 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:36.120
 and Uzbek input-output 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:41.820
 and the front of the screen and control buttons 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.240
 i.e. play pause menu stop rewind 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.979
 backwards 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:50.400
 fast forward free minus valim + 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:56.370
 volume easy plus works when 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:05:01.919
 holding the restraint that is running and went 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:03.620
 volume decreases menu menu this 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:08.490
 the choice 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:14.000
 line here all right all bye
