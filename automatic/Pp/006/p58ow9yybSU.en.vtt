00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.699 
is somewhat soft and wavy but I'm just
trying<00:03:34.910> to<00:03:35.000> see<00:03:35.330> how<00:03:35.660> it<00:03:35.840> works<00:03:36.110> because<00:03:36.680> I

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
trying to see how it works because I

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.630 
trying to see how it works because I
mean<00:03:37.959> as<00:03:38.959> long<00:03:39.470> as<00:03:39.560> I<00:03:39.739> can<00:03:39.799> remember<00:03:39.980> I've

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
mean as long as I can remember I've

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.600
