00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
because that's just the way our life is

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.660 
because that's just the way our life is
you<00:01:26.560> know<00:01:26.680> and<00:01:26.799> that's<00:01:26.979> how<00:01:27.130> I've<00:01:27.520> always

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
you know and that's how I've always

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.080 
you know and that's how I've always
liked<00:01:28.060> for<00:01:28.330> it<00:01:28.420> to<00:01:28.630> be<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:30.640> course<00:01:30.970> I'm

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
liked for it to be of course I'm

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.120 
liked for it to be of course I'm
emotionally<00:01:31.600> attached<00:01:31.930> to<00:01:32.320> my<00:01:32.500> friends<00:01:32.890> but<00:01:33.100> I

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
emotionally attached to my friends but I

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.169 
emotionally attached to my friends but I
also<00:01:33.340> think<00:01:33.640> that<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:36.280> can't<00:01:36.550> get<00:01:36.700> so

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
also think that you can't get so

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.040 
also think that you can't get so
attached<00:01:37.690> to<00:01:37.720> also<00:01:38.140> to<00:01:38.320> it<00:01:38.470> that<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:40.720> need<00:01:40.869> to

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
attached to also to it that you need to

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.840 
attached to also to it that you need to
basically<00:01:41.259> I<00:01:41.560> think<00:01:42.130> you<00:01:42.220> need<00:01:42.369> to<00:01:42.399> have<00:01:42.700> an

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
basically I think you need to have an

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.340 
basically I think you need to have an
objective<00:01:43.800> way<00:01:44.800> of<00:01:44.979> viewing<00:01:45.390> your<00:01:46.390> films<00:01:46.780> and

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.559 

because<00:01:50.350> what<00:01:51.220> can<00:01:51.429> happen<00:01:51.670> then<00:01:52.060> is<00:01:52.240> you<00:01:52.360> can

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569 
because what can happen then is you can

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:55.320 
because what can happen then is you can
get<00:01:52.750> carried<00:01:53.110> away<00:01:53.200> by<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.560> success<00:01:54.100> or<00:01:54.670> you

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
get carried away by the success or you

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.410 
get carried away by the success or you
can<00:01:55.509> be<00:01:55.659> completing<00:01:56.259> it<00:01:59.490> so<00:02:00.490> I<00:02:00.550> think<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:01.149> I

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
can be completing it so I think the I

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.840 
can be completing it so I think the I
think<00:02:01.569> once<00:02:01.960> that<00:02:02.050> film<00:02:02.409> is<00:02:02.590> done<00:02:02.800> and<00:02:03.610> once

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
think once that film is done and once

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.730 
think once that film is done and once
the<00:02:04.000> program<00:02:04.119> today<00:02:04.720> is<00:02:04.840> for<00:02:05.110> timing<00:02:05.409> one<00:02:05.590> day

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
the program today is for timing one day

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.859 
the program today is for timing one day
before<00:02:05.920> it<00:02:06.159> is<00:02:06.399> wrapped<00:02:06.820> right<00:02:07.060> now<00:02:07.390> is<00:02:07.689> who

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
before it is wrapped right now is who

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.300 
before it is wrapped right now is who
