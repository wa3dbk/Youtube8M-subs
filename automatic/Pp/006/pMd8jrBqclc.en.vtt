00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
the fort which I don't think they'll be

the fort which I don't think they'll be
able<00:03:05.270> to<00:03:05.510> do<00:03:05.810> because<00:03:06.230> all<00:03:06.560> they<00:03:06.739> have<00:03:06.860> with

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
able to do because all they have with

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:22.430 
able to do because all they have with
assault<00:03:07.310> rifles<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.270> other<00:03:08.450> guys

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
now as you can see cell are kind of

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.620 
now as you can see cell are kind of
dropping<00:03:25.050> like<00:03:25.140> flies<00:03:26.150> because<00:03:27.150> they've<00:03:27.390> very

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
dropping like flies because they've very

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.400

limited<00:03:28.050> amount<00:03:28.320> of<00:03:28.350> space<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.590> go<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:30.410> these

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
limited amount of space to go and these

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.340 
limited amount of space to go and these
