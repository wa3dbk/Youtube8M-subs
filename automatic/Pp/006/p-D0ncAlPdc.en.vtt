00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.799
 Hello friends and Andrei Nightingales 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.580
 device which will be discussed today 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:21.250
 was announced already good back in February 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.440
 2012 on mobile in congress and since 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.900
 so far he has only 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.700
 Fourth competitor is a new ipad 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.180
 google nexus 10 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:33.940
 asus and acer 700 series why yes because 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.480
 that only these five 10-inch 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.640
 tablets 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.030
 equipped with matrices with full resolution 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.760
 hd and above with huawei media pad fhd 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.860
 10 of the most democratic of them for the price and 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.710
 we will now try to figure out what was 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.020
 brought it sacrifice first of all it 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.010
 screen as i said huawei mediapad 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:57.640
 one of the few tablets on the market 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.190
 the resolution is even greater than this 1920 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.030
 points horizontally and 1200 points along 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.219
 vertical 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.499
 Well, since a device with such 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:08.619
 the display gets into a certain elite club 

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:09.270
 select table compare it has 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.920
 meaning 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.999
 with almost an unofficial benchmark and 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.420
 exactly 

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:17.579
 third generation apple ipad equipped 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.950
 retina matrices 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:25.029
 for starters we compare the brightness of both 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.579
 displays and maximum viewing angles i 

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:28.149
 I go to the same site of this site won 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:30.310
 bass 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:34.359
 here I choose for example this one 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.869
 I download the picture here and here and save 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:40.719
 as default and both pictures 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.729
 loaded and displayed in order 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:44.560
 to be completely objective I take off 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.049
 second film from our 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:53.960
 lava and now i'm ready to make 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:56.360
 own opinion and so actually two 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.170
 devices are very very close by 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:03.110
 color rendering seems to me that 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:06.979
 Contrast ipads slightly higher when 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:10.039
 the same picture the picture of the ear and you 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:13.040
 and a little softer at maximum 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.980
 brightness turns out that the same bee 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.870
 u on ipad looks like something more 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:23.750
 juicy but for detail put by detail 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.330
 lint on abdomen and on paws 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.390
 absolutely identical that is possible 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.730
 say that these matrices are different 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.769
 only with detailed comparison if 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.630
 not peering very intently and not 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.030
 look from one screen to 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.430
 other current quality of these matrices 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.860
 almost identical as for 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.340
 viewing angles here you are also big 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.739
 account 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.140
 not much difference the picture is not bad 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.470
 read both horizontally and 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.609
 vertical and in fact it means that 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.570
 what's the matrix 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:58.970
 Warwick at least as good Well with 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.359
 this is all clear now turn 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.340
 layout design and build quality but 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.500
 the first thing you want to note back 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.079
 device almost without a backdrop 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.870
 made of aluminum top 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:14.600
 the body is made of plastic under it 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.940
 versions equipped with a 3g module hiding 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.640
 antenna what's interesting is the design of the back 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.239
 covers in versions equipped with a 3g module and 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.380
 without him is exactly the same and found out 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.989
 does your device support 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.480
 installation of sim cards can be discarded this 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.850
 top cap on the end 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.769
 under it is a slot for installation 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.660
 micro sd cards 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.810
 and the second slot in this case we have 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.420
 empty, that is, if our version 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.120
 supported 3g sim card installation 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.489
 there would be a corresponding inscription except 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.829
 this along the edges of the back panel under the grids 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.680
 there are two stereo speakers on top 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:53.750
 among them is the peephole of the main camera she 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.150
 has a resolution of 8 megapixels 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.310
 has autofocus function can shoot 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.620
 video in full hd about what here 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.280
 proudly written besides this there is 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.140
 also 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.930
 LED flash at the top 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.540
 microphone is located directly opposite 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.750
 the main camera is located frontally 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.239
 and having 13 megapixel resolution 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.630
 on the bottom of the device are located 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.940
 two holes for installation guides 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.340
 for the docking station and the connector for 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.930
 dock installation by the way by itself 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.690
 the device is charged by 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.550
 special cable that goes to 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.880
 bundled and looks pretty much the same 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.760
 like 30 pin connector from ipad 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.140
 by the way in the box itself except the cable 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.720
 You can find just simply 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.330
 compact charger and 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.659
 instruction manual nothing more 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.940
 its younger model huawei does not invest 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:48.979
 and in our case I will remind you 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.470
 the youngest model with internal volume 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:53.419
 Memory is only 8 gigabytes and 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.120
 equip a module 3g 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:58.430
 Well, let's go to stuffing it here 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.430
 first really serious surprise 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.849
 The fact is that huawei media pad fhd 10 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.740
 equipped with a quad-core processor 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:09.380
 own production this processor 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.659
 called high silicone to 3 B2 and 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.570
 operates at a frequency of 1 and 2 gigahertz 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:16.789
 paris graphic system and you pi ji 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.810
 si 4 thousand too own 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:20.419
 production huavei 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.080
 and this is truly a dark horse like her 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.630
 manifest itself 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.430
 especially on this screen resolution i 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.760
 I can not even predict and 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.450
 I suggest to look at it on tests 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.240
 the first test will be 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.229
 antutu and while it passes I can say 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.360
 what's with the point 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:38.090
 I did not see the brake interface 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.550
 scrolls everything just enough yes 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.370
 Now, by the way, the device works on the version 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.830
 android 4 0 3 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.900
 is it supposed to upgrade 411 or 412 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.760
 yet incomprehensible well most likely she did 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.680
 will take place 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.440
 usually in such cases as long as the test goes I 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.430
 I put some such virtual bets on 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.440
 those numbers that we get in the end 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.270
 we are in this case the number of these 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.340
 most parrots will not be good news 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.510
 what a great somewhere in the thousands 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.610
 probably at 8 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:09.220
 whether it is true or not we will literally find out 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:12.310
 after a few seconds well 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:15.940
 see breathe it seems I was wrong and 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.890
 wrong in such a good way I underestimated 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.070
 device capabilities turns out to be all 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:23.170
 not so bad almost 12 thousand 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:25.180
 parrots in antutu it is very 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:27.730
 decent figure at the level too 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.590
 most 3 games on the chart 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:32.020
 performance our device 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:34.330
 hit right between samsung galaxy 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.110
 first generation and asus transformer 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.150
 prime 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.790
 equipped not the most sour and the most 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:42.310
 weak and nvidia tegra 3 working on 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:45.040
 much higher clock speed 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.050
 As for multitouch, q is also all 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.690
 interesting enough device 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:52.090
 supports 10 simultaneous keystrokes 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:54.160
 Well, I think that this is enough and 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:56.800
 we smoothly move to conclusions and they 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.840
 will be next in the budget 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.060
 huawei media pad fhd 10 was not 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.610
 so budgetary in the bad sense of it 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:06.210
 words at about a quarter price 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.810
 better than the nearest competitor and 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.090
 shows decent 

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:13.150
 performance own processor 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:15.190
 allowed fame quite seriously to reduce 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:17.320
 production cost and how 

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:19.360
 consequence of the price of the tablet itself 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.640
 although it is close in performance 

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.950
 approached in to the main competitors 

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.590
 more about the pros and cons of this 

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.100
 devices for example appreciating 13 thousand 

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.110
 rubles 

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.100
 I will tell in the bonus tracks shot here on 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.170
 this camera 

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.630
 I want to thank you for the fact that 

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:36.490
 See Mobile IMHO about the company humor 

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:39.190
 thanks for providing melting 

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:41.910
 ideapad and this open studio of all 

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:41.910
 good bye
