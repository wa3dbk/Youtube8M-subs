00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.039 

this<00:00:02.370> time<00:00:02.639> I'm<00:00:02.970> going<00:00:03.149> to<00:00:03.210> make<00:00:03.389> a<00:00:03.419> simple

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
this time I'm going to make a simple

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.480 
this time I'm going to make a simple
wooden<00:00:04.650> contour<00:00:05.339> gauge<00:00:06.500> in<00:00:07.500> case<00:00:08.010> you<00:00:08.189> didn't

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
wooden contour gauge in case you didn't

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.850 
wooden contour gauge in case you didn't
know<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.910> contour<00:00:09.480> gauge<00:00:09.750> is<00:00:10.050> made<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.620> measure

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
know a contour gauge is made to measure

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.950 
know a contour gauge is made to measure
and<00:00:11.400> replicate<00:00:12.269> complicated<00:00:13.110> parts<00:00:14.960> first

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
and replicate complicated parts first

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.450 
and replicate complicated parts first
thing<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.139> did<00:00:16.199> was<00:00:16.410> go<00:00:16.619> over<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.859> my<00:00:16.980> wood<00:00:17.190> rack

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
thing I did was go over to my wood rack

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.370 
thing I did was go over to my wood rack
and<00:00:17.760> picked<00:00:18.060> out<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.240> couple<00:00:18.690> of<00:00:18.869> pieces<00:00:19.140> of

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
and picked out a couple of pieces of

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.450 
and picked out a couple of pieces of
maple<00:00:22.010> then<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.039> had<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:24.000> sand<00:00:24.720> those<00:00:25.529> so<00:00:26.430> that

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
maple then I had to sand those so that

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.560 
maple then I had to sand those so that
they<00:00:27.029> are<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.930> little<00:00:28.320> bit<00:00:28.820> convex<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.359> means

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
they are a little bit convex that means

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.330 
they are a little bit convex that means
that<00:00:30.779> they're<00:00:30.960> curved<00:00:31.260> outwards<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.160> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
that they're curved outwards in the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.700 
that they're curved outwards in the
middle<00:00:35.510> now<00:00:36.510> these<00:00:36.690> don't<00:00:36.930> have<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.140> be<00:00:37.230> sanded

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
middle now these don't have to be sanded

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.500 
middle now these don't have to be sanded
very<00:00:37.890> much<00:00:38.129> they<00:00:38.399> just<00:00:38.640> have<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.940> be<00:00:39.059> slightly

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
very much they just have to be slightly

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.970 
very much they just have to be slightly
open<00:00:39.840> on<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.110> end<00:00:40.260> when<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.590> hold<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.950> other

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
open on the end when you hold the other

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.299 
open on the end when you hold the other
end<00:00:41.219> close<00:00:41.809> that<00:00:42.809> way<00:00:42.989> when<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.379> both<00:00:43.590> ends

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
end close that way when the both ends

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.670 
end close that way when the both ends
are<00:00:44.489> clamped<00:00:45.360> together<00:00:45.450> there's<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.350> little

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
are clamped together there's a little

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.560 
are clamped together there's a little
bit<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.890> pressure<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.460> center<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:48.420> hold

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
bit of pressure in the center to hold

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.779 
bit of pressure in the center to hold
the<00:00:48.780> strips<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.170> place<00:00:49.410> now<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.340> size<00:00:50.610> of

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
the strips in place now the size of

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.270 
the strips in place now the size of
these<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.180> kind<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.600> arbitrary<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:53.010> doesn't

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
these is kind of arbitrary it doesn't

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.869 
these is kind of arbitrary it doesn't
have<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.520> be<00:00:53.610> any<00:00:53.870> particular<00:00:54.870> length<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.879> just

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
have to be any particular length I just

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.580 
have to be any particular length I just
picked<00:00:57.149> what<00:00:57.329> was<00:00:57.480> on<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.690> Shelf<00:00:57.960> cut<00:00:58.410> them

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
picked what was on the Shelf cut them

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.840 
picked what was on the Shelf cut them
both<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.100> same<00:00:59.370> length<00:00:59.699> they<00:01:00.539> are<00:01:00.930> about

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
both of the same length they are about

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.429 
both of the same length they are about
5/8<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.969> an<00:01:03.090> inch<00:01:03.180> thick<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.780> they're<00:01:04.019> inch

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
5/8 of an inch thick and they're inch

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.890 
5/8 of an inch thick and they're inch
and<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> half<00:01:04.710> wide<00:01:05.100> these<00:01:06.090> particular<00:01:06.450> pieces

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
and a half wide these particular pieces

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.130 
and a half wide these particular pieces
have<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> chamfer<00:01:08.189> on<00:01:08.580> each<00:01:08.820> corner<00:01:09.150> because

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
have a chamfer on each corner because

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.630 
have a chamfer on each corner because
that's<00:01:10.650> what<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:10.950> cut<00:01:11.220> them<00:01:11.340> from<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:13.640> nothing

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
that's what I cut them from and nothing

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.190 
that's what I cut them from and nothing
else<00:01:14.790> really<00:01:15.030> needs<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.479> be<00:01:15.600> done<00:01:15.780> with<00:01:16.020> these

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
else really needs to be done with these

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.649 
else really needs to be done with these
before<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:17.100> couple<00:01:17.759> holes<00:01:17.939> are<00:01:18.180> drilled<00:01:18.330> in

before a couple holes are drilled in
each<00:01:18.900> end<00:01:21.650> I'm<00:01:22.650> just<00:01:22.890> going<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.100> take<00:01:23.250> these

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
each end I'm just going to take these

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.940 
each end I'm just going to take these
screws<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.790> grind<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.450> sides<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.960> head<00:01:25.170> I

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.410 

need<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.040> do<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.610> can<00:01:29.820> drive<00:01:30.000> them<00:01:30.270> into

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
need to do this so I can drive them into

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.260 
need to do this so I can drive them into
the<00:01:30.659> wood<00:01:34.400> now<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.430> got<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.729> cut<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.909> bunch<00:01:36.119> of

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
the wood now I got to cut a bunch of

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.850 
the wood now I got to cut a bunch of
thin<00:01:36.450> strips<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.079> I'm<00:01:37.380> going<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.590> be<00:01:37.680> cutting

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
thin strips and I'm going to be cutting

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.069 
thin strips and I'm going to be cutting
those<00:01:38.100> from<00:01:38.400> just<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.060> piece<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.420> two<00:01:39.600> by<00:01:39.630> ten

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
those from just a piece of two by ten

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.649 
those from just a piece of two by ten
that<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.409> cut<00:01:40.740> down<00:01:41.090> this<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.299> actually

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
that I cut down this is actually

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.889 
that I cut down this is actually
leftover<00:01:43.290> from<00:01:43.680> making<00:01:44.159> legs<00:01:44.460> for<00:01:45.270> my<00:01:45.479> planer

leftover from making legs for my planer

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.590 
leftover from making legs for my planer
stand<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.590> was<00:01:47.490> going<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.700> set<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:47.970> off<00:01:48.180> for

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
stand I was going to set this off for

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.859 
stand I was going to set this off for
half-inch<00:01:50.329> raise<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.509> blade<00:01:53.149> and<00:01:54.149> cut<00:01:54.720> off<00:01:54.840> a

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
half-inch raise the blade and cut off a

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:08.730 
half-inch raise the blade and cut off a
few<00:01:55.170> pieces

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.950 

and<00:02:09.460> it<00:02:09.550> comes<00:02:09.670> time<00:02:09.910> to<00:02:10.060> cut<00:02:10.240> the<00:02:10.360> thin<00:02:10.570> strips

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
and it comes time to cut the thin strips

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.470 
and it comes time to cut the thin strips
there's<00:02:11.320> a<00:02:11.410> couple<00:02:11.620> ways<00:02:11.770> you<00:02:12.070> can<00:02:12.220> do<00:02:12.370> it<00:02:12.580> this

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
there's a couple ways you can do it this

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.070 
there's a couple ways you can do it this
way<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:14.110> don't<00:02:14.260> recommend<00:02:14.740> a<00:02:15.510> better<00:02:16.510> way<00:02:16.720> is<00:02:16.930> to

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
way I don't recommend a better way is to

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.870 
way I don't recommend a better way is to
set<00:02:17.290> up<00:02:17.440> what's<00:02:17.680> known<00:02:17.920> as<00:02:18.160> a<00:02:18.190> thin<00:02:18.550> wrist

just<00:02:25.030> got<00:02:25.210> to<00:02:25.330> put<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.540> strip<00:02:25.780> in<00:02:26.050> and<00:02:26.380> then

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
just got to put the strip in and then

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.800 
just got to put the strip in and then
move<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.070> fence<00:02:27.310> over<00:02:27.880> until<00:02:28.300> it<00:02:28.480> just

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
move the fence over until it just

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.670 
move the fence over until it just
touches<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:31.240> piece<00:02:31.510> here<00:02:31.900> and<00:02:32.080> that<00:02:32.320> gives

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
touches the piece here and that gives

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:40.580 
touches the piece here and that gives
you<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:32.980> exact<00:02:33.400> width<00:02:33.700> that<00:02:33.940> you<00:02:34.030> need<00:02:34.180> to<00:02:34.270> cut

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.960 

and<00:02:41.590> then<00:02:41.860> we<00:02:41.890> need<00:02:42.100> down<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.430> a<00:02:42.460> piece<00:02:42.700> that's

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
and then we need down to a piece that's

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.640 
and then we need down to a piece that's
too<00:02:43.270> narrow<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.840> go<00:02:43.990> through<00:02:44.380> there

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
too narrow to go through there

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.740 
too narrow to go through there
comfortably<00:02:45.400> so<00:02:46.090> you're<00:02:46.240> not<00:02:46.330> cutting<00:02:46.570> up

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
comfortably so you're not cutting up

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.530 
comfortably so you're not cutting up
your<00:02:46.780> push<00:02:47.080> stick<00:02:47.350> throw<00:02:48.130> it<00:02:48.250> away<00:02:48.390> it's<00:02:49.390> easy

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
your push stick throw it away it's easy

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.540 
your push stick throw it away it's easy
or<00:02:50.320> you<00:02:50.500> can<00:02:50.560> just<00:02:50.860> put<00:02:51.070> them<00:02:51.160> back<00:02:51.190> on<00:02:51.340> the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
or you can just put them back on the

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.710 
or you can just put them back on the
shelf<00:02:51.880> for<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.150> next<00:02:52.420> project<00:02:54.210> okay<00:02:55.210> so<00:02:55.270> I<00:02:55.420> got

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
shelf for the next project okay so I got

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.330 
shelf for the next project okay so I got
all<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.110> strip's<00:02:56.470> cut<00:02:56.830> to<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.160> right

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
all the strip's cut to the right

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.580 
all the strip's cut to the right
thickness<00:02:57.640> all<00:02:58.180> I<00:02:58.240> need<00:02:58.570> to<00:02:58.780> do<00:02:58.930> now<00:02:59.140> is<00:02:59.350> cut

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
thickness all I need to do now is cut

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.660 
thickness all I need to do now is cut
them<00:02:59.740> to<00:02:59.890> the<00:03:00.010> right<00:03:00.130> length

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
them to the right length

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.930 
them to the right length
hopefully<00:03:01.510> I've<00:03:01.780> cut<00:03:02.020> more<00:03:02.380> than<00:03:02.680> I<00:03:02.710> need<00:03:03.130> cut

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
hopefully I've cut more than I need cut

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.340 
hopefully I've cut more than I need cut
the<00:03:04.060> strips<00:03:04.300> to<00:03:04.390> length<00:03:04.660> I've<00:03:04.840> set<00:03:05.050> up<00:03:05.080> my

you<00:04:38.570> want<00:04:39.080> to<00:04:39.230> get<00:04:39.380> in<00:04:39.590> as<00:04:39.800> many<00:04:40.070> as<00:04:40.310> you

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
you want to get in as many as you

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.350 
you want to get in as many as you
possibly<00:04:40.880> can<00:04:42.640> that's<00:04:43.640> why<00:04:43.880> it's<00:04:44.060> a<00:04:44.150> good<00:04:44.300> idea

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
possibly can that's why it's a good idea

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.740 
possibly can that's why it's a good idea
to<00:04:44.900> have<00:04:45.050> a<00:04:45.080> few<00:04:45.410> extra<00:04:45.470> I<00:04:46.340> think<00:04:47.330> it'll<00:04:47.450> go

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
to have a few extra I think it'll go

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.650 
to have a few extra I think it'll go
it'll<00:04:48.260> take<00:04:48.590> one<00:04:48.950> more<00:04:51.430> that's<00:04:52.430> it<00:04:52.700> I<00:04:53.000> should

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
it'll take one more that's it I should

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.810 
it'll take one more that's it I should
that<00:04:53.900> should<00:04:53.930> work<00:04:54.260> fine<00:04:54.470> now<00:04:55.460> it's<00:04:55.580> just<00:04:55.669> to

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
that should work fine now it's just to

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.290 
that should work fine now it's just to
take<00:04:55.970> the<00:04:56.150> other<00:04:56.300> side<00:04:56.710> put<00:04:57.710> it<00:04:57.860> on<00:04:57.980> top

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
take the other side put it on top

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.140 
take the other side put it on top
actually<00:04:59.300> I<00:04:59.330> have<00:04:59.480> it<00:04:59.630> backwards<00:05:00.080> I<00:05:00.230> think

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
actually I have it backwards I think

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.230 
actually I have it backwards I think
screw<00:05:02.150> holes<00:05:02.360> line<00:05:02.690> up<00:05:02.720> a<00:05:02.900> bit<00:05:03.230> better<00:05:04.210> no<00:05:05.210> I

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
screw holes line up a bit better no I

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.690 
screw holes line up a bit better no I
had<00:05:05.600> to<00:05:05.690> right<00:05:05.870> the<00:05:06.020> first<00:05:06.200> time<00:05:08.290> that<00:05:09.290> in<00:05:09.700> then

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
had to right the first time that in then

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.390 
had to right the first time that in then
I've<00:05:10.820> got<00:05:10.970> a<00:05:11.000> couple<00:05:11.210> of<00:05:11.390> small<00:05:11.540> washers<00:05:13.120> and

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
I've got a couple of small washers and

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.080 
I've got a couple of small washers and
some<00:05:16.400> 3/16<00:05:17.300> wing<00:05:17.570> nuts<00:05:18.520> now<00:05:19.520> with<00:05:19.760> it<00:05:19.910> together

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
some 3/16 wing nuts now with it together

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.270 
some 3/16 wing nuts now with it together
you<00:05:20.840> can<00:05:20.990> check<00:05:21.229> to<00:05:21.260> make<00:05:21.440> sure<00:05:21.830> that<00:05:22.070> it's

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
you can check to make sure that it's

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.580 
you can check to make sure that it's
okay

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
okay

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.620 
okay
it<00:05:24.590> shouldn't<00:05:25.400> be<00:05:25.490> too<00:05:25.580> slack<00:05:26.060> in<00:05:26.270> the<00:05:26.360> middle

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
it shouldn't be too slack in the middle

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.570 
it shouldn't be too slack in the middle
here<00:05:26.840> you<00:05:26.990> should<00:05:27.290> it<00:05:27.440> should<00:05:27.470> still<00:05:28.040> hold<00:05:28.370> the

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
here you should it should still hold the

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.600 
here you should it should still hold the
wood<00:05:28.790> fairly<00:05:29.300> well<00:05:29.479> with<00:05:29.750> the<00:05:30.370> wing<00:05:31.370> nuts

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
wood fairly well with the wing nuts

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.770 
wood fairly well with the wing nuts
tightened<00:05:31.970> down<00:05:32.300> if<00:05:32.680> they<00:05:33.680> move<00:05:33.979> too<00:05:34.280> easily

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
tightened down if they move too easily

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.150 
tightened down if they move too easily
what<00:05:35.780> you<00:05:35.930> can<00:05:36.110> do<00:05:36.260> is<00:05:36.500> you<00:05:36.620> can<00:05:36.740> take<00:05:36.979> this

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
what you can do is you can take this

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.129 
what you can do is you can take this
outside<00:05:37.460> piece<00:05:38.030> off<00:05:38.300> and<00:05:38.539> say

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
outside piece off and say

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.230 
outside piece off and say
and<00:05:39.229> it<00:05:39.439> a<00:05:39.590> bit<00:05:39.800> more<00:05:39.949> convex<00:05:40.490> so<00:05:40.819> that<00:05:40.999> it

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
and it a bit more convex so that it

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.850 
and it a bit more convex so that it
pushes<00:05:41.659> down<00:05:41.689> a<00:05:41.900> little<00:05:42.199> bit<00:05:42.349> harder<00:05:42.680> in<00:05:42.800> the

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
pushes down a little bit harder in the

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.830 
pushes down a little bit harder in the
middle<00:05:43.099> it<00:05:43.580> looks<00:05:43.909> like<00:05:44.090> that's<00:05:44.330> what<00:05:44.539> I<00:05:44.569> need

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
middle it looks like that's what I need

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.480 
middle it looks like that's what I need
to<00:05:44.870> do<00:05:45.169> with<00:05:45.349> this<00:05:45.499> one<00:05:45.770> so<00:05:46.069> I'm<00:05:46.189> just<00:05:46.340> going<00:05:46.460> to

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
to do with this one so I'm just going to

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.670 
to do with this one so I'm just going to
take<00:05:46.699> this<00:05:46.849> off<00:05:47.120> sand<00:05:48.050> it<00:05:48.229> on<00:05:48.319> the<00:05:48.439> belt<00:05:48.590> sander

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
take this off sand it on the belt sander

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.499 
take this off sand it on the belt sander
try<00:05:49.550> it<00:05:49.610> again<00:05:51.370> okay<00:05:52.370> well<00:05:52.729> it<00:05:52.879> took<00:05:53.150> some

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:53.509 
try it again okay well it took some

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:58.029 
try it again okay well it took some
doing<00:05:53.840> but<00:05:54.110> I<00:05:54.379> got<00:05:54.860> it<00:05:55.129> to<00:05:56.259> hold<00:05:57.259> up<00:05:57.469> well<00:05:57.740> in

00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.039 
doing but I got it to hold up well in

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:00.369 
doing but I got it to hold up well in
the<00:05:58.159> middle<00:05:58.460> I've<00:05:59.150> got<00:05:59.419> to<00:05:59.569> come<00:05:59.749> clean<00:05:59.990> on

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:00.379 
the middle I've got to come clean on

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:04.779 
the middle I've got to come clean on
this<00:06:00.590> one<00:06:00.939> it<00:06:01.939> took<00:06:02.150> a<00:06:02.210> lot<00:06:02.599> of<00:06:03.580> sanding<00:06:04.580> and

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:04.789 
this one it took a lot of sanding and

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:07.239 
this one it took a lot of sanding and
adjusting<00:06:05.539> to<00:06:05.810> get<00:06:06.050> this<00:06:06.319> to<00:06:06.560> the<00:06:06.650> point<00:06:06.889> where

00:06:07.239 --> 00:06:07.249 
adjusting to get this to the point where

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:09.459 
adjusting to get this to the point where
it<00:06:07.639> was<00:06:07.849> pressing<00:06:08.360> down<00:06:08.509> tightly<00:06:08.900> enough<00:06:09.289> in

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:09.469 
it was pressing down tightly enough in

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:12.580 
it was pressing down tightly enough in
the<00:06:09.529> middle<00:06:10.150> probably<00:06:11.150> it<00:06:11.509> will<00:06:11.719> work<00:06:12.020> a<00:06:12.259> lot

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
the middle probably it will work a lot

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:19.209 
the middle probably it will work a lot
better<00:06:13.279> if<00:06:13.729> it<00:06:14.449> was<00:06:14.810> a<00:06:14.840> bit<00:06:15.110> narrower<00:06:15.500> and<00:06:18.219> I

00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:19.219 
better if it was a bit narrower and I

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:21.249 
better if it was a bit narrower and I
like<00:06:19.879> I<00:06:20.000> say<00:06:20.150> I've<00:06:20.330> got<00:06:20.539> this<00:06:20.689> one<00:06:20.900> working

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:21.259 
like I say I've got this one working

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:23.709 
like I say I've got this one working
okay<00:06:21.590> but<00:06:21.860> I<00:06:21.889> would<00:06:22.129> recommend<00:06:22.669> that<00:06:22.909> if<00:06:23.599> you

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:23.719 
okay but I would recommend that if you

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:25.480 
okay but I would recommend that if you
were<00:06:23.810> to<00:06:23.930> make<00:06:24.080> one<00:06:24.349> you<00:06:24.770> would<00:06:24.919> make<00:06:25.129> it<00:06:25.279> a<00:06:25.340> bit

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
were to make one you would make it a bit

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.850 
were to make one you would make it a bit
narrower<00:06:25.939> it<00:06:26.479> will<00:06:26.689> be<00:06:26.840> a<00:06:26.870> lot<00:06:27.110> easier<00:06:27.139> to

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
narrower it will be a lot easier to

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.909 
narrower it will be a lot easier to
adjust<00:06:28.009> it<00:06:28.520> so<00:06:28.729> it's<00:06:28.879> working<00:06:29.270> properly<00:06:29.919> what

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:30.919 
adjust it so it's working properly what

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:32.769 
adjust it so it's working properly what
I<00:06:30.949> found<00:06:31.159> to<00:06:31.370> be<00:06:31.400> the<00:06:31.520> most<00:06:31.669> effective<00:06:32.300> way<00:06:32.569> to

00:06:32.769 --> 00:06:32.779 
I found to be the most effective way to

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:36.219 
I found to be the most effective way to
get<00:06:33.289> it<00:06:33.500> working<00:06:33.879> well<00:06:34.879> was<00:06:35.629> to<00:06:35.659> take<00:06:36.020> the

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:36.229 
get it working well was to take the

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.110 
get it working well was to take the
strips<00:06:36.560> and<00:06:36.800> extend<00:06:37.279> them<00:06:37.400> out<00:06:37.520> this<00:06:37.729> way<00:06:37.939> as

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 
strips and extend them out this way as

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.540 
strips and extend them out this way as
far<00:06:38.360> as<00:06:38.419> I<00:06:38.659> could<00:06:38.919> lay<00:06:39.919> those<00:06:40.189> on<00:06:40.400> the

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.550 
far as I could lay those on the

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.790 
far as I could lay those on the
workbench<00:06:41.060> and<00:06:41.360> take<00:06:41.569> my<00:06:41.749> sanding<00:06:42.259> block<00:06:42.499> and

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
workbench and take my sanding block and

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.110 
workbench and take my sanding block and
sand<00:06:43.669> it<00:06:43.939> smooth<00:06:44.360> and<00:06:45.370> slightly<00:06:46.370> taper<00:06:46.819> it
