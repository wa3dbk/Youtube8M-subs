00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
it because I realized that the other one

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.490 
it because I realized that the other one
my<00:00:10.170> audio<00:00:10.620> was<00:00:10.980> well<00:00:11.849> my<00:00:12.330> voice<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.840> just<00:00:13.230> I

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
my audio was well my voice I just I

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.890 
my audio was well my voice I just I
didn't<00:00:14.370> know<00:00:14.429> what<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.580> say<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:14.910> it's<00:00:15.660> so<00:00:15.839> I

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
didn't know what to say and it's so I

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.349 
didn't know what to say and it's so I
sort<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.320> stumbled<00:00:16.619> through<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.369> it

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
sort of stumbled through it and it

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.840 
sort of stumbled through it and it
really<00:00:18.750> wasn't<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.140> great<00:00:19.500> so<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.670> don't

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
really wasn't that great so and I don't

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:21.950 
really wasn't that great so and I don't
think<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.150> should<00:00:21.180> have<00:00:21.390> been<00:00:21.449> as<00:00:21.570> long<00:00:21.720> as<00:00:21.869> it

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
think it should have been as long as it
