 here we have a compressor we stopped 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.890
 install rivets and leaves on the disk 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:13.819
 each model 13 6 

00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:16.339
 use different pressure 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:17.170
 this 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.170
 ensure that it is installed without faults 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:29.179
 here we are balancing a first step loader in a horizontal maquila 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.700
 the reason that we are not balancing state to high vibration and harmonics 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:35.510
 that are created when the charger 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.290
 it does not swing 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.559
 here we have a balance the horizontal 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.010
 that allows us here 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.719
 in your music of Huesca 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.719

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.090
 this is the armed ram of a gas generator 36 this is a motor 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.070
 cease 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.040
 36 here we install the nozzles 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.700
 the selection of high temperatures since the final assembly 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.350
 end the tie with the power section 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.520
 before installing test tracks 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.320
 we are not only section of the ford of powers 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.159
 this is where the power sections of our fish are assembled 6 these are 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.159
 specialized tools for aspects of the armed 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.549
 this unit had a break in the exhaust area was repaired and 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.370
 rebuilt now we use the thousandth st to check the insulation resistance 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.079
 of the five system and being safe is ready to fly 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.050
 then we will pay it for shipment to the customer 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.480
 in this same room 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.530
 we do inspections of propeller blows 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.330
 spontaneous high 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.330
 of the year for the water anp as well as pollution by smoke 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.740
 right now I'm putting together a power section 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.140
 who had a high former official 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.490
 he worked in the first level loader 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.900
 she had previously been malaysia 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.730
 installing the pt disk requires calibrating the air flow through the section of 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.569
 Turbine power 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.149
 and once that is installed 

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:19.499
 I will devote to the box b of the pp is imposed 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:22.519
 once the power section is finished 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.419
 we will be ready for the gas power section 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:27.910
 finally 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.910
