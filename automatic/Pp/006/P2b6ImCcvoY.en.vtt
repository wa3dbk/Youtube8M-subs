00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.610
 So now it comes to onions start 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.560
 we have on with the onion we have 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.890
 three different varieties once the 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.830
 stuttgarter giant then the 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.400
 Brunswick red and the Zittauer 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:45.670
 We need yellow first 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.590
 naturally sowaaterde sowing 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.830
 earth it is important that they are not 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.710
 lumps of stones or wood 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:56.560
 Other bothering parts also contains 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.020
 she should be pretty loose sandy airy 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.660
 and, above all, nutrient-poor 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.420
 so that the fine little roots 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.910
 so do not burn with low salt 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.640
 it should be so then we take the 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.860
 You can get that shape in the form 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.390
 horticulture and the worth it 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.380
 very stable you can do it several times 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.570
 use 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.820
 and now she is first with earth forth 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.479
 It almost looks like it's being soaped 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.490
 naturally filled with the sowing earth 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.080
 subsequently be of the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.990
 onions five to six seeds per 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.020
 filled with a mold after a 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.030
 germination of about two weeks only 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.280
 three left standing 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.039
 the whole thing we try this year 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.259
 first time out and that will be 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.509
 also planted in groups so two 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:48.209
 until three onions are then together 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:51.340
 and then they come to the beet 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:53.770
 all three varieties of onions 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.599
 come in one shape if the seeds 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.490
 they are easy to pick up 

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:59.979
 pressed and what we definitely 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.759
 not to forget is the individual 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.649
 labels accordingly 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.349
 we do that with a tape and 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.149
 a foil pen because if the young 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.660
 you can not sprout plants 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.660
 distinguish more 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.830
 now all the seeds are even 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.750
 distributed it still comes aussaaterde 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.450
 and it will be easy again 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.350
 pressed and distributed and now it says 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.680
 water march 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:53.200
 we like to use it at brause 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.000
 because it sprays the water very gently 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.810
 and evenly so that the seeds do not 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.810
 to swim 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:17.830
 the next ones are in the series 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.470
 the leek onions which we have red 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.940
 and white the seed will be in the 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.060
 sprinkled 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.340
 while lightly pressed and distributed 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.069
 then, of course, also poured like all 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.049
 Onion should also be about 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.330
 half a centimeter below the earth 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:37.660
 come and then bright and cool 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.849
 that means about 10 to 15 degrees 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.340
 should have 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:44.410
 why do you do that so early 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.780
 Usually the harvest is onions 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.200
 announced in the fall but if you are now 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:53.260
 in january from seeth and depending on 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.599
 weather conditions in march april so depending on 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.489
 how it looks with the frost in the beet 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.920
 you can actually plant with it 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.910
 a harvest in the summer count and that 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.910
 Let's try it now 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:50.910
 at the vegetable onions com profi only one 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.680
 up to two seeds in the earth 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.020
 but otherwise it is here too 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.960
 same procedure and half an inch 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:02.240
 Lightly press under the earth 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.240
 sprinkle and wait for them barely 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.370
 After about two weeks you can the 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.500
 see first young plants sprout 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.210
 the stuttgart giants seem to be there 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.580
 but also to have the lead directly 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.200
 the Brunswick red one appears 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.540
 to be a bit behind 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.730
 it's a bit like one 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.580
 we'll see on the right 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.920
 like the leek onions 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.080
 looks like the whole again 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.480
 plate at a glance the leek onions 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.070
 are already doing well the white ones are 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.650
 but also faster than the red ones 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.540
 and how it goes on and who faster 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.490
 the front is what we see next 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.800
 video then we look at how 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.400
 is piqued and how is it then in the 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.600
 earth 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.540
 but now there is a small one 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:24.140
 mysterious because anyone what a 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:26.090
 Onion fish we hope you have that 

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.710
 Maybe he also builds video 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.390
 just onions then let us 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.400
 listen and maybe even look 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.640
 as it looks to you from a nice 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.640
 day still
