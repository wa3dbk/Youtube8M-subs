across the trust until finally I get

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.070 
across the trust until finally I get
there<00:00:26.220> which<00:00:26.970> isn't<00:00:27.150> too<00:00:27.359> bad<00:00:27.390> on<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.840> trust

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
there which isn't too bad on the trust

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.570 
there which isn't too bad on the trust
like<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.470> but<00:00:28.980> what<00:00:29.130> would<00:00:29.250> happen<00:00:29.460> if

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
like that but what would happen if

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.880 
like that but what would happen if
you're<00:00:29.699> working<00:00:29.880> on<00:00:30.060> one<00:00:30.240> like<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.900> you

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
you're working on one like this and you

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.350 
you're working on one like this and you
wanted<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.250> know<00:00:32.399> what<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.880> force<00:00:33.149> in

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
wanted to know what is the force in

member gra8ful we're going to show you

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.660 
member gra8ful we're going to show you
another<00:00:40.170> method<00:00:40.290> today<00:00:40.710> which<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.520> method

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
another method today which is the method

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.049 
another method today which is the method
of<00:00:41.969> sections<00:00:43.160> both<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.340> these<00:00:44.430> methods<00:00:44.670> work

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
of sections both of these methods work

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.549 
of sections both of these methods work
you<00:00:45.270> can<00:00:45.420> use<00:00:45.570> them<00:00:45.780> both<00:00:46.050> at<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.260> same<00:00:46.350> time

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
you can use them both at the same time

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.950 
you can use them both at the same time
you<00:00:47.250> can<00:00:47.430> use<00:00:47.579> them<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:47.850> combination<00:00:48.180> for

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
you can use them in combination for

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.330 
you can use them in combination for
example<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.440> could<00:00:49.590> work<00:00:49.770> into<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.129> middle

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
example you could work into the middle

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.529 
example you could work into the middle
of<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.520> trust<00:00:50.760> using<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.149> method<00:00:51.449> of

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
of the trust using the method of

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.389 
of the trust using the method of
sections<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.230> then<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.770> could<00:00:52.890> use<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> method

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
sections and then you could use a method

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.970 
sections and then you could use a method
of<00:00:53.489> joints<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:54.270> work<00:00:54.449> other<00:00:55.020> members<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
of joints to work other members in the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.819 
of joints to work other members in the
middle<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.399> truss<00:00:57.050> so<00:00:58.050> both<00:00:58.260> methods<00:00:58.680> work

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
middle of the truss so both methods work

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.220 
middle of the truss so both methods work
it<00:00:59.520> turns<00:00:59.760> out<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.210> method<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.660> joints

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
it turns out that the method of joints

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.920 
it turns out that the method of joints
is<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.710> concurrent<00:01:02.399> force<00:01:02.820> method<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.390> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
is a concurrent force method and the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.810 
is a concurrent force method and the
method<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.290> sections<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> non<00:01:05.280> concurrent

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
method of sections is a non concurrent

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.359 
method of sections is a non concurrent
force<00:01:06.000> method<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:07.470> let's<00:01:07.500> have<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.799> look<00:01:07.950> at<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
force method so let's have a look at the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.390 
force method so let's have a look at the
method<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.729> sections<00:01:09.180> on<00:01:09.510> this<00:01:09.659> truss<00:01:10.250> this<00:01:11.250> is

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
method of sections on this truss this is

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.850 
method of sections on this truss this is
how<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.580> works<00:01:11.820> I've<00:01:12.720> been<00:01:13.140> told<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.680> need

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
how it works I've been told that I need

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.859 
how it works I've been told that I need
to<00:01:13.950> find<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.369> forces<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.030> these<00:01:15.210> members<00:01:15.270> one

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
to find the forces in these members one

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.570 
to find the forces in these members one
of<00:01:15.990> these<00:01:16.080> members<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.560> here<00:01:16.799> let's<00:01:17.220> say<00:01:17.430> it's

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
of these members in here let's say it's

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.620 
of these members in here let's say it's
member<00:01:17.880> KJ<00:01:19.820> instead<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.909> using<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.270> method<00:01:21.570> of

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
member KJ instead of using the method of

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.630 
member KJ instead of using the method of
joints<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.110> I'm<00:01:22.380> working<00:01:22.799> my<00:01:22.920> way<00:01:22.950> over<00:01:23.340> there

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
joints and I'm working my way over there

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.429 
joints and I'm working my way over there
I'm<00:01:23.790> going<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.060> go<00:01:24.150> directly<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.170> centre

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
I'm going to go directly to the centre

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.670 
I'm going to go directly to the centre
of<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.560> truss<00:01:26.030> this<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.180> how<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.299> do<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.840> cut

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
of the truss this is how I do it I cut

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.289 
of the truss this is how I do it I cut
the<00:01:28.829> truss<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.250> half<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.970> trick

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the truss in half and this is a trick

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.960 
the truss in half and this is a trick
which<00:01:30.750> engineers<00:01:31.259> use<00:01:31.530> Freebody<00:01:32.220> diagrams<00:01:32.790> a

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
which engineers use Freebody diagrams a

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.940 
which engineers use Freebody diagrams a
free<00:01:33.360> body<00:01:33.509> diagram<00:01:33.990> can<00:01:34.200> be<00:01:34.259> anything<00:01:34.740> you

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
free body diagram can be anything you

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.640 
free body diagram can be anything you
like<00:01:35.130> it's<00:01:35.729> up<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.090> engineer<00:01:36.479> for<00:01:37.200> example

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
like it's up to the engineer for example

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.499 
like it's up to the engineer for example
when<00:01:37.829> I'm<00:01:37.950> working<00:01:38.520> out<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.790> reaction<00:01:39.180> forces

this I have the left hand side of the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.850 
this I have the left hand side of the
truss<00:02:13.170> only

I've<00:02:13.980> cut<00:02:14.460> through<00:02:14.670> three<00:02:15.030> members<00:02:15.420> one<00:02:16.380> of

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
I've cut through three members one of

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.870 
I've cut through three members one of
them<00:02:16.620> is<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.950> one<00:02:17.040> I'm<00:02:17.190> looking<00:02:17.220> for<00:02:17.670> which<00:02:17.850> is

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
them is the one I'm looking for which is

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.540 
them is the one I'm looking for which is
JK<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.690> I've<00:02:19.320> also<00:02:19.470> cut<00:02:19.770> two<00:02:19.980> other<00:02:20.160> members

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
JK and I've also cut two other members

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.360 
JK and I've also cut two other members
because<00:02:20.820> I<00:02:20.850> have<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.120> cut<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.420> trust<00:02:21.660> in<00:02:21.810> half

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
because I have to cut the trust in half

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.980 
because I have to cut the trust in half
so<00:02:23.370> at<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.610> moment<00:02:23.820> I've<00:02:24.120> got<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.420> non

you're allowed to take them anywhere at

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.810 
position so if I take the moments here I
should<00:03:40.080> get<00:03:40.230> 0<00:03:40.530> if<00:03:40.860> I<00:03:41.040> take<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.340> moments<00:03:41.640> here

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
should get 0 if I take the moments here

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.640 
should get 0 if I take the moments here
I'll<00:03:41.910> get<00:03:42.030> 0<00:03:42.090> wherever<00:03:42.690> I<00:03:42.900> decide<00:03:43.320> to<00:03:43.350> take

I'll get 0 wherever I decide to take

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
moments I should get 0 but it turns out

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.280 
moments I should get 0 but it turns out
that<00:03:47.489> if<00:03:47.700> I<00:03:47.820> take<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.180> moments<00:03:48.510> right<00:03:48.690> here<00:03:49.140> on

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
that if I take the moments right here on

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.470 
that if I take the moments right here on
a<00:03:51.110> then<00:03:52.110> when<00:03:53.070> I<00:03:53.100> write<00:03:53.459> my<00:03:53.489> moment<00:03:54.000> equations

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
a then when I write my moment equations

a then when I write my moment equations
sum<00:03:54.720> of<00:03:54.840> all<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.080> moments<00:03:55.230> about<00:03:55.560> a<00:03:55.980> equals<00:03:56.670> 0

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
sum of all the moments about a equals 0

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.270 
sum of all the moments about a equals 0
I<00:03:57.200> won't<00:03:58.200> have<00:03:58.380> to<00:03:58.590> include<00:03:59.280> these<00:03:59.580> two

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
I won't have to include these two

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.250 
I won't have to include these two
because<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.489> distance<00:04:02.970> is<00:04:03.150> 0<00:04:03.630> so<00:04:03.930> it<00:04:04.049> should

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
because the distance is 0 so it should

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:11.539 
because the distance is 0 so it should
be<00:04:04.380> RA<00:04:04.620> Y<00:04:05.160> times<00:04:05.910> 0<00:04:06.420> and<00:04:06.950> r<00:04:07.950> ax<00:04:08.310> times<00:04:08.670> 0<00:04:10.130> etc<00:04:11.130> etc

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
be RA Y times 0 and r ax times 0 etc etc

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.340 
be RA Y times 0 and r ax times 0 etc etc
those<00:04:12.000> two<00:04:12.239> are<00:04:12.390> not<00:04:12.540> in<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:12.840> moment<00:04:12.989> equation

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
those two are not in the moment equation

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.219 
those two are not in the moment equation
so<00:04:13.709> I<00:04:14.010> end<00:04:14.340> up<00:04:14.519> with<00:04:14.730> an<00:04:14.850> equation<00:04:15.120> based<00:04:15.989> on

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
so I end up with an equation based on

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:21.180 
so I end up with an equation based on
finding<00:04:17.040> only<00:04:17.220> one<00:04:17.549> force<00:04:17.910> reaction<00:04:18.540> RB

we have our trusts we're going to split
the<00:04:23.920> trust<00:04:24.190> in<00:04:24.340> half<00:04:24.610> and<00:04:24.970> we're<00:04:25.150> going<00:04:25.270> to<00:04:25.390> do

the trust in half and we're going to do

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.800 
the trust in half and we're going to do
the<00:04:26.140> method<00:04:26.560> of<00:04:26.710> non<00:04:27.340> concurrent<00:04:27.940> forces<00:04:28.150> to

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
the method of non concurrent forces to

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.920 
the method of non concurrent forces to
deal<00:04:29.050> with<00:04:29.500> a<00:04:29.530> portion<00:04:30.160> of<00:04:30.220> the<00:04:30.370> trust<00:04:30.660> so<00:04:31.660> here

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
deal with a portion of the trust so here

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:32.610 
deal with a portion of the trust so here
we<00:04:31.990> have<00:04:32.110> the<00:04:32.260> trust

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
we have the trust

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.620 
we have the trust
now<00:04:32.890> we<00:04:32.950> section<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.640> trust<00:04:33.910> and<00:04:34.120> we're<00:04:34.420> left

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
now we section the trust and we're left

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.620 
now we section the trust and we're left
with<00:04:34.870> this<00:04:35.020> segment<00:04:35.380> of<00:04:35.650> the<00:04:35.830> trust<00:04:36.130> we're<00:04:36.970> now

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
with this segment of the trust we're now

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.150 
with this segment of the trust we're now
going<00:04:37.900> to<00:04:38.020> analyze<00:04:38.380> this<00:04:38.590> segment<00:04:39.010> of<00:04:39.070> the

going to analyze this segment of the

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.400 
going to analyze this segment of the
trust<00:04:39.430> using<00:04:39.940> non<00:04:40.180> concurrent<00:04:40.720> forces<00:04:40.900> how

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
trust using non concurrent forces how

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.140 
trust using non concurrent forces how
many<00:04:41.620> forces<00:04:41.800> have<00:04:42.070> we<00:04:42.160> got<00:04:42.400> one<00:04:42.610> two<00:04:42.940> three

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
many forces have we got one two three

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.530 
many forces have we got one two three
four<00:04:43.630> five<00:04:44.350> six<00:04:44.770> forces<00:04:45.340> altogether<00:04:45.730> three<00:04:46.450> of

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
four five six forces altogether three of

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.300 
four five six forces altogether three of
them<00:04:46.660> are<00:04:47.080> unknown<00:04:47.790> CD<00:04:48.990> CJ<00:04:49.990> and<00:04:50.230> JK<00:04:50.920> we<00:04:51.160> know

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
them are unknown CD CJ and JK we know

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.800 
them are unknown CD CJ and JK we know
the<00:04:51.430> direction<00:04:51.640> of<00:04:51.850> those<00:04:51.970> forces<00:04:52.360> because

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
the direction of those forces because

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.410 
the direction of those forces because
they<00:04:53.020> forces<00:04:53.770> within<00:04:53.950> members<00:04:54.580> of<00:04:54.880> the<00:04:55.150> truss

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
they forces within members of the truss

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.930 
they forces within members of the truss
so<00:04:56.350> we<00:04:56.470> know<00:04:56.620> the<00:04:56.800> direction<00:04:57.130> of<00:04:57.340> them<00:04:57.550> but<00:04:57.850> we

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
so we know the direction of them but we

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.690 
so we know the direction of them but we
don't<00:04:58.150> know<00:04:58.300> the<00:04:58.330> magnitudes<00:04:59.370> so<00:05:00.370> we<00:05:00.580> are

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
don't know the magnitudes so we are

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.510 
don't know the magnitudes so we are
basically<00:05:01.210> doing<00:05:01.480> a<00:05:01.810> non<00:05:02.440> concurrent<00:05:03.310> force

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
basically doing a non concurrent force

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.230 
basically doing a non concurrent force
question<00:05:05.130> okay<00:05:06.130> how<00:05:06.310> do<00:05:06.370> we<00:05:06.520> solve<00:05:06.790> a<00:05:07.030> non

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
question okay how do we solve a non

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.150 
question okay how do we solve a non
concurrent<00:05:07.660> false<00:05:07.840> question<00:05:08.290> we<00:05:08.590> try<00:05:08.830> to<00:05:08.890> find

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
concurrent false question we try to find

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.070 
concurrent false question we try to find
a<00:05:09.250> point<00:05:09.550> we<00:05:09.700> can<00:05:09.880> take<00:05:10.060> a<00:05:10.090> moment<00:05:10.300> on<00:05:10.630> which

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
a point we can take a moment on which

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.380 
a point we can take a moment on which
will<00:05:11.290> eliminate<00:05:11.560> two<00:05:12.010> of<00:05:12.040> the<00:05:12.190> forces<00:05:12.670> our

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
will eliminate two of the forces our

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.480 
will eliminate two of the forces our
first<00:05:13.750> idea<00:05:14.440> is<00:05:14.650> to<00:05:14.920> do<00:05:15.100> a<00:05:15.340> moment<00:05:16.300> on<00:05:16.420> Point<00:05:17.050> C

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
first idea is to do a moment on Point C

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.400 
first idea is to do a moment on Point C
if<00:05:18.490> we<00:05:18.580> take<00:05:18.880> a<00:05:18.910> moment<00:05:19.150> at<00:05:19.390> Point<00:05:19.420> C<00:05:19.870> that<00:05:20.050> will

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
if we take a moment at Point C that will

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.400 
if we take a moment at Point C that will
eliminate<00:05:20.650> these<00:05:21.310> two<00:05:21.640> forces<00:05:22.090> out<00:05:22.510> of<00:05:23.290> the

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
eliminate these two forces out of the

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.140 
eliminate these two forces out of the
moment<00:05:23.710> equation<00:05:23.920> it<00:05:24.340> will<00:05:24.490> also<00:05:24.730> eliminate

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
moment equation it will also eliminate

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.050 
moment equation it will also eliminate
the<00:05:25.930> 10<00:05:26.170> kilonewton<00:05:26.710> force<00:05:26.740> because<00:05:27.700> all<00:05:28.000> of

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
the 10 kilonewton force because all of

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.140 
the 10 kilonewton force because all of
those<00:05:28.450> three<00:05:28.930> go<00:05:29.200> through<00:05:29.440> Point<00:05:29.740> C<00:05:30.040> so<00:05:30.850> now

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
those three go through Point C so now

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.390 
those three go through Point C so now
when<00:05:31.870> I<00:05:31.930> do<00:05:31.990> a<00:05:32.110> moment<00:05:32.500> equations<00:05:32.920> sum<00:05:33.190> of<00:05:33.310> all

when I do a moment equations sum of all
the<00:05:33.550> moments<00:05:33.900> at<00:05:34.900> C<00:05:36.090> will<00:05:37.090> be<00:05:37.120> eighteen<00:05:37.810> point

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
the moments at C will be eighteen point

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.600 
the moments at C will be eighteen point
three<00:05:39.540> times<00:05:40.710> eight<00:05:41.710> the<00:05:42.010> perpendicular

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
three times eight the perpendicular

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.720 
three times eight the perpendicular
distance<00:05:42.700> is<00:05:43.090> eight

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
distance is eight

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.160 
distance is eight
this<00:05:45.730> is<00:05:45.880> causing<00:05:46.270> clockwise<00:05:46.720> so<00:05:46.990> that's

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.170 
this is causing clockwise so that's

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:54.960 
this is causing clockwise so that's
positive<00:05:48.510> ten<00:05:49.950> times<00:05:50.950> four<00:05:53.040> negative

positive ten times four negative

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.080 
positive ten times four negative
that's<00:05:55.600> anti-clockwise<00:05:56.460> those<00:05:57.460> three<00:05:57.850> not

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
that's anti-clockwise those three not

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.590 
that's anti-clockwise those three not
included<00:05:58.630> and<00:05:58.810> we<00:05:58.990> have<00:05:59.020> JK<00:06:00.240> the<00:06:01.240> distance

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
included and we have JK the distance

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.940 
included and we have JK the distance
there<00:06:01.810> is<00:06:01.960> four<00:06:02.460> and<00:06:04.620> that's<00:06:05.620> causing

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950 
there is four and that's causing

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.820 
there is four and that's causing
anti-clockwise<00:06:06.790> negative<00:06:07.770> equals<00:06:09.210> zero<00:06:10.210> so

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
anti-clockwise negative equals zero so

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.260 
anti-clockwise negative equals zero so
this<00:06:11.830> moment<00:06:12.100> equation<00:06:12.670> has<00:06:12.820> none<00:06:13.030> of<00:06:13.150> these

got<00:07:52.600> 14<00:07:53.050> and<00:07:53.260> that<00:07:53.500> one's<00:07:53.710> got<00:07:53.860> 18<00:07:54.310> we've

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:54.820 
got 14 and that one's got 18 we've

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.630 
got 14 and that one's got 18 we've
solved<00:07:55.330> all<00:07:55.419> of<00:07:55.660> those<00:07:55.980> if<00:07:56.980> that's<00:07:57.250> the<00:07:57.400> method

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:57.640 
solved all of those if that's the method

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:02.340 
solved all of those if that's the method
of<00:07:57.730> joints<00:07:58.650> you<00:07:59.650> cut<00:07:59.919> the<00:08:00.220> truss<00:08:00.910> you<00:08:01.350> then

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:02.350 
of joints you cut the truss you then

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:04.469 
of joints you cut the truss you then
find<00:08:02.770> a<00:08:03.010> place<00:08:03.370> to<00:08:03.580> take<00:08:03.789> a<00:08:03.820> moment<00:08:04.090> that<00:08:04.360> will

00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:04.479 
find a place to take a moment that will

00:08:04.479 --> 00:08:06.360 
find a place to take a moment that will
eliminate<00:08:04.720> two<00:08:05.229> of<00:08:05.260> the<00:08:05.410> unknown<00:08:05.800> forces<00:08:06.160> out

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:06.370 
eliminate two of the unknown forces out

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.159 
eliminate two of the unknown forces out
of<00:08:06.400> the<00:08:06.610> three<00:08:06.880> you<00:08:07.419> do<00:08:07.570> the<00:08:07.690> moment<00:08:07.960> equation

00:08:08.159 --> 00:08:08.169 
of the three you do the moment equation

00:08:08.169 --> 00:08:08.879 
of the three you do the moment equation
that<00:08:08.470> will

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:08.889 
that will

00:08:08.889 --> 00:08:11.790 
that will
and<00:08:08.979> the<00:08:09.400> other<00:08:09.669> member<00:08:10.479> like<00:08:10.689> JK<00:08:11.169> for<00:08:11.409> example

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:11.800 
and the other member like JK for example

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.709 
and the other member like JK for example
and<00:08:12.069> once<00:08:12.550> you've<00:08:12.699> got<00:08:12.849> one<00:08:12.879> of<00:08:13.180> them<00:08:13.300> you've

00:08:13.709 --> 00:08:13.719 
and once you've got one of them you've

00:08:13.719 --> 00:08:15.689 
and once you've got one of them you've
only<00:08:13.900> got<00:08:14.080> two<00:08:14.229> left<00:08:14.469> to<00:08:14.650> go<00:08:14.800> you<00:08:15.189> can<00:08:15.370> finish

00:08:15.689 --> 00:08:15.699 
only got two left to go you can finish

00:08:15.699 --> 00:08:19.469 
only got two left to go you can finish
it<00:08:15.939> off<00:08:16.030> with<00:08:16.270> a<00:08:16.300> force<00:08:16.960> polygon
