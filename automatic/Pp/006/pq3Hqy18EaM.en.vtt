00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.040
 women we are a little bit in love is 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.190
 the fit skirt and skirt of the 50s 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.690
 the lack so feminine also this 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.000
 We will find it in the season 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.130
 all the shop windows is the time for 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.590

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.450
 little things to use it well in 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.430
 first place the citi skirt always 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:43.010
 you need very feminine complements 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:45.200
 shoes blouses handbags and then there are many 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.380
 forms of skirt cig for example this that 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.390
 I carry has shovels 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.800
 both those of shovels and those of gathers 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.570
 they do not suit you if you have something of 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.030
 belly or you do not have the waist very 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.340
 marked but there are other forms of skirt 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.880
 and surely fit you are good you 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.570
 I'm going to teach another one that I think can 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.760
 fit with almost everyone 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.260
 good the 1050 skirt that I taught you 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.140
 before it's okay for the figures in 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.360
 shaped x au v because it balances 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.040
 hips and make the waist but if 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.850
 your body is shaped like a ho in the form of 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.040
 or this other form of skirt of the years 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.830
 50 goes much better is plan and is by 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.280
 here you are flying down and always 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.800
 you can put over you see a shirt 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.900
 very feminine lace I told you the 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.729
 garments that accompany these skirts go 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.790
 very well that they are very feminine very 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.630
 very elegant soft 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.410
 if in addition it is not that it is that your case 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.720
 of figure 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.660
 you can accompany these skirts or this 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.770
 type of garments with a finite belt 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.960
 He is doing very well 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.350
 as we will see later because I love you 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.270
 teach another option skirts of these 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.789
 characteristics that are the dresses there are 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.219
 dressed in these skirts are dresses 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:02.939
 Precious will remind you of the times 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:05.399
 gilt hollywood in those dresses yes 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.140
 you want to accompany something on the 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.049
 knitted jackets as you will see they are very 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.450
 well and those jackets will go with them 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:14.519
 of these of these types of belts 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.220
 finite you are going to see let's start 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.810
 now to see dresses two types one more 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.900
 closed another more open but what 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.819
 important is the shape of the skirt that 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.780
 is what we are talking about as you 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.519
 I commented on the knitted jackets with a 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.000
 delgadito belt are the complement 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.470
 ideal for this type of dresses but if 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.930
 you are going to use the summer you do not want 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.890
 wear a jacket because the dress is 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.710
 can only logically 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.620
 fix if your figures in the form of h 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.530
 you do not need to put a belt 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.090
 this type of dresses will mark a little 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.600
 your waist and you have to rid the 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.030
 figure look at the mischievousness these dresses 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.450
 they lend a lot to carry with dogs 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.520
 low tulle that look giving 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.700
 If your figure allows you, you can 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.680
 accompany the dress with a belt in 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.560
 this case I have two options because the 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.480
 dress you the colors with this one 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.500
 will mark much more visually waist 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:18.380
 and with this a little less good and I 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.860
 I wanted to say goodbye with this dress like 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.800
 you see the shoes the dress everything is very 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.380
 50s plus this dress has a 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:31.210
 very special feature and it is this 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:34.270
 Strip of lace that has at the waist 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.620
 although he wears this little belt almost 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.130
 you can not see why the lace is also 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:42.280
 black mark a little waist with what 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.320
 which this dress can go well to almost 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.780
 all the figures I will not say all 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.760
 because then measure island but to me 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.470
 I think these and all mark a little the 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.020
 waist you can mark it more with a 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.930
 belt but it is very well balanced 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:00.730
 any figure strapless neckline 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:03.130
 but with a little detail it's perfect to see 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.130
 if this season you dare to do 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.960
 with a pledge of the 50s sure 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.440
 the catch is a lot of love 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.440
 until next time
