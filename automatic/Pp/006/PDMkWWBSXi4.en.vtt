00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.000
 40 days and 40 nights 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.900
 We're just trying to do the right things. 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.000
 We found out... 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.500
 that we are all the same 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.100
 So grab your piece and move fast. 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.000
 Then spend your life trying to make it last 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.200
 Oh ... 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.400
 We are all the same 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.500
 Hold ... 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.300
 What we once had 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Cracker Jacks Yes, I'm in the box 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.400
 I hope this time I'll impress you 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.000
 Because I am the toast your life has to sustain 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 So here we are in the same old glass 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.500
 Sifting sand, creating a past ... 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.000
 Too many blisters ... and heaps of guilt 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.900
 Here we are in the same old glass 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.500
 We are sifting sand, creating a past 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.200
 Lots of bubbles ... 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.800
 and loads of guilt 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 Hold ... 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.200
 What we once had 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.800
 Then try ... 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.300
 Forgive and forget 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 our evil 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.500
 Do not forget that before dawn 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.600
 The darkest hour will feel really long 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.500
 and all our hopes will try to explain 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.700
 Do not look back because you will turn into salt 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.320
 and half of this mess is half my fault 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.300
 Oh, at least you're a wonderful man. 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.500
 Do not forget that before dawn 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.500
 The darkest hour will feel really long 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.120
 and all our hopes will try to explain 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.500
 Do not look back because you will turn into salt 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.100
 and half of this mess is half my fault 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.100
 Oh at least you're a wonderful man. 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 Oh at least you're a wonderful man. 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.200
 Oh at least you're a wonderful man. 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.500
 Oh ... 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.700
 At least you're a wonderful man.
