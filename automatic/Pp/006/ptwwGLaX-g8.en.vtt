00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
come in on the Hammerhead so when I

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.200 
come in on the Hammerhead so when I
heated<00:01:31.800> up<00:01:31.980> the<00:01:32.010> metal<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.550> bend<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.880> on<00:01:33.060> the

the<00:01:35.220> angle<00:01:35.340> right<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.820> there<00:01:46.400> and<00:01:47.400> we'll<00:01:48.090> have

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
the angle right on there and we'll have

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.550 
the angle right on there and we'll have
a<00:01:48.270> whole<00:01:48.450> coming<00:01:48.840> through<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.110> middle<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.440> it

measuring to get the center hole so that

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
measuring to get the center hole so that
our<00:01:54.810> steel<00:01:55.440> pole<00:01:55.860> can<00:01:56.340> go<00:01:56.610> through<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.869> handle

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.960 
Molnar Thor's hammer was just a great
piece<00:05:32.710> I<00:05:33.040> think<00:05:33.220> it's<00:05:33.370> a<00:05:33.430> little<00:05:33.640> bigger<00:05:33.850> than

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
piece I think it's a little bigger than

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.750 
piece I think it's a little bigger than
one<00:05:34.240> in<00:05:34.360> the<00:05:34.420> movie<00:05:34.570> gets<00:05:35.020> probably<00:05:35.800> 12<00:05:36.280> to<00:05:36.370> 20

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
one in the movie gets probably 12 to 20

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.250 
one in the movie gets probably 12 to 20
pounds<00:05:36.910> I<00:05:37.300> think<00:05:37.720> what<00:05:37.810> we're<00:05:37.930> going<00:05:38.020> to<00:05:38.110> do

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
pounds I think what we're going to do

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.170 
pounds I think what we're going to do
since<00:05:38.500> it<00:05:38.710> is<00:05:38.860> a<00:05:38.890> hollow<00:05:39.220> construction<00:05:40.030> we're

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
since it is a hollow construction we're

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.120 
since it is a hollow construction we're
gonna<00:05:40.270> fill<00:05:40.540> it<00:05:40.660> up<00:05:40.720> with<00:05:40.780> lead<00:05:41.140> shot<00:05:41.170> so<00:05:41.920> it'll

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
gonna fill it up with lead shot so it'll

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.430 
gonna fill it up with lead shot so it'll
weigh<00:05:42.250> about<00:05:42.370> 250<00:05:43.120> pounds<00:05:43.480> so<00:05:43.930> people<00:05:44.260> will

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
weigh about 250 pounds so people will

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.170 
weigh about 250 pounds so people will
watch<00:05:44.680> it<00:05:44.710> in<00:05:45.010> the<00:05:45.100> show<00:05:45.280> and<00:05:45.520> see<00:05:45.700> me<00:05:45.850> picking

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
watch it in the show and see me picking

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.480 
watch it in the show and see me picking
up<00:05:46.330> swinging<00:05:46.660> around<00:05:46.990> fairly<00:05:47.290> easily<00:05:47.560> and<00:05:48.010> if
