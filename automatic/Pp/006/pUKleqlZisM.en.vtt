00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:04.050
 care to implant 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.150
 a satisfactory implant should feel the solid in places 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:10.529
 is pain free 

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:15.189
 and the dyeing of lenci around the implant should look healthy and pink 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.329
 it is true that the implant will never have decay 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.279
 but I can certainly have MencÃ­a diseases 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:29.249
 for this reason you must be diligent in the care of the implant and daily 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:35.079
 brushing and that I walk and lift to remove the dental plaque 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.280
 it's just as important 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.040
 you should use the same gentle pill and the same tooth paste that are 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.200
 used 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.410
 in your natural teeth 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.850
 ask your dentist today the mister 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.970
 to show you the proper way to use the brush and floss 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.530
 use an anti-bacterial epocal rinse daily which have been shown 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.090
 to get better 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.330
 the life time of dental implants 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.330
 you will also need to continue regular check-ups 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.710
 this is becoming more important for patients with implants than for 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.060
 patients and implant 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.060
 important can india times fail 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.180
 and these start to fail usually there are no symptoms to prove it 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.299
 until it's too late to act effectively 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.580
 for that reason 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.720
 Clinically detecting the failure is extremely important 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.900
 the most important signal of some failure is the loss of bone around 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.870
 of the implant 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.050
 and can only be detected by taking x-rays 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.710
 Dental implants must be exposed to x-rays 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.200
 every six months 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.840
 in the first two years and then 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.790
 every three years 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.190
 in cadet I think 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.730
 Your dentist should examine the implant to determine and the gums are 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.000
 healthy 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.130
 and if there is any sign of bone loss 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.469
 the implants must be cleaned every six months 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.419
 the implants or easily abused 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:14.459
 which can affect their health 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:16.599
 so that 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.950
 Special instruments should be used in your suite 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.659
 Mobile devices contain rubber parts 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.969
 hop tic or adhered 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.829
 that wear out over time 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:34.449
 and the life time of these parts sometimes uses usually six months 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:39.029
 for this moment maybe you have come to the conclusion 

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:44.159
 and that it will be important to be sure to put in your agenda the tequeÃ±os each 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:45.389
 six months 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:47.379
 just like your customers natural
