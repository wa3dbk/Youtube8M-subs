something<00:02:37.730> that's<00:02:37.849> nice<00:02:41.590> so<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.709> cool<00:02:42.890> thing

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
something that's nice so the cool thing

something that's nice so the cool thing
about<00:02:43.099> this<00:02:43.430> is<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.730> otk<00:02:44.209> potential<00:02:44.690> now<00:02:44.870> with

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
about this is the otk potential now with

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.199 
about this is the otk potential now with
kageki<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:45.980> shadow<00:02:46.220> is<00:02:46.430> really<00:02:47.000> really

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
kageki and shadow is really really

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.559 
kageki and shadow is really really
really<00:02:47.510> big<00:02:48.069> because<00:02:49.069> usually<00:02:49.879> you'd<00:02:50.329> have

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
really big because usually you'd have

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.860 
really big because usually you'd have
three<00:02:51.500> cousins<00:02:52.000> whatever<00:02:53.000> you<00:02:53.299> use<00:02:53.569> to<00:02:53.780> get

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
three cousins whatever you use to get

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.289 
three cousins whatever you use to get
your<00:02:53.930> stuff<00:02:54.200> out<00:02:54.319> to<00:02:54.470> probably<00:02:54.650> Shan<00:02:55.299> because

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
your stuff out to probably Shan because

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.470 
your stuff out to probably Shan because
you<00:02:56.420> probably<00:02:56.660> asset<00:02:57.140> ISM<00:02:57.440> your<00:02:57.709> kageki<00:02:58.069> your

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
you probably asset ISM your kageki your

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.050 
you probably asset ISM your kageki your
Kagemusha<00:02:59.480> or<00:02:59.659> your<00:02:59.870> elder<00:03:00.879> so<00:03:01.879> you<00:03:01.940> have

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
Kagemusha or your elder so you have

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.759 
Kagemusha or your elder so you have
three<00:03:02.269> cousins<00:03:02.569> your<00:03:03.049> shin<00:03:03.290> and<00:03:03.319> your<00:03:03.590> Grand

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
three cousins your shin and your Grand

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.430 
three cousins your shin and your Grand
Master<00:03:04.099> if<00:03:04.190> you<00:03:04.250> have<00:03:04.340> gatley<00:03:04.609> on<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.790> field

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
Master if you have gatley on the field

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.710 
Master if you have gatley on the field
so<00:03:06.440> that<00:03:06.950> that's<00:03:07.310> pretty<00:03:07.819> good<00:03:07.940> you<00:03:08.480> have<00:03:08.690> a

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
so that that's pretty good you have a

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.110 
so that that's pretty good you have a
couple<00:03:09.079> guys<00:03:09.170> to<00:03:09.379> beat<00:03:09.560> face<00:03:09.799> but<00:03:10.489> what<00:03:10.970> you're

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
couple guys to beat face but what you're

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.300 
couple guys to beat face but what you're
probably<00:03:11.299> going<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:11.540> end<00:03:11.599> up<00:03:12.310> attacking

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
probably going to end up attacking

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.039 
probably going to end up attacking
they're<00:03:14.090> going<00:03:14.180> to<00:03:14.269> probably<00:03:14.480> stop<00:03:14.810> one<00:03:15.019> of

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
they're going to probably stop one of

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.360 
they're going to probably stop one of
your<00:03:15.140> attacks<00:03:15.230> so<00:03:15.650> you're<00:03:15.769> going<00:03:15.890> to<00:03:15.950> run<00:03:16.310> over

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
your attacks so you're going to run over

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.050 
your attacks so you're going to run over
there<00:03:17.030> there<00:03:18.019> little<00:03:18.139> guy<00:03:18.380> and<00:03:18.700> then<00:03:19.700> you're

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
there there little guy and then you're

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.099 
there there little guy and then you're
going<00:03:20.150> to<00:03:20.209> be<00:03:20.299> a<00:03:20.329> little<00:03:20.480> tact<00:03:20.690> directly<00:03:20.989> with

going to be a little tact directly with
two<00:03:21.230> or<00:03:21.349> three<00:03:21.530> of<00:03:21.590> them<00:03:21.739> okay<00:03:22.370> but<00:03:22.430> two<00:03:22.639> or

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
two or three of them okay but two or

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.330 
two or three of them okay but two or
three<00:03:22.880> of<00:03:22.940> them<00:03:23.030> isn't<00:03:23.150> going<00:03:23.329> to<00:03:23.389> otk<00:03:24.099> now<00:03:25.099> yes

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
three of them isn't going to otk now yes

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.770 
three of them isn't going to otk now yes
you<00:03:25.430> can<00:03:25.519> potentially<00:03:25.849> otk<00:03:26.299> the<00:03:26.450> board<00:03:26.630> like

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
you can potentially otk the board like

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.990 
you can potentially otk the board like
that<00:03:26.989> but<00:03:27.440> it's<00:03:27.530> a<00:03:27.620> lot<00:03:27.829> easier<00:03:28.069> when<00:03:28.730> you<00:03:28.849> have

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
that but it's a lot easier when you have

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.150
