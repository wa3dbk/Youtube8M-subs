00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello , welcome to the fourth part of class 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:15.059
 about fame violin music 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:18.000
 Let's go to the norm today. Let's expand. 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.369
 the exercise learned in the previous lesson and 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.109
 Let's learn a new a new way 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.430
 to do the exercise to work the 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.109
 left hand fingers then 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.970
 you will first condition the 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:32.820
 instrument on the court there bring the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.610
 thumb remembering the previous lessons 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:48.899
 You will rise as you did the previous 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:50.789
 1 234 1 234 234 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.640
 arriving on the third finger you go 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:01:08.430
 repeat it and will go back 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:10.930
 1 2 3 4 1 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.750
 remembering your instrument should be with 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.760
 mark the fourth finger is in the 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.869
 direction of the last mark the third finger 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.550
 towards the night with litter in the 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.979
 first finger in the direction of the first 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.220
 his second mark will fall next to the 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.869
 3ยบ that already natural form of the other mon 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.060
 different thing also a little bit of 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.649
 more traditional violin teaching 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.909
 usually the first key 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.520
 seized by teachers 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.340
 traditional and leave the tonality of 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.979
 the greater is for not having any accidents 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.250
 most modern teachers teach or 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.490
 is greater than or la mayor has a sense that 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.660
 the way we hand 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.000
 of course it already has this 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.530
 second is not close to the first it is 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.840
 closest to the third 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.960
 then it is much more anatomical for 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.179
 body touch her larger than play doh 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.780
 greater for him for example as taught 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:07.750
 and thus to this heritage of de 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.519
 develop some right some vices and 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.170
 have tuning problems in his room 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.950
 because we start to see a 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.600
 something that was not atomic, since it was not 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.459
 is established 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.690
 position of the instrument to the body or 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.690
 fame of the left hand 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.620
 It's then for you that already plays and already 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.690
 I understood a little bit what I'm talking about. 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.610
 If you do not understand, do not 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.040
 worry, you do not need to understand this now 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.590
 So we're preparing with the 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.200
 tone that there higher and higher income 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.269
 only bigger and does not give greater although it is not 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.970
 objective is not to start with 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.360
 this deceased tonality without 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.360
 explain 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:03:11.810
 o 234 1 234 234 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:15.730
 preceding with 234 234 234 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.730
 I relax rope use 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:04:02.570
 I thought there were 12 seats in the 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:04:02.570
 2014 cup a year 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.900
 good now finally we go to the last 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:52.449
 exercise of this class you will position 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.610
 your violin always keeping your balance 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:57.090
 relaxation of the body while maintaining a 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:01.539
 collection documents the all natural body 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:03.430
 2014 came to bring the thumb and now you 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:07.449
 will lower support the third finger in the 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:09.699
 rope and will release the fourth finger 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:12.879
 You're going to put the second finger. 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:16.840
 be careful about the third party and 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:20.130
 third party to vote the first finger 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:26.800
 drop the second and then you will go up 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:29.710
 second and four are doing 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.500
 exercises in speaking so you can 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.970
 view better to do way too much 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.970
 slow to be very natural 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.880
 some general notes when playing 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.620
 even by placing your fingers behind 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.500
 fourth finger who is in the direction of 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.599
 rope with the second finger the third 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:51.210
 room in which is in the direction of the rope 

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:53.759
 they will come back tried the rope can not 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:56.580
 but they'll be prepared to play 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:58.470
 that rope first finger all 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.280
 other fingers ready to play with 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.900
