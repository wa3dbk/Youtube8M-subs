random my width Iowa used something that
could<00:03:16.099> actually<00:03:16.340> hurt<00:03:16.849> me<00:03:17.180> oh<00:03:18.250> hey<00:03:19.250> guys<00:03:19.579> for

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
could actually hurt me oh hey guys for

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.699 
could actually hurt me oh hey guys for
stores<00:03:20.690> too<00:03:21.079> so<00:03:21.409> be<00:03:21.680> careful<00:03:22.280> if<00:03:22.459> you<00:03:22.639> plan<00:03:23.090> on

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
stores too so be careful if you plan on

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.429 
stores too so be careful if you plan on
and<00:03:24.709> flip<00:03:25.040> them<00:03:25.280> him<00:03:25.459> with<00:03:25.639> statuses<00:03:26.599> which

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:27.439 
and flip them him with statuses which

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:29.140 
and flip them him with statuses which
would<00:03:27.620> be<00:03:27.739> actually<00:03:28.129> pretty<00:03:28.250> nice<00:03:28.700> if<00:03:28.939> I<00:03:29.030> can

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
would be actually pretty nice if I can

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.059 
would be actually pretty nice if I can
get<00:03:29.299> a<00:03:29.329> burn<00:03:29.750> on<00:03:29.780> it<00:03:30.260> because<00:03:30.470> then<00:03:30.799> it<00:03:30.950> would

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
get a burn on it because then it would

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:41.129 
get a burn on it because then it would
knock<00:03:31.370> it<00:03:31.639> out<00:03:31.879> oh<00:03:37.840> well<00:03:38.840> kids<00:03:39.379> survived<00:03:40.000> to

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
knock it out oh well kids survived to

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:48.440 
knock it out oh well kids survived to
flamethrowers

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.780 

[Applause]

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
[Applause]

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:58.949 
[Applause]
and<00:03:52.390> then<00:03:52.599> his<00:03:52.840> last<00:03:53.200> ho<00:03:53.739> Yeon<00:03:57.599> home<00:03:58.599> fire

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
and then his last ho Yeon home fire

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:10.320 
and then his last ho Yeon home fire
blast

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.670 

I<00:04:10.360> can<00:04:11.020> finally<00:04:11.290> get<00:04:11.560> rid<00:04:11.740> of<00:04:11.860> ember<00:04:12.460> now<00:04:13.680> the

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
I can finally get rid of ember now the

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.220 
I can finally get rid of ember now the
reason<00:04:15.280> I<00:04:15.520> like<00:04:15.730> flame<00:04:16.150> through<00:04:16.480> butter<00:04:16.900> is

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
reason I like flame through butter is

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.600 
reason I like flame through butter is
because<00:04:17.920> flamethrower<00:04:19.620> actually<00:04:20.620> is<00:04:20.920> more

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
because flamethrower actually is more

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:29.700 
because flamethrower actually is more
accurate<00:04:22.330> and<00:04:23.040> it<00:04:24.040> is<00:04:24.190> last<00:04:24.610> Photon<00:04:28.410> I'm<00:04:29.410> not

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
accurate and it is last Photon I'm not

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.400 
accurate and it is last Photon I'm not
even<00:04:29.980> gonna<00:04:30.130> try<00:04:30.460> saying<00:04:31.420> it<00:04:32.250> is<00:04:33.250> I<00:04:34.290> don't<00:04:35.290> even

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
even gonna try saying it is I don't even

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.430 
even gonna try saying it is I don't even
want<00:04:35.980> to<00:04:36.100> try<00:04:36.340> saying<00:04:36.820> hey<00:04:37.650> bastard<00:04:38.650> dawn

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
want to try saying hey bastard dawn

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
want to try saying hey bastard dawn
something<00:04:41.440> like<00:04:41.620> that

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
something like that

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.730 
something like that
[Applause]

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:55.180 

but<00:04:49.370> whatever<00:04:49.820> it's<00:04:50.420> a<00:04:50.630> round<00:04:51.380> pipe<00:04:51.770> so<00:04:54.190> it's

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
but whatever it's a round pipe so it's

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.070 
but whatever it's a round pipe so it's
really<00:04:55.640> good<00:04:56.120> to<00:04:56.150> play<00:04:56.480> it<00:04:56.750> with<00:04:56.900> some

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
really good to play it with some

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.910 
really good to play it with some
watertight<00:04:57.980> moves<00:04:58.930> of<00:04:59.930> course<00:05:00.260> it<00:05:00.500> also<00:05:00.680> has

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:00.920 
watertight moves of course it also has

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.420 
watertight moves of course it also has
the<00:05:01.310> steel<00:05:01.700> pipe<00:05:02.090> oh<00:05:02.420> wait<00:05:03.290> no<00:05:03.500> it's<00:05:03.740> rock<00:05:04.070> pipe

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
the steel pipe oh wait no it's rock pipe

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.880 
the steel pipe oh wait no it's rock pipe
it's<00:05:04.670> rock<00:05:05.000> type<00:05:05.390> and<00:05:05.660> still<00:05:06.020> types<00:05:06.320> which

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
it's rock type and still types which

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.230 
it's rock type and still types which
means<00:05:07.190> you<00:05:07.340> really<00:05:07.580> should<00:05:08.030> have<00:05:08.180> water<00:05:09.080> type

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
means you really should have water type

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.880 
means you really should have water type
which<00:05:11.240> will<00:05:11.510> probably<00:05:11.720> be<00:05:11.930> your<00:05:12.140> best<00:05:12.470> bet<00:05:12.830> for

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.290 
cannon now I haven't completely decided

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.450 
cannon now I haven't completely decided
this<00:06:10.330> but<00:06:11.330> I<00:06:11.450> might<00:06:12.020> teach<00:06:12.380> it<00:06:12.620> to<00:06:12.770> aqua<00:06:13.250> arm

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
this but I might teach it to aqua arm

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.930 
this but I might teach it to aqua arm
I'm<00:06:14.000> not<00:06:14.780> positive<00:06:15.140> as<00:06:15.740> of<00:06:16.010> this<00:06:16.190> moment<00:06:16.520> I

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
I'm not positive as of this moment I

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.660 
I'm not positive as of this moment I
think<00:06:17.270> I'm<00:06:17.660> gonna<00:06:17.810> sleep<00:06:18.230> on<00:06:18.650> it<00:06:18.980> and<00:06:19.010> think

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:19.670 
think I'm gonna sleep on it and think

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.180 
think I'm gonna sleep on it and think
about<00:06:20.030> it<00:06:20.300> because<00:06:21.110> I<00:06:21.290> might<00:06:21.590> want<00:06:21.830> to<00:06:21.950> teach

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
about it because I might want to teach

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.160 
about it because I might want to teach
it<00:06:22.430> cuz<00:06:22.610> it's<00:06:22.790> definitely<00:06:23.300> better<00:06:23.570> than<00:06:23.690> metal

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:24.170 
it cuz it's definitely better than metal

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.020 
it cuz it's definitely better than metal

so<00:06:27.030> after<00:06:27.449> six<00:06:27.749> gym<00:06:28.139> badges<00:06:28.439> you<00:06:28.770> can<00:06:29.129> finally

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
so after six gym badges you can finally

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.169 
so after six gym badges you can finally
leave<00:06:30.270> the<00:06:30.780> gym
