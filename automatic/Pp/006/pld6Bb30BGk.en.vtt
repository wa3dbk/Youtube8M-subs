and so is whatever del Bosque told his

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.039 
and so is whatever del Bosque told his
team<00:01:56.159> at<00:01:56.280> halftime<00:01:56.460> but<00:01:56.909> as<00:01:57.479> Spain<00:01:57.780> done

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
team at halftime but as Spain done

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.660 
team at halftime but as Spain done
collectively<00:01:58.770> as<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> team<00:01:59.100> they<00:01:59.460> looked

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
collectively as a team they looked

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.190 
collectively as a team they looked
pretty<00:01:59.909> disinterested<00:02:00.659> throughout<00:02:01.049> the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
pretty disinterested throughout the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.539 
pretty disinterested throughout the
whole<00:02:01.350> tournament<00:02:01.680> yet<00:02:02.189> they<00:02:02.310> found

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
whole tournament yet they found

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.160 
whole tournament yet they found
themselves<00:02:02.759> in<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.149> final<00:02:03.540> which<00:02:03.869> proves

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
themselves in the final which proves

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.440 
themselves in the final which proves
that<00:02:04.229> their<00:02:04.409> talent<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:04.920> undeniable<00:02:05.360> but<00:02:06.360> they

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
that their talent is undeniable but they

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.830 
that their talent is undeniable but they
don't<00:02:06.630> seem<00:02:06.810> as<00:02:06.960> invincible<00:02:07.200> as<00:02:07.500> they<00:02:07.590> won

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
don't seem as invincible as they won

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.109 
don't seem as invincible as they won
work<00:02:08.050> is<00:02:08.590> that<00:02:08.649> due<00:02:09.009> to<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:09.250> inevitable<00:02:09.550> wear

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
work is that due to the inevitable wear

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.430 
work is that due to the inevitable wear
and<00:02:10.269> tear<00:02:10.450> that<00:02:10.629> comes<00:02:10.810> from<00:02:10.899> playing<00:02:11.200> in<00:02:11.260> such

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
and tear that comes from playing in such

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.130 
and tear that comes from playing in such
a<00:02:11.470> high<00:02:11.800> level<00:02:11.830> for<00:02:12.489> such<00:02:12.670> a<00:02:12.700> long<00:02:12.940> time<00:02:13.140> have

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
a high level for such a long time have

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.869 
a high level for such a long time have
other<00:02:14.319> countries<00:02:14.709> figured<00:02:14.980> them<00:02:15.099> out<00:02:15.190> it's

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
other countries figured them out it's

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.309 
other countries figured them out it's
probably<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.269> combination<00:02:16.510> of<00:02:16.840> both<00:02:17.019> those

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
probably a combination of both those

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.229 
probably a combination of both those
things<00:02:17.349> so<00:02:18.129> not<00:02:18.280> winning<00:02:18.550> might<00:02:18.700> be<00:02:18.849> the<00:02:18.970> best

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
things so not winning might be the best

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.910 
things so not winning might be the best
thing<00:02:19.420> that<00:02:19.720> happened<00:02:20.050> to<00:02:20.080> them<00:02:20.260> but<00:02:20.650> now<00:02:20.769> they
