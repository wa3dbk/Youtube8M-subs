00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
area no I'm from I will try to feel is

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.639 
area no I'm from I will try to feel is
that<00:00:56.629> there<00:00:56.960> are<00:00:57.050> very<00:00:57.260> many<00:00:57.290> opportunities

make it fun and interesting and such
that<00:01:58.440> they<00:01:58.649> learn<00:01:59.190> something<00:01:59.550> that<00:01:59.880> is

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
that they learn something that is
