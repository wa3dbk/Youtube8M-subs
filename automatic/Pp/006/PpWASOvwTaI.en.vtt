00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
to the west of the lake there so if we

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
outside as well and then grindstone so

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.399 
outside as well and then grindstone so
if<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.310> just<00:01:29.729> loads<00:01:30.920> on<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.150> inside<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.869> it

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
if this just loads on the inside it's it

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.710 
if this just loads on the inside it's it
looks<00:01:34.439> really<00:01:34.829> cozy<00:01:35.009> it's<00:01:35.640> if<00:01:36.000> if<00:01:36.390> I've<00:01:36.570> got

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
looks really cozy it's if if I've got

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.679 
looks really cozy it's if if I've got
one<00:01:36.900> criticism<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.880> ceilings<00:01:39.270> are<00:01:39.390> quite

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
one criticism the ceilings are quite

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.630 
one criticism the ceilings are quite
high<00:01:41.659> they<00:01:42.659> look<00:01:42.840> much<00:01:43.110> higher<00:01:43.829> inside<00:01:44.310> than

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
high they look much higher inside than

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.690 
high they look much higher inside than
they<00:01:44.790> do<00:01:44.850> from<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.299> outside<00:01:45.770> so<00:01:46.770> go<00:01:47.369> in<00:01:47.520> here

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
they do from the outside so go in here

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.520 
they do from the outside so go in here
and<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.180> reason<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.509> might<00:01:48.659> appear<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.320> bit

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
and the reason it might appear a bit

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.649 
and the reason it might appear a bit
darker<00:01:50.100> than<00:01:50.189> normal<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.329> because<00:01:51.540> I've

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
darker than normal and is because I've

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.569 
darker than normal and is because I've
got<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.810> lighting<00:01:52.200> mod<00:01:52.380> called<00:01:53.040> realistic

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
got a lighting mod called realistic

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.039 
got a lighting mod called realistic
lighting<00:01:53.939> which<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.390> can<00:01:54.509> get<00:01:54.600> from<00:01:54.780> Steam

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
lighting which you can get from Steam

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.340 
lighting which you can get from Steam
Workshop<00:01:55.610> so<00:01:56.610> it's<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.719> reasonable<00:01:57.930> size

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
Workshop so it's a reasonable size

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.530 
Workshop so it's a reasonable size
actually<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:59.549> can<00:01:59.700> use<00:01:59.820> this<00:01:59.969> as<00:02:00.119> your<00:02:00.240> home
