00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:22.460
 you and I are walking up the path to 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:26.779
 the castle of rams as with the park is very beautiful 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.779
 personal we are interested in the castle itself 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:40.160
 the lake was probably the capital where it lived 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.850
 Earl Dracula 5s on it makes it 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.430
 a lot of advertising 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.820
 so is it true is n't it 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:50.840
 he does not know the means to hope that 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:57.190
 the film is so very beautiful with us 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.190
 took 25 years access and 15 children 5 themselves 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.390
 all looped as far as the dollar 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.440
 it's 15 dollars 15 euros 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:25.590
 20 15 dollars or paid for entry visible 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.399
 in the photo and now the castle will say enough 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.399
 right here 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.310
 look 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:39.640
 entrance seeing something burning burned merrell 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.720
 an old man is so small 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.299
 will be 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.299
 look carefully inside already
