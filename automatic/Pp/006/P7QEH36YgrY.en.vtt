actually now that I've experienced the
little<00:02:06.680> bit<00:02:06.799> of<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:06.979> demo<00:02:07.250> track<00:02:07.520> I'm<00:02:07.670> not

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
nervous about it and I think there'll be

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.290

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
something ready to happen but I am

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.559 
something ready to happen but I am
actually<00:02:13.370> looking<00:02:13.700> forward<00:02:14.120> I<00:02:14.270> had<00:02:14.360> a<00:02:14.420> very

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
actually looking forward I had a very

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.449 
actually looking forward I had a very
successful<00:02:14.840> drive<00:02:15.440> on<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.740> demo<00:02:15.890> tracks<00:02:16.250> I'm

looking<00:02:16.940> forward<00:02:17.300> to<00:02:17.330> it<00:02:19.090> then<00:02:20.090> it<00:02:20.360> was<00:02:20.660> time

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
looking forward to it then it was time

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.600 
looking forward to it then it was time
for<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.170> drivers<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:21.650> test<00:02:21.890> their<00:02:22.100> confidence

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610
