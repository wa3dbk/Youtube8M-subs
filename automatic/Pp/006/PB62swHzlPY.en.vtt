this<00:00:02.129> video<00:00:02.460> is<00:00:02.669> about<00:00:02.879> playing<00:00:03.179> chords<00:00:03.780> on

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
this video is about playing chords on

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.769 
this video is about playing chords on
the<00:00:04.110> fiddle<00:00:04.470> and<00:00:05.000> probably<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.120> most<00:00:06.299> common

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
the fiddle and probably the most common

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.089 
the fiddle and probably the most common
time<00:00:07.020> that<00:00:07.200> you<00:00:07.259> would<00:00:07.350> be<00:00:07.440> playing<00:00:07.649> chords

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
time that you would be playing chords

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.160 
time that you would be playing chords
would<00:00:08.220> be<00:00:08.370> back<00:00:08.639> up<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.179> I'm<00:00:09.960> actually

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
would be back up and I'm actually

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.230 
would be back up and I'm actually
referring<00:00:10.650> to<00:00:10.800> like<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:10.980> bluegrass<00:00:11.490> or<00:00:11.969> folk

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
referring to like a bluegrass or folk

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.600 
referring to like a bluegrass or folk
country<00:00:12.980> musician<00:00:13.980> here<00:00:14.250> rather<00:00:14.460> than

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
country musician here rather than

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.369 
country musician here rather than
someone<00:00:15.089> who<00:00:15.210> would<00:00:15.360> be<00:00:15.389> playing<00:00:15.809> classical

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
someone who would be playing classical

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.670 
someone who would be playing classical
and<00:00:16.529> reading<00:00:16.830> music<00:00:18.230> what<00:00:19.230> I'm<00:00:19.320> going<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.529> do

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
and reading music what I'm going to do

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.980 
and reading music what I'm going to do
is<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:19.890> show<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.189> some<00:00:20.490> simple<00:00:20.850> chords<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.510> I

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
is you show you some simple chords and I

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.750 
is you show you some simple chords and I
guess<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.470> technical<00:00:23.100> definition<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.699> a

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
guess the technical definition of a

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.720 
guess the technical definition of a
chord<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.320> three<00:00:25.320> notes<00:00:25.590> we're<00:00:26.460> going<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.670> be

chord is three notes we're going to be
playing<00:00:27.000> two<00:00:27.269> at<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.510> same<00:00:27.720> time<00:00:27.960> because<00:00:28.170> I'm

playing two at the same time because I'm

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.259 
playing two at the same time because I'm
Phil<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.859> can't<00:00:29.130> play<00:00:29.400> more<00:00:29.640> than<00:00:29.849> two<00:00:30.029> at<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.319 
Phil you can't play more than two at the

this<00:03:49.860> has<00:03:50.100> three<00:03:50.490> chords<00:03:50.910> you'll<00:03:51.750> be<00:03:51.870> playing

this has three chords you'll be playing
your<00:03:52.290> open<00:03:52.620> G<00:03:52.890> then<00:03:53.490> you'll<00:03:53.640> be<00:03:53.760> going<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.000> see

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
your open G then you'll be going to see

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.440 
your open G then you'll be going to see
you'll<00:03:55.350> be<00:03:55.380> going<00:03:55.680> back<00:03:55.950> to<00:03:55.980> G<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:56.610> then

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
you'll be going back to G and then

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:29.159

my<00:04:29.830> deal

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.750 

Oh

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.980 

and<00:04:40.760> I<00:04:40.880> think<00:04:40.940> a<00:04:41.150> lot<00:04:41.300> of<00:04:41.330> that<00:04:41.510> is<00:04:41.660> easier<00:04:41.930> to

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
and I think a lot of that is easier to

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.200 
and I think a lot of that is easier to
hear<00:04:42.290> if<00:04:42.380> you've<00:04:42.500> got<00:04:42.710> more<00:04:42.980> going<00:04:43.190> on<00:04:43.490> this<00:04:44.030> is

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
hear if you've got more going on this is

over to the two mill strings so you've

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.900 
over to the two mill strings so you've
got<00:05:39.740> first<00:05:39.950> position<00:05:40.610> on<00:05:40.790> DNA<00:05:41.300> now

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:51.730 

and<00:05:48.760> if<00:05:49.760> you<00:05:49.880> want<00:05:50.090> an<00:05:50.180> F<00:05:50.390> chord<00:05:50.870> go<00:05:51.230> to<00:05:51.290> a<00:05:51.380> low

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.060 

so<00:05:59.570> we<00:05:59.840> start<00:06:00.230> at<00:06:00.320> the<00:06:00.380> beginning<00:06:00.830> of<00:06:00.890> the

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
so we start at the beginning of the

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.290 
so we start at the beginning of the
alphabet<00:06:01.250> you've<00:06:01.760> got<00:06:02.000> a<00:06:02.300> here<00:06:03.850> B<00:06:04.850> is<00:06:05.030> it<00:06:05.210> the

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
alphabet you've got a here B is it the

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.410 
alphabet you've got a here B is it the
first<00:06:05.540> position<00:06:07.780> C<00:06:08.780> is<00:06:09.170> going<00:06:09.500> to<00:06:09.560> be<00:06:09.650> found<00:06:10.010> it

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:10.420 
first position C is going to be found it

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:18.959 
first position C is going to be found it
d1<00:06:11.420> and<00:06:11.810> a<00:06:12.200> low<00:06:12.560> two<00:06:15.130> D<00:06:16.130> is<00:06:16.340> open

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:18.969 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:26.539 

he<00:06:19.569> is<00:06:19.899> first<00:06:20.199> position<00:06:20.439> on<00:06:20.919> DNA<00:06:22.829> f<00:06:23.829> is<00:06:24.219> below<00:06:24.579> 2

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:26.549 
he is first position on DNA f is below 2

00:06:26.549 --> 00:06:33.680 
he is first position on DNA f is below 2
and<00:06:28.199> G<00:06:29.199> is<00:06:29.379> low<00:06:29.649> I'm<00:06:29.979> gonna<00:06:30.429> be<00:06:30.549> open<00:06:30.909> D<00:06:31.119> and<00:06:31.269> G

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.230 

so<00:06:34.560> there's<00:06:34.800> one<00:06:35.070> place<00:06:35.340> you<00:06:35.550> can<00:06:35.700> find<00:06:35.730> all

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
so there's one place you can find all

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.510 
so there's one place you can find all
the<00:06:36.450> notes<00:06:36.660> I<00:06:36.930> didn't<00:06:37.500> show<00:06:37.650> you<00:06:37.710> any<00:06:37.920> flats<00:06:38.250> or
