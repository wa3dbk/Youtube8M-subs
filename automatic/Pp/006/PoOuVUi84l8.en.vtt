00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 good so now we will show another 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.099
 thing that is very ugly too that is the 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.620
 change her dress here you see that 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.780
 in this part the left has this curve 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.150
 that in this part of the dress she does not 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.619
 It's not at all different. 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.570
 so we can use that 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.470
 photoshop tools to copy this 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:28.279
 part of here put here so I'll do 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.279
 now I'm going to press against the shift out and it's 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.300
 because I copy all edited content 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.890
 here for a law then this law here 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.050
 this visible part who is here 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.590
 underneath all edited under everything copied 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.469
 in a single law fell that what now 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:52.530
 I'll put it here. 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:56.730
 marquito make a selection so the so 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.079
 more or less then with that part 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.859
 select what I'll try 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.780
 against him he will create a new law in 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.689
 that this part that was selected 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.729
 will be inside us can 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:14.040
 handle easily now let's get 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:16.590
 here put here for what's here 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:22.110
 then press it against the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:27.479
 You can see here edith transform free 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.430
 transform transforms meaning beauty 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:35.270
 then the right button here I'll inflate 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.270
 legal horizontal peak 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:48.440
 so I'll try shaq way in that 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.730
 this dress looks more like 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.490
 ball 'here the first to the table is 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:02:01.260
 coming to do sanitation with the shirt 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:06.080
 first I'll put it here the way 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:08.759
 which more closely resembles the size of the other 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:14.070
 then tighten control have again I will 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:18.090
 I'll put it down here. 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.520
 also to the line with the table only to 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.380
 have an idea 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.390
 and here we will do the same 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.820
 thing that we did down here 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.180
 let's hold the alt click here to 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.370
 add a mask that also there 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.510
 so I'm going to do the same thing as I 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.300
 I made it down here 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.980
 I'll hold the audio or click here to 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.790
 add a mask that will sing 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.860
 All this law here I will stay here in 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:53.430
 blush so I'm adding now that 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:03:01.110
 Gradually, just the style I'm going to give 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:04.950
 zoom here I will do the same or 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:08.489
 decreases his chik wizard as he 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.739
 is approaching in the hand because the addiction 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:14.940
 go beyond the hand you see 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:17.959
 so it has to be smaller to dictate 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.959
 more details 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:26.060
 I chose b again here I am painting 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.060
 so here 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:36.780
 if I happen to pass my hand even though the 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.870
 People do for example did what I 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.480
 I ask x to reverse here for the 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.549
 black 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:48.420
 there I paint black does the opposite instead 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:51.900
 to add dress he pulls off why 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.569
 because here is a black mask then 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.680
 white reveals and black back mask 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.680
 again, then 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.400
 Here's an aut 1 to see qualifying 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.990
 ottosson dress details below 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.230
 we can paint free or because 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.790
 discovered only by the part of the dress nÃ© 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:56.390
 so here again there has to be a 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.390
 zoom b 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.819
 what a month 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:27.870
 It's good to change the zoom out here to see
