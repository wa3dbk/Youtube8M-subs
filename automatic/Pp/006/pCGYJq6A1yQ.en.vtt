00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
will curb some of the power without

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.370 
will curb some of the power without
detracting<00:01:41.729> from<00:01:41.970> dribbling<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.750> other<00:01:43.110> ball

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.249 
detracting from dribbling and other ball
control<00:01:43.860> skills<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.300> the<00:01:45.420> bit<00:01:45.570> way<00:01:45.960> used

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
control skills this is the bit way used

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.480 
control skills this is the bit way used
for<00:01:46.440> the<00:01:46.500> drag<00:01:46.710> flick<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.190> the<00:01:47.250> bit<00:01:47.369> you

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
for the drag flick this is the bit you

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.069 
for the drag flick this is the bit you
use<00:01:47.640> most<00:01:47.820> because<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.450> that's<00:01:48.840> where<00:01:48.990> you

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
use most because that that's where you

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.780 
use most because that that's where you
give<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.290> all<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.470> power<00:01:49.500> with<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.490> definitely

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
give it all the power with so definitely

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.899 
give it all the power with so definitely
the<00:01:51.210> power<00:01:51.450> will<00:01:51.630> be<00:01:51.780> reduced<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.909> yeah

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
the power will be reduced and yeah

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.730 
the power will be reduced and yeah
because<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.509> had<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.630> slight<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.170> bow<00:01:55.320> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
because you had a slight of the bow the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.800 
because you had a slight of the bow the
less<00:01:55.890> speed<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.250> can<00:01:56.340> give<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.610> ball<00:01:56.780> but<00:01:57.780> i

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
less speed you can give the ball but i

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.499 
less speed you can give the ball but i
think<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.490> really<00:01:59.490> good<00:01:59.610> flickers<00:02:00.000> they

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
think that the really good flickers they

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.780 
think that the really good flickers they
still<00:02:00.840> should<00:02:00.990> be<00:02:01.140> able<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:02.040> know<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.220> get

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
still should be able to you know to get

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.639 
still should be able to you know to get
enough<00:02:03.000> power<00:02:03.240> on<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:04.049> i<00:02:04.290> think<00:02:04.320> it's<00:02:04.590> a

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
enough power on it and i think it's a

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.499 
enough power on it and i think it's a
good<00:02:04.799> thing<00:02:04.979> because<00:02:05.159> with<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.880> with<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.090> really

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
good thing because with it with a really

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.509 
good thing because with it with a really
big<00:02:06.659> bowl<00:02:06.840> even<00:02:07.439> guys<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.619> technically<00:02:08.280> are

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
big bowl even guys that technically are

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.249 
big bowl even guys that technically are
not<00:02:08.700> very<00:02:08.850> well<00:02:09.119> can<00:02:09.630> still<00:02:09.840> give<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.019> ball

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
not very well can still give the ball

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.990 
not very well can still give the ball
hell<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.619> lot<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.769> speed<00:02:11.070> so<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.670> think<00:02:11.760> it

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
hell of a lot of speed so you think it

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.430 
hell of a lot of speed so you think it
will<00:02:12.060> make<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.269> it<00:02:12.690> will<00:02:12.810> certainly<00:02:12.989> make<00:02:13.140> it

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
will make a it will certainly make it

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.199 
will make a it will certainly make it
harder<00:02:13.769> to<00:02:13.799> do<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.160> drag<00:02:14.370> flick<00:02:14.640> i<00:02:14.820> think<00:02:15.090> now

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
harder to do the drag flick i think now

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.210 
harder to do the drag flick i think now
