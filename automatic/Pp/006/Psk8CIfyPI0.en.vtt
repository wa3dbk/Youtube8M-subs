00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.570 
seeing them as our worthy opponents then
and<00:02:54.790> only<00:02:55.000> then<00:02:55.209> can<00:02:55.480> we<00:02:55.810> finally<00:02:56.139> crush<00:02:56.650> them

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
and only then can we finally crush them

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:04.649 
and only then can we finally crush them
