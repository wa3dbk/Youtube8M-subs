00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
them and sometimes it's just very small

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.640 
them and sometimes it's just very small
so<00:02:32.489> for<00:02:32.670> example<00:02:33.090> this<00:02:33.540> one<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:33.840> got<00:02:34.170> for<00:02:34.410> like

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
so for example this one I got for like

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.539 
so for example this one I got for like
three<00:02:34.950> bucks<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:36.560> it's<00:02:37.560> just<00:02:37.769> like<00:02:37.950> this<00:02:38.130> very

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
three bucks and it's just like this very

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.229 
three bucks and it's just like this very
layered<00:02:38.880> lacy<00:02:39.510> type<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:40.140> shirt<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:41.239> the

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
layered lacy type of shirt and the

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.680 
layered lacy type of shirt and the
bottom<00:02:42.600> has<00:02:42.840> this<00:02:43.079> extra<00:02:43.650> layer<00:02:43.829> and<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:45.480> think

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
bottom has this extra layer and I think

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.819 
bottom has this extra layer and I think
that<00:02:45.900> defect<00:02:46.650> with<00:02:46.920> this<00:02:47.280> was<00:02:47.700> that<00:02:47.970> I

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
that defect with this was that I

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.080 
that defect with this was that I
remember<00:02:49.829> there<00:02:50.040> were<00:02:50.130> some<00:02:50.160> threads<00:02:50.700> coming

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
remember there were some threads coming

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.710 
remember there were some threads coming
out<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.359> it

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
out of it

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.039 
out of it
very<00:02:52.590> like<00:02:52.859> my<00:02:53.100> ear<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.639> then<00:02:54.540> maybe<00:02:54.780> like<00:02:54.989> a

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
very like my ear and then maybe like a

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.250 
very like my ear and then maybe like a
stain<00:02:55.410> somewhere<00:02:55.859> but<00:02:56.600> yeah<00:02:57.600> sometimes<00:02:58.079> it's

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
stain somewhere but yeah sometimes it's

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.449 
stain somewhere but yeah sometimes it's
like<00:02:58.410> barely<00:02:58.920> noticeable<00:02:59.579> so<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.620> don't<00:03:01.620> mind
