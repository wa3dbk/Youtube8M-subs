00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:11.081
 The clamp movement. 

00:00:11.847 --> 00:00:15.411
 The red represents the Roman troops. Blue those of Hannibal. 

00:00:15.856 --> 00:00:20.988
 When the Romans attacked, Hannibal's cavalry galloped in from behind. 

00:00:20.988 --> 00:00:23.787
 The Romans were completely surrounded. 

00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:25.995
 How do we apply this? 

00:00:30.252 --> 00:00:32.107
 Fall behind enemy lines ... 

00:00:36.023 --> 00:00:37.364
 attack from the rear ... 

00:00:40.873 --> 00:00:41.927
 and neutralize. 

00:00:44.875 --> 00:00:45.486
 Prepare to attack. 

00:00:45.486 --> 00:00:46.708
 You're going to get us all killed. 

00:00:46.708 --> 00:00:47.488
 They are my orders. 

00:00:47.488 --> 00:00:48.283
 I do not care. 

00:00:53.465 --> 00:00:55.233
 You have ignored orders. 

00:00:55.444 --> 00:00:57.004
 Just ... another one down, sir. 

00:00:57.004 --> 00:00:58.041
 Unacceptable. 

00:00:59.276 --> 00:01:01.249
 This academy represents honor ... 

00:01:01.913 --> 00:01:03.361
 value... 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.057
 loyalty. 

00:01:06.064 --> 00:01:07.085
 "I..." 

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:08.874
 "I am..." 

00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:09.927
 Hi brother. 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.892
 "...worthy!" 

00:01:10.892 --> 00:01:11.594
 ... I miss you, buddy. 

00:01:11.594 --> 00:01:12.725
 I miss you too. 

00:01:12.725 --> 00:01:14.441
 You are nothing! 

00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.116
 Our combat action stank thanks to you. 

00:01:17.906 --> 00:01:20.105
 Many, when they arrive here, they hate this place. 

00:01:24.613 --> 00:01:25.384
 Let's go! 

00:01:26.017 --> 00:01:27.217
 Do you want people to change? 

00:01:27.498 --> 00:01:29.362
 Then you're going to need people to follow you. 

00:01:32.129 --> 00:01:33.640
 There's a soldier inside you, Thomas. 

00:01:33.898 --> 00:01:37.353
 I can see. You need to see it. 

00:01:39.373 --> 00:01:41.948
 What does this mean? You go? 

00:01:52.432 --> 00:01:55.192
 This is not an instruction! Move, let's go! 

00:01:55.397 --> 00:01:56.011
 We are under attack. 

00:01:59.903 --> 00:02:01.667
 What the hell are those things? 

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:04.942
 Let's go! 

00:02:09.075 --> 00:02:09.487
 May Day! 

00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:21.439
 Stay close to me. I am your best chance of survival. 

00:02:23.504 --> 00:02:24.144
 This is holy war. 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.898
 You're good? 

00:02:26.898 --> 00:02:27.266
 Let's go! 

00:02:31.165 --> 00:02:31.867
 Boss! 

00:02:35.157 --> 00:02:35.697
 He drives! 

00:02:37.403 --> 00:02:38.076
 THIS AUTUMN 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.102
 THE HISTORY 

00:02:41.413 --> 00:02:42.124
 OF HALO 4 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:44.229
 BEGINS AT SUNSET 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.988
 May Day. May Day. Forward Unto Dawn. 

00:02:49.238 --> 00:02:50.866
 Immediate evac, 117. 

00:02:50.866 --> 00:02:52.021
 ReprodÃºzcalo again, please. 

00:02:52.467 --> 00:02:54.119
