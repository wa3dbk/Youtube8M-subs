00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.200
 Hello everyone, today I will show you how 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.250
 to make 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:13.340
 loop on beaver very budget option 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:16.400
 very cheap and easy to manufacture 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:23.029
 for this we need 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:25.890
 cable asks for one millimeter I 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:29.099
 I recommend using at least three 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.809
 millimeters cable why because 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.670
 when I put such a cable on beaver 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:39.710
 Babur large bar 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.090
 gnaws through the cable during the night is very easy 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.020
 together with a rope you will always come in handy 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.219
 such round teeth that are very you 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.789
 will help and in making the loop and 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:55.620
 setting the same for convenience 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:01.350
 use loop you will need 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:05.040
 such a carbine and such clamps 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:09.830
 aluminum cost of this version 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:15.869
 not more than 15 rubles 5 rubles 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:19.850
 cable 7 rubles clamp and 50 kopecks 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.850
 possible scenery 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:30.390
 round teeth already for what you could 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.620
 make a bend and the first thing we do 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:38.260
 make an ear where we will pass 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:40.390
 loop for this you first run 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:50.050
 two clamps 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:53.440
 loop cable do the fold and do 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:59.970
 so ku-ku-shka does not need to do 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:03.790
 very big so that you can 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:07.119
 tighten the loop is very easy and yet 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:11.200
 time it should be fixed like this 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:14.800
 here it turned out to be drying further 1 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:24.239
 clip that you missed it goes 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:27.510
 under the very ear of your fill here and 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:31.209
 round pliers pinch 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:36.720
 I need the cutting part as air 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.720
 to tighten in order for more water 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:49.820
 and the second clamp you refuel in to the most 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:53.660
 edge 2 tip that you have left 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:03:00.790
 bend but so that he does not stick with the other 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.790
 sides and also pull in 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:16.890
 You have such an ear 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:22.200
 mounted literally share refuel 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.200
 part of the cable 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.590
 lass you made you 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:36.180
 it turns out such a loop but that 's not all 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:41.170
 on this side you need to do a subgenre 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:44.910
 rope to make a small ring also 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.910
 fill two clips here 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:04:01.180
 and pushing together and you can 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:04.690
 preload is not fundamentally important 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.500
 also that he was not bruised and bristled 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.140
 Firstly 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:12.730
 you do not prick yourself with cable 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:14.040
 time will be swing but if you 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:19.210
 will clamp 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:23.140
 the very beginning of the cable he you never 

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:24.970
 face scale you don't hurt yourself and not yourself 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.810
 spoil the skin of animals which 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.810
 will fall further 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:38.110
 everything for your ready for use 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.650
 you need another carbine 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:44.980
 which you charge and when 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:48.520
 needing to set the loop you 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:54.600
 wrap around a tree and a carbine 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.600
 thread into the cable and just twist 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:03.120
 pull up to the tree all loop 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:06.880
 fixed your god will not break away 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:13.560
 to set the loop you do 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:13.560
 optimal loop size 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:21.690
 supposed beaver and then here 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.690
 a little bend 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:30.970
 for your will say so with 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:34.040
 each side of the loop 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:37.640
 you should set together a pickup 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:41.740
 beaver hedge 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:44.360
 trees and sticks and put on top 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.970
 cross shelf for which you sweat 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.630
 tie your loop is not basic 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.320
 mount 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:53.150
 where will the carbine be next 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.850
 fasten the main mount babor 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.490
 will tighten the loop 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.880
 the loop is tightened on csk because it asks 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.770
 open 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:07.850
 very easy to tighten all god hands 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:11.450
 woman does not go anywhere and right when 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:16.390
 wanting to escape nothing from him 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:19.190
 I can immediately tell who wants 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:23.530
 this way to catch beaver to 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:26.930
 use his fur hide 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:28.400
 then the video is not for you this way 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.430
 suitable only for those who want 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:34.910
 catch bobrov goal in order to save 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:37.460
 their land for the purpose of using meat 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:41.450
 beaver in food because as with 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:44.780
 tightening this beaver skin rope 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:47.600
 spoils it delays starting to beat 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:50.480
 tearing up his skin begins to gnaw on the rope and 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.270
 that kinda if so creative 

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:56.210
 use in water and no beaver 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:59.150
 opportunities when tightening the loop 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:03.230
 crawled ashore and for a long time 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:07.870
 Loop is a cable fit but 

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:11.830
 if you use it on shore means 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:14.390
 This cable does not fit yet I 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:17.320
 I advise you to use the cable no less 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.320
 three millimeters 

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.040
 thank you all bye bye
