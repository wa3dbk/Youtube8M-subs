00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
in the case and you can see how much

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.050 
in the case and you can see how much
room<00:02:03.590> there<00:02:03.770> is<00:02:03.920> and<00:02:04.159> I<00:02:04.250> mean<00:02:04.430> there<00:02:04.700> is<00:02:04.729> not

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
much I don't even know if this will work

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.999 
much I don't even know if this will work
in<00:02:07.369> in<00:02:07.909> reality<00:02:08.149> but<00:02:09.140> I'm<00:02:09.679> gonna<00:02:09.920> do

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
the bearings are there so I can turn the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.600 
the bearings are there so I can turn the
crank<00:02:17.860> all<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:19.100> way<00:02:19.190> around<00:02:21.430> cause<00:02:22.430> it's

crank all the way around cause it's
going<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:22.760> turn<00:02:22.940> around<00:02:23.090> thousands<00:02:23.780> of<00:02:23.870> times

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
going to turn around thousands of times

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.270 
going to turn around thousands of times
a<00:02:24.200> minute<00:02:24.819> when<00:02:25.819> it's<00:02:26.000> running<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.980> I<00:02:28.040> want<00:02:28.220> to

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
a minute when it's running and I want to

just<00:04:40.400> as<00:04:41.230> new<00:04:42.230> bearings<00:04:42.590> would<00:04:43.180> then<00:04:44.180> with

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
just as new bearings would then with

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.870 
just as new bearings would then with
these<00:04:44.450> I<00:04:44.780> can<00:04:46.840> turn<00:04:47.840> the<00:04:47.930> crank<00:04:48.460> up<00:04:49.460> and<00:04:49.700> down

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
these I can turn the crank up and down

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.270 
these I can turn the crank up and down
and<00:04:50.150> see<00:04:50.690> it's<00:04:51.080> catching<00:04:51.290> down<00:04:51.680> right<00:04:51.980> down<00:04:52.130> in

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
and see it's catching down right down in

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.870 
and see it's catching down right down in
here<00:04:52.370> somewhere

have<00:05:08.360> been<00:05:08.450> a<00:05:08.480> problem<00:05:08.780> then<00:05:09.470> I<00:05:09.560> could<00:05:09.710> easily

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
have been a problem then I could easily

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.740 
have been a problem then I could easily
destroy<00:05:10.310> the<00:05:10.610> engine
