Hey little Steves welcome in this tutorial on "How install the Optifine mod"

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.650
for 1.8.4 version

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.820
Before starting to download the mod, we have to download  the 1.8.4 Minecraft version

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.780
from our launcher

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.059
The method to download and install the Optifine Mod is very simple

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.530
We go to the official Optifine's site - link in description-

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.329
How you can see, there are different links each one corresponding to the Minecraft

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:00.879
and Optifine version

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:07.320
In this case, we only have the Minecraft 1.8.4 HD Ultra D4 version

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.430
So click on "Download"

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.780

00:01:51.880 --> 00:02:01.920
