depending on which one the obviously

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.160 
depending on which one the obviously
you're<00:00:52.649> depending<00:00:53.129> on<00:00:53.219> your<00:00:53.340> TV<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.170> stuff

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
you're depending on your TV and stuff

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.350 
you're depending on your TV and stuff
like<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.530> because<00:00:55.680> people<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.670> believe<00:00:57.120> they

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
like that because people I believe they

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.849 
like that because people I believe they
all<00:00:57.510> vary<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.260> if<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.699> have<00:00:59.969> unknown<00:01:00.859> Samsung

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
all vary so if you have unknown Samsung

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.840 
all vary so if you have unknown Samsung
TV<00:01:02.340> or<00:01:02.579> on<00:01:02.670> an<00:01:02.960> lg<00:01:03.960> tv<00:01:03.989> then<00:01:04.640> they<00:01:05.640> can<00:01:05.760> be

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
TV or on an lg tv then they can be

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.250 
TV or on an lg tv then they can be
different<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:07.229> for<00:01:08.070> me<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:09.780> stereo

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
different so for me and the stereo

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.100 
different so for me and the stereo
uncompressed<00:01:10.520> works<00:01:11.520> fine<00:01:12.950> and<00:01:14.869> you<00:01:15.869> don't

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
uncompressed works fine and you don't

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.690 
uncompressed works fine and you don't
have<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.380> really<00:01:16.650> change<00:01:16.890> any<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.159> these<00:01:17.369> I

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
have to really change any of these I

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.060 
have to really change any of these I
believe<00:01:17.759> but<00:01:18.720> these<00:01:19.229> are<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.500> things<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.830> have

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
believe but these are the things I have

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.130 
believe but these are the things I have
to<00:01:20.939> Dobie<00:01:21.330> digital<00:01:21.840> bit<00:01:22.770> stream<00:01:22.799> out<00:01:23.520> and

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
to Dobie digital bit stream out and

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.560 
to Dobie digital bit stream out and
stereo<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.409> compressed<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.250> that's<00:01:27.240> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
stereo and compressed and that's the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.420 
stereo and compressed and that's the
only<00:01:27.990> things<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.409> need<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.740> change<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.340> order

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
only things you need to change in order

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.789 
only things you need to change in order
to<00:01:30.290> make<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.530> perform<00:01:32.220> better<00:01:33.020> and<00:01:34.020> for<00:01:34.530> there

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
to make it perform better and for there

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.550
