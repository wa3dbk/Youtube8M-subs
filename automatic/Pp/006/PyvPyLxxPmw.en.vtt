00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
with the delay turn off the delay so

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.530 
with the delay turn off the delay so
open<00:01:09.880> this<00:01:10.880> is<00:01:11.060> a<00:01:11.090> rolling<00:01:11.960> pull<00:01:12.890> off<00:01:13.040> okay<00:01:13.700> so

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
open this is a rolling pull off okay so

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.520 
open this is a rolling pull off okay so
what<00:01:14.869> I<00:01:14.900> do

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
what I do

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.500 
what I do
edge<00:01:15.619> does<00:01:16.070> not<00:01:16.430> I<00:01:16.460> don't<00:01:16.729> believe<00:01:17.030> plays<00:01:17.330> it

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
edge does not I don't believe plays it

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.870 
edge does not I don't believe plays it
this<00:01:17.600> way<00:01:17.810> I<00:01:18.050> think<00:01:18.770> edge<00:01:18.950> uses<00:01:19.460> his<00:01:19.640> third

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
this way I think edge uses his third

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.990 
this way I think edge uses his third
finger<00:01:20.330> and<00:01:20.479> pulls<00:01:21.170> off<00:01:21.380> of<00:01:21.770> this<00:01:22.070> I<00:01:22.310> like<00:01:22.850> to

okay and then pull

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.760 
okay and then pull
so<00:02:18.580> it's<00:02:18.700> really<00:02:18.940> three<00:02:19.150> notes<00:02:19.530> but<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.560> got

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
so it's really three notes but you got

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:27.210 
so it's really three notes but you got
to<00:02:20.860> get<00:02:20.920> that<00:02:21.069> pinky<00:02:21.370> to<00:02:21.459> pull<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.040> should

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
to get that pinky to pull and you should

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.770 
to get that pinky to pull and you should
if<00:02:27.430> you<00:02:27.580> need<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.910> practice<00:02:28.330> that<00:02:28.360> now<00:02:28.629> I<00:02:28.660> think

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
if you need to practice that now I think

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.130 
if you need to practice that now I think
edge<00:02:29.170> might<00:02:29.830> do<00:02:30.069> this<00:02:30.280> he<00:02:30.610> might<00:02:30.760> use<00:02:30.940> these<00:02:31.180> he

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
edge might do this he might use these he

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.550 
edge might do this he might use these he
might<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:33.370> can<00:02:33.519> do<00:02:33.610> that<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:33.879> can<00:02:34.000> use<00:02:34.120> these

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
might you can do that you can use these

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.120 
might you can do that you can use these
so<00:02:35.560> you<00:02:35.590> play<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:35.830> B<00:02:38.700> so<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:39.819> can<00:02:39.940> do<00:02:40.000> it<00:02:40.090> those

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
so you play the B so you can do it those

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.440 
so you play the B so you can do it those
because<00:02:42.130> you<00:02:42.280> might<00:02:42.519> be<00:02:42.670> stronger<00:02:43.150> on<00:02:43.180> this

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
because you might be stronger on this

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.369 
because you might be stronger on this
this<00:02:43.959> ring<00:02:44.590> finger<00:02:44.920> right<00:02:45.780> but<00:02:46.780> I<00:02:46.810> like<00:02:47.140> to

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
want to strengthen and coordinate build

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.009 
want to strengthen and coordinate build
