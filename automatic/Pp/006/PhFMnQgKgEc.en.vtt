it can be smaller than this if you're

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.190 
it can be smaller than this if you're
only<00:00:44.789> making<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.239> small<00:00:45.510> amount<00:00:45.690> like<00:00:45.899> we<00:00:46.050> are

that<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.809> boil<00:00:50.180> so<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.510> doesn't<00:00:51.809> matter

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
that to a boil so it doesn't matter

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.720 
that to a boil so it doesn't matter
medium-high<00:00:52.530> heat<00:00:53.870> just<00:00:54.870> bring<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.469> boil

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.400 
just pour the milian in there you don't
want<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.640> oil<00:02:03.670> so<00:02:04.150> hot<00:02:04.360> that<00:02:04.510> it<00:02:04.660> gets<00:02:04.870> smoky

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
want the oil so hot that it gets smoky

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.840 
want the oil so hot that it gets smoky
if<00:02:05.590> it's<00:02:05.680> smoked<00:02:06.010> start<00:02:06.400> over<00:02:06.640> again<00:02:06.670> just

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
if it's smoked start over again just

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.109 
if it's smoked start over again just
wipe<00:02:07.330> it<00:02:07.479> out<00:02:07.600> and<00:02:07.750> start<00:02:07.960> over<00:02:08.020> again

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
wipe it out and start over again

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.750 
wipe it out and start over again
smoking<00:02:10.119> oil<00:02:10.390> is<00:02:10.630> actually<00:02:10.780> a<00:02:11.020> little<00:02:11.200> toxic

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
smoking oil is actually a little toxic

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.060 
smoking oil is actually a little toxic
so<00:02:12.760> you<00:02:13.690> want<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:13.930> put<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.140> millet<00:02:14.410> in<00:02:14.530> here<00:02:14.830> I

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
so you want to put the millet in here I

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.010 
so you want to put the millet in here I
just<00:02:15.580> mix<00:02:15.940> it<00:02:16.090> around<00:02:16.180> then<00:02:16.630> you<00:02:16.720> kind<00:02:16.930> of

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
just mix it around then you kind of

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.550 
just mix it around then you kind of
spoon<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:18.010> get<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.400> oil<00:02:18.580> on<00:02:19.240> each<00:02:20.080> of<00:02:20.380> the

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
spoon to get the oil on each of the

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.590 
spoon to get the oil on each of the
little<00:02:21.190> millet<00:02:21.490> kernels<00:02:21.820> as<00:02:21.940> much<00:02:22.090> as<00:02:22.240> you<00:02:22.330> can

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
little millet kernels as much as you can

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.350 
little millet kernels as much as you can
you<00:02:23.250> can<00:02:24.250> leave<00:02:24.400> it<00:02:24.520> on<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:24.670> higher<00:02:24.910> temperature

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
you can leave it on a higher temperature

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.810 
you can leave it on a higher temperature
in<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.720> beginning<00:02:28.980> again<00:02:29.980> not<00:02:30.340> an<00:02:30.520> exact

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
in the beginning again not an exact

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.300 
in the beginning again not an exact
science<00:02:31.050> you<00:02:32.050> can<00:02:32.260> use<00:02:32.500> you<00:02:32.920> know<00:02:33.010> slightly

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
science you can use you know slightly

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.040 
science you can use you know slightly
lower<00:02:33.580> temperature<00:02:33.850> slightly<00:02:34.600> higher<00:02:34.810> it

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
lower temperature slightly higher it

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.810 
lower temperature slightly higher it
doesn't<00:02:35.380> really<00:02:35.590> matter<00:02:35.890> which<00:02:36.100> is<00:02:36.310> toasting

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
doesn't really matter which is toasting

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.640 
doesn't really matter which is toasting
these<00:02:37.080> I'm<00:02:38.080> going<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.290> bring<00:02:38.410> it<00:02:38.500> down<00:02:38.590> a

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
these I'm going to bring it down a

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.009 
these I'm going to bring it down a
little<00:02:38.830> bit<00:02:39.040> so<00:02:39.250> I<00:02:39.280> don't<00:02:39.340> wind<00:02:39.640> up<00:02:40.019> burning

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
little bit so I don't wind up burning

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.020 
little bit so I don't wind up burning
the<00:02:41.080> oil<00:02:41.110> too<00:02:41.620> much<00:02:41.800> and<00:02:42.010> causing<00:02:42.489> it<00:02:42.580> to<00:02:42.640> smoke

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
the oil too much and causing it to smoke

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.830 
the oil too much and causing it to smoke
so<00:02:43.959> I<00:02:44.380> just<00:02:44.890> stir<00:02:45.100> it<00:02:45.130> around<00:02:45.310> like<00:02:45.670> this<00:02:45.940> you

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
so I just stir it around like this you

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.740 
so I just stir it around like this you
don't<00:02:46.930> have<00:02:47.050> to<00:02:47.290> stir<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.620> whole<00:02:47.769> time<00:02:48.750> you

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
don't have to stir the whole time you

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.910 
don't have to stir the whole time you
can<00:02:49.989> leave<00:02:50.110> it<00:02:50.260> for<00:02:50.350> a<00:02:50.440> little<00:02:50.470> bit<00:02:50.650> you<00:02:50.890> just

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
can leave it for a little bit you just

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.860 
can leave it for a little bit you just
don't<00:02:51.220> want<00:02:51.370> to<00:02:51.430> burn<00:02:51.730> it<00:02:51.760> you're<00:02:52.480> looking<00:02:52.780> to

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
don't want to burn it you're looking to

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.390 
don't want to burn it you're looking to
toast<00:02:53.110> it<00:02:53.290> not<00:02:53.500> burn<00:02:53.709> it<00:02:53.890> you'll<00:02:54.010> see<00:02:54.220> if<00:02:54.310> it

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
toast it not burn it you'll see if it

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.680 
toast it not burn it you'll see if it
gets<00:02:54.519> burnt<00:02:54.730> it<00:02:54.850> gets<00:02:54.970> kind<00:02:55.180> of<00:02:55.239> black<00:02:55.420> on<00:02:55.600> the

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
gets burnt it gets kind of black on the

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.360 
gets burnt it gets kind of black on the
bottom<00:02:55.989> a<00:02:56.260> little<00:02:56.590> that's<00:02:56.890> okay<00:02:57.190> but<00:02:57.340> you

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
bottom a little that's okay but you

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.449 
bottom a little that's okay but you
don't<00:02:57.580> want<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.760> do<00:02:57.820> that<00:02:57.940> too<00:02:58.180> much

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
don't want to do that too much

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.830 
don't want to do that too much
that's<00:03:00.459> where<00:03:00.700> stirring<00:03:01.090> can<00:03:01.239> help<00:03:01.450> keep<00:03:01.690> it

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
that's where stirring can help keep it

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.710 
that's where stirring can help keep it
from<00:03:01.959> getting<00:03:02.140> too<00:03:02.880> too<00:03:03.880> heated<00:03:04.120> on<00:03:04.360> any<00:03:04.510> one

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
from getting too too heated on any one

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.620 
from getting too too heated on any one
piece<00:03:04.959> of<00:03:05.380> millet<00:03:05.940> so<00:03:06.940> you'll<00:03:07.239> start<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.540> get

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
piece of millet so you'll start to get

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.530 
piece of millet so you'll start to get
this<00:03:07.780> really<00:03:08.080> nice<00:03:08.200> little<00:03:08.260> nutty<00:03:09.100> smell

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.970 
this really nice little nutty smell
smells<00:03:10.540> like<00:03:10.660> it's<00:03:10.840> toasting<00:03:11.290> grain<00:03:11.560> and<00:03:11.860> it

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
smells like it's toasting grain and it

soon enough you could do a little bit
more<00:03:36.580> than<00:03:36.730> this<00:03:36.880> a<00:03:37.240> little<00:03:37.510> bit<00:03:37.630> less<00:03:37.810> it

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
doesn't again have to be very specific
