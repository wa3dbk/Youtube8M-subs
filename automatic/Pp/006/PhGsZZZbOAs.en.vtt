00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
he gave some specifics on what is going

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.119 
he gave some specifics on what is going
to<00:02:16.689> be<00:02:16.780> nerf<00:02:17.019> now<00:02:17.230> he<00:02:17.290> didn't<00:02:17.680> give<00:02:17.860> like

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
to be nerf now he didn't give like

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.160 
to be nerf now he didn't give like
actual<00:02:18.489> numbers<00:02:19.030> or<00:02:19.209> anything<00:02:19.480> like<00:02:19.810> that<00:02:19.959> but

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
actual numbers or anything like that but

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.990 
actual numbers or anything like that but
he<00:02:20.290> he<00:02:20.739> said<00:02:21.069> that<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.540> hipfire<00:02:22.810> spread

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
he he said that the the hipfire spread

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.600 
he he said that the the hipfire spread
the<00:02:25.000> recoil<00:02:25.629> pattern<00:02:26.079> and<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.829> center<00:02:27.250> speed

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
the recoil pattern and the center speed

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.809 
the recoil pattern and the center speed
also<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:29.079> hipfire<00:02:29.290> raised<00:02:30.129> time<00:02:30.489> which<00:02:30.700> I

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
also the the hipfire raised time which I

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.960 
also the the hipfire raised time which I
believe<00:02:31.090> is<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.450> time<00:02:32.069> from<00:02:33.069> going<00:02:33.579> from<00:02:33.730> like

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
believe is the time from going from like

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.509 
believe is the time from going from like
sprinting<00:02:34.540> to<00:02:34.780> hipfire<00:02:35.140> spread<00:02:35.939> or<00:02:36.939> you<00:02:37.750> know

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
sprinting to hipfire spread or you know

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.660 
sprinting to hipfire spread or you know
from<00:02:39.519> sprinting<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.799> fully<00:02:41.799> accurate<00:02:42.040> hipfire

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
from sprinting to fully accurate hipfire

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.819 
from sprinting to fully accurate hipfire
it's<00:02:43.269> a<00:02:43.540> it's<00:02:43.840> like<00:02:43.930> steady<00:02:44.200> aim<00:02:44.409> pro<00:02:44.439> it's

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
it's a it's like steady aim pro it's

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.509 
it's a it's like steady aim pro it's
what<00:02:44.950> steady<00:02:45.220> aim<00:02:45.400> pro<00:02:46.319> augments<00:02:47.319> in<00:02:48.190> he<00:02:48.340> and

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
what steady aim pro augments in he and

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:49.979 
what steady aim pro augments in he and
he<00:02:48.579> said<00:02:48.760> he's<00:02:48.879> going<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.180> nerve<00:02:49.540> though<00:02:49.810> she's

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
he said he's going to nerve though she's

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.670 
he said he's going to nerve though she's
going<00:02:50.200> to<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:51.430> change<00:02:51.790> or<00:02:52.000> tweak<00:02:52.180> them<00:02:52.359> now<00:02:52.680> you

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
going to to change or tweak them now you

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.750 
going to to change or tweak them now you
know<00:02:53.739> he<00:02:53.859> could<00:02:54.040> change<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.549> for<00:02:54.639> the<00:02:54.700> better

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
know he could change it for the better

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.610 
know he could change it for the better
but<00:02:55.060> he<00:02:55.150> said<00:02:55.329> either<00:02:55.420> he's<00:02:55.720> gonna<00:02:55.989> nerf<00:02:56.379> the

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
but he said either he's gonna nerf the

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.970 
but he said either he's gonna nerf the
famas<00:02:57.090> so<00:02:58.090> it's<00:02:58.900> it's<00:02:59.230> not<00:02:59.470> that<00:02:59.680> much<00:02:59.829> of<00:02:59.859> a

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
famas so it's it's not that much of a

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.080 
famas so it's it's not that much of a
leap<00:03:00.189> to<00:03:00.310> assume<00:03:00.430> that<00:03:00.670> he's<00:03:00.760> going<00:03:00.879> to<00:03:00.939> make

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
leap to assume that he's going to make

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.089 
leap to assume that he's going to make
it<00:03:01.150> worse<00:03:01.540> or<00:03:01.810> make<00:03:01.959> those<00:03:02.139> aspects<00:03:02.590> worse<00:03:02.829> but

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
it worse or make those aspects worse but

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.129 
it worse or make those aspects worse but
what<00:03:03.250> he<00:03:03.340> did<00:03:03.639> say<00:03:03.939> and<00:03:04.180> he<00:03:04.239> said<00:03:04.510> explicitly

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:05.139 
what he did say and he said explicitly

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.250 
what he did say and he said explicitly
that<00:03:05.670> these<00:03:06.670> following<00:03:07.420> things<00:03:07.720> were<00:03:07.959> not

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
that these following things were not

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.330 
that these following things were not
going<00:03:08.650> to<00:03:08.799> be<00:03:08.920> changed<00:03:09.430> rate<00:03:09.760> of<00:03:09.790> fire<00:03:10.019> damage

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
going to be changed rate of fire damage

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.470 
going to be changed rate of fire damage
overall<00:03:12.340> range<00:03:12.700> and<00:03:13.090> in<00:03:14.019> magazine<00:03:14.560> size<00:03:15.480> so

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
overall range and in magazine size so

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.210 
overall range and in magazine size so
rate<00:03:16.780> of<00:03:16.900> fire<00:03:17.170> damage<00:03:18.449> damage<00:03:19.449> range<00:03:19.870> and<00:03:20.220> an

black<00:03:29.049> ops<00:03:29.169> the<00:03:29.680> famas<00:03:30.010> will<00:03:30.280> get<00:03:30.430> a<00:03:30.459> reduction

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
black ops the famas will get a reduction

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.479 
black ops the famas will get a reduction
in<00:03:31.180> center<00:03:31.569> speed<00:03:31.870> which<00:03:32.470> is<00:03:32.500> like<00:03:32.949> the<00:03:32.980> rubber

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
in center speed which is like the rubber

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.740 
in center speed which is like the rubber

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:44.409 
tweaked with and and that's about it and

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:46.649 
tweaked with and and that's about it and
they're<00:03:44.500> gonna<00:03:44.560> call<00:03:44.859> it<00:03:45.010> a<00:03:45.069> day<00:03:45.280> now<00:03:46.090> I<00:03:46.419> don't

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 
they're gonna call it a day now I don't

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.089 
they're gonna call it a day now I don't
know<00:03:46.870> if<00:03:46.900> many<00:03:47.169> of<00:03:47.290> you<00:03:47.440> are<00:03:47.560> aware<00:03:47.680> of<00:03:47.859> this

now<00:03:48.310> last<00:03:48.549> time<00:03:48.729> I<00:03:48.760> talked<00:03:49.060> about<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:49.359> famas<00:03:49.629> I

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
now last time I talked about the famas I

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.449 
now last time I talked about the famas I
only<00:03:49.989> talked<00:03:50.379> about<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.709> famas<00:03:50.979> and<00:03:51.190> some<00:03:51.340> of

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
only talked about the famas and some of

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.219 
only talked about the famas and some of
you<00:03:51.579> couldn't<00:03:51.940> really<00:03:52.180> get<00:03:52.359> past<00:03:52.659> the<00:03:52.930> idea

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:53.229 
you couldn't really get past the idea

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:55.619 
you couldn't really get past the idea
that<00:03:53.500> I<00:03:53.889> was<00:03:54.129> only<00:03:54.370> talking<00:03:54.790> about<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.299> famas

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
that I was only talking about the famas
