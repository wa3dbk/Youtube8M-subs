00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.689 
calves and his feet when he's swimming
so<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:20.779> lot<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.810> people<00:00:22.050> say<00:00:22.470> oh<00:00:22.800> it's<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.310> it's<00:00:23.609> a

so a lot of people say oh it's a it's a

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.640 
so a lot of people say oh it's a it's a
nutrition<00:00:24.150> thing<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.539> be<00:00:24.660> more<00:00:24.810> salt<00:00:25.230> or<00:00:25.619> you

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
nutrition thing you be more salt or you

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.349 
nutrition thing you be more salt or you
need<00:00:25.859> more<00:00:26.010> potassium<00:00:26.340> or<00:00:26.910> whatever<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.300> is

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
need more potassium or whatever it is

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.810 
need more potassium or whatever it is
but<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.199> fact<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.680> matter<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.519> lot

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
but the fact of the matter is is a lot

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.189 
but the fact of the matter is is a lot
of<00:00:29.910> studies<00:00:30.210> out<00:00:30.300> there<00:00:30.449> have<00:00:30.660> shown<00:00:30.900> recent

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
of studies out there have shown recent

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.470 
of studies out there have shown recent
science<00:00:31.769> has<00:00:31.890> displayed<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:33.030> it's<00:00:33.270> usually

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
science has displayed that it's usually

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.830 
science has displayed that it's usually
more<00:00:33.989> due<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.430> the<00:00:35.430> muscles<00:00:35.880> themselves<00:00:36.450> being

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
more due to the muscles themselves being

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.930 
more due to the muscles themselves being
out<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.110> shape<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.770> not<00:00:37.980> able<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.399> handle<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
out of shape and not able to handle the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.569 
out of shape and not able to handle the
training<00:00:39.480> load<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.710> beginning<00:00:40.890> I'm

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
training load and in the beginning I'm

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.250 
training load and in the beginning I'm
assuming<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.180> you're<00:00:42.390> you're<00:00:42.899> new<00:00:43.110> to

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
assuming that you're you're new to

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.510 
assuming that you're you're new to
swimming<00:00:43.620> because<00:00:43.890> you're<00:00:44.010> having<00:00:44.219> this

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
swimming because you're having this

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.430 
swimming because you're having this
issue<00:00:44.820> but<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.750> beginning<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.320> was

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
issue but in the beginning that was

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.959 
issue but in the beginning that was
something<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.860> really<00:00:46.890> struggled<00:00:47.550> with<00:00:47.610> too

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
something I really struggled with too

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.060 
something I really struggled with too
and<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.539> tried<00:00:48.750> all<00:00:48.870> kinds<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.170> sports<00:00:49.469> drinks

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
and I tried all kinds of sports drinks

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.639 
and I tried all kinds of sports drinks
and<00:00:50.219> try<00:00:51.030> drinking<00:00:51.239> pickle<00:00:51.840> juice<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.559> all

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
and try drinking pickle juice and all

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.170 
and try drinking pickle juice and all
that<00:00:52.800> stuff<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.280> help<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.820> none<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.090> it

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
that stuff to help it and none of it

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.479 
that stuff to help it and none of it
really<00:00:54.420> seemed<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.660> help<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:56.010> was<00:00:56.160> just

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
really seemed to help and it was just

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.580 
really seemed to help and it was just
something<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:57.030> went<00:00:57.480> away<00:00:57.600> with<00:00:57.960> time<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.469> I

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
something that went away with time and I

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.319 
something that went away with time and I
think<00:00:58.829> it's<00:00:58.949> just<00:00:59.039> because<00:00:59.250> you<00:01:00.059> know<00:01:00.149> my

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
think it's just because you know my

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.729 
think it's just because you know my
muscles<00:01:00.750> gotten<00:01:01.050> better<00:01:01.199> shape<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.680> that's

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
muscles gotten better shape and that's

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.799 
muscles gotten better shape and that's
what<00:01:01.980> I've<00:01:02.070> found<00:01:02.280> with<00:01:02.489> people<00:01:02.850> as<00:01:03.000> well<00:01:03.030> so

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
what I've found with people as well so

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.380 
what I've found with people as well so
you<00:01:04.439> know<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.619> can<00:01:04.799> do<00:01:04.920> some<00:01:05.129> stuff<00:01:05.220> before<00:01:05.760> to

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
you know you can do some stuff before to

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.300 
you know you can do some stuff before to
maybe<00:01:06.630> help<00:01:06.840> eat<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:07.590> your<00:01:07.799> muscles<00:01:07.979> don't

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
maybe help eat it so your muscles don't

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.310 
maybe help eat it so your muscles don't
get<00:01:08.490> quite<00:01:08.939> as<00:01:08.970> tight<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.900> can<00:01:10.049> do<00:01:10.140> some

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
get quite as tight you can do some

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.350 
get quite as tight you can do some
rolling<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:10.920> them<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.580> can<00:01:11.729> do<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> little<00:01:12.180> bit

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
rolling on them you can do a little bit

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.200 
rolling on them you can do a little bit
of<00:01:12.479> dynamic<00:01:12.869> stretching<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:14.220> go<00:01:15.030> on<00:01:15.180> a

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
of dynamic stretching so you can go on a

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.120 
of dynamic stretching so you can go on a
stair<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.720> can<00:01:15.869> drop<00:01:16.080> your<00:01:16.320> your<00:01:16.650> heel<00:01:16.920> off

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
stair you can drop your your heel off

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.380 
stair you can drop your your heel off
the<00:01:17.220> stair<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.700> then<00:01:17.820> come<00:01:18.000> up<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:18.240> your<00:01:18.330> toes

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
the stair and then come up on your toes

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.570 
the stair and then come up on your toes
and<00:01:18.960> then<00:01:19.049> come<00:01:19.200> back<00:01:19.229> down<00:01:19.380> open<00:01:20.340> your<00:01:20.369> toes

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
and then come back down open your toes

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.510 
and then come back down open your toes
and<00:01:20.970> then<00:01:21.030> back<00:01:21.240> down<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:22.409> may<00:01:22.650> help<00:01:22.920> but

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
and then back down that may help but

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.820 
and then back down that may help but
really<00:01:24.030> it's<00:01:24.299> just<00:01:24.540> putting<00:01:25.020> at<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.290> time<00:01:25.500> doing

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
really it's just putting at a time doing

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.770 
really it's just putting at a time doing
some<00:01:26.070> specific<00:01:26.310> kicking<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.420> really<00:01:27.630> get

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
some specific kicking to really get

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.539 
some specific kicking to really get
those<00:01:27.900> muscles<00:01:28.170> strong<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.950> sticking<00:01:29.340> with

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
those muscles strong and sticking with

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.700 
those muscles strong and sticking with
it<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.759> it's<00:01:30.390> going<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.630> not<00:01:30.960> be<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.320> fun<00:01:31.590> at

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
it and it's going to not be so fun at

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.580 
it and it's going to not be so fun at
first<00:01:31.979> but<00:01:32.420> you<00:01:33.420> know<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.570> do<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:33.990> stick

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
first but you know you do that stick

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.109 
first but you know you do that stick
with<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.890> long<00:01:34.920> enough<00:01:35.040> those<00:01:35.460> cramps<00:01:35.700> will<00:01:35.939> go

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
with it long enough those cramps will go

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:36.620 
with it long enough those cramps will go
away

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
away
