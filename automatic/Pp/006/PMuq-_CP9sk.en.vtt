00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.830
 hello in this video only very briefly 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.360
 Shown as under windows 8 in the 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.600
 safe mode come or 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.519
 at least in the good selection menu around there 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.800
 make a corresponding selection 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.390
 in that windows 8 among other things the 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.730
 aero surface thrown overboard 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.560
 it is so fast that the users 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.420
 often not the right point 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.230
 get hold of the input 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.390
 perform 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.070
 that's why there are several windows 8 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.680
 possibilities here one time 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.469
 shown we are already logged in 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.120
 press on windows and there I come in 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:44.050
 the settings we have here the pc 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.600
 attitudes because it gets on it again 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.649
 then we have in general we start 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.839
 right down we have here 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.960
 expanded state to restart now 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:57.399
 Let's just click on it here 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:01.200
 Troubleshooting advanced options 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:03.980
 windows start settings 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.990
 select restart 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.220
 and that was it already here 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.890
 now just the corresponding number 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.240
 click which we just want to choose 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.060
 I'm going in safe 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.400
 activated mode with network operators 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.290
 So I just push the five here 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.170
 my keyboard 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.090
 the whole course was booted long 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.380
 here again on the login screen here 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.380
 of course logged in now 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.060
 That's it 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.200
 At least for this possibility there is 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.119
 I will do another one now 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.439
 easily again restart with 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.189
 old f4 then you choose to restart 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.750
 So we're back to ours 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.180
 metro-surface we go back to 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.640
 our desktop then i push windows 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.149
 and he will click on the execute dialog 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.030
 to get 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.570
 cmd at a prompt 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.679
 to open 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:00.530
 then here just shutdown for the 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:02.979
 complete parameter / question mark 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.840
 then we get the ones listed here 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:09.080
 Here we see, for example, parameters for 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.519
 the computer restart parameters for 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.830
 the options for the advanced 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:15.620
 Start menu and we have the parameter t 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.450
 who sets a time when the calculator 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.220
 the new battle should not be 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.290
 omit if we leave that off 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.920
 then the calculator needs about one 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.920
 minute until he executes the command 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.920
 shut down 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.330
 I'll let that go away then 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.980
 keep the indication in seconds 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.980
 send me the whole thing off 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:49.910
 the dialogue that fell all the way down 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:51.590
 we can close and are already 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.240
 We're back in our options menu here 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.920
 back to the problem treatment exactly 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.630
 the same as extended 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.280
 Settings prick settings and so on 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.880
 on and on 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.880
 OK
