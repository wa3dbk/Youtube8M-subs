mechanism<00:01:54.689> this<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.530> me<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.100> most

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
mechanism this to me is the most

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.850 
mechanism this to me is the most
difficult<00:01:56.460> part<00:01:56.759> because<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:58.409> focusing

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
difficult part because the focusing

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.219 
difficult part because the focusing
screen<00:01:58.890> floats<00:01:59.820> between<00:02:00.149> two<00:02:01.049> different

screw<00:02:01.649> mounds<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.579> find<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.030> very<00:02:03.060> tricky

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
screw mounds and I find it very tricky

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.959 
screw mounds and I find it very tricky
to<00:02:04.170> make<00:02:04.320> sure<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.740> it's<00:02:04.920> level<00:02:05.070> when<00:02:05.520> you're

you're on a tripod so notice what

you're on a tripod so notice what

flipped<00:02:30.599> you<00:02:31.409> will<00:02:31.709> probably<00:02:31.980> need<00:02:32.340> an
