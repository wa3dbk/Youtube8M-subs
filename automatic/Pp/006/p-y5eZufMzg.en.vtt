the<00:00:02.520> Imagination<00:00:03.179> Station<00:00:03.210> right<00:00:03.689> now<00:00:03.750> I'm

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
the Imagination Station right now I'm

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.690 
the Imagination Station right now I'm
joined<00:00:04.470> by<00:00:04.620> Jeff<00:00:05.549> Stevenson<00:00:06.540> and<00:00:07.370> we're<00:00:08.370> going

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
joined by Jeff Stevenson and we're going

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.410 
joined by Jeff Stevenson and we're going
to<00:00:08.730> cloak<00:00:09.630> us<00:00:10.019> in<00:00:10.469> invisibility<00:00:11.120> can<00:00:12.120> we<00:00:12.240> do

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
to cloak us in invisibility can we do

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.240 
to cloak us in invisibility can we do
this<00:00:12.570> well<00:00:13.080> if<00:00:13.590> we're<00:00:13.740> gonna<00:00:13.799> be<00:00:13.950> doing

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
this well if we're gonna be doing

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.530 
this well if we're gonna be doing
anything<00:00:14.429> with<00:00:14.519> invisibility<00:00:14.880> we<00:00:15.150> first<00:00:15.420> have

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
anything with invisibility we first have

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.359 
anything with invisibility we first have
to<00:00:15.570> learn<00:00:15.750> something<00:00:16.020> about<00:00:16.199> light<00:00:16.500> okay<00:00:17.130> all

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
to learn something about light okay all

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.980 
to learn something about light okay all
right<00:00:17.550> let's<00:00:18.000> do<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.210> it's<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.480> first<00:00:18.690> step<00:00:18.720> to

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
right let's do that it's a first step to

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.120 
right let's do that it's a first step to
learning<00:00:19.170> about<00:00:19.260> visibility<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:19.980> then

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
learning about visibility and then

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.550 
learning about visibility and then
learning<00:00:20.279> about<00:00:20.430> invisibility<00:00:21.420> so<00:00:21.990> I'm<00:00:22.260> a

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
learning about invisibility so I'm a

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.740 
learning about invisibility so I'm a
really<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.010> really<00:00:23.310> classic<00:00:23.660> experiment<00:00:24.660> that

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
really a really classic experiment that

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.060 
really a really classic experiment that
you<00:00:24.869> can<00:00:24.900> do<00:00:25.080> at<00:00:25.199> home<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.619> take<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.800> pencil

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
you can do at home is to take a pencil

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.880 
you can do at home is to take a pencil
and<00:00:26.250> put<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.939> in<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.300> glass<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.720> water<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.380> if

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
and put it in a glass of water and if

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.769 
and put it in a glass of water and if
you<00:00:29.010> kind<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.310> get<00:00:29.519> down<00:00:29.550> on<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.300> level<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.660> the

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
you kind of get down on the level of the

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.139 
you kind of get down on the level of the
water<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.230> can<00:00:31.410> see<00:00:31.590> my<00:00:31.830> level<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.730> what's

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
water you can see my level that what's

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.360 
water you can see my level that what's
happening<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.510> our<00:00:33.570> pencil<00:00:34.020> there<00:00:34.140> Chris<00:00:34.440> it

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
happening to our pencil there Chris it

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.600 
happening to our pencil there Chris it
appears<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.239> change<00:00:36.270> size<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.469> almost<00:00:38.340> even

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
appears to change size and almost even

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.650 
appears to change size and almost even
shape<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.270> little<00:00:39.390> bit

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
shape a little bit

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.540 
shape a little bit
yeah<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.110> looks<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.829> looks<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.129> little<00:00:41.219> bent

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
yeah it looks it looks a little bent

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.639 
yeah it looks it looks a little bent
right<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.690> that's<00:00:42.840> because<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.469> light

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
right and and that's because the light

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.160 
right and and that's because the light
is<00:00:43.829> being<00:00:44.040> refracted<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:45.360> which<00:00:45.510> refracted

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
is being refracted so which refracted

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.420 
is being refracted so which refracted
light<00:00:46.200> just<00:00:46.410> means<00:00:46.559> Bentley

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
light just means Bentley

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.580 
light just means Bentley
so<00:00:47.579> as<00:00:47.760> light<00:00:48.059> travels<00:00:48.480> from<00:00:48.600> air<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.140> water<00:00:49.260> it

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
so as light travels from air to water it

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.799 
so as light travels from air to water it
actually<00:00:49.920> bends<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.309> little<00:00:50.520> bit<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.910> it's

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
actually bends a little bit and it's

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:52.729 
actually bends a little bit and it's
different<00:00:51.989> for<00:00:52.140> different<00:00:52.199> material<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:52.680> if

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
different for different material so if

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.139 
different for different material so if
you<00:00:52.800> wanna<00:00:52.920> take<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.100> pencil<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.879> go<00:00:53.940> ahead<00:00:54.030> and

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
you wanna take a pencil and go ahead and

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.520 
you wanna take a pencil and go ahead and
put<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.899> container<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.230> canola

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
put it in this is a container of canola

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.680 
put it in this is a container of canola
oil<00:00:55.680> you'll<00:00:56.430> actually<00:00:56.610> notice<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.300> bends

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
oil you'll actually notice that it bends

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.840 
oil you'll actually notice that it bends
a<00:00:57.870> little<00:00:57.899> more<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:59.160> that's<00:00:59.280> because<00:00:59.640> that

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
a little more and that's because that

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.849 
a little more and that's because that
their<00:01:00.030> light<00:01:00.690> travels<00:01:01.199> through<00:01:01.289> canola<00:01:01.680> oil

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
their light travels through canola oil

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.380 
their light travels through canola oil
at<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> little<00:01:02.550> bit<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.760> different<00:01:03.120> speed

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
at a little bit of a different speed

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.240 
at a little bit of a different speed
than<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.750> does<00:01:03.899> through<00:01:03.930> water<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.100> can

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
than it does through water so you can

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.160 
than it does through water so you can
try<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.430> out<00:01:05.580> at<00:01:05.729> home<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:06.030> can<00:01:06.150> do<00:01:06.240> lots<00:01:07.080> of

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
try this out at home you can do lots of

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.240 
try this out at home you can do lots of
different<00:01:07.229> materials<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.860> see<00:01:07.979> what

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
different materials to see what

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.710 
different materials to see what
materials<00:01:08.760> light<00:01:09.270> travels<00:01:09.659> through

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
materials light travels through

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.030 
materials light travels through
different<00:01:09.900> speeds<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.619> probably<00:01:10.799> heard

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
different speeds and you probably heard

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.710 
different speeds and you probably heard
that<00:01:11.070> light<00:01:11.970> always<00:01:12.119> travels<00:01:12.210> at<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.540> same

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
that light always travels at the same

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.440 
that light always travels at the same
speed<00:01:12.890> but<00:01:13.890> that's<00:01:14.189> actually<00:01:14.430> only<00:01:15.060> true<00:01:15.270> for

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
speed but that's actually only true for

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.090 
speed but that's actually only true for
certain<00:01:15.750> material<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:16.740> I'm<00:01:16.830> sure<00:01:16.979> the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
certain material so I'm sure the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.080 
certain material so I'm sure the
troubles<00:01:17.340> are<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.490> same<00:01:17.610> speed<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.939> vacuum

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
troubles are the same speed in a vacuum

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.270 
troubles are the same speed in a vacuum
as<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.540> does<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:18.810> water<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.830> different<00:01:20.070> than

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
as it does in water it's different than

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.340 
as it does in water it's different than
canola<00:01:20.610> oil<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:21.150> if<00:01:21.930> we<00:01:22.049> want<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.229> make

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
canola oil so if we want to make

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.410 
canola oil so if we want to make
something<00:01:22.590> invisible<00:01:22.710> what<00:01:23.670> we<00:01:23.909> can<00:01:24.090> do<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.390> a

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
something invisible what we can do is a

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.090 
something invisible what we can do is a
lot<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.750> people<00:01:24.900> will<00:01:24.990> say<00:01:25.170> oh<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.560> have<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.830> clear

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
lot of people will say oh I have a clear

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.940 
lot of people will say oh I have a clear
rod<00:01:26.310> clear<00:01:27.150> water<00:01:27.390> would<00:01:28.320> be<00:01:28.409> invisible<00:01:28.619> right

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
rod clear water would be invisible right

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.730 
rod clear water would be invisible right
but<00:01:29.310> as<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.939> can<00:01:30.060> clearly<00:01:30.270> see<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.840> can<00:01:31.470> still

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
but as you can clearly see you can still

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.530 
but as you can clearly see you can still
see<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.280> rod<00:01:32.460> right<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.030> can<00:01:33.150> see<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.420> the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
see the rod right you can see it in the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
see the rod right you can see it in the
water<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.869> can<00:01:33.960> see<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.170> out<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.380> water

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
water you can see the out of the water

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.690 
water you can see the out of the water
so<00:01:34.920> why<00:01:35.009> don't<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.189> go<00:01:35.280> ahead<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.460> take<00:01:35.640> a

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
so why don't you go ahead and take a

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.910 
so why don't you go ahead and take a
clear<00:01:35.970> rod<00:01:36.119> okay<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.780> put<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.500> into<00:01:37.890> our

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
clear rod okay and put it into our

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.620 
clear rod okay and put it into our
canola<00:01:38.460> oil<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.880> let's<00:01:39.030> see<00:01:39.210> what<00:01:39.329> happens

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
canola oil and let's see what happens

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.100 
canola oil and let's see what happens
and<00:01:39.750> do<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.900> kind<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.140> slowly<00:01:41.750> you<00:01:42.750> can<00:01:42.869> see

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
and do it kind of slowly you can see

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.950 
and do it kind of slowly you can see
that<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.530> actually<00:01:43.950> looks<00:01:44.189> like<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.720> can't

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
that it actually looks like it you can't

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.210 
that it actually looks like it you can't
really<00:01:46.140> see<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.530> anymore<00:01:46.740> once<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.100> enters

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
really see it anymore once it enters

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.580 
really see it anymore once it enters
that<00:01:47.399> canola<00:01:47.700> oil<00:01:48.079> we<00:01:49.079> have<00:01:49.200> pulled<00:01:49.439> it

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
that canola oil we have pulled it

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.109 
that canola oil we have pulled it
disappearing<00:01:50.159> act<00:01:50.430> yeah<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.729> put<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> little

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
disappearing act yeah you put a little

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.460 
disappearing act yeah you put a little
disappear<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.509> what's<00:01:51.930> actually<00:01:52.020> going<00:01:52.290> on

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
disappear and what's actually going on

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.289 
disappear and what's actually going on
here<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:52.860> light<00:01:53.250> travels<00:01:53.820> at<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.000> same

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
here is that light travels at the same

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.319 
here is that light travels at the same
speed<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:54.990> glass<00:01:55.799> as<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.880> does<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.270> that

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
speed in that glass as it does in that

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.420 
speed in that glass as it does in that
canola<00:01:57.719> oil<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.530> there's<00:01:58.680> no<00:01:58.829> refracted<00:01:59.399> light

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
canola oil so there's no refracted light

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.190 
canola oil so there's no refracted light
and<00:01:59.759> as<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.420> know<00:02:00.509> glass<00:02:00.719> doesn't<00:02:01.049> reflect

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
and as you know glass doesn't reflect

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.620 
and as you know glass doesn't reflect
light<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:01.710> refract<00:02:02.579> no<00:02:02.850> refracted<00:02:03.299> light<00:02:03.329> no

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
light so refract no refracted light no

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.350 
light so refract no refracted light no
reflected<00:02:03.960> light<00:02:04.340> disappears<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:06.180> what's

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
reflected light disappears so what's

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.910 
reflected light disappears so what's
really<00:02:06.450> cool<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.049> set<00:02:07.320> up<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.619> little

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
really cool is that I set up a little

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.100 
really cool is that I set up a little
kind<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.399> layering<00:02:08.759> here<00:02:09.209> where<00:02:09.390> oil<00:02:09.569> floats

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
kind of a layering here where oil floats

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.300 
kind of a layering here where oil floats
on<00:02:10.259> top<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.500> water<00:02:10.679> because<00:02:10.860> it's<00:02:10.950> less<00:02:11.129> dense

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
on top of water because it's less dense

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.860 
on top of water because it's less dense
so<00:02:11.550> you'll<00:02:11.700> see<00:02:11.879> this<00:02:12.060> you'll<00:02:12.629> see<00:02:12.780> it

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
so you'll see this you'll see it

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.860 
so you'll see this you'll see it
disappear

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
disappear

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.020 
disappear
the<00:02:13.930> top<00:02:14.250> reappear<00:02:15.250> at<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.459> bottom<00:02:15.760> so<00:02:16.000> you

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
the top reappear at the bottom so you

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.670 
the top reappear at the bottom so you
can<00:02:16.120> see<00:02:16.390> it<00:02:16.480> in<00:02:16.540> air<00:02:16.750> you<00:02:16.989> see<00:02:17.290> it<00:02:17.560> in<00:02:17.620> the

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
can see it in air you see it in the

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.890 
can see it in air you see it in the
water<00:02:17.860> but<00:02:18.489> you<00:02:18.580> can't<00:02:18.849> see<00:02:19.090> it<00:02:19.209> in<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.540> canola

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
water but you can't see it in the canola

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.449 
water but you can't see it in the canola
oil

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
oil

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.970 
oil
very<00:02:21.459> very<00:02:22.060> cool<00:02:22.480> sign<00:02:22.780> it's<00:02:22.989> invisible

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
very very cool sign it's invisible

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.780 
very very cool sign it's invisible
visible<00:02:24.879> yeah<00:02:25.690> very<00:02:26.590> cool<00:02:26.830> stuff<00:02:27.099> right<00:02:27.370> so

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
visible yeah very cool stuff right so

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.449 
visible yeah very cool stuff right so
I've<00:02:28.450> got<00:02:28.659> kind<00:02:28.780> of<00:02:28.870> an<00:02:28.989> even<00:02:29.230> larger<00:02:29.860> beaker

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
I've got kind of an even larger beaker

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.699 
I've got kind of an even larger beaker
over<00:02:30.700> here<00:02:30.909> right<00:02:31.239> and<00:02:31.450> as<00:02:31.989> you<00:02:32.230> can<00:02:32.349> see<00:02:32.409> I've

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
over here right and as you can see I've

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.319 
over here right and as you can see I've
got<00:02:32.980> this<00:02:33.159> thing<00:02:33.340> filled<00:02:33.700> with<00:02:33.849> canola<00:02:34.120> oil

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
got this thing filled with canola oil

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.300 
got this thing filled with canola oil
and<00:02:34.569> there's<00:02:35.290> actually<00:02:35.680> a<00:02:35.709> test<00:02:36.040> tube

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
and there's actually a test tube

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.680 
and there's actually a test tube
floating<00:02:36.849> inside<00:02:37.090> of<00:02:37.209> here<00:02:37.329> now<00:02:37.420> I<00:02:37.450> should

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
floating inside of here now I should

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.720 
floating inside of here now I should
warn<00:02:37.840> you<00:02:37.930> that<00:02:38.170> we're<00:02:38.590> using<00:02:38.739> a<00:02:38.890> lot<00:02:39.040> of<00:02:39.069> Pyrex

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
warn you that we're using a lot of Pyrex

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.059 
Pyrex glass so if you're gonna do this
at<00:02:43.540> home<00:02:43.569> you<00:02:43.720> really<00:02:44.019> want<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.200> grab<00:02:44.379> one<00:02:44.680> of

at home you really want to grab one of

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.380 
at home you really want to grab one of
these<00:02:45.159> Pyrex<00:02:45.579> bowls<00:02:45.849> okay

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
these Pyrex bowls okay

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.720 
these Pyrex bowls okay
I<00:02:46.420> usually<00:02:46.599> say<00:02:46.870> Pyrex<00:02:47.260> on<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.500> body<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:47.950> this

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
I usually say Pyrex on the body and this

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.309 
I usually say Pyrex on the body and this
few<00:02:49.120> of<00:02:49.209> those<00:02:49.299> laying<00:02:49.510> around<00:02:49.629> home<00:02:49.959> yeah

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
few of those laying around home yeah

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.830 
few of those laying around home yeah
yeah<00:02:50.440> exactly<00:02:50.560> so<00:02:51.099> this<00:02:51.459> glass<00:02:51.730> works<00:02:52.540> with

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
yeah exactly so this glass works with

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.660 
yeah exactly so this glass works with
Wesson<00:02:53.410> canola<00:02:53.769> oil<00:02:54.010> it's<00:02:54.190> very<00:02:54.370> very

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
Wesson canola oil it's very very

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.759 
Wesson canola oil it's very very
specific<00:02:55.329> kind<00:02:55.810> of<00:02:55.870> at-home<00:02:56.079> stuff<00:02:56.500> you<00:02:56.620> have

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
specific kind of at-home stuff you have

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.250 
specific kind of at-home stuff you have
to<00:02:56.920> have<00:02:57.099> so<00:02:57.400> we<00:02:58.150> have<00:02:58.750> this<00:02:58.840> test<00:02:59.079> tube

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
to have so we have this test tube

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.330 
to have so we have this test tube
floating<00:02:59.590> in<00:02:59.680> here<00:02:59.829> and<00:02:59.920> I<00:02:59.980> want<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:00.190> kind<00:03:00.250> of

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
floating in here and I want to kind of

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.770 
floating in here and I want to kind of
show<00:03:00.459> you<00:03:00.549> how<00:03:00.670> I<00:03:00.700> did<00:03:00.819> this<00:03:01.090> I<00:03:01.239> actually<00:03:01.390> if<00:03:01.690> I

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
show you how I did this I actually if I

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.690 
show you how I did this I actually if I
put<00:03:01.959> a<00:03:01.989> test<00:03:02.230> tube<00:03:02.470> inside<00:03:02.859> of<00:03:03.159> the<00:03:03.250> canola<00:03:03.489> oil

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
put a test tube inside of the canola oil

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.539 
put a test tube inside of the canola oil
you<00:03:04.239> can<00:03:04.420> still<00:03:04.629> see<00:03:04.840> it<00:03:04.930> right<00:03:05.470> but<00:03:06.400> that's

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
you can still see it right but that's

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.069 
you can still see it right but that's
because<00:03:06.730> there's<00:03:07.000> air<00:03:07.269> inside<00:03:07.480> of<00:03:07.750> that<00:03:07.870> test

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
because there's air inside of that test

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:08.759 
because there's air inside of that test
-<00:03:08.230> right

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
- right

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.130 
- right
which<00:03:08.890> isn't<00:03:09.370> matching<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.420> canola<00:03:10.690> oil<00:03:10.900> or

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
which isn't matching the canola oil or

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.990 
which isn't matching the canola oil or
the<00:03:11.170> Pyrex<00:03:11.590> because<00:03:12.040> of<00:03:12.190> different<00:03:12.549> densities

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
the Pyrex because of different densities

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.339 
the Pyrex because of different densities
so<00:03:13.150> lights<00:03:13.359> gonna<00:03:13.540> travel<00:03:13.780> at<00:03:13.959> a<00:03:14.079> different

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
so lights gonna travel at a different

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.259 
so lights gonna travel at a different
speed<00:03:14.560> yes<00:03:14.950> got<00:03:15.310> it<00:03:15.459> so<00:03:15.730> why<00:03:15.970> don't<00:03:16.090> you<00:03:16.180> go

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
speed yes got it so why don't you go

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.819 
speed yes got it so why don't you go
ahead<00:03:16.329> and<00:03:16.540> take<00:03:16.659> this<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:16.900> fill<00:03:17.260> up<00:03:17.440> my<00:03:17.560> test

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
ahead and take this and fill up my test

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.009 
ahead and take this and fill up my test
tube<00:03:18.099> okay<00:03:18.760> um<00:03:19.000> with<00:03:19.299> this<00:03:19.720> and<00:03:19.930> we'll

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
tube okay um with this and we'll

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.870 
tube okay um with this and we'll
actually<00:03:20.139> watch<00:03:20.500> it<00:03:20.769> disappear<00:03:21.190> right<00:03:21.760> on

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
actually watch it disappear right on

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.099 
actually watch it disappear right on
camera<00:03:22.299> okay<00:03:24.359> and<00:03:25.359> you<00:03:25.510> can<00:03:25.599> see<00:03:25.660> it<00:03:25.900> just

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
camera okay and you can see it just

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:27.900 
camera okay and you can see it just
fills<00:03:26.410> on<00:03:26.680> up<00:03:26.829> and<00:03:27.010> then<00:03:27.040> we're<00:03:27.430> matching<00:03:27.579> the

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
fills on up and then we're matching the

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.180 
fills on up and then we're matching the
index<00:03:27.940> of<00:03:28.389> refraction<00:03:28.419> and<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.829> test<00:03:30.040> tube

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
index of refraction and the test tube

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.300 
index of refraction and the test tube
looks<00:03:30.370> like<00:03:30.489> it<00:03:30.609> disappears<00:03:31.000> that's<00:03:31.870> good<00:03:32.310> you

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
looks like it disappears that's good you

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.710 
looks like it disappears that's good you
can<00:03:33.370> see<00:03:33.609> that<00:03:33.760> where<00:03:33.879> the<00:03:34.000> air<00:03:34.120> is<00:03:34.359> you<00:03:34.569> can

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
can see that where the air is you can

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.170 
can see that where the air is you can
still<00:03:34.930> see<00:03:35.109> it<00:03:35.220> or<00:03:36.220> it's<00:03:36.459> full<00:03:36.579> of<00:03:36.639> canola<00:03:36.879> oil

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
still see it or it's full of canola oil

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.599 
still see it or it's full of canola oil
it's<00:03:37.599> absolutely<00:03:38.260> gone<00:03:38.530> isn't<00:03:38.799> that<00:03:39.010> so<00:03:39.310> cool

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
it's absolutely gone isn't that so cool

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:41.550 
it's absolutely gone isn't that so cool
you<00:03:40.060> have<00:03:40.090> pulled<00:03:40.480> an<00:03:40.599> amazing<00:03:41.109> trick<00:03:41.379> and

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
you have pulled an amazing trick and

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.559 
you have pulled an amazing trick and
actually<00:03:41.919> very<00:03:42.489> impressed<00:03:42.970> with<00:03:43.150> this<00:03:43.329> one

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
actually very impressed with this one

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.089 
actually very impressed with this one
yeah<00:03:43.870> yeah<00:03:44.109> and<00:03:44.290> I<00:03:44.470> dropped<00:03:44.739> it<00:03:44.829> all<00:03:44.919> the<00:03:45.010> way

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
yeah yeah and I dropped it all the way

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:46.970 
yeah yeah and I dropped it all the way
and<00:03:45.250> it<00:03:45.400> looks<00:03:45.669> like<00:03:45.730> it's<00:03:45.940> gone<00:03:46.060> right<00:03:46.389> now

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
and it looks like it's gone right now

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.199 
and it looks like it's gone right now
here's<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.099> thing<00:03:48.280> well<00:03:48.730> while<00:03:48.910> we're<00:03:49.030> still

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
here's the thing well while we're still

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.879 
here's the thing well while we're still
looking<00:03:49.389> at<00:03:49.480> this<00:03:49.599> beaker<00:03:49.930> here<00:03:50.139> it's

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
looking at this beaker here it's

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.189 
looking at this beaker here it's
actually<00:03:51.040> such<00:03:51.430> a<00:03:51.459> powerful<00:03:51.849> illusion<00:03:52.629> that

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:53.199 
actually such a powerful illusion that

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:55.349 
actually such a powerful illusion that
the<00:03:53.889> entire<00:03:54.220> time<00:03:54.549> we<00:03:54.579> were<00:03:54.790> doing<00:03:55.060> this<00:03:55.209> I

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
the entire time we were doing this I

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.710 
the entire time we were doing this I
actually<00:03:55.599> had<00:03:56.139> a<00:03:56.519> whole<00:03:57.519> nother<00:03:57.849> and<00:03:58.359> see<00:03:58.540> if<00:03:58.599> I

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
actually had a whole nother and see if I

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.659 
actually had a whole nother and see if I
can't<00:03:58.989> do<00:03:59.620> this<00:04:00.959> inside<00:04:01.959> of<00:04:02.019> here<00:04:02.410> without<00:04:03.310> you

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:03.669 
can't do this inside of here without you

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:05.069 
can't do this inside of here without you
even<00:04:03.849> realize<00:04:04.269> and<00:04:04.419> as<00:04:04.540> you<00:04:04.629> can<00:04:04.720> see<00:04:04.780> this<00:04:04.959> is

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
even realize and as you can see this is

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.150 
even realize and as you can see this is
a<00:04:05.109> little<00:04:05.319> bit<00:04:05.440> messy<00:04:05.739> so<00:04:05.769> if<00:04:05.980> you're<00:04:06.069> doing

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
a little bit messy so if you're doing

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.680 
a little bit messy so if you're doing
this<00:04:06.340> at<00:04:06.489> home<00:04:06.519> I'm<00:04:07.150> gonna<00:04:07.239> make<00:04:07.419> sure<00:04:07.449> you<00:04:07.569> get

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
this at home I'm gonna make sure you get

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.349 
this at home I'm gonna make sure you get
mom<00:04:07.870> and<00:04:07.989> dad's<00:04:08.169> permission<00:04:08.680> I<00:04:08.919> get<00:04:09.639> some<00:04:09.819> rags

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
mom and dad's permission I get some rags

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:12.930 
mom and dad's permission I get some rags
it's<00:04:10.540> like<00:04:10.930> messy<00:04:11.739> though<00:04:11.919> they<00:04:12.129> like<00:04:12.400> science

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
it's like messy though they like science

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.369 
it's like messy though they like science
where<00:04:13.090> they<00:04:13.180> can<00:04:13.329> get<00:04:13.510> their<00:04:13.750> hands<00:04:14.049> kind<00:04:14.349> of

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:14.379 
where they can get their hands kind of

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.050 
where they can get their hands kind of
dirty<00:04:14.680> and<00:04:14.949> involved<00:04:15.430> in<00:04:15.579> the<00:04:15.669> science<00:04:15.940> that's

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
dirty and involved in the science that's

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.979 
dirty and involved in the science that's
what<00:04:16.269> you<00:04:16.359> guys<00:04:16.510> do

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
what you guys do

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.810 
what you guys do
of<00:04:17.049> course<00:04:17.620> at<00:04:17.769> the<00:04:17.919> imagination<00:04:18.459> station

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
of course at the imagination station

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.969 
of course at the imagination station
what's<00:04:19.060> new<00:04:19.479> with<00:04:19.750> you<00:04:19.810> guys<00:04:20.019> oh<00:04:20.380> what<00:04:20.650> we<00:04:20.769> have

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
what's new with you guys oh what we have

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.490 
what's new with you guys oh what we have
our<00:04:21.130> extreme<00:04:21.849> science<00:04:22.090> happening<00:04:22.840> actually

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
our extreme science happening actually

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.080 
our extreme science happening actually
right<00:04:23.650> now<00:04:23.800> so<00:04:24.010> it's<00:04:24.159> a<00:04:24.190> bunch<00:04:24.340> of<00:04:24.430> exciting

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
right now so it's a bunch of exciting

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.290 
right now so it's a bunch of exciting
experiments<00:04:25.840> and<00:04:26.080> we're<00:04:27.010> having

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
experiments and we're having

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.640 
experiments and we're having
kind<00:04:27.449> of<00:04:27.479> a<00:04:27.599> really<00:04:27.870> good<00:04:27.990> time<00:04:28.169> testing<00:04:28.620> the

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
kind of a really good time testing the

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.219 
kind of a really good time testing the
strength<00:04:29.370> of<00:04:29.819> eggs<00:04:29.970> how<00:04:30.270> eggs<00:04:30.569> work<00:04:30.840> with<00:04:31.020> a

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
strength of eggs how eggs work with a

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.839 
strength of eggs how eggs work with a
different<00:04:31.349> chemistry<00:04:31.949> we<00:04:32.490> even<00:04:32.610> have<00:04:32.759> the

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849 
different chemistry we even have the
