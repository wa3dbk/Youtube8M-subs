is our floor stander speaker available
and<00:00:26.100> this<00:00:26.460> has<00:00:26.670> three<00:00:27.440> drivers<00:00:28.440> inside<00:00:28.920> and

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
and this has three drivers inside and

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.400 
and this has three drivers inside and
the<00:00:29.910> tweeter<00:00:30.240> as<00:00:30.420> well<00:00:30.600> so<00:00:30.720> we<00:00:30.779> have<00:00:30.930> two<00:00:31.170> bass

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
the tweeter as well so we have two bass

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.279 
the tweeter as well so we have two bass
one<00:00:32.070> mid<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.489> one<00:00:32.999> tweeter<00:00:33.300> here<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:34.109> talk<00:00:34.260> a

00:00:34.279 --> 00:00:34.289 
one mid and one tweeter here to talk a

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:35.720 
one mid and one tweeter here to talk a
little<00:00:34.469> bit<00:00:34.649> about<00:00:34.679> the<00:00:34.949> drivers<00:00:35.309> these<00:00:35.460> are

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
little bit about the drivers these are

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.610 
little bit about the drivers these are
what<00:00:35.940> we<00:00:36.030> call<00:00:36.179> a<00:00:36.359> PMD<00:00:36.749> driver<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.440> that's

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
what we call a PMD driver so that's

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.950 
what we call a PMD driver so that's
advanced<00:00:38.159> polymer<00:00:38.550> injected<00:00:39.089> mica<00:00:39.390> diaphragm

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
advanced polymer injected mica diaphragm

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.079 
advanced polymer injected mica diaphragm
drivers<00:00:40.319> they<00:00:40.469> give<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.949> rich<00:00:41.460> detailed

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:42.089 
drivers they give you a rich detailed

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:43.700 
drivers they give you a rich detailed
kind<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.510> mid-range<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.379> much<00:00:43.530> more

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
kind of mid-range and a much more

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.860 
kind of mid-range and a much more
powerful<00:00:43.979> and<00:00:44.280> precise<00:00:44.699> space<00:00:45.030> it's<00:00:45.389> a<00:00:45.420> really

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
powerful and precise space it's a really

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.750 
powerful and precise space it's a really
really<00:00:45.989> excellent<00:00:46.559> sound<00:00:46.979> natural<00:00:47.460> sound

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
really excellent sound natural sound

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.549 
really excellent sound natural sound
which<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.179> what<00:00:48.449> we<00:00:48.629> as<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.929> company<00:00:49.199> have<00:00:49.409> been

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
which is what we as a company have been

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.099 
which is what we as a company have been
built<00:00:49.769> on<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.550> tweeter<00:00:50.909> as<00:00:51.120> well<00:00:51.359> is<00:00:51.600> made<00:00:51.989> of

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
built on the tweeter as well is made of

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:53.569 
built on the tweeter as well is made of
aluminium<00:00:52.229> and<00:00:52.620> it's<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.769> DC<00:00:53.100> diaphragm

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
aluminium and it's a DC diaphragm

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.189 
aluminium and it's a DC diaphragm
tweeter<00:00:53.909> we<00:00:54.329> also<00:00:54.449> have<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.690> aluminium<00:00:54.899> plate

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
tweeter we also have the aluminium plate

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.200 
tweeter we also have the aluminium plate
here<00:00:55.769> the<00:00:56.129> aluminium<00:00:56.549> plate<00:00:56.819> basically

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
here the aluminium plate basically

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.509 
here the aluminium plate basically
eliminates<00:00:58.079> resonances<00:00:58.709> from<00:00:58.949> inside<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
eliminates resonances from inside the

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:01.849 
eliminates resonances from inside the
cabinet<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.179> get<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.389> really<00:01:00.629> clear<00:01:01.079> rich

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
cabinet so you get a really clear rich

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.009 
cabinet so you get a really clear rich
high-end<00:01:02.699> sound<00:01:02.969> it's<00:01:03.209> very<00:01:03.569> very<00:01:03.809> detailed

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
high-end sound it's very very detailed

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.380 
high-end sound it's very very detailed
and<00:01:04.470> again<00:01:04.829> natural<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.700> sounds<00:01:06.060> like<00:01:06.210> it

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
and again natural it sounds like it

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.310 
and again natural it sounds like it
should

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
should

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.899 
should
inside<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.979> camera<00:01:08.219> as<00:01:08.340> well<00:01:08.430> we<00:01:08.549> can't<00:01:08.729> show

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
inside the camera as well we can't show

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.310 
inside the camera as well we can't show
you<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.030> bit<00:01:09.270> but<00:01:09.420> inside<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.899> cabinet<00:01:10.200> we

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
you that bit but inside the cabinet we

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.410 
you that bit but inside the cabinet we
have<00:01:10.469> a<00:01:10.500> slanted<00:01:11.250> construction<00:01:11.939> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
have a slanted construction the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.270 
have a slanted construction the
construction<00:01:12.450> inside<00:01:13.259> basically<00:01:13.530> eliminates

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
construction inside basically eliminates

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.889 
construction inside basically eliminates
standing<00:01:14.729> waves<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.299> you've<00:01:15.420> got<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.539> large

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
standing waves so you've got a large

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.469 
standing waves so you've got a large
clearer<00:01:16.409> sound<00:01:16.649> again<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.310> natural<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.030> if

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
clearer sound again it's natural and if

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.660 
clearer sound again it's natural and if
you<00:01:18.570> look<00:01:18.719> down<00:01:18.869> at<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.049> bottom<00:01:19.490> we<00:01:20.490> can<00:01:20.549> see

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
you look down at the bottom we can see

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.760 
you look down at the bottom we can see
that<00:01:20.939> we<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.270> rethought<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.140> plates<00:01:22.409> so

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
that we have rethought the plates so

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.039 
that we have rethought the plates so
it's<00:01:22.950> now<00:01:23.130> on<00:01:23.369> more<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.909> base<00:01:24.119> than<00:01:24.390> feet<00:01:24.630> and

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
it's now on more of a base than feet and

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.510 
it's now on more of a base than feet and
we<00:01:25.200> have<00:01:25.289> spikes<00:01:25.710> on<00:01:25.890> here<00:01:26.039> as<00:01:26.130> well<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.430> you

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
we have spikes on here as well so you

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.370 
we have spikes on here as well so you
can<00:01:26.640> alert<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.149> can<00:01:27.180> separate<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.049> speaker

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
can alert you can separate the speaker

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.440 
can alert you can separate the speaker
from<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.680> floor<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.729> again<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.179> is<00:01:30.329> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
from the floor so again this is the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.760 
from the floor so again this is the
floor<00:01:30.659> standing<00:01:30.990> version<00:01:31.320> we<00:01:31.409> also<00:01:31.439> have<00:01:31.740> over

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
floor standing version we also have over

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.029 
floor standing version we also have over
here<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.789> bookshelf<00:01:33.240> version<00:01:33.829> there<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:34.920> also

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
here the bookshelf version there is also

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:36.709 
here the bookshelf version there is also
a<00:01:35.189> surround<00:01:35.729> bookshelf<00:01:36.179> version<00:01:36.479> which<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.689> a

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:36.719 
a surround bookshelf version which is a

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:38.779 
a surround bookshelf version which is a
little<00:01:36.810> bit<00:01:37.079> thinner<00:01:37.609> available<00:01:38.609> for<00:01:38.729> your

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
little bit thinner available for your

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:40.580
