00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
switch to the gameplay view here and you

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.660 
switch to the gameplay view here and you
can<00:00:22.350> see<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.650> don't<00:00:22.800> have<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.949> lot<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.160> opening

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
can see you don't have a lot of opening

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.810 
can see you don't have a lot of opening
moves<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.859> pretty<00:00:25.859> much<00:00:25.949> any<00:00:26.189> move<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.460> can

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
moves so pretty much any move you can

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.880 
moves so pretty much any move you can
take<00:00:27.000> two<00:00:27.180> pieces<00:00:27.420> from<00:00:27.750> him<00:00:27.960> but<00:00:28.650> it's<00:00:28.830> a

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
take two pieces from him but it's a

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.550 
take two pieces from him but it's a
question<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.429> what<00:00:29.929> counter<00:00:30.929> move<00:00:31.109> he's<00:00:31.380> going

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
question of what counter move he's going

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.470 
question of what counter move he's going
to<00:00:31.619> be<00:00:31.710> able<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.009> do<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:33.030> take<00:00:33.300> two<00:00:33.450> of

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
to be able to do to you so take two of

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.690 
to be able to do to you so take two of
his<00:00:33.719> pieces<00:00:33.930> but<00:00:34.590> now<00:00:34.710> he<00:00:34.770> takes<00:00:35.010> three<00:00:35.610> of

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
his pieces but now he takes three of

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.180 
his pieces but now he takes three of
mine<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.300> then<00:00:36.930> he<00:00:37.110> can<00:00:37.260> move<00:00:37.410> his<00:00:37.469> piece<00:00:37.770> away

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
mine and then he can move his piece away

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.170 
mine and then he can move his piece away
and<00:00:38.760> then<00:00:39.000> take<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.180> fourth<00:00:40.399> so<00:00:41.399> as<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:42.030> can<00:00:42.120> see

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
and then take a fourth so as you can see

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.540 
and then take a fourth so as you can see
if<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.660> move<00:00:42.809> towards<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.590> row<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.890> pieces<00:00:44.309> or

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
if you move towards a row of pieces or

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.760 
if you move towards a row of pieces or
away<00:00:45.059> from<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.420> row<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.719> pieces<00:00:46.140> you're<00:00:46.710> going

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
away from a row of pieces you're going

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.340 
away from a row of pieces you're going
to<00:00:46.860> take<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.129> whole<00:00:47.489> line<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:48.120> any<00:00:48.750> connected

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
to take that whole line of any connected

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.380 
to take that whole line of any connected
pieces<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.760> goal<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.120> game<00:00:51.210> is

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
pieces and the goal of the game is

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.560 
pieces and the goal of the game is
obviously<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.870> get<00:00:52.079> rid<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.350> all<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.770> hits

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
obviously to get rid of all of the hits

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.819 
obviously to get rid of all of the hits
so<00:00:54.570> here<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.260> have<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.440> bunch<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.710> different

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
so here I have a bunch of different

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.970 
so here I have a bunch of different
moves<00:00:56.190> but<00:00:57.020> trying<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.050> think<00:00:58.289> ahead<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.680> little

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
moves but trying to think ahead a little

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.330 
moves but trying to think ahead a little
bit<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.480> what's<00:01:00.480> going<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.690> avoid<00:01:01.340> him

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
bit of what's going to avoid him

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.950 
bit of what's going to avoid him
chaining<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.030> taking<00:01:03.359> all<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.510> my<00:01:03.750> pieces

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
chaining and taking all of my pieces

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.500 
chaining and taking all of my pieces
because<00:01:04.379> when<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.650> take<00:01:04.890> pieces<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.640> chain

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
because when you take pieces you chain

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.420 
because when you take pieces you chain
until<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.680> run<00:01:07.890> out<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.100> moves<00:01:10.010> so<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.040> select

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
until you run out of moves so I select

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.950 
until you run out of moves so I select
this<00:01:11.580> piece<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.240> take<00:01:12.450> three<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.810> his

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
this piece and I take three of his

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.030 
this piece and I take three of his
pieces

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.620 

and<00:01:19.040> then<00:01:19.490> you<00:01:19.610> can<00:01:19.730> see<00:01:19.910> I<00:01:19.940> made<00:01:20.120> a<00:01:20.180> pretty<00:01:20.480> big

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
and then you can see I made a pretty big

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.800 
and then you can see I made a pretty big
mistake<00:01:20.780> because<00:01:21.650> he<00:01:22.340> moves<00:01:22.580> once<00:01:23.150> twice

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
mistake because he moves once twice

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:31.740 
mistake because he moves once twice
three<00:01:24.800> times<00:01:25.180> four<00:01:26.180> times<00:01:27.880> and<00:01:29.380> I'm<00:01:30.380> left<00:01:30.950> with

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
three times four times and I'm left with

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:46.650 
three times four times and I'm left with
considerably<00:01:32.750> less<00:01:32.960> pieces<00:01:33.200> on<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:33.560> board

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.560 

okay<00:01:47.660> so<00:01:47.720> now<00:01:48.050> I'm<00:01:48.500> in<00:01:48.560> a<00:01:48.800> crappy<00:01:49.130> spot<00:01:49.570> he's

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
okay so now I'm in a crappy spot he's

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.930 
okay so now I'm in a crappy spot he's
all<00:01:50.960> locked<00:01:51.350> up<00:01:51.530> in<00:01:51.649> the<00:01:51.710> corner<00:01:52.070> but<00:01:52.399> if<00:01:52.610> I<00:01:52.759> can

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
all locked up in the corner but if I can

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.090 
all locked up in the corner but if I can
get<00:01:53.119> in<00:01:53.240> there<00:01:53.450> then<00:01:54.170> I<00:01:54.530> can<00:01:54.680> get<00:01:54.800> rid<00:01:54.979> of<00:01:55.040> a

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
get in there then I can get rid of a

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:04.060 
get in there then I can get rid of a
bunch<00:01:55.460> of<00:01:55.550> his<00:01:55.670> pieces<00:01:56.030> at<00:01:56.149> once<00:02:02.800> so<00:02:03.800> I<00:02:03.830> only

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
bunch of his pieces at once so I only

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.859 
bunch of his pieces at once so I only
got<00:02:04.250> rid<00:02:04.399> of<00:02:04.490> two<00:02:04.700> with<00:02:04.880> that<00:02:05.060> move<00:02:05.270> but<00:02:05.600> I<00:02:05.630> set

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
got rid of two with that move but I set

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.040 
got rid of two with that move but I set
myself<00:02:06.020> up<00:02:06.320> for<00:02:06.590> a<00:02:06.619> longer<00:02:06.890> chain<00:02:07.310> I<00:02:07.929> can<00:02:08.929> move

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
myself up for a longer chain I can move

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.560 
myself up for a longer chain I can move
away<00:02:09.170> take<00:02:09.619> this<00:02:09.800> one<00:02:10.070> and<00:02:10.429> then<00:02:11.060> three<00:02:11.420> more

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
away take this one and then three more

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:17.860 
away take this one and then three more
right<00:02:11.810> now<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:15.070> then<00:02:16.070> even<00:02:16.790> longer<00:02:17.030> we<00:02:17.720> got

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
right now and then even longer we got

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.590 
right now and then even longer we got
one<00:02:18.080> more<00:02:18.320> and<00:02:18.560> then<00:02:18.920> suddenly<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:20.270> tables

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
one more and then suddenly the tables

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.710 
one more and then suddenly the tables
are<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:20.720> lot<00:02:21.050> nice<00:02:21.530> take<00:02:21.769> more<00:02:21.950> even<00:02:24.940> as<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.660> can

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
are a lot nice take more even as you can

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.240 
are a lot nice take more even as you can
see<00:02:26.930> all<00:02:27.049> his<00:02:27.140> pieces<00:02:27.440> in<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:27.799> top<00:02:28.010> left

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
see all his pieces in the top left

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.460 
see all his pieces in the top left
corner<00:02:28.549> are<00:02:29.060> locked<00:02:29.360> up<00:02:29.540> there<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:30.049> I<00:02:30.200> can't

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
corner are locked up there and I can't

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.140 
corner are locked up there and I can't
get<00:02:30.620> them<00:02:30.769> but<00:02:30.980> he<00:02:31.100> can't<00:02:31.370> get<00:02:31.519> me<00:02:31.700> either<00:02:31.970> so

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
get them but he can't get me either so

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.240 
get them but he can't get me either so
all<00:02:32.780> I<00:02:32.810> have<00:02:33.049> to<00:02:33.140> do<00:02:33.290> right<00:02:33.440> now<00:02:33.620> is<00:02:33.830> just<00:02:34.040> move

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
all I have to do right now is just move

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.820 
all I have to do right now is just move
a<00:02:34.340> piece<00:02:34.580> that<00:02:34.989> doesn't<00:02:35.989> leave<00:02:36.410> me<00:02:36.620> in<00:02:36.739> a

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
a piece that doesn't leave me in a

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.770 
a piece that doesn't leave me in a
weaker<00:02:37.100> position<00:02:37.280> so<00:02:38.269> here<00:02:38.510> I'm<00:02:38.630> going<00:02:38.720> to

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
weaker position so here I'm going to

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.910 
weaker position so here I'm going to
make<00:02:38.900> a<00:02:38.959> mistake<00:02:39.790> he<00:02:40.790> moved<00:02:41.000> that<00:02:41.150> piece<00:02:41.390> away

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
make a mistake he moved that piece away

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.310 
make a mistake he moved that piece away
but<00:02:42.920> I<00:02:42.950> forgot<00:02:43.340> that<00:02:43.670> lets<00:02:44.540> him<00:02:44.690> move<00:02:44.959> one<00:02:45.200> of

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
but I forgot that lets him move one of

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.050 
but I forgot that lets him move one of
his<00:02:45.440> pieces<00:02:45.620> away<00:02:45.950> from<00:02:46.190> me<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:46.580> then<00:02:46.730> I<00:02:46.790> lose

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
his pieces away from me and then I lose

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.650 
his pieces away from me and then I lose
two<00:02:47.330> more<00:02:47.470> now<00:02:48.470> I<00:02:48.500> have<00:02:48.830> a<00:02:48.860> capture<00:02:49.310> move<00:02:49.600> so<00:02:50.600> I

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
two more now I have a capture move so I

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.600 
two more now I have a capture move so I
can<00:02:50.840> move<00:02:50.930> in<00:02:51.110> here<00:02:51.440> take<00:02:51.950> two<00:02:52.130> of<00:02:52.250> his<00:02:52.400> pieces

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
can move in here take two of his pieces

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.210 
can move in here take two of his pieces
and<00:02:53.060> then<00:02:53.720> since<00:02:54.440> none<00:02:54.650> of<00:02:54.769> his<00:02:54.860> pieces

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
and then since none of his pieces

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
and then since none of his pieces
connect<00:02:55.549> to<00:02:55.670> mine<00:02:55.880> I'm<00:02:56.150> safe

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.120 

so<00:03:19.240> after<00:03:19.450> a<00:03:19.480> lot<00:03:19.660> of<00:03:19.690> time<00:03:19.960> him<00:03:20.650> shuffling

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
so after a lot of time him shuffling

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.220 
so after a lot of time him shuffling
back<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.340> forth<00:03:21.790> I<00:03:22.090> get<00:03:22.810> into<00:03:22.990> a<00:03:23.020> position

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
back and forth I get into a position

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.960 
back and forth I get into a position
where<00:03:23.680> he<00:03:23.830> doesn't<00:03:24.010> have<00:03:24.130> a<00:03:24.220> lot<00:03:24.400> of<00:03:24.430> options

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
where he doesn't have a lot of options

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.550 
where he doesn't have a lot of options
and<00:03:25.240> then<00:03:25.450> eventually<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:26.020> computer<00:03:26.410> just

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
and then eventually the computer just

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.360 
and then eventually the computer just
lets<00:03:26.800> me<00:03:26.890> win

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
lets me win

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.500 
lets me win
so<00:03:28.360> that's<00:03:28.570> Phantom<00:03:29.290> Rona
