00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.800 

and<00:01:45.380> now<00:01:46.280> each<00:01:46.490> of<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.730> assemblies<00:01:47.150> comes

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
and now each of the assemblies comes

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.070 
and now each of the assemblies comes
right<00:01:48.050> up<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:48.290> out<00:01:52.330> okay<00:01:53.330> now<00:01:53.450> you<00:01:53.510> need<00:01:53.600> a<00:01:53.750> 15

millimeter wrench and the socket wrench

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.210 
millimeter wrench and the socket wrench
again<00:01:56.450> and<00:01:56.750> best<00:01:57.350> practice<00:01:57.710> actually<00:01:57.890> is<00:01:58.130> to

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
again and best practice actually is to

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.880 
again and best practice actually is to
just<00:01:58.430> kind<00:01:58.610> of<00:01:58.640> loosen<00:01:58.850> these<00:01:59.120> up<00:01:59.680> before<00:02:00.680> you

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
just kind of loosen these up before you

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.090 
just kind of loosen these up before you
take<00:02:01.160> it<00:02:01.190> out<00:02:01.370> of<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:02.000> vehicle<00:02:04.690> and<00:02:06.100> depending

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
take it out of the vehicle and depending

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.310 
take it out of the vehicle and depending
on<00:02:07.160> which<00:02:07.310> part<00:02:07.640> of<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.910> mount<00:02:08.720> you<00:02:08.990> need<00:02:09.170> to

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
on which part of the mount you need to

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:20.320 
on which part of the mount you need to
replace<00:02:10.180> you<00:02:11.180> can<00:02:11.390> replace<00:02:11.810> it<00:02:11.960> as<00:02:12.080> necessary

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.910 

and<00:02:20.420> then<00:02:21.140> you<00:02:21.260> can<00:02:21.350> put<00:02:21.500> this<00:02:21.560> back<00:02:21.770> together

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
and then you can put this back together

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.880 
and then you can put this back together
outside<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.180> vehicle<00:02:23.630> you<00:02:23.870> want<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.170> kind<00:02:24.800> of

outside the vehicle you want to kind of
put<00:02:25.010> it<00:02:25.100> together<00:02:25.190> but<00:02:25.580> you<00:02:25.700> don't<00:02:25.850> need<00:02:25.970> to

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
put it together but you don't need to

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.050 
put it together but you don't need to
tighten<00:02:26.270> it<00:02:26.390> up<00:02:26.480> all<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.750> way<00:02:26.870> right<00:02:27.110> now<00:02:28.060> just

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
tighten it up all the way right now just

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.420 
tighten it up all the way right now just
tighten<00:02:29.390> it<00:02:29.420> up<00:02:29.540> preliminary<00:02:30.410> and<00:02:30.800> then

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
tighten it up preliminary and then

tighten it up preliminary and then
you'll<00:02:31.880> tighten<00:02:32.240> it<00:02:32.420> up<00:02:32.450> all<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:32.810> way<00:02:33.050> when

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
you'll tighten it up all the way when

00:02:33.350 --> 00:03:07.280 
you'll tighten it up all the way when

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.830 

you'll<00:03:07.830> need<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.099> use<00:03:08.159> a<00:03:08.250> pry<00:03:08.580> bar<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:09.450> help<00:03:09.569> you

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
you'll need to use a pry bar to help you

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.869 
you'll need to use a pry bar to help you
get<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.650> engine<00:03:10.920> in<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.099> right<00:03:11.250> position<00:03:11.700> and
