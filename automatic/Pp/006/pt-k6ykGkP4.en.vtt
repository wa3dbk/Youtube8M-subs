00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.440
 your lesson forever and as a second 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.450
 today's video I bring you a glitch 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.040
 pretty funny that good is something that 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.570
 patched a long time ago and has 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.700
 come out a new method to do it 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.529
 much easier and such so good what 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.180
 I'm going to explain basically is this clip 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.680
 Good thing I did not go to the channel but 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.750
 maybe you have seen it how good is the 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.849
 clichÃ© of mannequin and there is another one that is 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.199
 good in topo mode so to speak 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.369
 it's really pretty funny 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.779
 I will teach you both ways to 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.790
 do it in the two ways that is a 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.810
 same method for two but good 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.850
 Well, you have to do some things 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.710
 different and good because I was here with 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.300
 my friend fargas that I will also leave you his 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.040
 channel in the description if you want 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.600
 watch video from your perspective as 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.520
 what I'm going to see I'm not going to see him and 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.750
 then to see him I'm not going to see him and 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.700
 Well basically the trick is 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.950
 in the following we have to put myself 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.690
 for example, pointing at him and that's what 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.980
 has to do is at the same time 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.870
 I'm going to shoot him with the 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.610
 sniper in the head that is him 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.290
 we have to shoot a lethal bullet with 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.570
 the franc in the head and at the same time 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.490
 that just we shoot he has 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.320
 to put yourself in passive mode is worth 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.490
 it has to be very fast right in the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.070
 At the moment we counted 1 2 and 3 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.270
 and it gave the passive mode it's worth and so 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.640
 go well then what has to happen 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.619
 is that it appears to us that 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.320
 he is on the ground with the little symbol of 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.420
 passive mode and will be already created vale 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.799
 right now he is as if he does not like 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.630
 we would have fired later you will see it 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.159
 because we 're going to do it the other way around and well 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.530
 Well, once here we can do two 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.179
 one things is the mannequin mode and another is 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.039
 turbo mode ok let's do first 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:32.899
 the mannequin mode that we 're going to see well 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.119
 here that is going to ride the bike and goes 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.770
 to leave in an incredibly position 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.479
 rare that one stayed like watching 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.850
 back on the bike and then I 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.850
 Amount me and good looks like a figure 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.979
 a little weird a little sexual but good 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.200
 for it is simply he will see him 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.729
 same normal mounted on the motorcycle and on the 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.440
 can carry and all that is worth but to me 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.420
 I get like this very weird played like a 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.920
 mannequin and good because the truth is that 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.240
 it's quite fun, now you will not see 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.060
 we 're going to do it the other way around so that 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.310
 You see how I do it and he went out to 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.479
 he came out is like I was done 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.799
 a mannequin is valid for you to see 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.049
 simply that I have to put on 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.939
 passive mode and that nothing happens to me and 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.599
 so it is worth to see it from two 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.250
 prospects 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.290
 I repeat that you have to do it at the same 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.880
 time since if you put the passive mode 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.580
 a little before then the other 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.200
 he will not be able to shoot and if he does well 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.940
 you are going to hit it later it will kill you 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.470
 but nothing happens he will try again 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.360
 all the times you want but it 's 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.040
 pretty simple, it's worth most 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.840
 of the times so good then 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.610
 simply the other method that there is is 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.530
 well let's repeat the same thing 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.230
 I'm going to shoot him and he's going to put on 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.780
 passive and good way what we are going to do 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.400
 Now is when I'm on the ground once 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.260
 that really our local version but 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.240
 we see him has drawn what he 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.130
 will do is remove the passive mode 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.110
 so that we can hit him 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.880
 the passive mode is removed and as soon as 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.710
 we hit a hit it goes up now and it 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.660
 will remain like a mole on the ground with the 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.400
 mole mode as I call him and how do you 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.890
 We call ourselves how good it is 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.240
 fun because it goes or is it really strange 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.850
 you see in the background in the video that goes like 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.230
 jumping at the bottom of the floor one thing 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.360
 quite rare and good is will be seen 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.670
 totally normal as I said so 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.380
 good if you want to see how it happens to me 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.970
 how do I put myself in topo mode and all that 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.800
 go through your channel and you can see how I have 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.870
 said nothing kids, it's a click 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.700
 pretty funny very easy so 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.290
 I hope that you to me the truth that I 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.000
 They make pretty good grace and that and me 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.170
 I have a good time so nothing is 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.760
 so it is simply that if it has 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.300
 liked to pop the like button 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.130
 Favourite 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.130
 if we go in the next video chao
