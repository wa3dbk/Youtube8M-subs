00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.469 
lighting since the xbox is a downgraded
version<00:01:46.020> from<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.710> ps3<00:01:46.920> it's<00:01:47.790> not<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.210> same

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
version from the ps3 it's not the same

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.359 
version from the ps3 it's not the same
so<00:01:49.049> they<00:01:49.259> had<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.590> use<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.770> different<00:01:50.189> lighting

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
so they had to use a different lighting

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.830 
so they had to use a different lighting
system<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.180> they<00:01:51.299> said<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.810> actually

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
system and they said that it actually

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.190 
system and they said that it actually
looks<00:01:52.409> better<00:01:52.500> than<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.100> ps3<00:01:53.720> all<00:01:54.720> right<00:01:54.930> so

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
looks better than the ps3 all right so

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.319 
looks better than the ps3 all right so
with<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.500> lighting<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.950> also<00:01:56.280> did<00:01:56.610> say<00:01:57.000> that

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
with the lighting you also did say that

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.870 
with the lighting you also did say that
everything<00:01:58.320> got<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.860> going<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.340> look<00:01:59.490> clearer

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
everything got is going to look clearer

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.289 
everything got is going to look clearer
uh<00:02:00.229> through<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.259> guess<00:02:02.060> through<00:02:03.060> looking

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
uh through I guess through looking

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.240 
uh through I guess through looking
across<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.600> map<00:02:03.869> through<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.110> scope<00:02:04.439> or<00:02:04.740> is

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
across the map through a scope or is

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.100 
across the map through a scope or is
that<00:02:05.880> just<00:02:05.939> looking<00:02:06.390> through<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.600> scope<00:02:06.630> or

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
that just looking through the scope or

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.740 
that just looking through the scope or
is<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:08.069> looking<00:02:08.759> plain<00:02:09.090> sight<00:02:09.479> like

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
is that just looking plain sight like

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.720 
is that just looking plain sight like
without<00:02:09.929> aiming<00:02:10.289> down<00:02:10.530> sight<00:02:10.800> both<00:02:11.310> both

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
without aiming down sight both both

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.220 
without aiming down sight both both
through<00:02:11.970> this

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
through this

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.500 
through this
scope<00:02:12.409> and<00:02:12.650> aiming<00:02:13.400> down<00:02:13.580> your<00:02:13.879> iron<00:02:14.120> sights

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
let's get into the environment has

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.270 
let's get into the environment has
anything<00:02:40.069> changed<00:02:40.510> will<00:02:41.510> there<00:02:41.629> still<00:02:41.750> be

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
anything changed will there still be

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.369 
anything changed will there still be
destruction<00:02:43.280> 2<00:02:43.549> point<00:02:43.790> 0<00:02:44.260> destruction<00:02:45.260> to

destruction 2 point 0 destruction to
point<00:02:45.709> out<00:02:45.890> there<00:02:46.280> are<00:02:46.540> some<00:02:47.540> cases<00:02:47.810> but<00:02:48.110> this

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
point out there are some cases but this

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.250 
point out there are some cases but this
isn't<00:02:49.010> this<00:02:49.280> is<00:02:49.489> just<00:02:49.760> off<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:50.209> Alpha<00:02:50.780> so<00:02:51.049> we

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
isn't this is just off the Alpha so we

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.479 
isn't this is just off the Alpha so we
didn't<00:02:51.530> really<00:02:51.650> get<00:02:51.829> to<00:02:51.980> see<00:02:52.160> as<00:02:52.310> many

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
didn't really get to see as many

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.430 
didn't really get to see as many
buildings<00:02:53.000> but<00:02:53.299> when<00:02:53.870> you're<00:02:54.049> going<00:02:54.290> through

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
buildings but when you're going through

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.050 
buildings but when you're going through

bomb sites and when you're going through

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.789 
bomb sites and when you're going through
the<00:02:58.099> tunnel<00:02:58.519> you<00:02:58.940> can<00:02:59.180> blow<00:02:59.569> up<00:02:59.599> walls<00:03:00.349> in<00:03:00.709> the

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
the tunnel you can blow up walls in the

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.979 
the tunnel you can blow up walls in the
rooms<00:03:01.069> of<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.459> of<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.970> tunnel<00:03:02.329> and<00:03:02.510> you<00:03:02.780> can

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
rooms of the of the tunnel and you can

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.039 
rooms of the of the tunnel and you can
blow<00:03:03.709> up<00:03:04.000> let's<00:03:05.000> say<00:03:05.150> you<00:03:05.209> go<00:03:05.569> up<00:03:05.720> into<00:03:05.930> the

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
blow up let's say you go up into the

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:07.690 
blow up let's say you go up into the
buildings<00:03:06.530> there<00:03:06.799> are<00:03:06.950> certain<00:03:07.310> rooms<00:03:07.519> you

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
buildings there are certain rooms you

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.250 
buildings there are certain rooms you
can<00:03:07.819> go<00:03:07.970> to<00:03:08.030> and<00:03:08.390> you<00:03:08.450> can<00:03:08.629> blow<00:03:08.810> those<00:03:09.019> walls

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
can go to and you can blow those walls

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.289 
can go to and you can blow those walls
out<00:03:09.440> completely<00:03:09.859> but<00:03:10.430> you<00:03:10.519> can't<00:03:10.849> bring<00:03:11.000> down

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
out completely but you can't bring down

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:12.940 
out completely but you can't bring down
the<00:03:11.540> entire<00:03:11.660> buildings<00:03:12.440> because<00:03:12.769> the

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
the entire buildings because the

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.009 
the entire buildings because the
buildings<00:03:13.340> are<00:03:13.489> so<00:03:13.670> massive<00:03:13.940> they<00:03:14.420> don't<00:03:14.870> want

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
buildings are so massive they don't want

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.870 
buildings are so massive they don't want
sniper<00:03:15.319> sitting<00:03:15.739> up<00:03:15.859> at<00:03:16.040> like<00:03:16.220> a<00:03:16.280> certain

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
sniper sitting up at like a certain

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.690 
sniper sitting up at like a certain
window<00:03:17.510> on<00:03:17.930> a<00:03:17.959> certain<00:03:18.260> floor<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:19.040> then<00:03:19.160> you

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
window on a certain floor and then you

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.220 
window on a certain floor and then you
know<00:03:19.819> they<00:03:20.060> just<00:03:20.209> drop<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.569> entire<00:03:20.959> building

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
know they just drop the entire building

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.720 
know they just drop the entire building
that<00:03:21.530> would<00:03:21.620> be<00:03:21.769> that<00:03:21.950> would<00:03:22.010> be<00:03:22.220> too<00:03:22.370> much<00:03:22.400> to

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
that would be that would be too much to

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.069 
that would be that would be too much to
handle<00:03:22.849> even<00:03:23.329> for<00:03:23.510> PC<00:03:24.019> but<00:03:24.799> uh<00:03:24.859> so<00:03:25.819> so<00:03:26.660> far<00:03:26.870> the

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
handle even for PC but uh so so far the

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.800 
handle even for PC but uh so so far the
environment<00:03:27.709> goes<00:03:27.829> the<00:03:28.340> trees<00:03:28.790> what<00:03:29.419> happens

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
environment goes the trees what happens

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.680 
environment goes the trees what happens
