and<00:00:18.810> games<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.170> anyone<00:00:19.619> could<00:00:19.770> come<00:00:19.949> across

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
and games that anyone could come across

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.740 
and games that anyone could come across
while<00:00:20.520> playing<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.180> when<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.330> lot<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.660> these

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750
