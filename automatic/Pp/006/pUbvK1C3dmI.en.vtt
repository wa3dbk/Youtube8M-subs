00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
because it's been about I guess four

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.499 
because it's been about I guess four
maybe<00:00:10.860> even<00:00:11.280> closer<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.759> five<00:00:12.000> months<00:00:12.480> that

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
maybe even closer to five months that

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
were such good products but I did find

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.910 
were such good products but I did find
out<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.770> for<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.309> lot<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.670> people<00:00:45.469> using<00:00:46.469> face

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
out that for a lot of people using face

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.209 
out that for a lot of people using face
washes<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.850> are<00:00:48.440> gentle<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.920> don't

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
washes that are gentle and don't

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.639 
washes that are gentle and don't
actually<00:00:50.489> have<00:00:50.879> like<00:00:51.090> soap<00:00:51.480> or<00:00:51.930> benzoyl

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
actually have like soap or benzoyl

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.910 
actually have like soap or benzoyl
peroxide<00:00:53.219> or<00:00:53.629> you<00:00:54.629> know<00:00:54.780> salicylic<00:00:55.350> acid<00:00:55.829> in

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
peroxide or you know salicylic acid in

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.770 
peroxide or you know salicylic acid in
them<00:00:56.070> it's<00:00:56.399> actually<00:00:56.879> better<00:00:57.059> for<00:00:57.149> your<00:00:57.329> skin

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
them it's actually better for your skin

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.709 
them it's actually better for your skin
so<00:00:58.109> it's<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.399> same<00:00:59.699> face<00:00:59.969> wash<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.600> you've

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
so it's the same face wash that you've

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.900 
so it's the same face wash that you've
seen<00:01:01.050> if<00:01:01.500> you've<00:01:01.680> seen<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.129> but<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.640> my

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
seen if you've seen it but in my

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.359 
seen if you've seen it but in my
skincare<00:01:03.300> routine<00:01:03.570> video<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:05.220> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
skincare routine video and it's the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.649 
skincare routine video and it's the
Cetaphil<00:01:05.909> gentle<00:01:06.510> skin<00:01:06.869> cleanser<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:08.659> it

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser and it

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.690 
Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser and it
says<00:01:09.960> it's<00:01:10.170> for<00:01:10.320> all<00:01:10.500> skin<00:01:10.950> types<00:01:10.979> but<00:01:11.670> I

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
says it's for all skin types but I

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.630 
says it's for all skin types but I
honestly<00:01:12.060> think<00:01:12.450> people<00:01:12.990> who<00:01:13.170> have<00:01:13.640> dry

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
honestly think people who have dry

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.179 
honestly think people who have dry
sensitive<00:01:15.270> skin<00:01:15.420> tend<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.170> lean<00:01:16.320> more<00:01:16.350> toward

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
sensitive skin tend to lean more toward

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.999 
sensitive skin tend to lean more toward
this<00:01:17.520> than<00:01:17.909> people<00:01:18.330> with<00:01:18.570> oily<00:01:19.110> skin<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.680> don't

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
this than people with oily skin I don't

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.300 
this than people with oily skin I don't
think<00:01:20.520> if<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:21.360> have<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.780> oily<00:01:22.229> skin<00:01:22.710> that

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
think if you have the oily skin that

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.640 
think if you have the oily skin that
this<00:01:24.000> would<00:01:24.210> be<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.479> ideal<00:01:24.840> for<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.290> they<00:01:25.590> do

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
this would be that ideal for you they do

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.740 
this would be that ideal for you they do
have<00:01:26.220> one<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.869> for<00:01:28.880> oily<00:01:29.880> skin<00:01:29.909> oily

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
have one that is for oily skin oily

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.940 
have one that is for oily skin oily
combination<00:01:31.140> skin<00:01:31.610> so<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:33.439> tried<00:01:34.439> using<00:01:34.799> that

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
combination skin so I tried using that

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.950 
combination skin so I tried using that
one<00:01:35.100> but<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.369> was<00:01:35.759> stupid<00:01:36.090> because<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.659> do<00:01:36.840> have

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
one but it was stupid because I do have

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.630 
one but it was stupid because I do have
dry<00:01:37.290> sensitive<00:01:37.680> skin<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.159> was<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.520> only

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
dry sensitive skin it was just the only

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.080 
dry sensitive skin it was just the only
one<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.850> could<00:01:38.970> buy<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.240> time<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:41.090> really

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
one I could buy the time so I really

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.789 
one I could buy the time so I really
like<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.659> it's<00:01:42.960> amazing<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.270> I<00:01:45.270> wear<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.380> powder

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799

right now I thought about it but then it

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.960 
right now I thought about it but then it
ended<00:01:52.320> up<00:01:52.380> being<00:01:52.619> just<00:01:52.890> too<00:01:53.130> heavy<00:01:53.310> for<00:01:53.790> me
