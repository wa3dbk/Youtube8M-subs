00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
looks like right there and I'm going to

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.290 
looks like right there and I'm going to
transfer<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.460> into<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.820> container<00:02:27.180> that

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300

looks<00:02:27.630> like<00:02:27.810> this<00:02:28.050> if<00:02:28.530> this<00:02:29.160> actually<00:02:29.760> got

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
looks like this if this actually got

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.760 
looks like this if this actually got
this<00:02:30.000> from<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.300> kitchen<00:02:30.690> section<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.650> I

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
this from the kitchen section and I

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.460 
this from the kitchen section and I
think<00:02:32.100> that<00:02:32.430> is<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:33.180> chub<00:02:33.690> container<00:02:34.080> so<00:02:34.380> I'm

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
think that is a chub container so I'm

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.839 
think that is a chub container so I'm
going<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.740> be<00:02:34.890> pouring<00:02:35.190> my<00:02:35.430> solution<00:02:36.000> there

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.630 

I'm<00:02:42.849> going<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:43.510> seal<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:44.250> now<00:02:45.250> I'm<00:02:45.400> going<00:02:45.579> to

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
I'm going to seal it now I'm going to

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.610 
I'm going to seal it now I'm going to
shake<00:02:45.879> it<00:02:45.909> before<00:02:46.239> I<00:02:46.450> use<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:46.870> so<00:02:47.200> that<00:02:47.230> the

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
shake it before I use it so that the

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.949 
shake it before I use it so that the
solution<00:02:47.950> is<00:02:48.340> properly<00:02:49.120> mixed<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:49.659> then<00:02:49.870> I'm

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
solution is properly mixed and then I'm

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.199

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.190 
going to apply that directly onto her
scalp<00:02:52.569> and<00:02:52.920> then<00:02:53.920> as<00:02:54.790> you<00:02:54.879> guys<00:02:55.030> can<00:02:55.239> see<00:02:55.510> the

whole<00:02:56.409> process<00:02:56.650> is<00:02:56.950> very<00:02:56.980> easy<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:57.760> less

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:57.969 
whole process is very easy and less

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.809 
whole process is very easy and less
messy<00:02:58.389> if<00:02:58.599> you<00:02:58.780> use<00:02:59.109> that<00:02:59.799> container<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:00.639> then

but<00:03:46.810> we<00:03:47.379> did<00:03:47.680> an<00:03:47.949> apple<00:03:48.940> cider<00:03:49.209> vinegar<00:03:49.389> rinse

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
but we did an apple cider vinegar rinse

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.229 
but we did an apple cider vinegar rinse
so<00:03:50.440> in<00:03:50.949> that<00:03:51.220> container<00:03:51.519> I'm<00:03:51.849> going<00:03:52.060> to<00:03:52.150> be

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
so in that container I'm going to be

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.319 
so in that container I'm going to be
adding<00:03:52.799> 1/4<00:03:53.799> of<00:03:54.069> apple<00:03:54.519> cider<00:03:54.699> vinegar<00:03:54.879> and

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
adding 1/4 of apple cider vinegar and

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.110 
adding 1/4 of apple cider vinegar and
then<00:03:55.930> I<00:03:55.959> will<00:03:56.199> be<00:03:56.409> diluting<00:03:57.040> it<00:03:57.159> with<00:03:57.519> 1<00:03:57.909> and

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
then I will be diluting it with 1 and

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.330 
then I will be diluting it with 1 and
1/4<00:03:58.750> cup<00:03:59.079> of<00:03:59.260> water<00:03:59.560> so<00:03:59.889> that's<00:04:00.040> what<00:04:00.220> it<00:04:00.310> looks

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
1/4 cup of water so that's what it looks

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.670 
1/4 cup of water so that's what it looks
like<00:04:00.669> right<00:04:00.909> there<00:04:01.150> and<00:04:01.329> then<00:04:02.049> she<00:04:02.379> actually

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
like right there and then she actually

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.309 
like right there and then she actually
rinse<00:04:03.370> a<00:04:03.669> little<00:04:03.819> solution<00:04:04.239> with<00:04:04.510> the<00:04:04.720> apple

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
rinse a little solution with the apple

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:06.270 
rinse a little solution with the apple
cider<00:04:05.500> vinegar

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
cider vinegar

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.360 
cider vinegar
this<00:04:06.519> step<00:04:06.790> is<00:04:07.030> totally<00:04:07.720> optional<00:04:07.930> ok<00:04:08.650> so<00:04:08.709> you

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
this step is totally optional ok so you

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.740 
this step is totally optional ok so you
don't<00:04:09.400> really<00:04:09.609> have<00:04:09.729> to<00:04:09.879> do<00:04:10.000> this<00:04:10.209> but<00:04:10.509> what<00:04:10.720> we

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
don't really have to do this but what we

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.530 
don't really have to do this but what we
notice<00:04:11.199> that<00:04:11.500> this<00:04:11.949> really<00:04:12.400> added<00:04:12.759> find<00:04:13.239> her

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
notice that this really added find her

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.129 
notice that this really added find her
hair<00:04:13.930> as<00:04:14.139> well<00:04:14.409> and<00:04:15.120> she<00:04:16.120> actually<00:04:16.329> left<00:04:16.780> that

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
hair as well and she actually left that

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.460 
hair as well and she actually left that
on<00:04:17.440> her<00:04:17.620> hair<00:04:17.919> for<00:04:18.579> another<00:04:19.329> 30<00:04:19.750> minutes<00:04:20.049> and

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
on her hair for another 30 minutes and

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.399 
on her hair for another 30 minutes and
then<00:04:21.039> she<00:04:21.489> just<00:04:21.729> washed<00:04:22.000> off<00:04:22.330> with<00:04:22.659> shampoo

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:23.409 
then she just washed off with shampoo

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:25.439 
then she just washed off with shampoo
and<00:04:23.620> conditioner<00:04:24.220> with<00:04:24.610> a<00:04:24.639> sesame<00:04:25.060> oil<00:04:25.240> and

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
and conditioner with a sesame oil and

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:27.450 
and conditioner with a sesame oil and
honey<00:04:25.599> solution<00:04:26.229> she<00:04:26.440> left<00:04:26.650> that<00:04:26.919> on<00:04:27.130> her<00:04:27.250> hair

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
honey solution she left that on her hair

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.180 
honey solution she left that on her hair
for<00:04:27.669> 30<00:04:27.849> minutes<00:04:28.180> and<00:04:28.330> then<00:04:28.930> she<00:04:29.740> did<00:04:30.070> this

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
for 30 minutes and then she did this

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.610 
for 30 minutes and then she did this
rinse

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
rinse

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.339 
rinse
so<00:04:32.909> after<00:04:33.909> this<00:04:34.330> is<00:04:34.509> the<00:04:34.630> result

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:35.349 
so after this is the result

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:38.100 
so after this is the result
afterwards<00:04:36.340> it<00:04:36.669> really<00:04:36.940> made<00:04:37.150> her<00:04:37.449> hair<00:04:37.690> soft

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
afterwards it really made her hair soft

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.060 
afterwards it really made her hair soft
and<00:04:38.409> smooth<00:04:38.740> and<00:04:38.979> since<00:04:39.280> her<00:04:39.430> hair<00:04:39.699> is<00:04:39.820> dyed

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
and smooth and since her hair is dyed

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.189 
and smooth and since her hair is dyed
her<00:04:42.070> hair<00:04:42.099> tends<00:04:42.580> to<00:04:42.729> go<00:04:43.060> dry<00:04:43.449> so<00:04:43.810> that's<00:04:43.990> the

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
her hair tends to go dry so that's the

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:46.409 
her hair tends to go dry so that's the
very<00:04:44.590> reason<00:04:44.919> why<00:04:45.130> the<00:04:45.669> apple<00:04:46.150> cider<00:04:46.270> vinegar

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
very reason why the apple cider vinegar

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.110 
very reason why the apple cider vinegar
and<00:04:46.960> this<00:04:47.169> whole<00:04:47.530> hair<00:04:48.190> mask
