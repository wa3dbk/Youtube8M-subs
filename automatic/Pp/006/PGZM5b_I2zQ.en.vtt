00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.170 
three four five now six is like a cactus
place<00:03:09.230> that's<00:03:09.590> actually<00:03:10.220> not<00:03:10.490> necessary<00:03:11.090> to

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
place that's actually not necessary to

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.970 
place that's actually not necessary to
even<00:03:11.510> be<00:03:11.660> in<00:03:11.690> a<00:03:11.810> greenhouse<00:03:14.110> hey<00:03:15.110> well<00:03:15.620> simply

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
even be in a greenhouse hey well simply

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.580 
even be in a greenhouse hey well simply
because<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.850> reason<00:03:17.150> we<00:03:17.540> have<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:18.230> wheat<00:03:18.440> in

because the reason we have the wheat in

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.110 
because the reason we have the wheat in
a<00:03:18.680> greenhouse<00:03:18.920> is<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.460> protect<00:03:19.760> it<00:03:19.940> from

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
a greenhouse is to protect it from

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.990 
really that smart or I hadn't learned
everything<00:05:05.810> I<00:05:06.110> know<00:05:06.140> about<00:05:06.380> redstone<00:05:07.310> so<00:05:07.760> I

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
everything I know about redstone so I

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.260 
everything I know about redstone so I
actually<00:05:08.960> have<00:05:09.620> an<00:05:09.710> open<00:05:10.010> door<00:05:10.220> and<00:05:10.610> a<00:05:10.760> closed

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
actually have an open door and a closed

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.500 
actually have an open door and a closed
door<00:05:11.600> button<00:05:12.190> it's<00:05:13.190> kind<00:05:13.430> of<00:05:13.520> silly<00:05:13.820> you<00:05:14.300> could

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
door button it's kind of silly you could

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.840 
door button it's kind of silly you could
actually<00:05:14.660> have<00:05:14.930> one<00:05:15.290> button<00:05:15.860> that<00:05:16.340> opens<00:05:16.370> it

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
actually have one button that opens it

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.220 
actually have one button that opens it
and<00:05:17.000> then<00:05:17.240> you<00:05:17.360> press<00:05:17.540> it<00:05:17.600> again<00:05:17.930> and<00:05:18.110> it

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.230 
and then you press it again and it

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.350 
and then you press it again and it
closes<00:05:18.440> it<00:05:18.770> I've<00:05:19.400> showed<00:05:19.700> you<00:05:19.820> all<00:05:19.940> how<00:05:20.120> to<00:05:20.150> do

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
closes it I've showed you all how to do

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.720 
closes it I've showed you all how to do
that<00:05:20.480> in<00:05:20.600> another<00:05:20.690> video<00:05:21.650> I<00:05:21.860> have<00:05:23.380> but<00:05:24.730> anyway

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
that in another video I have but anyway

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:31.330 
that in another video I have but anyway
so<00:05:26.570> here's<00:05:26.930> my<00:05:27.050> lab<00:05:29.230> and<00:05:30.230> I<00:05:30.560> can<00:05:30.740> like<00:05:30.980> kind<00:05:31.280> of

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
so here's my lab and I can like kind of

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.760 
so here's my lab and I can like kind of
make<00:05:31.520> videos<00:05:31.970> in<00:05:32.270> here<00:05:32.750> um<00:05:33.620> I<00:05:35.500> don't<00:05:36.500> know<00:05:36.680> I

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
make videos in here um I don't know I

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.980 
make videos in here um I don't know I
really<00:05:37.010> like<00:05:37.220> it<00:05:37.400> the<00:05:37.580> clean-cut<00:05:38.150> pneus<00:05:38.630> of<00:05:38.840> it

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
really like it the clean-cut pneus of it

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.860 
really like it the clean-cut pneus of it
of<00:05:39.830> the<00:05:40.130> wolf<00:05:40.370> or<00:05:40.760> so<00:05:41.030> you<00:05:41.120> can<00:05:41.270> kind<00:05:41.480> of<00:05:41.540> count

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
of the wolf or so you can kind of count

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.760 
of the wolf or so you can kind of count
squares<00:05:42.440> when<00:05:42.800> looking<00:05:43.100> at<00:05:43.250> red<00:05:43.490> wire<00:05:44.770> spacing

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
squares when looking at red wire spacing

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.430 
squares when looking at red wire spacing
etc<00:05:46.040> and<00:05:46.730> then<00:05:46.910> the<00:05:47.300> lighting<00:05:47.690> above<00:05:47.990> this<00:05:48.290> is

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
etc and then the lighting above this is

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.470 
etc and then the lighting above this is
what<00:05:48.590> kind<00:05:48.830> of<00:05:48.920> makes<00:05:49.670> it<00:05:49.820> squares<00:05:50.180> below

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:50.480 
what kind of makes it squares below

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.860 
what kind of makes it squares below
stand<00:05:50.870> out<00:05:51.050> like<00:05:51.200> they<00:05:51.380> do<00:05:51.790> so<00:05:52.790> yeah<00:05:53.060> that's<00:05:53.630> it

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
stand out like they do so yeah that's it

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.590 
stand out like they do so yeah that's it
a<00:05:53.900> big<00:05:54.620> room<00:05:55.280> full<00:05:55.580> of<00:05:55.640> fuzzy<00:05:56.150> wool<00:05:58.390> then<00:05:59.390> I<00:05:59.420> can

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 
a big room full of fuzzy wool then I can

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.630 
a big room full of fuzzy wool then I can
do<00:05:59.720> like<00:05:59.900> different<00:06:00.290> redstone<00:06:00.740> experiments

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 
do like different redstone experiments

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.530 
do like different redstone experiments
in<00:06:01.910> this<00:06:02.450> room<00:06:02.720> and<00:06:03.310> yeah<00:06:04.310> so<00:06:04.940> it's<00:06:05.150> kind<00:06:05.390> of<00:06:05.450> a

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:05.540
