00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:01.350 
two people have asked me to draw a

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.249 
two people have asked me to draw a
laptop<00:00:01.920> the<00:00:02.100> diamond<00:00:02.639> guy<00:00:02.909> and<00:00:03.179> Nicko<00:00:03.689> Kuhlman

laptop the diamond guy and Nicko Kuhlman
here<00:00:04.859> we<00:00:04.980> go<00:00:05.130> let's<00:00:05.549> not<00:00:05.759> talk<00:00:06.029> about<00:00:06.060> it<00:00:06.509> let's

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
here we go let's not talk about it let's

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.220 
here we go let's not talk about it let's
do<00:00:07.770> it<00:00:10.160> to<00:00:11.160> draw<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.759> laptop<00:00:12.690> what<00:00:12.929> do<00:00:12.990> you<00:00:13.080> want

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
do it to draw a laptop what do you want

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.230 
do it to draw a laptop what do you want
to<00:00:13.320> do<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.860> start<00:00:14.130> off<00:00:14.250> with<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:15.000> draw<00:00:15.360> a

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
to do to start off with is to draw a

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
to do to start off with is to draw a
parallelogram

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
parallelogram

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.060 
parallelogram
remember<00:00:20.189> those<00:00:21.380> that's<00:00:22.380> parallel<00:00:22.859> there's

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
remember those that's parallel there's

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.310 
remember those that's parallel there's
two<00:00:23.250> parallel<00:00:23.699> sides<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.180> parallel<00:00:24.750> then

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
two parallel sides to a parallel then

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.160 
two parallel sides to a parallel then
you're<00:00:25.529> going<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.710> want<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:25.949> Inc<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:27.480> sort

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
you're going to want to Inc in the sort

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.740 
you're going to want to Inc in the sort
of<00:00:28.429> rectangle<00:00:29.429> bit<00:00:29.640> in<00:00:29.849> there<00:00:30.179> but<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.630> want

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
of rectangle bit in there but you want

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.959 
of rectangle bit in there but you want
to<00:00:30.929> curl<00:00:31.460> around<00:00:32.460> these<00:00:32.700> corners<00:00:34.730> let's<00:00:35.730> see

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
to curl around these corners let's see

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.040 
to curl around these corners let's see
give<00:00:36.180> those<00:00:36.420> corners<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:38.090> curved<00:00:39.090> corners<00:00:39.690> and

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
give those corners a curved corners and

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.910 
give those corners a curved corners and
then<00:00:40.770> we<00:00:41.010> need<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.219> thickness<00:00:42.770> to<00:00:43.770> this

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
then we need a thickness to this

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.440 
then we need a thickness to this
computer<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.730> we're<00:00:44.879> just<00:00:45.030> going<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.210> go<00:00:45.329> along

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
computer so we're just going to go along

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.229 
computer so we're just going to go along
like<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.260> up<00:00:46.649> there<00:00:47.070> now<00:00:47.789> what<00:00:48.090> you're

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
like that and up there now what you're

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.500 
like that and up there now what you're
going<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.420> want<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.629> do<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.289> add<00:00:49.500> more<00:00:50.510> add

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
going to want to do is to add more add

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.689 
going to want to do is to add more add
the<00:00:51.750> back<00:00:51.989> okay<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:52.649> we're<00:00:53.039> going<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.280> go<00:00:53.430> up

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
the back okay so we're going to go up

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.090 
the back okay so we're going to go up
like<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.329> up<00:00:55.760> like<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.890> it's<00:00:58.890> got<00:00:59.070> a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
like that up like that and it's got a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.549 
like that up like that and it's got a
kind<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.399> he<00:00:59.879> got<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.180> feel<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.809> it's<00:01:00.960> kind<00:01:01.500> of

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
kind of he got to feel that it's kind of

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.319 
kind of he got to feel that it's kind of
opening<00:01:02.430> up<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.820> they're<00:01:02.969> kind<00:01:03.270> of

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
opening up and that they're kind of

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.210 
opening up and that they're kind of
about<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.600> same<00:01:03.809> height<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:04.949> going<00:01:05.159> to

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
about the same height so it's going to

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.320 
about the same height so it's going to
be<00:01:05.339> about<00:01:05.640> like<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.720> maybe<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.229> fraction<00:01:07.950> more

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
be about like that maybe a fraction more

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.090 
be about like that maybe a fraction more
so<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.659> coming<00:01:09.960> up<00:01:10.080> about<00:01:10.320> here<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.040> I

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
so this is coming up about here and I

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.700 
so this is coming up about here and I
think<00:01:11.310> it's<00:01:11.640> slightly<00:01:12.030> more<00:01:12.380> you<00:01:13.380> have<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.619> do

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
think it's slightly more you have to do

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.300 
think it's slightly more you have to do
this<00:01:13.830> by<00:01:14.010> eye

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
this by eye

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.460 
this by eye
really<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.479> these<00:01:15.750> lines<00:01:16.049> should<00:01:16.320> be<00:01:16.380> parallel

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
really so these lines should be parallel

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.890 
really so these lines should be parallel
there<00:01:19.970> now<00:01:20.970> what<00:01:21.180> I'm<00:01:21.299> going<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.479> do<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.810> I'm

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
there now what I'm going to do is I'm

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.940 
there now what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.049> go<00:01:22.170> around<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.500> bottom<00:01:22.619> I'm<00:01:22.830> going

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
going to go around the bottom I'm going

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.330 
going to go around the bottom I'm going
to<00:01:23.040> leave<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> little<00:01:23.490> gap<00:01:23.850> there<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:25.130> then<00:01:26.130> up

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
to leave a little gap there and then up

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.600 
to leave a little gap there and then up
around<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.700> corner<00:01:27.560> up<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.009> top<00:01:29.310> run

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
around the corner up to the top run

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.069 
around the corner up to the top run
around<00:01:29.930> up<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.259> top<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.740> around<00:01:32.840> down<00:01:33.840> and

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
around up to the top and around down and

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.450 
around up to the top and around down and
join<00:01:34.229> up<00:01:34.439> with<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.979> then<00:01:35.009> I'm<00:01:35.189> going<00:01:35.369> to

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
join up with that and then I'm going to

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.920 
join up with that and then I'm going to
put<00:01:35.640> an<00:01:35.729> extra<00:01:35.970> one<00:01:36.210> down<00:01:36.420> there<00:01:36.689> which<00:01:36.810> is

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
put an extra one down there which is

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.920 
put an extra one down there which is
going<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.110> be<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.320> thickness<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.040> side<00:01:38.310> I

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
going to be the thickness on the side I

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.190 
going to be the thickness on the side I
get<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.079> put<00:01:40.470> little<00:01:40.680> tiny<00:01:41.250> curves<00:01:41.759> there<00:01:42.299> to

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
get to put little tiny curves there to

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.960 
get to put little tiny curves there to
be<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:44.610> hinge<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.950> then<00:01:46.950> we<00:01:47.189> need<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.490> put<00:01:47.759> the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
be the hinge and then we need to put the

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.950 
be the hinge and then we need to put the
kind<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:49.280> fascia<00:01:50.280> thing<00:01:50.759> around<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.750> LCD

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
kind of fascia thing around the LCD

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.480 
kind of fascia thing around the LCD
screen<00:01:54.619> be<00:01:55.619> like<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:56.040> you're<00:01:56.159> going<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.340> want

screen be like that you're going to want

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.200 
screen be like that you're going to want
a<00:01:56.549> little<00:01:56.810> circle<00:01:57.810> there<00:01:57.840> field<00:01:58.200> camera<00:01:58.740> and

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
a little circle there field camera and

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.609 
a little circle there field camera and
the<00:02:00.590> manufacturers<00:02:01.590> name<00:02:01.860> there

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
the manufacturers name there

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.709 
the manufacturers name there
now<00:02:03.490> we<00:02:03.700> want<00:02:03.880> to<00:02:03.969> do<00:02:04.090> some<00:02:04.329> more<00:02:06.719> parallel

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
now we want to do some more parallel

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:10.469 
now we want to do some more parallel
lines<00:02:08.019> with<00:02:08.440> parallel<00:02:09.340> lines<00:02:09.610> like<00:02:09.729> that<00:02:09.879> more

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
lines with parallel lines like that more

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.940 
lines with parallel lines like that more
another<00:02:10.750> parallel<00:02:11.200> line<00:02:11.440> there<00:02:11.709> another

step by step print sheets like this when

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.390 
step by step print sheets like this when
you<00:03:37.090> are<00:03:37.120> sure<00:03:37.660> that<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:38.019> ink<00:03:38.290> is<00:03:38.560> dry<00:03:38.590> then

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
you are sure that the ink is dry then

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.879 
you are sure that the ink is dry then
you<00:03:39.609> raise<00:03:39.880> those<00:03:40.209> pencil<00:03:40.780> lines<00:03:40.829> I'm<00:03:41.829> going

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
you raise those pencil lines I'm going

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.440 
you raise those pencil lines I'm going
to<00:03:42.130> put<00:03:42.310> a<00:03:42.340> little<00:03:42.579> thing<00:03:42.760> like<00:03:42.819> that<00:03:43.239> and

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
to put a little thing like that and

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.800 
to put a little thing like that and
that's<00:03:43.569> going<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:43.989> be<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.910> power<00:03:46.329> cable

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
that's going to be the power cable

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.860 
that's going to be the power cable
coming<00:03:47.049> out<00:03:47.609> and<00:03:48.609> then<00:03:48.910> this<00:03:49.090> is<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.359> edge<00:03:49.599> of

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
coming out and then this is the edge of

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.159 
coming out and then this is the edge of
the<00:03:50.260> table<00:03:51.239> so<00:03:52.239> the<00:03:52.329> power<00:03:52.540> cable<00:03:52.870> will<00:03:53.019> go

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:53.169 
the table so the power cable will go

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:56.610 
the table so the power cable will go
over<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:53.650> edge<00:03:53.910> and<00:03:54.910> then<00:03:55.630> I'm<00:03:56.049> just<00:03:56.349> going<00:03:56.560> to

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
over the edge and then I'm just going to

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.000 
over the edge and then I'm just going to
put<00:03:56.799> a<00:03:56.829> little<00:03:56.980> bit<00:03:57.160> of<00:03:57.280> shading<00:03:57.609> here<00:03:58.889> just<00:03:59.889> to

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
put a little bit of shading here just to

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.240 
put a little bit of shading here just to
kind<00:04:00.190> of<00:04:00.250> put<00:04:00.310> it<00:04:00.609> on<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:00.880> table<00:04:01.120> a<00:04:02.130> little<00:04:03.130> bit

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
kind of put it on the table a little bit

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.129 
kind of put it on the table a little bit
of<00:04:03.340> shading<00:04:03.579> on<00:04:03.819> there<00:04:04.150> and<00:04:04.480> we're<00:04:05.049> just

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
of shading on there and we're just

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.740 
of shading on there and we're just
shading<00:04:05.680> there<00:04:06.010> like<00:04:06.280> that<00:04:06.519> just<00:04:07.480> to<00:04:07.599> make<00:04:07.690> it

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
shading there like that just to make it

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.420 
shading there like that just to make it
look<00:04:07.959> a<00:04:08.049> little<00:04:08.290> more<00:04:08.500> interesting<00:04:09.220> I'm<00:04:09.400> going

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
look a little more interesting I'm going

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.509 
look a little more interesting I'm going
to<00:04:09.669> use<00:04:09.819> a<00:04:09.849> COPI<00:04:10.510> channel<00:04:11.079> marker<00:04:11.650> you<00:04:12.219> don't

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
to use a COPI channel marker you don't

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.120 
to use a COPI channel marker you don't
have<00:04:12.819> to<00:04:13.030> or<00:04:13.239> you<00:04:13.269> could<00:04:13.569> use<00:04:13.719> a<00:04:13.750> pencil

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130
