00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 good morning with you i'm olga platonov and 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.980
 good mood probably many of 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.160
 you have rhododendrons in the garden almost 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.950
 each such a situation bought a plant 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.520
 taken out of the pot planted the next 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.640
 year thrown and the thing is that 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.090
 rhododendrons 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.890
 love a special soil and pit planting 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.619
 before you plant there 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.869
 need to prepare a special way in 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.109
 first it must be several times 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.300
 wider than the pot in which you bought 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.480
 plant 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:41.510
 dig it out and now need to fill 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:44.460
 its peat peat is sold special for 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.800
 rhododendrons it is important simple horse 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.730
 peat may not be suitable it may be 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.329
 too sour 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.940
 take and fill them pit but this 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:58.440
 not enough now need to add 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.440
 needles cass new 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:05.689
 why exactly from the basics the fact is that in 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.880
 nature rhododendrons grow under 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.850
 pine forest canopy 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.340
 when all the ingredients you mix need 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.950
 be sure to pay everything properly 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.280
 kicks and only after that 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.780
 dig a new hole to the size of the root 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.780
 your plant systems 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.730
 take the plant out of the pot trying 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.510
 preserve as much land as possible and 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:36.280
 immersing it in a new landing pit 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.000
 try when planting root collar 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.530
 Russia and in no case do not bury 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.810
 now the soil is needed 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.740
 grumble and much we will also 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.900
 special is pine candles every spring 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.840
 i cut it myself so that they 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.590
 were fluffy and leave them can be 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.080
 mulch 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.010
 rhododendrons they rot and enrich 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.710
 the soil 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:04.150
 acidic reactions just what is needed 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.790
 for rhododendrons do not be afraid to plant in 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.560
