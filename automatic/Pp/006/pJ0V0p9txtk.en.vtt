buying this set if you can find it it's

buying this set if you can find it it's
a<00:05:37.730> good<00:05:37.970> set<00:05:38.450> but<00:05:39.290> there's<00:05:39.530> some<00:05:39.800> things<00:05:39.830> that

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
a good set but there's some things that

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.030 
a good set but there's some things that
I<00:05:40.550> don't<00:05:40.760> exactly<00:05:41.270> like<00:05:41.780> about<00:05:42.080> it<00:05:42.110> I<00:05:43.780> actually

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.040 
I don't exactly like about it I actually

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.950 
I don't exactly like about it I actually
do<00:05:46.040> not<00:05:46.280> like<00:05:47.980> how<00:05:48.980> they<00:05:49.580> made<00:05:49.880> this<00:05:50.270> look<00:05:50.600> I

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
do not like how they made this look I

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.810 
do not like how they made this look I
think<00:05:51.560> that<00:05:51.800> it<00:05:52.010> should<00:05:52.280> have<00:05:52.430> had<00:05:52.580> the

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
think that it should have had the

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.660 
think that it should have had the
pattern<00:05:53.380> here<00:05:54.380> as<00:05:54.710> well<00:05:54.920> make<00:05:55.340> smooth

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:55.670 
pattern here as well make smooth

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.790 
pattern here as well make smooth
efficacious<00:05:55.970> you<00:05:56.420> can<00:05:56.570> see<00:05:56.750> that<00:05:56.930> they<00:05:57.680> just

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
efficacious you can see that they just

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.250 
efficacious you can see that they just
put<00:05:58.040> this<00:05:58.250> here<00:05:58.580> I<00:05:58.760> think<00:05:59.240> they<00:05:59.390> should<00:06:00.140> have

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
put this here I think they should have

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.230 
put this here I think they should have
made<00:06:00.410> it<00:06:00.560> better<00:06:01.130> by<00:06:02.030> fixing<00:06:02.780> that<00:06:03.550> it<00:06:04.550> was

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
made it better by fixing that it was

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.750 
made it better by fixing that it was
