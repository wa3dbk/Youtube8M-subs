really<00:01:01.370> over<00:01:02.000> simplifying<00:01:02.449> just<00:01:02.750> to<00:01:02.840> call<00:01:03.020> it

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
really over simplifying just to call it

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.570 
really over simplifying just to call it
a<00:01:03.199> protein<00:01:03.350> shake<00:01:03.710> it's<00:01:03.890> so<00:01:04.129> much<00:01:04.309> more<00:01:04.519> than

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
a protein shake it's so much more than

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.749 
a protein shake it's so much more than
that<00:01:04.790> but<00:01:05.229> I've<00:01:06.229> got<00:01:06.410> the<00:01:06.500> shake<00:01:06.770> man<00:01:07.070> and<00:01:07.369> what

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.499 
finally sort of understanding is that I
wasn't<00:01:42.410> eating<00:01:42.770> enough<00:01:43.190> man<00:01:43.520> even<00:01:43.940> though<00:01:44.119> I

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
wasn't eating enough man even though I

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.109 
wasn't eating enough man even though I
was<00:01:45.229> never<00:01:45.410> hungry<00:01:45.830> I<00:01:46.100> don't<00:01:46.369> eat<00:01:46.670> whenever<00:01:46.940> I

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
was never hungry I don't eat whenever I

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.300 
was never hungry I don't eat whenever I
was<00:01:47.210> hungry<00:01:47.450> I<00:01:47.780> wasn't<00:01:48.679> getting<00:01:49.070> enough

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
was hungry I wasn't getting enough

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.540 
was hungry I wasn't getting enough
calories<00:01:50.440> probably<00:01:51.440> not<00:01:51.560> enough<00:01:51.800> protein<00:01:52.340> or

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
calories probably not enough protein or

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.839 
calories probably not enough protein or
carbs<00:01:53.119> to<00:01:53.780> be<00:01:53.959> building<00:01:54.470> muscle<00:01:55.220> mass<00:01:55.399> I<00:01:55.670> just

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:55.849 
carbs to be building muscle mass I just

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:56.740 
carbs to be building muscle mass I just
wasn't

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
wasn't

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.470 
wasn't
so<00:01:57.550> but<00:01:58.550> that's<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.760> thing<00:01:58.820> right<00:01:59.180> it's<00:01:59.390> a

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
so but that's the thing right it's a

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.150 
so but that's the thing right it's a
trip<00:01:59.780> right<00:01:59.930> like<00:02:00.200> you<00:02:00.320> need<00:02:00.530> your<00:02:00.710> calories

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
trip right like you need your calories

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.530 
trip right like you need your calories
right<00:02:01.190> like<00:02:01.640> I<00:02:01.760> don't<00:02:01.820> know<00:02:01.970> what<00:02:02.180> I<00:02:02.330> don't

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
right like I don't know what I don't

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.060 
right like I don't know what I don't
know<00:02:02.600> what<00:02:02.690> the<00:02:02.750> figures<00:02:03.110> are<00:02:03.260> it's<00:02:03.650> different

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
know what the figures are it's different

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.650 
know what the figures are it's different
for<00:02:04.130> everyone<00:02:04.340> but<00:02:04.580> let's<00:02:05.030> say<00:02:05.240> you<00:02:05.270> need

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
for everyone but let's say you need

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.340 
for everyone but let's say you need
3,000<00:02:06.530> calories<00:02:06.710> a<00:02:07.250> day<00:02:07.840> to<00:02:08.840> build<00:02:09.110> muscle

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
3,000 calories a day to build muscle

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.100 
3,000 calories a day to build muscle
while<00:02:09.830> working<00:02:10.310> out<00:02:10.490> right<00:02:10.759> if<00:02:11.540> you<00:02:11.720> have<00:02:11.870> too

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
while working out right if you have too

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.310 
while working out right if you have too
many<00:02:12.260> calories<00:02:12.620> or<00:02:13.600> you<00:02:14.600> don't<00:02:14.870> work<00:02:15.110> out

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
many calories or you don't work out

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.890 
many calories or you don't work out
enough<00:02:15.760> those<00:02:16.760> calories<00:02:17.360> that<00:02:17.540> you<00:02:17.570> haven't

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
enough those calories that you haven't

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.650 
enough those calories that you haven't
burnt<00:02:18.140> off<00:02:18.610> they<00:02:19.610> just<00:02:19.820> because<00:02:20.240> they<00:02:20.330> turn<00:02:20.540> to

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
burnt off they just because they turn to

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.500 
burnt off they just because they turn to
fat<00:02:20.900> so<00:02:21.440> I<00:02:21.890> mean<00:02:22.610> this<00:02:22.700> good<00:02:22.910> calories<00:02:23.270> back

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
fat so I mean this good calories back

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.660 
fat so I mean this good calories back
now<00:02:23.750> is<00:02:23.900> I<00:02:23.990> think<00:02:24.470> I'm<00:02:24.709> sorta<00:02:25.130> i'm<00:02:25.310> sort<00:02:25.580> of

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
now is I think I'm sorta i'm sort of

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.790 
now is I think I'm sorta i'm sort of
money<00:02:26.000> month<00:02:26.300> my<00:02:26.780> knowledge<00:02:26.990> is<00:02:27.290> growing<00:02:27.620> all

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
money month my knowledge is growing all

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.990 
money month my knowledge is growing all
the<00:02:27.860> time<00:02:27.950> but<00:02:28.370> it's<00:02:28.520> kind<00:02:28.730> of<00:02:28.790> limited<00:02:29.260> so

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
the time but it's kind of limited so

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.760 
the time but it's kind of limited so
basically<00:02:32.000> it's<00:02:32.330> like<00:02:32.480> a<00:02:32.870> bit<00:02:33.050> of<00:02:33.080> a<00:02:33.230> juggle

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
basically it's like a bit of a juggle

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.500 
basically it's like a bit of a juggle
right<00:02:33.980> you<00:02:34.160> want<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:34.430> be<00:02:34.489> eating<00:02:34.850> enough<00:02:35.270> that

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
you did healthy foods getting enough

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.060 
you did healthy foods getting enough
calories<00:02:38.420> protein<00:02:38.959> and<00:02:39.350> carbs<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:39.830> build

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
calories protein and carbs to build

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.040 
calories protein and carbs to build
muscle<00:02:40.489> but<00:02:41.030> you<00:02:41.150> don't<00:02:41.360> want<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:41.540> overdo<00:02:41.870> it

capable<00:03:46.319> of

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
capable of

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.040 
capable of
I<00:03:47.459> think<00:03:47.910> a<00:03:47.970> lot<00:03:48.000> of<00:03:48.150> people<00:03:48.239> man<00:03:48.750> when<00:03:48.959> they

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
I think a lot of people man when they

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.100 
I think a lot of people man when they
start<00:03:49.349> something<00:03:49.769> they<00:03:49.890> get<00:03:50.010> so<00:03:50.480> hell-bent<00:03:51.480> on

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
start something they get so hell-bent on

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.290 
start something they get so hell-bent on
the<00:03:52.260> end<00:03:52.440> result<00:03:52.860> you<00:03:53.129> know<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:53.910> they<00:03:54.060> think

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
the end result you know and they think

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.000 
the end result you know and they think
they're<00:03:54.420> a<00:03:54.450> failure<00:03:55.019> if<00:03:55.290> they<00:03:55.470> didn't<00:03:55.739> achieve

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
they're a failure if they didn't achieve

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.300 
they're a failure if they didn't achieve
what<00:03:56.760> they<00:03:56.790> set<00:03:57.150> out<00:03:57.180> to<00:03:57.300> achieve<00:03:58.220> you<00:03:59.220> know

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
what they set out to achieve you know

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.650 
what they set out to achieve you know
that's<00:03:59.489> one<00:03:59.730> way<00:03:59.879> of<00:03:59.910> looking<00:04:00.060> at<00:04:00.330> it<00:04:00.390> if

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
that's one way of looking at it if

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.540 
that's one way of looking at it if
that's<00:04:01.050> what<00:04:01.170> motivates<00:04:01.769> you<00:04:02.040> then<00:04:02.250> fair
