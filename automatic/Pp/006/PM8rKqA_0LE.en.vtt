00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.040 
five people will be back in the hospital
in<00:02:05.440> the<00:02:06.040> years<00:02:06.340> after<00:02:06.670> their<00:02:06.940> surgery<00:02:07.150> so<00:02:07.780> for

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
in the years after their surgery so for

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.889 
in the years after their surgery so for
the<00:02:08.260> study<00:02:08.470> from<00:02:08.649> California<00:02:09.450> for<00:02:10.450> every<00:02:10.720> year

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
the study from California for every year

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.480 
the study from California for every year
that<00:02:10.960> was<00:02:11.110> studied<00:02:11.560> about<00:02:11.920> one<00:02:12.190> in<00:02:12.310> five

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
that was studied about one in five

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.040 
that was studied about one in five
people<00:02:12.550> is<00:02:13.000> back<00:02:13.240> in<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.510> hospital<00:02:13.630> after

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
people is back in the hospital after

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.900 
people is back in the hospital after
their<00:02:14.320> room<00:02:14.530> why<00:02:14.770> with<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.250> gastric<00:02:15.610> bypass

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
their room why with a gastric bypass

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.780 
their room why with a gastric bypass
related<00:02:16.780> complication<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:17.740> then<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.760> other

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
related complication and then the other

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.580 
related complication and then the other
really<00:02:19.240> disappointing<00:02:19.810> feature<00:02:20.080> of<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.470> row

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
really disappointing feature of the row

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.100 
really disappointing feature of the row
and<00:02:20.740> why<00:02:20.920> is<00:02:21.370> that<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:21.940> fails<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:22.600> is<00:02:22.870> there's

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
and why is that it fails that is there's

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.290 
and why is that it fails that is there's
a<00:02:23.170> fairly<00:02:23.380> high<00:02:23.530> rate<00:02:24.040> of<00:02:24.310> people<00:02:24.880> regaining

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
a fairly high rate of people regaining

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.440 
a fairly high rate of people regaining
their<00:02:25.540> way<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:26.080> it's<00:02:26.800> not<00:02:26.950> easy<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.340> revise<00:02:27.670> so

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
their way and it's not easy to revise so

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.150 
their way and it's not easy to revise so
the<00:02:28.570> ruin<00:02:28.840> why<00:02:28.989> is<00:02:29.050> not<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.320> bad<00:02:29.530> surgery<00:02:29.770> lots

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
the ruin why is not a bad surgery lots

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.940 
the ruin why is not a bad surgery lots
of<00:02:30.310> people<00:02:30.580> do<00:02:30.700> well<00:02:30.940> with<00:02:31.150> it<00:02:31.440> but<00:02:32.440> there's

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
of people do well with it but there's

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.010 
of people do well with it but there's
certainly<00:02:33.310> room<00:02:33.370> for<00:02:33.550> improvement<00:02:34.239> a<00:02:34.480> new

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
certainly room for improvement a new

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.690 
certainly room for improvement a new
popular<00:02:35.590> choice<00:02:35.860> for<00:02:35.890> weight<00:02:36.340> loss<00:02:36.520> surgery

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
popular choice for weight loss surgery

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.850 
popular choice for weight loss surgery
is<00:02:37.060> something<00:02:37.360> called<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.600> Lap<00:02:37.780> Band<00:02:37.860> well

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
is something called the Lap Band well

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.280 
is something called the Lap Band well
that<00:02:39.010> band<00:02:39.280> is<00:02:39.459> great<00:02:39.910> is<00:02:40.180> it<00:02:40.510> improves<00:02:40.930> on<00:02:41.200> the

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
that band is great is it improves on the

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.650 
that band is great is it improves on the

safety profile of the room why the

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.270 
safety profile of the room why the
disadvantage<00:02:44.290> of<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.470> band<00:02:44.680> is<00:02:44.920> it<00:02:45.100> has<00:02:45.250> a

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
disadvantage of the band is it has a

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.270 
disadvantage of the band is it has a
very<00:02:45.610> low<00:02:46.570> effectiveness<00:02:47.260> so<00:02:47.650> that<00:02:47.800> over<00:02:48.040> time

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
very low effectiveness so that over time

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.400 
very low effectiveness so that over time
up<00:02:49.030> to<00:02:49.209> fifty<00:02:49.450> percent<00:02:49.750> of<00:02:49.840> people<00:02:49.989> fail

up to fifty percent of people fail
initial<00:02:51.310> weight<00:02:51.459> loss<00:02:51.670> is<00:02:51.970> only<00:02:52.150> so-so<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:53.380> so

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
working very well and if you think about

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.080 
working very well and if you think about
it<00:03:01.900> basically<00:03:02.410> a<00:03:02.530> block<00:03:02.800> shoot<00:03:03.160> from<00:03:03.790> eating

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
it basically a block shoot from eating

it basically a block shoot from eating
healthy<00:03:04.420> foods<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:05.260> it<00:03:05.500> allows<00:03:05.770> you<00:03:06.040> to<00:03:06.100> eat

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220

again is relatively safe not as safe as

a bad and about as effective as the band

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.350 
a bad and about as effective as the band
