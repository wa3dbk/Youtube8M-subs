they do a really good job of breaking up
the<00:03:55.160> fights<00:03:55.400> just<00:03:56.180> the<00:03:56.359> right<00:03:56.480> amount<00:03:56.540> of

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
the fights just the right amount of

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.120 
the fights just the right amount of
movement<00:03:57.079> so<00:03:57.500> it<00:03:57.590> doesn't<00:03:57.829> feel<00:03:57.950> like<00:03:58.010> you're

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
movement so it doesn't feel like you're

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.890 
movement so it doesn't feel like you're
stuck<00:03:58.400> in<00:03:58.549> arena<00:03:58.820> after<00:03:58.970> arena<00:03:59.359> and<00:03:59.540> all<00:03:59.810> this

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
stuck in arena after arena and all this

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:00.789 
stuck in arena after arena and all this
doesn't<00:04:00.170> feel<00:04:00.290> like<00:04:00.380> you're<00:04:00.530> wandering

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
doesn't feel like you're wandering

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.160 
doesn't feel like you're wandering
aimlessly<00:04:01.390> some<00:04:02.390> people<00:04:02.600> might<00:04:02.750> argue<00:04:02.810> that

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
aimlessly some people might argue that

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.410 
aimlessly some people might argue that
there<00:04:03.350> isn't<00:04:03.650> a<00:04:03.680> whole<00:04:03.950> ton<00:04:04.340> to<00:04:04.549> do<00:04:04.700> as<00:04:04.940> you

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
there isn't a whole ton to do as you

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.090 
there isn't a whole ton to do as you
wander<00:04:05.690> the<00:04:05.900> halls<00:04:06.049> or<00:04:06.350> jump<00:04:06.620> from<00:04:06.799> platform

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
wander the halls or jump from platform

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.130 
wander the halls or jump from platform
to<00:04:07.190> platform<00:04:07.250> in<00:04:07.700> between<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:08.450> battles<00:04:08.780> but<00:04:08.989> I

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
to platform in between the battles but I

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.599 
to platform in between the battles but I
think<00:04:09.350> that<00:04:09.470> adds<00:04:09.680> a<00:04:09.799> great<00:04:10.100> change<00:04:10.459> of<00:04:10.579> pace

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
think that adds a great change of pace

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:12.430 
think that adds a great change of pace
and<00:04:10.940> for<00:04:11.269> me<00:04:11.359> was<00:04:11.480> one<00:04:11.569> of<00:04:11.659> the<00:04:11.720> most<00:04:11.840> fun<00:04:12.140> parts

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
and for me was one of the most fun parts

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.050 
and for me was one of the most fun parts
of<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:12.560> game<00:04:12.709> the<00:04:13.370> actual<00:04:13.580> feeling<00:04:13.970> of

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
of the game the actual feeling of

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.050 
of the game the actual feeling of
movement<00:04:14.180> DMC<00:04:14.780> is<00:04:14.900> quite<00:04:15.200> freeing<00:04:15.590> and

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
movement DMC is quite freeing and

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.170 
movement DMC is quite freeing and
an<00:04:16.480> excellent<00:04:17.200> addition<00:04:17.380> I<00:04:18.040> think<00:04:18.549> to<00:04:18.970> this

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
an excellent addition I think to this

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.490 
an excellent addition I think to this
kind<00:04:19.329> of<00:04:19.450> game<00:04:19.630> it's<00:04:19.870> it's<00:04:20.019> one<00:04:20.169> thing<00:04:20.320> to<00:04:20.380> be

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
kind of game it's it's one thing to be

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.409 
kind of game it's it's one thing to be
going<00:04:20.799> from<00:04:20.980> five<00:04:21.579> to<00:04:21.700> fight<00:04:21.880> and<00:04:22.090> using<00:04:22.360> all

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
going from five to fight and using all

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.000 
going from five to fight and using all
