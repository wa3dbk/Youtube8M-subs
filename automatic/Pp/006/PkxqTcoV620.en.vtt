USBC gold certified coach and we're

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.130 
USBC gold certified coach and we're
going<00:00:14.540> to<00:00:14.570> talk<00:00:14.720> a<00:00:14.750> little<00:00:14.990> bit<00:00:15.110> about

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:15.140 
going to talk a little bit about

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.140 
going to talk a little bit about
adjustments<00:00:15.950> and<00:00:16.309> I<00:00:16.340> think<00:00:16.609> you<00:00:17.000> know<00:00:17.090> too

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
adjustments and I think you know too

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.210 
adjustments and I think you know too
often<00:00:17.660> we<00:00:18.019> find<00:00:18.199> ourselves<00:00:18.380> lined<00:00:18.830> up<00:00:19.010> in<00:00:19.160> a

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
often we find ourselves lined up in a

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.920 
often we find ourselves lined up in a
game<00:00:19.430> and<00:00:19.640> then<00:00:19.760> you<00:00:20.000> know<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:20.420> lanes<00:00:20.630> change

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
game and then you know the lanes change

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.900 
game and then you know the lanes change
as<00:00:21.140> they<00:00:21.289> inevitably<00:00:21.560> are<00:00:21.920> gonna<00:00:22.010> do<00:00:22.310> we<00:00:22.789> got

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
as they inevitably are gonna do we got

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.760 
as they inevitably are gonna do we got
to<00:00:23.029> find<00:00:23.210> ways<00:00:23.390> to<00:00:23.449> stay<00:00:23.960> lined<00:00:24.260> up<00:00:24.470> and<00:00:24.650> that's

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
to find ways to stay lined up and that's

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.140 
to find ways to stay lined up and that's
probably<00:00:24.980> one<00:00:25.190> of<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:25.340> more<00:00:25.460> frustrating

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
probably one of the more frustrating

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.359 
probably one of the more frustrating
things<00:00:26.390> and<00:00:26.840> in<00:00:27.140> today's<00:00:27.590> game<00:00:27.859> is<00:00:27.920> you<00:00:28.279> know

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
things and in today's game is you know

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:29.679 
things and in today's game is you know
what<00:00:28.550> do<00:00:28.609> we<00:00:28.699> how<00:00:28.850> do<00:00:28.910> we<00:00:29.029> fine-tune<00:00:29.510> things

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
what do we how do we fine-tune things

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.630 
what do we how do we fine-tune things
what<00:00:29.930> do<00:00:29.990> we<00:00:30.080> want<00:00:30.260> to<00:00:30.350> do<00:00:30.470> to<00:00:30.650> make<00:00:30.980> sure<00:00:31.130> we're

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
what do we want to do to make sure we're

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.700 
what do we want to do to make sure we're
accurately<00:00:32.449> hitting<00:00:32.989> what<00:00:33.109> we<00:00:33.230> want<00:00:33.410> to<00:00:33.559> and

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
accurately hitting what we want to and

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.350 
accurately hitting what we want to and
getting<00:00:33.829> to<00:00:34.039> the<00:00:34.129> pocket<00:00:34.519> well<00:00:35.000> oftentimes

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
getting to the pocket well oftentimes

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.810 
getting to the pocket well oftentimes
the<00:00:36.170> big<00:00:36.470> moves<00:00:36.770> aren't<00:00:37.040> the<00:00:37.160> way<00:00:37.280> to<00:00:37.340> go<00:00:37.550> you

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
the big moves aren't the way to go you

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.610 
the big moves aren't the way to go you
might<00:00:37.970> need<00:00:38.120> just<00:00:38.329> little<00:00:38.570> moves<00:00:38.780> and<00:00:38.989> I<00:00:39.350> found

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
might need just little moves and I found

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.260 
might need just little moves and I found
a<00:00:39.710> way<00:00:39.829> by<00:00:39.980> moving<00:00:40.220> the<00:00:40.399> heels<00:00:40.670> just<00:00:41.000> slightly

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
a way by moving the heels just slightly

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.790 
a way by moving the heels just slightly
but<00:00:41.540> you<00:00:41.660> have<00:00:41.809> to<00:00:41.960> keep<00:00:42.079> your<00:00:42.230> body<00:00:42.380> in<00:00:42.590> a<00:00:42.649> box

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
but you have to keep your body in a box

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.490 
but you have to keep your body in a box
so<00:00:43.100> everything<00:00:43.610> turns<00:00:43.940> with<00:00:44.899> you<00:00:45.110> you<00:00:45.260> can't

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
so everything turns with you you can't

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.780 
so everything turns with you you can't
get<00:00:45.620> your<00:00:45.770> feet<00:00:45.950> going<00:00:46.190> one<00:00:46.370> way<00:00:46.399> and<00:00:46.579> the

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
get your feet going one way and the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.160 
get your feet going one way and the
shoulders<00:00:47.180> go<00:00:47.329> in<00:00:47.480> another<00:00:47.719> and<00:00:47.899> your<00:00:47.989> push

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
shoulders go in another and your push

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.959 
shoulders go in another and your push
away<00:00:48.410> another<00:00:48.680> way<00:00:48.890> they<00:00:49.340> all<00:00:49.460> have<00:00:49.640> to<00:00:49.790> stay

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
away another way they all have to stay

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.000 
away another way they all have to stay
connected<00:00:50.329> so<00:00:50.690> you're<00:00:50.840> in<00:00:51.020> that<00:00:51.230> box<00:00:51.530> by

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
connected so you're in that box by

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.709 
connected so you're in that box by
moving<00:00:52.340> just<00:00:52.489> the<00:00:52.610> heels<00:00:52.850> one<00:00:53.210> way<00:00:53.390> to<00:00:53.450> the

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
moving just the heels one way to the

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.299 
moving just the heels one way to the
either<00:00:53.989> to<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.379> left<00:00:54.410> the<00:00:54.800> ball<00:00:54.950> can<00:00:55.160> go<00:00:55.190> to

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
either to the left the ball can go to

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.279 
either to the left the ball can go to
the<00:00:55.550> right<00:00:55.700> a<00:00:55.730> little<00:00:56.000> bit<00:00:56.120> more<00:00:56.239> or<00:00:56.870> moving

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
the right a little bit more or moving

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:58.420 
the right a little bit more or moving
them<00:00:57.379> to<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:57.649> right<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:58.039> ball<00:00:58.190> would<00:00:58.309> go<00:00:58.340> a

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
them to the right the ball would go a

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.590 
them to the right the ball would go a
little<00:00:58.579> bit<00:00:58.730> left<00:00:58.940> and<00:00:59.120> now<00:00:59.239> you've<00:00:59.420> got<00:00:59.539> a

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
little bit left and now you've got a

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.900 
little bit left and now you've got a
different<00:01:00.079> adjustment<00:01:00.320> fine<00:01:01.250> line<00:01:01.550> without

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
different adjustment fine line without

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.209 
different adjustment fine line without
physically<00:01:02.629> moving<00:01:02.930> three<00:01:03.620> or<00:01:03.739> four<00:01:03.920> boards

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:04.219 
physically moving three or four boards

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:05.889 
physically moving three or four boards
so<00:01:04.489> you<00:01:04.579> normally<00:01:04.909> bring<00:01:05.119> laterally<00:01:05.570> on<00:01:05.600> their

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:05.899 
so you normally bring laterally on their

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:06.760 
so you normally bring laterally on their
approach<00:01:06.079> you're<00:01:06.229> going<00:01:06.350> to<00:01:06.409> stand<00:01:06.590> in<00:01:06.680> the

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
approach you're going to stand in the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.319 
approach you're going to stand in the
same<00:01:06.920> place<00:01:07.189> but<00:01:07.429> we're<00:01:07.639> just<00:01:07.819> trying<00:01:08.029> to<00:01:08.090> find

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:08.329 
same place but we're just trying to find

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:09.849 
same place but we're just trying to find
a<00:01:08.450> way<00:01:08.539> to<00:01:08.569> change<00:01:08.990> your<00:01:09.200> launch<00:01:09.439> angle

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:09.859 
a way to change your launch angle

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:11.469 
a way to change your launch angle
through<00:01:10.069> the<00:01:10.189> front<00:01:10.490> to<00:01:10.939> help<00:01:11.119> you<00:01:11.209> get<00:01:11.359> it

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
through the front to help you get it

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:12.760 
through the front to help you get it
going<00:01:11.779> a<00:01:11.840> little<00:01:11.959> further<00:01:12.200> right<00:01:12.350> or

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
going a little further right or

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:23.370 
going a little further right or
sometimes<00:01:13.520> a<00:01:13.759> little<00:01:13.850> bit<00:01:14.479> more

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.870

need to move the heels to the left if
you<00:01:36.469> miss<00:01:36.679> to<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:36.950> right<00:01:37.250> turn<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:38.119> heels<00:01:38.329> to

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
you miss to the right turn the heels to

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:40.179 
you miss to the right turn the heels to
the<00:01:38.600> right<00:01:38.689> that<00:01:39.049> will<00:01:39.289> line<00:01:39.530> up<00:01:39.560> and<00:01:39.920> give<00:01:40.069> you

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
the right that will line up and give you

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:41.949 
the right that will line up and give you
a<00:01:40.219> fine<00:01:40.549> line<00:01:40.759> adjust<00:01:41.060> without<00:01:41.390> physically

00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:41.959 
a fine line adjust without physically

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:44.230 
a fine line adjust without physically
moving<00:01:42.289> on<00:01:42.709> the<00:01:42.979> approach<00:01:43.310> let's<00:01:43.909> try<00:01:44.179> it

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
moving on the approach let's try it

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.999 
moving on the approach let's try it
again

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
again

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.499 
again
this<00:01:46.009> is<00:01:46.189> where<00:01:46.369> Matt's<00:01:46.610> been<00:01:46.819> lining<00:01:47.030> up<00:01:47.270> and

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
this is where Matt's been lining up and

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:48.850 
this is where Matt's been lining up and
he<00:01:47.630> just<00:01:47.869> missed<00:01:48.079> a<00:01:48.170> little<00:01:48.259> bit<00:01:48.380> on<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.679> high

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
he just missed a little bit on the high

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.550 
he just missed a little bit on the high
side<00:01:48.890> so<00:01:49.399> we<00:01:49.549> need<00:01:49.579> to<00:01:49.969> move<00:01:50.209> his<00:01:50.390> heels<00:01:50.719> to<00:01:51.380> the

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
side so we need to move his heels to the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.469 
side so we need to move his heels to the
left<00:01:51.829> the<00:01:52.220> direction<00:01:52.700> of<00:01:52.789> the<00:01:52.909> ball<00:01:53.060> is<00:01:53.270> moving

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
left the direction of the ball is moving

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.510 
left the direction of the ball is moving
so<00:01:53.929> watch<00:01:54.170> as<00:01:54.349> he<00:01:54.470> turns<00:01:54.709> his<00:01:54.920> heels<00:01:55.130> but

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
so watch as he turns his heels but

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.160 
so watch as he turns his heels but
remember<00:01:55.939> his<00:01:56.090> whole<00:01:56.299> body<00:01:56.569> and<00:01:56.780> shoulders

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
remember his whole body and shoulders

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.539 
remember his whole body and shoulders
and<00:01:57.259> everything<00:01:57.349> has<00:01:57.770> to<00:01:57.950> stay<00:01:58.159> within<00:01:58.369> that

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
and everything has to stay within that

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.850 
and everything has to stay within that
box<00:01:59.000> so<00:01:59.630> that<00:01:59.810> he<00:01:59.929> can<00:02:00.079> get<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.319> ball<00:02:00.500> to<00:02:00.829> the

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
box so that he can get the ball to the

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.249 
box so that he can get the ball to the
right<00:02:01.189> so<00:02:01.880> everything<00:02:02.360> you<00:02:02.539> missed<00:02:02.750> left<00:02:02.989> can

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
right so everything you missed left can

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.260 
right so everything you missed left can
you<00:02:03.319> move<00:02:03.500> left<00:02:03.709> if<00:02:04.009> you<00:02:04.189> miss<00:02:04.369> right<00:02:04.670> you<00:02:05.060> move

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
you move left if you miss right you move

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.230 
you move left if you miss right you move
to<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.539> right

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.700 

so<00:02:10.240> I<00:02:10.300> was<00:02:10.450> a<00:02:10.479> great<00:02:10.780> shot<00:02:11.110> Karen<00:02:11.500> and<00:02:11.620> that

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
so I was a great shot Karen and that

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.170 
so I was a great shot Karen and that
really<00:02:11.980> good<00:02:12.160> adjustment<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:12.790> you<00:02:13.060> know<00:02:13.150> I

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
really good adjustment and you know I

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.520 
really good adjustment and you know I
always<00:02:13.330> feel<00:02:13.600> like<00:02:13.630> you<00:02:14.110> know<00:02:14.200> some<00:02:14.380> of<00:02:14.410> these

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
always feel like you know some of these

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.890 
always feel like you know some of these
fine<00:02:14.890> tuning<00:02:15.550> adjustments<00:02:16.240> that<00:02:16.330> we<00:02:16.480> make<00:02:16.690> are

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
fine tuning adjustments that we make are

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.420 
fine tuning adjustments that we make are
really<00:02:17.320> critical<00:02:17.800> when<00:02:17.950> we're<00:02:18.070> bowling<00:02:18.250> on

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
really critical when we're bowling on

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.490 
really critical when we're bowling on
sport<00:02:18.760> patterns<00:02:19.150> we<00:02:19.750> really<00:02:19.990> don't<00:02:20.200> want<00:02:20.410> to

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
sport patterns we really don't want to

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.960 
sport patterns we really don't want to
move<00:02:20.620> around<00:02:20.740> too<00:02:21.070> much<00:02:21.220> left<00:02:21.520> to<00:02:21.640> right<00:02:21.820> on

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
move around too much left to right on

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.490 
move around too much left to right on
the<00:02:22.090> lane<00:02:22.240> we<00:02:22.390> want<00:02:22.600> to<00:02:22.690> see<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:22.930> more<00:02:23.050> front<00:02:23.350> to

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
the lane we want to see it more front to

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.020 
the lane we want to see it more front to
back<00:02:23.680> right<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:24.460> that<00:02:24.550> gives<00:02:24.760> us<00:02:24.880> another

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
back right and that gives us another

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.330 
back right and that gives us another
idea<00:02:25.750> of<00:02:25.810> how<00:02:25.900> to<00:02:26.050> move<00:02:26.350> without<00:02:26.800> physically

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
idea of how to move without physically

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.370 
idea of how to move without physically
moving<00:02:27.610> any<00:02:27.910> boards<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.540> there's<00:02:29.140> another

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
moving any boards and there's another

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.350 
moving any boards and there's another
way<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.650> moving<00:02:30.310> forward<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:30.730> back<00:02:30.910> on<00:02:31.180> the

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
way to moving forward and back on the

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.060 
way to moving forward and back on the
approach<00:02:31.690> shortening<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.650> lane<00:02:32.830> or

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
approach shortening the lane or

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.380 
approach shortening the lane or
lengthening<00:02:33.460> the<00:02:33.580> lane<00:02:33.760> as<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.210> ball

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
lengthening the lane as the ball

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.600 
lengthening the lane as the ball
finishes
