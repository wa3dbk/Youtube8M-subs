00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello girls today come and record this video 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.720
 to try to help other girls who 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.790
 also has oil problem in the 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.040
 skin just like I know it's annoying to have 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.809
 to create oily skin and difficult thing 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.170
 already products that do not leave our skin 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.940
 even more oily so I tested many 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.010
 products during my whole life and 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.630
 some of them have worked very well for me and 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.210
 I already saw you recommended to me 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.340
 it helps the skin then you too 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.170
 I hope they like I will start 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.210
 I'll start by talking about makeup I think 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.340
 that in this matter what matters most is the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.410
 because it will determine 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.170
 really the thing will get your skin 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.170
 during the day the bases that use the most 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.079
 This one, look at the Lancome market and the 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.480
 brand macmaster to try when 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.670
 How is it that in my day to day life is a 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.539
 very light base it does not look like 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.690
 in her face that of that novelty and is 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.449
 very creamy so it does not stay a touch 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.670
 dry but I find it very light and like 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.539
 a shape of her shape does very well 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.570
 for the skin 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.880
 she never assaulted my taste leaves 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.670
 much less expensive than many bases 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.659
 that I have tested in my life and when I 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.420
 I want to do a heavier makeup 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.570
 To go out for the photoshoot at night. 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.670
 This is the perfect one here. 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.860
 leaves very dry skin had very good 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.340
 It has to pass before the moisturizer to 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.080
 do not let the skin is beginning to climb 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.659
 because she makes the skin a good man 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.939
 sequinha is so this is one of mine 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.869
 favorite bands are worth it 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.670
 I also bought makeup that the 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.890
 recommend this little hole here in my 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.720
 to see that it is a loose powder also has the 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.780
 compact version that I think is more 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.689
 practical, such that you can carry in your purse 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:49.110
 but I bought this from here the consultant is 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.790
 very good because I like it that way 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.360
 too much to use powder during the day to 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.909
 the face and this 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.009
 here does not leave with face of mass race 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.570
 Do not make me look like you know 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.930
 Paul and passes will create inter 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.900
 layers until your face arrives 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.610
 here then this is too bad this here is 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.500
 very thin very light 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.940
 just have to take a little care have 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.190
 It is the time to move is this one 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.990
 enough because it does not roll that 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.030
 story that you hit the flash has to 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.150
 meet the bank in your face that is not 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.580
 very cool but it's just that sea ​​that stays 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.340
 very good this was perfect leaves the skin 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.660
 with an incredible touch so i recommend 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.160
 very many people who have oily skin 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.600
 I do not like to put cream on my face. 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.459
 because I think it's better to stay longer 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.410
 oily yet it has nothing to do and 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.910
 hydration has to do with loyalty and 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.150
 cup is very important to maintain a 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.790
 beautiful skin then be lived with this 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.420
 people can advertise cream 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.160
 so it's very important date the face 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.590
 yes before doing makeup before 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.970
 sleeping these things is an ungrateful always 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.830
 give only once a day 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.010
 before doing the makeup whenever 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.810
 then everything else slipped there I wrote 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.260
 here it is very good and does not leave the skin 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:03.290
 oleo that is toledo and jane lynch do da 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.270
 la roche posay I do not know how the name speaks 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.360
 of this difficult French brand 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:11.209
 anyway it is very good, very light and 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.610
 very tasty texture dries very quickly 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.410
 so I recommend super to anyone 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.330
 looking for a moisturizer good taste if 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.250
 You do not wear sunscreen because you 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.530
 Do you think your skin looks goosebumps? 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.510
 change your life now because I have two 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.350
 sunscreens to highly recommend 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.900
 Good 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.420
 This one here looks chic from you here. 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:33.380
 natura that is of corpus christi has factor 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.540
 50 mine and it 's toxic so it's a lot 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.630
 good for oily skin even is you 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.840
 it happens in time they are not left 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.660
 trace of goo is very good until it is good 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.299
 Occasionally I intersperse is envious is 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.250
 This one I use the protector when the 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:54.260
 my base has no producer and the 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:56.750
 vice of ke ha and natura body 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.519
 my balance is factor 30 he is 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.160
 resistant to water and sweat 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.900
 it is a gel then impossible to 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.360
 cooking will not stay 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.790
 cooking on me I'm the queen of 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.260
 demanded of the sunscreens and 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.980
 These ones really save my 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.409
 life 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.870
 then you are looking for O was 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:17.639
 This is recommended, this is a very 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.859
 Wonderful for oily skin is water 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.479
 thermal I love I bought this miniature 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.669
 now to be able to walk with her in the bag 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.009
 because you always ask me 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.479
 I like to pass this trick on my face. 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.789
 Even when I'm wearing makeup I can 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:32.550
 be loaded makeup and do not have 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:33.960
 problem it dries naturally and leaves 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.789
 skin feeling a lot more 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.760
 Dryer but at the same time I said thank you 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:42.680
 and there are several stops that make it super good 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:45.270
 skin so I recommend a lot of thermal water 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.210
 soaps let's see these two here 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:51.240
 It's my favorite of natura da natura. 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.669
 chronos it is a cleaning foam is 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.150
 me to my combination skin is the version 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:58.800
 oily and leaves the skin is very good and this 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.320
 It's over here so I'm using it now. 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.680
 this league which is also cool is the 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.199
 same thing multi cleaning is is very 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.599
 exciting because more liquid too 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.599
 When you press it, it turns another u 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.310
 take care of child given by then I 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.860
 I washed my skin every day with this taste 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.050
 in this style and winter car with protex 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.599
 because it is the best taste of all to 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.250
 my skin is leaving super fine but 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:31.909
 also leaves about more if you use all 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.590
 the days, so I ended up talking to this 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:37.080
 and lastly I want to talk about a make-up remover 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:40.409
 That was always a problem in my life. 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.180
 because those are normal not to take away the 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:45.060
 makeup did not take a river to the test 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.400
 designers and designers. 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.860
 those biphasics who have eyes letting 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.289
 my face is very disgusting then 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.180
 And then I did not ask. 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:55.320
 these handkerchiefs to take the makeup are 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.630
 wonderful 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.060
 This one is from a supermarket that I 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.909
 I bought that I went during my trip. 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.159
 compile a bundle of drawings 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:06.880
 more time to sell at the pharmacy has the 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:10.930
 of the snow which are very good 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:13.210
 so the cost of around $ 20 it has 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:16.060
 for all different skin types 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.080
 Usually comes the 25 handkerchiefs hard to 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.080
 damn it 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.550
 so very good it leaves the skin well 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.610
 cleanser takes off all makeup does not leave 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:27.280
 disgusting the use of machines make and 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.410
 Good, this cable was fast I even did 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.020
 My recommendations here for you are 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.640
 This is one more tip that 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.220
 true because it is a tip that was already well 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.540
 spread out there but at least it's not 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.430
 face with very hot very hot water 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.960
 because you will pay as you like to see a 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.660
 Hill of thorn will get very curious 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.430
 even it is ideal to wash with warm water and 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.930
 Then when I left the bath, I passed a 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.370
 ice water to close the 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.100
 pores I think this is also one of the 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:53.680
 most important tips of all is if you 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:56.140
 wear fringe things that leave the skin 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.880
 muffled is trying to give a wash instead 

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:00.430
 when to let the skin breathe too 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.170
 it is very important the clean brushes 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.840
 because it gives more of the 

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:06.850
 grease and I hope you have 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.590
