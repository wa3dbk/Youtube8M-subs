00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.900 
I got it in the shade medium deep and um
basically<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.750> way<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:18.900> see<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.350> it's

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
basically the way I see it it's

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.849 
basically the way I see it it's
something<00:00:20.910> like<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:21.060> tinted<00:00:21.480> moisturizer<00:00:21.859> but

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
something like a tinted moisturizer but

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.279 
something like a tinted moisturizer but
it<00:00:23.010> has<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.189> lot<00:00:23.400> more<00:00:23.640> coverage<00:00:24.600> than<00:00:24.630> its<00:00:25.050> into

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
it has a lot more coverage than its into

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.490 
it has a lot more coverage than its into
moisturizer<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:26.789> for<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.210> reason<00:00:27.269> alone<00:00:27.869> I

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
moisturizer so for that reason alone I

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.170

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
so that I don't break out I think that

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.549 
so that I don't break out I think that
some<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.660> lot<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.870> reasons<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.320> lot<00:00:55.440> of

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
some a lot of the reasons a lot of

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.709 
some a lot of the reasons a lot of
people<00:00:56.100> break<00:00:56.309> out<00:00:56.520> because<00:00:56.760> their<00:00:56.969> pores<00:00:57.360> are

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
people break out because their pores are

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.040 
people break out because their pores are
always<00:00:58.050> getting<00:00:59.010> full<00:00:59.370> you<00:01:00.030> know<00:01:00.149> dirt<00:01:00.750> and

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
colors lectures as well but this one

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.009 
colors lectures as well but this one
actually<00:02:38.400> is<00:02:39.400> a<00:02:39.459> shade<00:02:40.060> that<00:02:40.090> matches<00:02:40.359> me<00:02:40.989> the

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
actually is a shade that matches me the

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.839 
actually is a shade that matches me the
mediums<00:02:41.590> deep<00:02:41.920> ones<00:02:42.189> so<00:02:42.609> or<00:02:43.269> negative<00:02:43.659> it

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849

blends well into my skin not that it
perfectly<00:02:47.859> matches<00:02:48.370> me<00:02:48.519> but<00:02:48.700> it<00:02:48.819> just<00:02:48.970> blends

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239
