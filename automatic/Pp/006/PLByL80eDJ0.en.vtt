00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
simulator and I know it's not for a

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.549 
simulator and I know it's not for a
little<00:00:11.130> while<00:00:11.280> but<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:12.030> literally<00:00:12.750> just<00:00:13.259> found

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.510 
out about it and I am so excited for
this<00:00:15.780> game<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.260> had<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:16.920> share<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.250> with<00:00:17.369> you

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
this game I had to share it with you

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.730 
this game I had to share it with you
guys

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
guys

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.590

so<00:00:19.740> Artemis<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.340> multiplayer<00:00:20.939> spaceship

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
so Artemis is a multiplayer spaceship

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.900 
so Artemis is a multiplayer spaceship

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
thinking ok this is a spaceship bridge

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.330 
thinking ok this is a spaceship bridge
simulator<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.140> what<00:00:46.350> do<00:00:46.410> people<00:00:46.680> actually<00:00:46.890> do

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
simulator so what do people actually do

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.119 
simulator so what do people actually do
one<00:00:47.850> person<00:00:48.270> plays<00:00:48.510> as<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.719> captain<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.500> from

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
their device they get to run the

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.450 
their device they get to run the
simulation<00:00:51.930> server<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.860> main<00:00:53.129> screen

the nice thing about this game being
cross-platform<00:01:33.549> is<00:01:34.030> that<00:01:34.149> you<00:01:34.210> could<00:01:34.329> have<00:01:34.360> a

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
cross-platform is that you could have a

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.660 
cross-platform is that you could have a
number<00:01:34.750> of<00:01:35.079> different<00:01:35.350> setups<00:01:35.560> one<00:01:36.009> ideal<00:01:36.460> way

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
number of different setups one ideal way

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.969 
number of different setups one ideal way
to<00:01:36.729> set<00:01:37.000> up<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.119> system<00:01:37.390> is<00:01:37.750> to<00:01:38.229> have<00:01:38.259> the

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
to set up the system is to have the

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.520 
to set up the system is to have the
captain's<00:01:39.429> console<00:01:39.939> be<00:01:40.420> a<00:01:40.450> PC<00:01:41.079> that's<00:01:41.259> running
