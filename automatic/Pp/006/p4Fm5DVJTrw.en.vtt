a four row stripe or any stripe that's
more<00:00:12.070> than<00:00:12.340> two<00:00:12.580> rows<00:00:12.820> this<00:00:13.570> is<00:00:13.780> how<00:00:13.960> you<00:00:14.020> do<00:00:14.320> it

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000 
more than two rows this is how you do it

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.920 
more than two rows this is how you do it
on<00:00:16.270> the<00:00:16.840> two<00:00:17.050> row<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:18.820> would<00:00:18.970> pull<00:00:19.270> the

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930 
on the two row you would pull the

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.530 
on the two row you would pull the
secondary<00:00:20.530> yarn<00:00:20.860> up<00:00:21.100> from<00:00:21.430> the<00:00:21.580> bottom<00:00:21.790> on<00:00:22.180> the

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.540 
secondary yarn up from the bottom on the

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.690 
secondary yarn up from the bottom on the
four<00:00:23.440> row<00:00:23.619> you're<00:00:23.860> not<00:00:24.010> ready<00:00:24.250> for<00:00:24.490> that<00:00:24.550> yet

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:24.700 
four row you're not ready for that yet

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.630 
four row you're not ready for that yet
but<00:00:25.180> you<00:00:25.300> still<00:00:25.630> need<00:00:25.810> to<00:00:25.869> pull<00:00:26.230> it<00:00:26.380> up<00:00:26.640> twist

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
but you still need to pull it up twist

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.990 
but you still need to pull it up twist
it<00:00:27.910> around<00:00:28.060> and<00:00:28.710> then<00:00:29.710> continue<00:00:30.460> with<00:00:30.700> the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
it around and then continue with the

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.920 
it around and then continue with the
color<00:00:31.360> that<00:00:31.660> you're<00:00:31.810> using<00:00:32.310> that<00:00:33.310> way<00:00:33.930> you

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
color that you're using that way you

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.350 
color that you're using that way you
continue<00:00:35.500> to<00:00:35.650> pull<00:00:35.890> it<00:00:36.010> up<00:00:36.130> as<00:00:36.370> you<00:00:37.060> go<00:00:37.090> along

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
continue to pull it up as you go along

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.290 
continue to pull it up as you go along
so<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:39.040> just<00:00:39.489> continue<00:00:40.270> doing<00:00:40.630> the<00:00:40.870> four<00:00:41.140> rows

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
so you just continue doing the four rows

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.910 
so you just continue doing the four rows
and<00:00:43.300> I'll<00:00:43.420> show<00:00:43.660> you<00:00:43.720> what<00:00:43.930> to<00:00:43.960> do<00:00:44.200> next<00:00:46.920> now

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
and I'll show you what to do next now

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.220 
and I'll show you what to do next now
we've<00:00:48.130> done<00:00:48.340> the<00:00:48.520> four<00:00:48.820> rows<00:00:49.120> of<00:00:49.150> the<00:00:49.480> gray<00:00:49.810> and

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
we've done the four rows of the gray and

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.090 
we've done the four rows of the gray and
we're<00:00:50.830> ready<00:00:51.040> to<00:00:51.130> do<00:00:51.430> the<00:00:51.460> four<00:00:51.880> rows<00:00:52.150> of<00:00:52.480> red

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
we're ready to do the four rows of red

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.750 
we're ready to do the four rows of red
so<00:00:54.100> you<00:00:54.190> just<00:00:54.460> pull<00:00:54.790> the<00:00:55.150> yarn<00:00:55.390> up<00:00:55.630> and<00:00:55.930> luckily

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
so you just pull the yarn up and luckily

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.970 
so you just pull the yarn up and luckily
since<00:00:57.760> you<00:00:58.060> pulled<00:00:58.570> it<00:00:58.720> up<00:00:58.840> before<00:00:59.230> it's

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
since you pulled it up before it's

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.130 
since you pulled it up before it's
closer<00:01:00.370> to<00:01:00.790> where<00:01:01.390> you<00:01:01.540> want<00:01:01.750> it<00:01:01.840> to<00:01:01.990> be

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
closer to where you want it to be

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.560 
closer to where you want it to be
otherwise<00:01:02.590> it<00:01:02.890> would<00:01:03.040> be<00:01:03.070> down<00:01:03.910> here<00:01:04.390> and

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
otherwise it would be down here and

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.289 
otherwise it would be down here and
you'd<00:01:04.780> have<00:01:04.930> a<00:01:05.170> big<00:01:05.379> loop<00:01:05.710> so<00:01:06.670> now<00:01:06.850> you<00:01:06.909> just

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
you'd have a big loop so now you just

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:14.060 
you'd have a big loop so now you just
start<00:01:07.630> with<00:01:08.560> the<00:01:08.710> red<00:01:08.950> and<00:01:10.110> knit<00:01:11.110> four<00:01:11.560> rows

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.580 

now<00:01:15.070> I've<00:01:15.250> knit<00:01:15.549> two<00:01:16.060> rows<00:01:16.090> of<00:01:16.329> the<00:01:16.689> red<00:01:16.930> so

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
now I've knit two rows of the red so

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.910 
now I've knit two rows of the red so
again<00:01:18.009> I'm<00:01:18.310> going<00:01:18.640> to<00:01:18.729> twist<00:01:19.210> the<00:01:19.450> yarn<00:01:19.920> I'm

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
again I'm going to twist the yarn I'm

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.360 
again I'm going to twist the yarn I'm
going<00:01:20.980> to<00:01:21.340> pull<00:01:21.550> the<00:01:21.790> gray<00:01:22.030> up<00:01:22.920> pull<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:23.950> red

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
going to pull the gray up pull the red

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.520 
going to pull the gray up pull the red
under<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.120> gray<00:01:25.360> and<00:01:26.370> just<00:01:27.370> start<00:01:28.210> knitting

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
under the gray and just start knitting

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.200

for<00:01:29.530> the<00:01:29.740> last<00:01:30.270> two<00:01:31.320> rows<00:01:32.320> of<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:32.979> fourth<00:01:33.340> so

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
for the last two rows of the fourth so

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.890 
for the last two rows of the fourth so
there's<00:01:34.450> our<00:01:34.690> four<00:01:35.110> rows<00:01:35.909> now<00:01:36.909> I'm<00:01:37.270> ready<00:01:37.600> to

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.060 
that from below but if you are going to
knit<00:01:45.040> more<00:01:45.640> rows<00:01:45.940> of<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.360> red<00:01:46.600> you<00:01:47.470> would<00:01:47.740> once

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
knit more rows of the red you would once

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.649 
knit more rows of the red you would once
again<00:01:48.780> pull<00:01:49.780> it<00:01:49.960> over<00:01:50.560> and<00:01:51.040> then<00:01:52.030> pull<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.450> red

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
under and continue with the red I'm not

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.530 
under and continue with the red I'm not
going<00:01:56.740> to<00:01:56.860> do<00:01:57.010> that<00:01:57.190> though<00:01:57.490> I'm<00:01:57.970> going<00:01:58.330> to

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
going to do that though I'm going to

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.490 
going to do that though I'm going to
knit<00:01:58.750> gray<00:02:00.570> so<00:02:01.570> I'm<00:02:01.720> going<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.080> pull<00:02:02.290> that

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
knit gray so I'm going to pull that

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.310 
knit gray so I'm going to pull that
under

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
under

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.570 
under
but<00:02:04.010> that<00:02:04.220> basically<00:02:04.610> is<00:02:05.120> how<00:02:05.150> you<00:02:05.360> do

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
but that basically is how you do

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.520 
but that basically is how you do
changing<00:02:07.580> color<00:02:07.850> for<00:02:08.509> rows<00:02:08.990> of<00:02:09.460> knitting

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
changing color for rows of knitting

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.040 
changing color for rows of knitting
there<00:02:12.530> you<00:02:12.680> have<00:02:12.860> it
