00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.180 
when Napoleon and I first met each other
he<00:02:28.630> was<00:02:28.780> like<00:02:28.930> a<00:02:28.959> gym<00:02:29.200> rat<00:02:29.380> I<00:02:29.620> would<00:02:29.830> exercise

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
he was like a gym rat I would exercise

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.670 
he was like a gym rat I would exercise
but<00:02:31.090> I<00:02:31.120> didn't<00:02:31.420> know<00:02:31.540> anything<00:02:31.840> about<00:02:32.260> health

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
but I didn't know anything about health

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.340 
but I didn't know anything about health
and<00:02:32.890> nutrition<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:34.120> when<00:02:34.299> we<00:02:34.480> started<00:02:34.870> dating

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
and nutrition so when we started dating

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.680 
and nutrition so when we started dating
it<00:02:35.470> was<00:02:35.590> like<00:02:35.709> he<00:02:35.860> opened<00:02:36.220> Pandora's<00:02:37.180> box<00:02:37.450> he

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
it was like he opened Pandora's box he

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.570 
it was like he opened Pandora's box he
brought<00:02:37.840> me<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:38.049> the<00:02:38.170> gym<00:02:38.440> I<00:02:38.769> would<00:02:38.830> do<00:02:39.130> sunjin

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
brought me to the gym I would do sunjin

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.729 
brought me to the gym I would do sunjin
ism<00:02:39.850> we<00:02:39.940> would<00:02:40.120> train<00:02:40.420> and<00:02:40.810> I<00:02:40.989> think<00:02:41.470> I<00:02:41.530> was<00:02:41.650> in

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
ism we would train and I think I was in

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.770 
ism we would train and I think I was in
the<00:02:41.830> best<00:02:41.980> shape<00:02:42.069> of<00:02:42.340> my<00:02:42.400> life<00:02:42.670> I<00:02:42.970> feel<00:02:43.120> like<00:02:43.510> my

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
the best shape of my life I feel like my

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.870 
the best shape of my life I feel like my
body<00:02:44.049> has<00:02:44.200> maintained<00:02:44.799> a<00:02:44.890> good<00:02:45.069> muscle<00:02:45.489> memory

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
body has maintained a good muscle memory

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.780 
body has maintained a good muscle memory
so<00:02:46.150> with<00:02:46.630> all<00:02:46.810> my<00:02:46.989> dancing<00:02:47.620> I<00:02:47.830> can<00:02:48.160> maintain<00:02:48.370> it

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
so with all my dancing I can maintain it

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.729 
so with all my dancing I can maintain it
pretty<00:02:49.030> well<00:02:49.239> because<00:02:49.690> I<00:02:49.780> don't<00:02:49.959> overeat<00:02:50.410> and

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
pretty well because I don't overeat and

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.800 
pretty well because I don't overeat and
I'm<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.040> opposite<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:51.730> like<00:02:52.180> to<00:02:52.299> work<00:02:52.569> out

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
I'm the opposite I like to work out

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.530 
I'm the opposite I like to work out
really<00:02:53.170> hard<00:02:53.290> and<00:02:53.769> then<00:02:53.980> eat<00:02:54.340> like<00:02:54.519> a<00:02:54.549> madman<00:02:55.030> I

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
really hard and then eat like a madman I

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.539 
really hard and then eat like a madman I
was<00:02:55.959> worried<00:02:56.290> about<00:02:56.410> what<00:02:57.130> it<00:02:57.250> would<00:02:57.370> be<00:02:57.519> like

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
was worried about what it would be like

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.610 
was worried about what it would be like
to<00:02:57.940> be<00:02:58.060> pregnant<00:02:58.299> and<00:02:58.750> how<00:02:59.170> much<00:02:59.350> weight<00:02:59.590> I

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
to be pregnant and how much weight I

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.470 
to be pregnant and how much weight I
would<00:02:59.799> gain<00:03:00.100> so<00:03:00.549> she<00:03:00.609> eats<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:01.030> same<00:03:01.180> amount

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
would gain so she eats the same amount

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.750 
would gain so she eats the same amount
as<00:03:01.600> me<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:02.140> I<00:03:02.290> work<00:03:02.470> out<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:02.920> we<00:03:03.489> gain<00:03:03.640> the

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
as me and I work out and we gain the

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.740 
as me and I work out and we gain the
same<00:03:03.880> amount<00:03:04.120> of<00:03:04.150> weight<00:03:04.269> so<00:03:04.450> that's<00:03:04.570> the

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
same amount of weight so that's the

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.479 
same amount of weight so that's the
frustrating<00:03:05.109> part<00:03:05.380> I've<00:03:05.739> only<00:03:05.920> gained<00:03:06.220> about

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
frustrating part I've only gained about

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.910 
frustrating part I've only gained about
12<00:03:06.940> pounds<00:03:07.180> for<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:07.900> pregnancy<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:08.650> I<00:03:08.739> think

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
12 pounds for the pregnancy and I think

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.470 
12 pounds for the pregnancy and I think
Napoleon's<00:03:09.310> gained<00:03:09.519> about<00:03:09.670> 12<00:03:10.120> pounds<00:03:10.329> to

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.590 

work<00:03:16.480> has<00:03:16.690> been<00:03:16.870> such<00:03:17.140> a<00:03:18.450> everything<00:03:19.450> that

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
work has been such a everything that

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.470 
work has been such a everything that
Holly<00:03:19.989> and<00:03:20.140> I<00:03:20.200> do<00:03:20.260> is<00:03:20.980> work<00:03:21.430> we<00:03:21.819> love<00:03:22.180> what<00:03:22.359> we

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
Holly and I do is work we love what we

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.809 
Holly and I do is work we love what we
do<00:03:22.720> because<00:03:23.140> we<00:03:23.470> do<00:03:23.620> it<00:03:23.739> together<00:03:23.920> we<00:03:24.549> rarely

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
do because we do it together we rarely

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.390 
do because we do it together we rarely
think<00:03:25.269> about<00:03:25.600> saying<00:03:26.380> no<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:26.680> a<00:03:26.799> job<00:03:26.920> because

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
think about saying no to a job because

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.979 
think about saying no to a job because
it<00:03:27.640> doesn't<00:03:27.910> feel<00:03:28.030> like<00:03:28.120> work<00:03:28.450> but<00:03:28.690> I<00:03:28.780> can

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
it doesn't feel like work but I can

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.539 
it doesn't feel like work but I can
assure<00:03:29.109> you<00:03:29.260> do<00:03:29.590> it<00:03:29.739> you<00:03:29.950> know<00:03:30.040> we<00:03:30.160> always<00:03:30.310> have

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
assure you do it you know we always have

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:31.349 
assure you do it you know we always have
that<00:03:30.609> motto

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
that motto

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:32.819 
that motto
I<00:03:31.390> think<00:03:31.720> that's<00:03:31.870> gonna<00:03:32.049> all<00:03:32.260> have<00:03:32.440> to<00:03:32.590> change

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
I think that's gonna all have to change

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.789 
I think that's gonna all have to change
a<00:03:33.010> little<00:03:33.220> bit<00:03:33.780> now<00:03:34.780> that<00:03:34.810> he's<00:03:35.170> coming<00:03:35.590> and

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
a little bit now that he's coming and

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.009 
a little bit now that he's coming and
it's<00:03:35.950> a<00:03:36.150> little<00:03:37.150> nerve-racking

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
it's a little nerve-racking

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.870 
it's a little nerve-racking
so<00:03:38.200> we<00:03:38.650> won't<00:03:38.829> be<00:03:38.950> able<00:03:39.040> to<00:03:39.160> work<00:03:39.340> as<00:03:39.639> many

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
so we won't be able to work as many

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.970 
so we won't be able to work as many
projects<00:03:40.630> we'll<00:03:40.959> have<00:03:41.049> to<00:03:41.200> focus<00:03:41.380> on<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.799> ones

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
projects we'll have to focus on the ones

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.949 
projects we'll have to focus on the ones
that<00:03:42.130> are<00:03:42.220> really<00:03:42.400> important<00:03:43.000> and<00:03:43.209> for<00:03:43.930> a

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
that are really important and for a

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.559 
that are really important and for a
little<00:03:44.109> while<00:03:44.410> I<00:03:44.829> don't<00:03:45.819> know<00:03:46.000> I<00:03:46.030> feel<00:03:46.299> like<00:03:46.480> I

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
little while I don't know I feel like I

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.360 
little while I don't know I feel like I
might<00:03:46.720> want<00:03:46.900> to<00:03:46.989> take<00:03:47.139> a<00:03:47.170> back<00:03:47.410> seat<00:03:47.709> we're
