00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.350
 Hi, people made it hard and today I came. 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.350
 here answered epic its boteco 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.830
 I was asked to respond if asked 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.529
 by canal lescott work let 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.510
 perhaps in my questions until it is 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.789
 a little bit to study English in the 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.350
 wall are the same, but maybe it's a 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.210
 little different than it is because tradition 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.580
 I had already answered this tag from my 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.960
 microsoft word pocket for power 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.449
 record that I did not have work yet 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.940
 so it was a boost when the incentive 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.880
 English indicated to answer very foolish law 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.829
 about Welsh unity me then I resolved 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.840
 record and I got my own file 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.090
 which he had already done and 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.160
 but even the league made some 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.020
 neighboring small modifications that seen 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.000
 for example by changing the word plate 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.480
 coffee as we had coffee and tea 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.250
 but there's even exactly the same let's go and 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.469
 more interesting questions but I left 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.180
 so I also wanted to record a lot 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.399
 ecotec version that we always choose 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.020
 the same things then look at the 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.510
 first as it's pretty cool 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.700
 if you could invite an author and a 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.100
 from their traditional characters to 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.650
 have tea or coffee in English bed 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.049
 that you would invite the person you 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.000
 would be for them good easy movie starts 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.000
 because if I could and had the power 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.460
 to invite the author can have tea or 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.100
 coffee would be the amazing adventure christi the 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.720
 Your character here, I think it would be 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.299
 one of my happiest moments 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.650
 life and I always seemed in the 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.390
 list are toys died of starvation 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.820
 because she describes the races then 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.970
 they like very much tea consumed by 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.430
 typical English food if a cookie is 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.130
 some cookies so I would see with 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.170
 the types here like tapioca roll cake 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.850
 because I think I have to 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.979
 possibility would be the type of 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.110
 person who would like these things until 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.970
 because she is an adventurous woman she 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.439
 traveled to several different countries 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.780
 so I think he'd like to prove 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.280
 the typical foods of these countries do not 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.689
 that same old thing then 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.280
 surely that would be what your 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.259
 experience the happiest moments of 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.040
 My life will only happen in two 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.950
 sessions 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.810
 several reasons to the second which book you 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.069
 I wish the author of the sun published 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.140
 that is 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.609
 I was told that you do not know the story before 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.739
 of the story that has returned has already 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:16.349
 The moment I like is the same as the 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.670
 English I answered harry potter I think 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.980
 It would be wonderful if up to the 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.620
 they did for coding poor counting 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.409
 so the time before the goal of death is 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.150
 to become an evil wizard even today 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.489
 in this story is the mother of the size for 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.290
 harry just a little before and would be 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.689
 sensational to see how you can 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.459
 how has this normal group been 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:37.139
 emerging gradually is making a 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.510
 script for the movie is from the blog more 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:41.700
 fantastic and a 21st day is proof that 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.530
 Lula is writing but I went back to the 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.930
 movie will be wonderful yes but I think 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.790
 It's a very new book. 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.500
 I think she should write why not 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.719
 apply something new that harry 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.639
 potter would be great if she solved it. 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:55.439
 play enough to make an audience 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.209
 remember and I think the national world 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:03:00.419
 People think the state is good there. 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.730
 same but complicated the next is which 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:05.669
 two characters that are not the same 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.709
 book you think would make a good couple is 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:10.049
 very difficult to try to put the 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.079
 characters from different books but 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.780
 I just got taken to rain right off the river 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.909
 already golden trilogy of moral damages 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.340
 I think it's a great image of the day. 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.620
 traumatized by everything that happened and the 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.109
 Jorge Weasley and yes one of the brothers live 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.169
 because he also went through trauma and 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:30.060
 including the story say that I know 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.889
 that you know that the 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.470
 people number harry potter then you 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:36.239
 nothing much i think he is very 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.370
 I think it's funny that even if it 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.709
 has gone through this trauma that MPB 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.810
 he has then he 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.579
 would help to act as a reference to the 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.049
 to develop their cars are 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.540
 Happy together 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.370
 It's a car I know, but it 's difficult. 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.030
 that bc then I will answer that I 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.729
 I thought 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.370
 the next one is if you run up to your 

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:58.979
 favorite bull on the subway and could only 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.099
 say a sentence to who would be what 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:03.780
 You'd say it's easy, because I 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:06.509
 I chose a living author not to choose 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.669
 No one dead who would be 

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:11.050
 challenge then who gave it, who knows 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:13.210
 day I can walk behind barcelona 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.590
 last year he lives there too 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.230
 find it would be wonderful 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.720
 while I could only say one case 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.090
 I have that I would run out of words and 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.510
 materials that take off and that would only 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.880
 Thank you so well, hold on. 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.100
 many things that he himself would perceive 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.930
 that a prospective person gave me a 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.570
 hug of an autograph but like the code 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:38.260
 with sentence then without a word thank you 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:41.500
 is consumption which has been read responsible 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.030
 for making it a reader that's good I'll 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.500
 say the first book I remember 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.360
 have read my life I think I 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.280
 should be about four years old 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.200
 bug that grow people that 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.300
 apple bite I think he had it all 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.500
 a series of book reviews and was the 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.240
 first team I remember reading 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.130
 in my life then it will be the animal that 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.750
 grow up with what I think was there 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.550
 which was the reading plant was 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.290
 inserted and was with him that the first 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.740
 The day I read in my life I have 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.540
 sure then it's 6 next is fire 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.070
 Are you just catching fire? 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.230
 one of the worst nightmares of my life 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.060
 sure show us the book that 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.740
 Would you talk how to ask to show? 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.000
 I got up to get the book since 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.950
 I had not fallen but I think if I 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.410
 I could save the book, yes, people. 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.630
 buying is buying others but overcoming 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.610
 book and yes a complete collection of the show 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.740
 because I do not see 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.690
 also with several senses 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.060
 has its emotional value for me will do 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.770
 the first books or the first one 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.660
 My boyfriend gave me a gift soon 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.900
 beginning our loves makes many many 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.640
 many years and I love being one of the 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.830
 my favorite books far gone 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.480
 leno show rooms one of the children who have 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.890
 more sentimental value to me in 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.169
 several stories from books can be 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.800
 a way to save multiple books from a 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:50.020
 once only 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.360
 the next in which the dystopic universe 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.669
 should you had to choose by 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.350
 that it is difficult to choose the universe only 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.990
 to drink because we know that the 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.000
 women's clothing and terrible universe 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.680
 to live, but I would choose one 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.510
 universe than the steel campaigns that are 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.700
 a science fiction but she also has 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.710
 much of dystopia is a universe where 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.320
 people like to see there the subject of 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.760
 organized live no more obvious live 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.350
 in large steel claws 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.660
 so it would be hard to clear that I like 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.490
 of the outdoor world but they get more 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.560
 that an improvement because it did not have a 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.330
 terrible accident 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.160
 government in all aspects of the 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.290
 my life I could still choose with 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.340
 that he marry me in the mistake of having my 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.200
 privacy 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.940
 even because privacy is a thing 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.700
 extremely important in this universe 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:35.610
 people value your privacy a lot 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:38.550
 so I think it would be a universe of 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.260
 steel sheet of media worst ids day 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.389
 that I to him to live 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.160
 I think it would be a universe like that. 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:44.580
 his most epic reading of all 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.500
 times 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.060
 I just can not answer a 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.889
 thing decision I think it's the same thing 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.160
 Wondering what your favorite son is? 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:55.139
 does not have as soon as several books 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.669
 favorites in the people I have in both with 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:58.169
 muricy in the club if someone wants to give 

00:06:56.669 --> 00:06:59.880
 a look to know how was the choice 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:03.090
 of the books I put there then 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:05.639
 although the books a book on and by 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:08.790
 Last is a plus you do not have to do 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:10.530
 time and basically you demonstrate your 

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.840
 authored by some book you loved 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.760
 really I think it's something I do I 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:18.180
 I really like a free term 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:21.479
 basically hug him and then happy not to 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:23.850
 have nothing like that, do not play well 

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:26.789
 made it crazy this is because it is very light
