00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530

first<00:05:42.979> most<00:05:43.940> of<00:05:44.120> the<00:05:44.180> time<00:05:45.460> enemies<00:05:46.460> don't

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
first most of the time enemies don't

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:48.340 
first most of the time enemies don't
always<00:05:47.060> look<00:05:47.330> down<00:05:47.390> so<00:05:47.720> they<00:05:48.050> could<00:05:48.229> be

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350 
always look down so they could be

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:49.900 
always look down so they could be
running<00:05:48.650> around<00:05:48.890> and<00:05:49.040> if<00:05:49.160> it's<00:05:49.310> a<00:05:49.400> smoked<00:05:49.700> up

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910
