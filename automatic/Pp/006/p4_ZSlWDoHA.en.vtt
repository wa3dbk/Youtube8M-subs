00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 hello friends of the frame welcome to 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.170
 dvd criticism and space was already 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.790
 often cinematic scenery for very 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.440
 exciting stripes and beginning of october 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.540
 another expects us in this 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.490
 direction in german cinemas and 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.490
 that's about gravity now 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.920
 told 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.270
 the rat with scare them 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:51.610
 you have the home pakistan six 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.820
 There is someone down there 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.509
 thinks when he looks up 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.509
 I had a daughter 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.610
 have michael brown 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.610
 said I will not give up 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.170
 Gravity goes 90 minutes is twelve 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.690
 released years and starts in 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.010
 Germany from the third october 2013 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.500
 in german cinemas and will 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.240
 notably in 3d one of the best 3ds 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.220
 shown for a long time in cinemas 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.980
 tells the story of doctor rows 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.200
 stone biomedicine played by sandra 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.730
 bullock the first space use 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.560
 but has the basic program for it 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.510
 Of course , the most important graduated 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.830
 entry and exit scenarios in space 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.720
 but dominates because she just one 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.580
 Newcomer has one in her side 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.230
 quite experienced man named medco as 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.120
 played here by george clooney 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.160
 but as it is during a routine use 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.450
 outside her space capsule to one 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.250
 Incident with a lot of small ones 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.410
 satellites particles through the room 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.090
 flying comes and so coalition with her 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.890
 Space station ends the whole in one 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.850
 disaster and these two are found 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.010
 in the middle of nowhere 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.690
 exactly in the middle of the universe again 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.490
 and somehow have to save themselves 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.680
 they hardly threaten contact with the earth 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.690
 also losing each other and that 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.520
 Whole while the oxygen is scarce 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.170
 Basically, this is a scenario of 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.150
 typical lost on the open sea 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.830
 rather just lost in the middle of it 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.390
 nowhere will I come back 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.120
 home so the constant fear 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.860
 to be lost and somehow her 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.600
 to save lives and that is that 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.010
 Scenario what you in the core namely in it 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.690
 is and not necessarily so 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.340
 Surprisingly the films of this kind are there 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.420
 that's why you have to do it a lot 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.370
 say that gravity what the 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.050
 History, frankly 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.400
 which is rather disappointing on the 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.020
 I'm insane 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.150
 Happy and the trailer was right 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.800
 great class but in the core is the 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.810
 history a little bit long-winded 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.550
 almost a little boring and before 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.050
 There is a whole lot of sandra 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.370
 bullock coach much too little george 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.810
 clooney for my taste and sandra 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.640
 Bullock tries in many scenes 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.200
 somehow has to play for the oscar 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.480
 the feeling so there is whole text the 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.730
 34 minutes are not cut but 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.170
 correctly noted as too much play 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.970
 is at many moments and at sandra 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.320
 bullock the spirits whether they are divorced 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.370
 can play now or not and 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.530
 That's why I have to say that first 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.120
 in core gravity has the biggest problems 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.800
 and that is not the rating for me 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.180
 I would have liked to dust off 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.980
 I'm crazy about that 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.900
 but where are the big trumps 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.280
 the film is the whole 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.710
 technical side of the film has one 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.510
 really great strong soundtrack and he 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.550
 is especially good with a brute 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.680
 3d equipped and had something technical 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.330
 Make up 80 million dollars in budget 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.740
 the feeling could even be 200 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.080
 cost millions because everything works here 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.820
 so fine and realistic animated so that 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.680
 the cinema trip almost something for everyone 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.900
 large space fans, we are all the 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.460
 Grass made action like that 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.660
 correct and exciting is the film too 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.030
 every time you look at it again and again 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.770
 Okay, what are you doing now? 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.030
 looks just damn realistic but 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.650
 as I said just these two 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.720
 There are medal pages on one page 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.060
 great to look at on the other side 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.440
 in the core , the strip touches one 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.650
 not really in that he gets from 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.810
 me as a torture or drama only 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.370
 six and a half out of ten possible points 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.140
 Overall, however , I'm headed by one 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.610
 to give better evaluation because just this 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.990
 technical appreciation then for many 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.310
 but should make a year already 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.080
 for that reason altogether 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.570
 worth seeing only unfortunately behind mine 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.130
 expectations remain overall 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.510
 seven and a half out of 10 possible points 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.710
 I hope you can understand what I am 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.080
 mine and that was it too now 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.340
 I like to do my review on gravity 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.450
 thumb this one let it stay 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.070
 i will have it last may 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.390
 cinema reviews over or on twitter and 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.950
 facebook and subscribe to these two 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.750
 channels from me if you do not have any videos from 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.220
 want me to miss that is 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.990
 Let's stay that only decides you 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.270
 tomorrow at 15 o'clock there is here at the latest 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.590
 a new video and until then I hope 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:49.020
 here again since tomorrow 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.020
 of course at 3
