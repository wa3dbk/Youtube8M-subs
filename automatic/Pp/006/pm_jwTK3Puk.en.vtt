no<00:00:06.620> middle-market<00:00:07.190> shall<00:00:07.730> find<00:00:08.000> the<00:00:08.149> ends

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.530 

two<00:00:12.320> armed<00:00:12.560> spans<00:00:13.010> are<00:00:13.250> broke<00:00:13.490> but<00:00:13.880> coiling<00:00:14.390> up

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
two armed spans are broke but coiling up

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.170 
two armed spans are broke but coiling up
later<00:00:15.070> and<00:00:16.070> then<00:00:16.490> what<00:00:16.940> if<00:00:17.119> like<00:00:17.300> a<00:00:19.180> sponge

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
later and then what if like a sponge

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:51.110 
later and then what if like a sponge
either<00:00:21.020> side

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.139 

a<00:00:51.320> little<00:00:52.320> bit<00:00:52.469> extra<00:00:52.500> there<00:00:53.129> without<00:00:53.430> loop<00:00:53.879> so

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
a little bit extra there without loop so

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.959 
a little bit extra there without loop so
again<00:00:54.739> back<00:00:55.739> up<00:00:56.989> short<00:00:57.989> loop<00:00:58.760> there's<00:00:59.760> just

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
again back up short loop there's just

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.700 
again back up short loop there's just
enough<00:01:00.239> there<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.660> everything<00:01:00.930> can<00:01:01.230> be<00:01:01.290> tied

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
enough there so everything can be tied

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.880 
enough there so everything can be tied
in<00:01:02.269> when<00:01:03.269> you<00:01:03.390> do<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.660> quick<00:01:03.839> pitch<00:01:04.049> do<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
in when you do the quick pitch do the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.389 
in when you do the quick pitch do the
flip<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.600> get<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.840> double<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.890> end<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.310> the

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
flip it get the double the end of the

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:17.330 
flip it get the double the end of the
rope<00:01:09.200> round<00:01:10.200> three<00:01:10.979> or<00:01:11.220> four<00:01:11.520> times<00:01:16.070> and<00:01:17.070> then

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
rope round three or four times and then

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:25.370 
rope round three or four times and then
most<00:01:17.909> effectively<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:19.729> loop<00:01:21.470> through

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.899 

like<00:01:25.980> so<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:27.530> instead<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.710> threading<00:01:29.550> the<00:01:29.760> end

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
like so and instead of threading the end

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.180 
like so and instead of threading the end
of<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.120> Rope<00:01:30.300> through<00:01:30.600> it's<00:01:31.560> always<00:01:31.890> most

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
of the Rope through it's always most

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.430 
of the Rope through it's always most
effective<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.720> noose<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.800> head<00:01:35.010> of<00:01:35.160> the<00:01:35.220> coils

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
effective to noose the head of the coils

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.980 
effective to noose the head of the coils
all<00:01:37.440> that<00:01:37.650> time<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.310> don't<00:01:39.210> never<00:01:39.510> had<00:01:39.690> one<00:01:39.869> of

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
all that time I don't never had one of

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.590 
all that time I don't never had one of
those<00:01:40.080> jump<00:01:40.500> out<00:01:40.770> on<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.280> 20<00:01:41.910> or<00:01:42.000> 30<00:01:42.090> years

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
those jump out on the in 20 or 30 years

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.440 
those jump out on the in 20 or 30 years
of<00:01:42.690> doing<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.369> good<00:01:44.369> good<00:01:44.729> method<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.210> coil

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
of doing it so good good method of coil

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.380 
of doing it so good good method of coil
at<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.720> rope<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:47.430> short<00:01:47.759> tails<00:01:48.060> there

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
at the rope and the short tails there

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.140 
at the rope and the short tails there
like<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:50.430> can<00:01:50.580> just<00:01:50.759> go<00:01:50.850> straight

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
like that you that can just go straight

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.359 
like that you that can just go straight
on<00:01:51.330> top<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.690> rucksacks<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.800> finished<00:01:53.190> for

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
on top you rucksacks you finished for

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.520 
on top you rucksacks you finished for
the<00:01:53.490> day
