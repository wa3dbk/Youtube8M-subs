it's using up my rx-8 just for fun I
haven't<00:00:57.989> used<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.230> thing<00:00:58.440> Royal

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.280 

multiplayer<00:01:01.859> okay<00:01:02.820> yes<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.170> was

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
multiplayer okay yes it's that was

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.730 
multiplayer okay yes it's that was
working<00:01:04.619> multiplayer<00:01:05.900> what<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:06.990> does<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.560> it

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
working multiplayer what it does is it

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.160 
working multiplayer what it does is it
kind<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.220> slows<00:01:08.640> down<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.970> time<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:10.020> might

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
kind of it slows down the time it might

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.929 
kind of it slows down the time it might
not<00:01:10.380> make<00:01:10.500> sense<00:01:10.770> but<00:01:11.100> you'll<00:01:11.310> see<00:01:13.820> see<00:01:14.820> if

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
not make sense but you'll see see if

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.280 
not make sense but you'll see see if
anyone<00:01:15.360> will<00:01:15.420> actually<00:01:15.720> want<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.960> race<00:01:16.909> busy

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
anyone will actually want to race busy

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:26.550 
anyone will actually want to race busy
here's<00:01:19.290> an<00:01:19.409> artsy

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.459 

okay<00:01:27.799> so<00:01:28.340> right<00:01:28.490> now<00:01:31.570> watch<00:01:32.570> you'll<00:01:32.899> see<00:01:32.960> it

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
okay so right now watch you'll see it

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:46.050 
okay so right now watch you'll see it
slows<00:01:33.799> down<00:01:33.829> the<00:01:34.039> the<00:01:34.939> time

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.110 

and<00:01:46.660> I<00:01:46.780> lost<00:01:47.050> anyway<00:01:47.730> because<00:01:48.730> I<00:01:48.760> didn't<00:01:49.000> get<00:01:49.060> a

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
and I lost anyway because I didn't get a

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.940 
and I lost anyway because I didn't get a
perfect<00:01:49.540> launch<00:01:49.750> oh<00:01:51.570> well<00:01:52.570> but<00:01:53.200> um<00:01:53.410> the

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
perfect launch oh well but um the

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.030 
perfect launch oh well but um the
purpose<00:01:54.190> of<00:01:54.370> the<00:01:54.460> heck<00:01:54.610> is<00:01:54.820> to<00:01:54.970> like<00:01:55.150> slow<00:01:55.600> down

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
purpose of the heck is to like slow down

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.550 
purpose of the heck is to like slow down
the<00:01:57.040> the<00:01:57.970> lights<00:01:58.240> so<00:01:58.690> that<00:01:58.840> way<00:01:58.990> you<00:01:59.050> it's

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
the the lights so that way you it's

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.630 
the the lights so that way you it's
easier<00:02:00.250> to<00:02:00.400> time<00:02:00.610> it<00:02:01.800> but<00:02:02.800> yeah<00:02:03.340> I<00:02:03.400> haven't

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
easier to time it but yeah I haven't

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.090 
easier to time it but yeah I haven't
seen<00:02:03.820> any<00:02:04.060> videos<00:02:04.450> on<00:02:04.600> this<00:02:04.810> so<00:02:05.170> I<00:02:05.200> thought<00:02:05.560> why

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
seen any videos on this so I thought why

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.400 
seen any videos on this so I thought why
not<00:02:06.130> make<00:02:06.340> one<00:02:08.399> all<00:02:09.399> right<00:02:09.520> I'll<00:02:09.789> do<00:02:10.000> one<00:02:10.030> more

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
not make one all right I'll do one more

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.990 
not make one all right I'll do one more
I'll<00:02:11.410> probably<00:02:11.650> lose<00:02:11.950> again<00:02:12.280> but<00:02:12.610> it's<00:02:12.790> not

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
I'll probably lose again but it's not

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.960 
I'll probably lose again but it's not
the<00:02:13.750> gameplay<00:02:14.170> as<00:02:14.860> matters<00:02:15.250> its<00:02:15.430> I<00:02:15.670> want<00:02:15.910> to

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
really for like an rx-8 but more like

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.260 
really for like an rx-8 but more like
the<00:02:58.690> harder<00:02:59.020> cars<00:02:59.520> better<00:03:00.520> heart<00:03:00.820> at<00:03:00.970> a<00:03:01.060> time

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
the harder cars better heart at a time

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:13.560 
the harder cars better heart at a time
so<00:03:01.570> slow<00:03:01.870> it<00:03:01.990> goes<00:03:09.030> yeah<00:03:10.030> whatever<00:03:10.420> but<00:03:12.570> I'm

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
so slow it goes yeah whatever but I'm

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.440 
so slow it goes yeah whatever but I'm
not<00:03:13.750> that<00:03:14.140> good<00:03:14.350> at<00:03:14.470> this<00:03:14.590> game<00:03:14.830> anyway<00:03:15.420> but<00:03:16.420> uh
