00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
of these are fairly stiff so if it'll

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.720 
of these are fairly stiff so if it'll
work<00:00:16.470> for<00:00:16.650> these<00:00:16.800> it<00:00:17.100> should<00:00:17.279> work<00:00:17.369> for<00:00:17.550> about

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
work for these it should work for about

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.120 
work for these it should work for about
any<00:00:17.910> Springs<00:00:18.210> you'll<00:00:18.420> use<00:00:18.710> the<00:00:19.710> only<00:00:19.949> tool

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130

Freight<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.250> would<00:00:26.460> imagine<00:00:26.670> fairly<00:00:27.240> similar

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
Freight I would imagine fairly similar

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.689 
Freight I would imagine fairly similar
the<00:00:28.560> main<00:00:28.590> thing<00:00:28.920> that's<00:00:29.099> important<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.609> you

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
the main thing that's important is you

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.519 
the main thing that's important is you
want<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.880> have<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.060> end<00:00:30.210> curved<00:00:30.510> kind<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.410> like

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
want to have the end curved kind of like

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.750 
want to have the end curved kind of like
you<00:00:31.619> see<00:00:31.830> here<00:00:33.829> so<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.950> remove<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.309> spring<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.730> put

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
you see here so to remove a spring I put

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.330 
you see here so to remove a spring I put
the<00:00:36.000> pick<00:00:36.149> under<00:00:36.450> right<00:00:36.660> here<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.200> then<00:00:38.100> pry

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
the pick under right here and then pry

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.900 
the pick under right here and then pry
it<00:00:38.399> up<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.700> little<00:00:38.879> bit<00:00:39.620> then<00:00:40.620> take<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.550> nose<00:00:41.730> of

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
it up a little bit then take the nose of

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.090 
it up a little bit then take the nose of
the<00:00:41.969> pick<00:00:42.200> work<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.350> under<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.649> spring<00:00:43.950> and

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
the pick work it under the spring and

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.850 
the pick work it under the spring and
move<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.399> forward<00:00:44.610> like<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.480> see<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.050> kind<00:00:46.770> of

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
move it forward like you see and kind of

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.709 
move it forward like you see and kind of
pry<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.430> way<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> little<00:00:47.879> bit<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.450> spring

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
pry this way a little bit the spring

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.959 
pry this way a little bit the spring
will<00:00:48.840> start<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.110> work<00:00:49.260> its<00:00:49.410> way<00:00:49.559> off<00:00:49.820> then<00:00:50.820> you

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
will start to work its way off then you

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.029 
will start to work its way off then you
bridge<00:00:51.180> this<00:00:51.390> little<00:00:51.660> gap<00:00:51.809> here<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.829> picks

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
bridge this little gap here so the picks

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.410 
bridge this little gap here so the picks
all<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.309> way<00:00:53.399> across<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.000> other<00:00:54.180> side<00:00:54.360> of

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
all the way across on the other side of

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.139 
all the way across on the other side of
the<00:00:54.510> clutch<00:00:54.719> pry<00:00:55.620> up<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.820> can<00:00:56.940> see<00:00:57.059> the

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
the clutch pry up and you can see the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.479 
the clutch pry up and you can see the
spring<00:00:57.390> pops<00:00:57.660> off<00:00:57.949> then<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.070> just<00:00:59.250> got<00:00:59.399> to

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
spring pops off then you just got to

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.810 
spring pops off then you just got to
kind<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.699> work<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.969> out<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.359> other<00:01:00.989> side

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
kind of work it out of the other side

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.609 
kind of work it out of the other side
Springs<00:01:02.820> removed<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:04.080> can<00:01:04.140> repeat<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
Springs removed you can repeat the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.859 
Springs removed you can repeat the
process<00:01:04.650> all<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.430> way<00:01:05.460> around<00:01:05.909> it's<00:01:06.630> fairly

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
process all the way around it's fairly

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:21.230 
process all the way around it's fairly
quick<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:19.280> install<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.670> spring<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.060> should

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
quick to install the spring you should

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.670 
quick to install the spring you should
see<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.450> you've<00:01:21.659> got<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.840> short<00:01:22.140> side<00:01:22.380> and

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
see that you've got a short side and

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.039 
see that you've got a short side and
along<00:01:23.130> side<00:01:23.330> you'll<00:01:24.330> want<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.540> take<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.780> short

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
along side you'll want to take the short

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.810 
along side you'll want to take the short
side<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.619> put<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.250> into<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.580> hole<00:01:26.790> here<00:01:28.820> once

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
side and put it into this hole here once

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.999 
side and put it into this hole here once
it's<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> hole<00:01:30.329> just<00:01:30.600> kind<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:31.020> maneuver

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
it's in the hole just kind of maneuver

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.390 
it's in the hole just kind of maneuver
it<00:01:32.100> across<00:01:33.619> so<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.650> it's<00:01:34.890> sitting<00:01:35.040> like<00:01:35.280> you

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
it across so that it's sitting like you

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.929 
it across so that it's sitting like you
see<00:01:35.840> then<00:01:36.840> you'll<00:01:36.990> take<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.200> pick<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.939> slide

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
see then you'll take the pick and slide

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.140 
see then you'll take the pick and slide
it<00:01:39.119> under<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.600> front<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.439> spring<00:01:40.770> and

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
it under the front of the spring and

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:48.139 
it under the front of the spring and
also<00:01:42.619> work<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:43.799> tip<00:01:44.360> into<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.450> hole<00:01:45.630> here<00:01:47.149> so

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
also work this tip into the hole here so

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.910 
also work this tip into the hole here so
once<00:01:48.329> you've<00:01:48.450> done<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.840> kind<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.740> put<00:01:49.890> a

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
once you've done that kind of put a

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.380 
once you've done that kind of put a
little<00:01:49.979> pressure<00:01:50.310> down<00:01:50.610> on<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.850> spring<00:01:51.180> with

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
little pressure down on the spring with

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.520 
little pressure down on the spring with
your<00:01:51.509> thumb<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.790> then<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.939> can<00:01:54.200> sort<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.290> pry

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
your thumb and then you can sort of pry

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.020 
your thumb and then you can sort of pry
up<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.399> spring<00:01:56.670> should<00:01:56.850> pop<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:58.939> so<00:01:59.939> you

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
up and the spring should pop in so you

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.310 
up and the spring should pop in so you
see<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.299> popped<00:02:00.509> in<00:02:00.689> there<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:00.960> then<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.140> just

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
see it popped in there and then you just
