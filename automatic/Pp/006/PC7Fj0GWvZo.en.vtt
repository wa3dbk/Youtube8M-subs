 building system case ths developed 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.740
 for the rapid construction of residential and 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.840
 public buildings by the method of monolithic 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.459
 construction made formwork 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:14.689
 as an external formwork element 

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:16.599
 used stove done with 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.630
 glued on cement mortar and 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.429
 efficient insulation foam m 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.039
 field styrene insulation layer remains 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.380
 one 3 constructions between the outer plate 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.189
 formwork and concrete layer thickness textbooks 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:29.489
 realities k varies from 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:30.939
 depending on regulatory 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:32.559
 requirements for heating engineer 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.550
 hollow Karabakh overlap 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.320
 used as a non-removable 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.300
 formwork for ceiling installation 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.320
 maximum span without 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.130
 additional supports up to 14 meters 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.050
 But consider the main 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.830
 principles and sequences 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.060
 building 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.300
 we prepared the foundations applied 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.410
 layout of the building plan installation of wall forms 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.250
 always starts from one of the corners 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.130
 buildings and is made of at 35 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.340
 millimeters insulation in the corner 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.760
 joints and slopes should be cut 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.580
 the thickness of the second plate or slope slat on 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.860
 external timbering 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.280
 one-sided screeds are installed 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.430
 and so that distance from the corner 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.820
 buildings and the first rush will be 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.620
 wall thickness plus 50 millimeters and 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.560
 next with an interval of 20 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.220
 centimeters apart 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.110
 and in the corners can not use plates 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.810
 shorter than one meter 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.850
 then the plate turns over and 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.829
 placed exactly on the markup line with 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.369
 considering the reinforcement of the walls of the building which 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:31.720
 set by project 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.900
 on the free end of the inner plate 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.860
 which are the result of her 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.090
 offset relative to the outer plate 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.630
 set missing 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.200
 single-sided screed and internal plate 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.750
 mounted in a hurry outer plates 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.900
 plates are explored by setting so 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.730
 to old people of internal and external 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.980
 plates mutual did not match 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.710
 and external and internal plates 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.370
 formwork on top connect 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.790
 double-sided ties similar 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:58.990
 like the bottom of the police 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.270
 to that aligned at that angle set 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.229
 inner slab st with unilateral 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.710
 ties up the vertical angle 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.250
 in terms of period weight and internal plates and 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.679
 interconnected stared in three 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.689
 places meant 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:14.569
 after being exposed and 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.150
 fixed and internal plates 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.510
 outdoor plate is installed 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.960
 further installation of plates is carried out 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.859
 around the perimeter of the building 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:24.839
 simultaneously with the installation of the first row 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:27.129
 external wall plates are being mounted 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.039
 reverend coach bearing walls

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:34.149
 internal walls with one integer and one 

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:35.310
 half plate 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.730
 to provide a ligation before 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.480
 docking points and wall slabs 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.860
 connected by nails after mounting the first 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.010
 a number at this place shed afp and doors 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.790
 slope plates are installed which 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.849
 exhibited between the formwork plates 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:51.390
 Attention 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.510
 ordinary formwork boards are needed 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.770
 nail together to 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.980
 prevent their divergence during 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.800
 concreting and education and 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.539
 vertical and gaps 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:04.029
 the concrete is filled with the first battle from the formwork 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:06.669
 throughout the building concrete is poured to a height 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:08.219
 up to four millimeters and 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:09.569
 compacted 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.059
 when laying the second of the following rows 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:14.059
 vertical stands of brto formwork and 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:16.099
 should be shifted relative to each other 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.119
 a friend at least twenty 

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:19.569
 five centimeters 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.980
 in the corners it is necessary to provide a dressing 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.239
 assume a

 before concreting into the window opening 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.169
 need to put a spacer attention in 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:30.060
 slope slab window opening 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.989
 installed on three sides and 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.760
 fastened with nails slabs formwork

 parapet level connect 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.469
 one-sided ties and opening 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:41.259
 remains open for concreting 

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:44.189
 followed by the installation of floors together with 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:45.909
 Pikovsky exterior walls and floors 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:47.629

 are installed from up to the bench which 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.510
 connects to the internal plates 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.900
 walls are two nets 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.260
 boards are stacked on the catchy ones in

 overlapping stacking board price drop 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.989
 metro in the dock with 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.070
 their internal plates are necessary 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.169
 fasten the two main seats and 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.289
 Auxiliary fittings are put in 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.970
 according to the project reinforcement

 filled with concrete 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.910
 after technological 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.039
 break, you can continue installation

 to wish 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.219
 no restrictions on the architecture themselves 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:58.669
 came up with a house they built it themselves 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:00.409
 subject to the elementary 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:02.150
 neatly built box 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.259
