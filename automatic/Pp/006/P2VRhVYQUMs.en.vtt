00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.200
 welcome back are emma and knit 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.340
 and the activity that excites me the most 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.170
 relaxes 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.779
 for this reason I would like to share with 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.590
 you tricks and techniques to achieve al 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.640
 better 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.830
 shawls scarves shawl collars today in 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.440
 this episode I would like you to see how 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.180
 carry out without making the auxiliary one 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.270
 braid on two meshes that goes towards 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.430
 right so we have to work first 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.070
 the second jersey on the front of the work 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.930
 our arrows on two meshes I love them 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.400
 so much because they allow us to decorate 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.530
 for example this is a neck 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.870
 then combining it with other points then 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.269
 here we have a fretwork but 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.940
 our braid combined then with the 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.680
 inverted stockinette stitch allows us to 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.190
 decorating what can be a neck 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.170
 a shawl and a scarf without affirming 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.000
 auxiliary we can work a lot 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.769
 faster because we do n't have a 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.840
 ferretto that we must all times 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.729
 use to position the shirt 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.220
 left pending 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.100
 in this sample I wanted to make you 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.079
 also see how the knit braid 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.969
 on two meshes it can be combined with 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:20.000
 stockinette stitch to create this effect 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:23.090
 as if it were a border and then I have 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.719
 worked a ribbed pattern of two meshes 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.180
 2 meshes with the reverse stockinette stitch 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:32.840
 so I have to start with my firsts 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.030
 four jerseys to straight and then we have the 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.359
 our first braid is what it creates 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.359
 this beaded effect with the sweater 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:43.729
 then shaved to work 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:44.509
 first the second jersey on the front of the 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.579
 work 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.609
 I have to move my thread over the 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.829
 iron this allows us to achieve it 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:56.149
 more with rains wanting more easily 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:58.729
 so let's take the second one we work on 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:02.109
 on straight and when we're here 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:05.119
 we move our thread back behind 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:09.500
 and we work the first jersey that here 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:11.900
 behind hidden to normal straight only a 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.760
 this point we slide the 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.560
 two meshes of the tip of the iron of 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.150
 left because otherwise we risk that 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.790
 a mail run away and then we have to 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.930
 go and recover it and here we are 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.060
 realized the year 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.739
 the first track going to the right 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.980
 see the shirts go to the right 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.620
 without auxiliary iron we carry out 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.799
 another one combined with the stockinette stitch 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.099
 upside down then first move the 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:40.040
 Our trust work 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:44.930
 the second shirt we move the shirt 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:49.219
 behind and we work what was the 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.439
 our first mafia and let them fall 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:53.989
 now I continue with my project in 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:57.879
 waiting for the next episode touched 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.879
 it does good work
