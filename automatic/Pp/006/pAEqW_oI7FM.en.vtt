00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.590
 the national highway number 21 is a 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:09.940
 infrastructure located in the part 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.490
 north of guelma wilaya 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.380
 it is a very important axis on 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.990
 economic and social plans 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.609
 the purpose of splitting this route 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.779
 national level and increase its effectiveness 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.779
 and his safety 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.900

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.190
 the interchange is planned near 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.780
 each metropolitan met a 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.640
 first exchanger is planned at the beginning of 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.890
 project then we will wait for the wadi 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:46.750
 sebou this meaning crossing will be through 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:48.970
 a viaduct of length of 220 m then we 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:53.040
 neighboring the agglomeration of heliopolis 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.040
 or a second exchanger is planned 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.350
 good 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.180
 com 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.640
 a little further we will find the 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.830
 third exchanger at the level of gnaque 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.740
 sweet not just after we will wait a 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.270
 1200 meter long tunnel that 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.090
 crosses a mountain peak between 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.980
 cugnaux luz not in spain finally at the level 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.760
 of the latter a fourth exchanger 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:30.070
 is foreseen facing a possibility of 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.990
 Construction of the project trans years 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.900
 been divided into three lots in accordance with 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.050
 the terms of reference lot number 0 1 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.570
 beginning of the project that act bousbaa lot 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.650

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.690
 their number 039 billion end of project 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.400
 indeed consider them the realization of 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.960
 two pavements an improvement of 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.480
 trace parameters for a speed of 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.320
 base of 110 km per hour 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.840
 bypassing agglomerations 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.730
 urban areas and corresponding heat exchangers 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.260
 an extra way for the weights 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.380
 heavy in sections with strong 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.380

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.570
 I 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.020
 at the beginning of the project not finding a 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.180
 link exchanger with also 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.220
 the exchanger is built on three 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.310
 levels the first level is dedicated to 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.300
 crossing the 20 rn with both 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.250
 straps of the highway 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.690
 the second level is dedicated to 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.200
 crossing of the two straps of 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.780
 Highway 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.330
 finally the third is dedicated to flows 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.730
 coming from constantine varin foremost 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.470
 the name of this section namely the lot 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.090
 number 01 of the route totally 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.090
 independent of the current road 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.500
 there we are in nyon law of seissan 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.780
 crossing will be through a viaduct 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.900
 along 220 m it is two points 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.050
 juxtaposed each supporting a sense of 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.050
 traffic 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.970

 font and very type configuration 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.180
 exchanger number 0 2 is designed in the 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.740
 purpose of ensuring exchanges with inna

 of type not daring the design of this 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.860
 exchanger is intended to ensure the 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.199
 exchanges with bullet agglomeration 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.389
 not push this exchanger is composed of 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:07.210
 four straps unidirectional a 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:10.360
 roundabout at the plane with which 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:14.979
 we manage the flows of the existing route of the 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:17.130
 rn21 along the lot 0.2 namely that the 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.449
 sweet ban dogs both roadways 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:23.580
 course parallel to the road 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:23.580
 current with improved traffic 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.140
 there we come another way in the most 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.950
 complex from the gold point of view to the graph 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:44.870
 and geological so as to keep the 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.900
 level of service this route offers 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:52.750
 crossing the mountain peak will be done 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.750
 using a 2000 tunnel of 105 m 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.460
 near snow mayer an interchange 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.860
 2013 type configuration is ready 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.410
 the latter is designed to ensure the 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.539
 exchanges with the agglomeration its 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.220
 straps probably unidirectional 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:36.650
 and the connection of their ends 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.289
 with the secondary road is done to 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.000
 using crossroads in plan along 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:43.940
 this last section is the lot 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.210
 number 03 the route am aminer friend 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.320
 independent of the existing road 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:50.800
 until he reaches the highway 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.800
 is West
