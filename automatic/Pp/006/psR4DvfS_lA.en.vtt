me tell you the downsides to this habit

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.830 
me tell you the downsides to this habit
first<00:00:57.600> off<00:00:57.930> we're<00:00:58.920> all<00:00:58.949> too<00:00:59.340> toxic<00:00:59.690> so<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.719> never

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
first off we're all too toxic so I never

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.680 
first off we're all too toxic so I never
recommend<00:01:01.649> drinking<00:01:02.280> tap<00:01:02.579> water<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.329> that's

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
recommend drinking tap water and that's

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.280 
recommend drinking tap water and that's
what<00:01:03.989> most<00:01:04.559> restaurants<00:01:05.159> serve<00:01:06.229> now<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
what most restaurants serve now the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.910 
what most restaurants serve now the
other<00:01:07.700> issue<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.689> don't<00:01:09.930> want<00:01:10.140> freezing

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
other issue is you don't want freezing

that's<00:01:12.360> ice<00:01:12.630> water<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.200> paralyzes<00:01:13.920> your

that's ice water it paralyzes your

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.020 
that's ice water it paralyzes your
stomach<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:15.090> some<00:01:15.330> extent<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.560> ice<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> no-no

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
stomach to some extent so ice is a no-no

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.630 
stomach to some extent so ice is a no-no
if<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.689> want<00:01:19.020> your<00:01:19.380> stomach<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.070> function

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640

properly
now<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.320> also<00:01:22.619> recommend<00:01:23.630> minimizing<00:01:24.630> your
