00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.310
 good to all I'm guillermo but bad and 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.980
 can you follow me on twitter as at 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.110
 colomar that we are going to start with this 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.409
 video in which we will see five things 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.490
 why they buy the xperia n 2 we go 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:19.529
 there you can follow the group that is already 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.109
 on twitter as at a trip to bar 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.060
 low or on facebook as well we're going to 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.089
 start by saying that connectivity 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.249
 of the device is really good and 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:32.970
 It weighs in its price is very well we can 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:35.340
 find us glonass 4g or even the 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.320
 own nfc 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.650
 another reason why 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.480
 buy the xperia m2 is your camera because 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.640
 it's pretty good at enough 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.739
 situations because I have 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.260
 tried and of course it goes pretty well 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.150
 compared to other smartphones from 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.220
 the same range the average range 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.990
 sonny software is quite 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.870
 good although it is not updated to the 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.250
 latest version android 4.4 software 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.680
 Sound can compete perfectly 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.420
 with our expectations due to the 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.020
 fluency that we can find to the 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.470
 time to see the operating system a bit 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.930
 tell you that it is android 4.3 and that it has 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.910
 the sun customization layer that is 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.960
 something that is very good and that work 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.330
 perfectly 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.520
 you have to keep in mind that for the 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.440
 price that you have is really fantastic 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.600
 the sound that this 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.060
 device and in fact you can see that 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.510
 sound in the review I'll let you down on 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.510
 the description 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.899
 how to say it the customization layer 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.270
 it would be pretty customizable good this 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.189
 last point that I am going to comment to the 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.590
 time to buy on this device is 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.420
 because they are customizable in the 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.360
 settings section we see a 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.579
 customization section here we can 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.079
 change the wallpaper the background of 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.659
 screen lock 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.729
 and we can make quick adjustments and 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.840
 even change the topics this is something 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.580
 that I personally liked 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.679
 a lot since it's going to change a bit the 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.720
 color of the system but you can also 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:09.640
 listen to the more button to go to the 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.560
 store that has sony to be called 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.200
 sony select even though it redirects you to 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.480
 Projector is a separate and good store 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.700
 we can go down seeing some 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.980
 of the issues that this can bring us 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.380
 system ok now I have much better 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.150
 wifi and it's going to work as you see 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.580
 let's go down from the movie of 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.430
 ego that is a mess and good we are going to 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.890
 go to the play store and let's go down 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.269
 to download us as you see is free not 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.430
 I know if they are all free but the 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:40.000
 most yes and well let's go down 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.370
 we wait a moment and here we have it 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.040
 is already installed let's go back to what 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.560
 that would be adjustments let's take off by 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.900
 here and let's go to personalization to 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.370
 the topics and as you see here in the part 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.560
 from above we will be installed delegated 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.120
 very well we are going to change it and as you see 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.889
 we will change the color of the accent 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.099
 wallpaper and screen 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:02.769
 what we are going to apply it as you see 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.170
 they have put of the ego absolutely everything is 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.599
 a wonder is this topic because 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.120
 everything is going to be done as if it were the ego 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.859
 and the truth is that this pretty cool 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.799
 even the buttons of the part 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:16.269
 below and this is going to be a new being of 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.010
 It's true that this was done a lot 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:21.159
 system that has not done process and what 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.980
 will have done officially or not but of 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.239
 truth that Uruguay is the subject and how 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.629
 You see, we are going to change the background of 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.579
 lock screen and the other and good 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:32.349
