00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
gonna stay in the nap mode for a while

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.570 
gonna stay in the nap mode for a while
so<00:01:16.049> we're<00:01:16.140> on<00:01:16.229> our<00:01:16.320> way<00:01:16.380> over<00:01:16.590> direct<00:01:17.009> huh<00:01:17.310> sock

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
so we're on our way over direct huh sock

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.640 
so we're on our way over direct huh sock
you<00:01:18.270> can<00:01:18.420> see<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.720> charts<00:01:19.020> been<00:01:19.229> loaded<00:01:19.560> you

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
you can see the charts been loaded you

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.770 
you can see the charts been loaded you
see<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.920> black<00:01:20.159> rectangular<00:01:20.939> line<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.540> there

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
see the black rectangular line on there

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.200 
see the black rectangular line on there
that's<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.920> took<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.430> liberty<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.790> loading<00:01:24.119> a

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
that's I took the liberty of loading a

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.969 
that's I took the liberty of loading a
chart<00:01:24.450> onto<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.840> map<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.590> we<00:01:25.619> get<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> little

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
chart onto the map so we get a little

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.859 
chart onto the map so we get a little
closer<00:01:26.220> we'll<00:01:26.549> have<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.880> there<00:01:27.090> will<00:01:27.840> be

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
closer we'll have it there will be

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.539 
closer we'll have it there will be
cheese<00:01:28.200> I'm<00:01:28.500> finna<00:01:29.189> maintain<00:01:29.490> three<00:01:29.790> then<00:01:30.470> the

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
cheese I'm finna maintain three then the

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.620 
cheese I'm finna maintain three then the
3040<00:01:32.549> Rojo<00:01:33.030> tell<00:01:33.240> Papa

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
3040 Rojo tell Papa

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.899 
3040 Rojo tell Papa
okay<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.619> that's<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.070> minimum<00:01:35.369> vector<00:01:35.850> in

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
okay so that's the minimum vector in

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.819 
okay so that's the minimum vector in
creating<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.570> maintain<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.470> know<00:01:37.530> that

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
creating on and maintain and I know that

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.080 
creating on and maintain and I know that
because<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.340> was<00:01:38.430> looking<00:01:38.670> at<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.850> chart

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
because I was looking at the chart

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.580 
because I was looking at the chart
earlier<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.570> people<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:39.930> since<00:01:40.229> we're<00:01:40.409> about

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
earlier the people so since we're about

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.530 
earlier the people so since we're about
to<00:01:40.740> go<00:01:40.860> geosynchronous<00:01:41.460> here<00:01:41.820> um<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.210> know<00:01:42.270> to

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
to go geosynchronous here um you know to

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.480 
to go geosynchronous here um you know to
go<00:01:43.380> ahead<00:01:43.700> switch<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.939> car<00:01:45.210> zero<00:01:45.720> seven<00:01:46.079> on<00:01:46.170> our

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
go ahead switch to car zero seven on our

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.429 
go ahead switch to car zero seven on our
backyard<00:01:47.490> 74<00:01:47.970> connect<00:01:48.299> for<00:01:48.509> Center<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.200> 98.1

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
backyard 74 connect for Center on 98.1

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.249 
backyard 74 connect for Center on 98.1
okay<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:52.950> there's<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.430> chart<00:01:53.899> of<00:01:54.899> course<00:01:55.110> was

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
okay so there's a chart of course was

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.039 
okay so there's a chart of course was
ooh<00:01:55.500> man<00:01:55.710> three<00:01:56.009> planning<00:01:56.520> one<00:01:56.670> eight<00:01:56.820> zero

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
ooh man three planning one eight zero

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.209 
ooh man three planning one eight zero
what<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.079> very<00:01:58.380> good<00:01:58.710> three
