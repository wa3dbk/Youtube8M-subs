00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
you're going to work the saying is it's

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.990

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
not every four years every day and

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.250 
not every four years every day and
that's<00:04:03.389> something<00:04:03.599> we've<00:04:03.840> really<00:04:04.049> tried<00:04:04.170> to

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260
