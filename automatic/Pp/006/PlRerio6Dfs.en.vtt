00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.180

so<00:00:10.590> we<00:00:10.980> have<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.340> a7<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.570> a7<00:00:13.259> are<00:00:13.410> before

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
so we have the a7 and the a7 are before

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.700 
so we have the a7 and the a7 are before
we<00:00:14.340> get<00:00:14.519> into<00:00:15.089> how<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.260> things<00:00:16.500> that<00:00:16.619> they

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
we get into how the things that they

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.840 
we get into how the things that they
share<00:00:17.039> cuz<00:00:17.279> they're<00:00:17.400> they're<00:00:17.580> almost

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
share cuz they're they're almost

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.460 
share cuz they're they're almost
identical<00:00:18.180> why<00:00:18.660> don't<00:00:18.840> we<00:00:18.900> just<00:00:19.020> get<00:00:19.170> out<00:00:19.230> of

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
identical why don't we just get out of

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.170 
identical why don't we just get out of
the<00:00:19.529> way<00:00:19.619> what<00:00:19.920> makes<00:00:20.189> these<00:00:20.369> different<00:00:20.430> all

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
the way what makes these different all

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.660 
the way what makes these different all
right<00:00:21.330> so<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.630> a7<00:00:22.080> a7r<00:00:22.680> as<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.220> good<00:00:23.519> way<00:00:23.609> to

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
right so the a7 a7r as the good way to

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.490 
right so the a7 a7r as the good way to
think<00:00:23.939> about<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.359> differences<00:00:24.900> between<00:00:25.080> them

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
think about the differences between them

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.800 
think about the differences between them
are<00:00:25.650> really<00:00:26.460> kind<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.730> on<00:00:26.880> two<00:00:27.119> maybe<00:00:27.359> three

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
are really kind of on two maybe three

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.570 
are really kind of on two maybe three
different<00:00:28.140> levels<00:00:28.289> first<00:00:28.859> they're<00:00:29.310> both

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
different levels first they're both

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.640 
different levels first they're both
full-frame<00:00:30.210> cameras<00:00:30.689> but<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.960> megapixel

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
full-frame cameras but the megapixel

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.400 
full-frame cameras but the megapixel
count<00:00:31.859> on<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.489> cameras<00:00:32.880> differs<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.600> a7r<00:00:34.320> is

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
count on the cameras differs the a7r is

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.350 
count on the cameras differs the a7r is
higher<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.160> correct<00:00:35.610> you're<00:00:35.820> at<00:00:36.090> about

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
higher that is correct you're at about

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.910

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
filter and what that essentially means

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.389 
filter and what that essentially means
is<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.539> when<00:01:00.809> you're<00:01:00.930> shooting<00:01:01.109> stills<00:01:01.829> and

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
is that when you're shooting stills and

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.039 
is that when you're shooting stills and
you're<00:01:02.550> using<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:02.910> camera<00:01:03.210> you're<00:01:03.840> not

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
you're using this camera you're not

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.990 
you're using this camera you're not
going<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.379> have<00:01:04.559> any<00:01:04.890> sort<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.250> filtering

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
going to have any sort of filtering

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.030 
going to have any sort of filtering
going<00:01:06.270> on<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.479> you're<00:01:06.600> gonna<00:01:06.869> get<00:01:07.290> sharper

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
going on so you're gonna get sharper

some more more a on the images because

you're not filtering that out and this

the<00:01:41.759> cream<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.119> crop<00:01:42.299> right<00:01:42.509> now<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.810> terms

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
the cream of the crop right now in terms

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.510 
the cream of the crop right now in terms

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
of that sensor technology and how good

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.429 
of that sensor technology and how good
it<00:01:44.579> can<00:01:44.729> get<00:01:44.970> now<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.509> other<00:01:45.750> difference<00:01:46.259> is

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
it can get now the other difference is

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.850 
it can get now the other difference is
is<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.340> a7<00:01:48.000> R<00:01:48.210> has<00:01:48.840> contrast<00:01:49.590> detection

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
is that the a7 R has contrast detection

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.580 
is that the a7 R has contrast detection
only<00:01:50.640> for<00:01:50.850> autofocus<00:01:51.420> for<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.899> for<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.380> you

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
only for autofocus for that for that you

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.840 
only for autofocus for that for that you
know<00:01:52.680> consistent<00:01:53.280> or<00:01:53.340> constant<00:01:53.700> auto

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
know consistent or constant auto

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.389 
know consistent or constant auto
focusing<00:01:54.270> whereas<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.079> a7<00:01:55.680> not<00:01:56.070> only<00:01:56.280> has

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
focusing whereas the a7 not only has

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.950 
focusing whereas the a7 not only has
contrast<00:01:56.850> detection<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.329> also<00:01:57.420> has<00:01:57.600> phase

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
contrast detection it also has phase

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.020 
contrast detection it also has phase
detection<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.189> terms<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.579> continuous

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
detection so in terms of continuous

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.399 
detection so in terms of continuous
autofocus<00:02:00.270> for<00:02:00.630> shooting<00:02:00.869> movies<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.350> things

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
autofocus for shooting movies and things

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.080 
autofocus for shooting movies and things
of<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.619> nature<00:02:01.759> you're<00:02:02.759> gonna<00:02:02.880> have<00:02:03.060> a

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
of that nature you're gonna have a

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.359 
of that nature you're gonna have a
little<00:02:03.360> bit<00:02:03.570> faster<00:02:04.020> focusing<00:02:04.560> on<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.799> a7

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
little bit faster focusing on the a7

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.940 
little bit faster focusing on the a7
than<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.909> are<00:02:06.119> on<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.600> a7<00:02:07.110> are<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.619> why

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
than you are on the a7 are is that why

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.440 
than you are on the a7 are is that why
you<00:02:08.009> went<00:02:08.280> with<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.520> a7<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.090> was<00:02:09.209> also<00:02:09.360> a

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
you went with the a7 it was also a

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.910 
you went with the a7 it was also a
little<00:02:09.539> cheaper<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.349> be<00:02:10.440> honest<00:02:10.679> with<00:02:10.830> you

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
little cheaper to to be honest with you

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.600 
little cheaper to to be honest with you
and<00:02:11.160> because<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:11.970> was<00:02:12.209> moving<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.840> new<00:02:13.170> city

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
and because I was moving to a new city

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.810 
and because I was moving to a new city
with<00:02:14.270> a<00:02:14.390> 787<00:02:14.900> our<00:02:15.290> is<00:02:15.500> actually<00:02:16.100> a<00:02:16.130> new<00:02:16.490> lens

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
with a 787 our is actually a new lens

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.630 
with a 787 our is actually a new lens
mount<00:02:17.120> for<00:02:17.390> Sony<00:02:17.630> this<00:02:18.380> is<00:02:18.560> called<00:02:18.800> email<00:02:19.400> but

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
mount for Sony this is called email but

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.180 
mount for Sony this is called email but
it's<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:19.850> F<00:02:20.030> EE<00:02:20.660> mount<00:02:21.080> F<00:02:21.290> meaning<00:02:21.920> for

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
it's the F EE mount F meaning for

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.550 
it's the F EE mount F meaning for
full-frame<00:02:23.000> so<00:02:23.660> what<00:02:23.900> they<00:02:24.020> did<00:02:24.080> is<00:02:24.230> they<00:02:24.350> came

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
full-frame so what they did is they came

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.980 
full-frame so what they did is they came
out<00:02:24.620> with<00:02:24.800> a<00:02:25.070> new<00:02:25.370> mount<00:02:25.610> in<00:02:26.270> a<00:02:26.390> new<00:02:26.570> you<00:02:26.900> know

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
out with a new mount in a new you know

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.720 
out with a new mount in a new you know
new<00:02:27.200> series<00:02:27.500> of<00:02:27.530> lenses<00:02:27.740> and<00:02:28.160> when<00:02:28.400> I<00:02:28.430> was

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
new series of lenses and when I was

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.670 
new series of lenses and when I was
going<00:02:28.880> out<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.240> buy<00:02:29.390> it<00:02:29.450> at<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.780> time<00:02:30.050> there

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
going out to buy it at the time there

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.350 
going out to buy it at the time there
was<00:02:30.800> very<00:02:31.010> few<00:02:31.130> lenses<00:02:31.580> available<00:02:31.850> and

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
was very few lenses available and

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.150 
was very few lenses available and
compared<00:02:32.810> to<00:02:32.930> Canada<00:02:33.140> Nikon<00:02:33.590> there<00:02:33.740> still<00:02:34.010> is

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
compared to Canada Nikon there still is

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.220 
compared to Canada Nikon there still is
a<00:02:34.190> lot<00:02:34.520> we<00:02:34.940> don't<00:02:35.030> less<00:02:35.240> lens<00:02:35.480> about<00:02:35.720> what<00:02:35.990> for

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
a lot we don't less lens about what for

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.660 
a lot we don't less lens about what for
on<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.500> market<00:02:36.800> now<00:02:36.890> four<00:02:37.160> or<00:02:37.280> five<00:02:37.460> on<00:02:37.490> the

market and the a7 was the only one
available<00:02:39.980> with<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.490> kit<00:02:40.700> lens<00:02:40.910> I<00:02:41.060> didn't

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
available with the kit lens I didn't

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.400 
available with the kit lens I didn't
want<00:02:41.360> it<00:02:41.450> right<00:02:41.540> off<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.690> bat<00:02:41.810> have<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.290> buy

that<00:02:45.620> range<00:02:45.830> but<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.400> a7<00:02:46.790> R<00:02:46.940> is<00:02:47.150> available<00:02:47.600> in

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
that range but the a7 R is available in

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.350 
that range but the a7 R is available in
body<00:02:47.870> only<00:02:48.230> you<00:02:48.830> have<00:02:48.980> to<00:02:49.010> go<00:02:49.190> after<00:02:49.400> an

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
body only you have to go after an

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.940 
body only you have to go after an
additional<00:02:50.720> lens<00:02:50.840> event<00:02:51.110> okay<00:02:51.590> other<00:02:51.830> things

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
additional lens event okay other things

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.710 
additional lens event okay other things
that<00:02:52.280> stand<00:02:52.520> out<00:02:52.640> to<00:02:52.700> me<00:02:52.880> I<00:02:53.030> like<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:53.510> fact

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
that stand out to me I like the fact

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.410 
that stand out to me I like the fact
that<00:02:53.900> it<00:02:54.110> has<00:02:54.260> an<00:02:54.560> articulating<00:02:55.490> panel<00:02:56.270> back

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
that it has an articulating panel back

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.690 
that it has an articulating panel back
here<00:02:56.660> so<00:02:56.840> you<00:02:56.870> can<00:02:57.170> hold<00:02:57.680> it<00:02:57.860> low<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:58.070> cradle

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
here so you can hold it low and cradle

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.210 
here so you can hold it low and cradle
or<00:02:58.940> tilt<00:02:59.420> this<00:02:59.570> for<00:02:59.810> shooting<00:03:00.080> overhead<00:03:00.500> so

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
or tilt this for shooting overhead so

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.100 
or tilt this for shooting overhead so
there's<00:03:01.400> some<00:03:01.520> nice<00:03:01.670> benefits<00:03:02.420> there<00:03:02.630> the

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
there's some nice benefits there the

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.680 
there's some nice benefits there the
body<00:03:03.380> feels<00:03:04.010> really<00:03:04.640> solid<00:03:04.910> it's<00:03:05.300> a<00:03:05.450> nice

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
body feels really solid it's a nice

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.230 
body feels really solid it's a nice
compact<00:03:06.350> but<00:03:06.620> good<00:03:06.980> feeling<00:03:07.520> metal<00:03:07.790> body<00:03:07.970> yeah

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
compact but good feeling metal body yeah

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.730 
compact but good feeling metal body yeah
it's<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:08.959> that's<00:03:09.020> actually<00:03:09.320> important

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
it's and that's actually important

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.260 
it's and that's actually important
distinction<00:03:10.010> it's<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.310> very<00:03:10.550> thin<00:03:10.910> body<00:03:11.150> you

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
distinction it's a very thin body you

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.490 
distinction it's a very thin body you
can<00:03:11.390> see<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.600> grip<00:03:11.840> side<00:03:12.020> is<00:03:12.170> a<00:03:12.200> little

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
can see the grip side is a little

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.430 
can see the grip side is a little
thicker<00:03:12.709> but<00:03:13.010> on<00:03:13.520> the<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.600> other<00:03:14.959> side<00:03:15.170> here

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
thicker but on the the other side here

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.410 
thicker but on the the other side here
it's<00:03:15.740> very<00:03:15.800> thin<00:03:16.310> very<00:03:16.550> lightweight<00:03:16.820> you

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
it's very thin very lightweight you

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.520 
it's very thin very lightweight you
actually<00:03:17.660> made<00:03:17.750> it<00:03:17.840> a<00:03:17.900> really<00:03:18.200> important

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
actually made it a really important

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.680 
actually made it a really important
point<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:19.280> back<00:03:19.519> body<00:03:19.910> of<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.209> back<00:03:20.360> part<00:03:20.630> of

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
point the back body of the back part of

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.150 
point the back body of the back part of
the<00:03:20.780> casing<00:03:21.110> here<00:03:21.230> is<00:03:21.320> identical<00:03:21.440> between<00:03:21.920> the

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
the casing here is identical between the

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.400 
the casing here is identical between the
cameras<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.970> front<00:03:23.360> plate<00:03:23.750> is<00:03:23.959> actually<00:03:24.200> a

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
cameras the front plate is actually a

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.130 
cameras the front plate is actually a
little<00:03:24.769> different<00:03:25.360> for<00:03:26.360> some<00:03:26.540> reason<00:03:26.870> on<00:03:27.050> the

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
little different for some reason on the

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.259 
little different for some reason on the
a7<00:03:27.650> are<00:03:27.830> they<00:03:28.040> employed<00:03:28.370> a<00:03:28.400> true<00:03:28.760> metal<00:03:29.060> plate

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
a7 are they employed a true metal plate

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:30.940 
a7 are they employed a true metal plate
on<00:03:29.300> the<00:03:29.480> front<00:03:29.720> so<00:03:29.870> this<00:03:30.019> is<00:03:30.140> no<00:03:30.350> pushing<00:03:30.769> you

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
on the front so this is no pushing you

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.670 
on the front so this is no pushing you
know<00:03:31.040> no<00:03:31.310> cracking<00:03:31.760> here<00:03:32.000> on<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.600> a7<00:03:33.170> it<00:03:33.320> is

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
know no cracking here on the a7 it is

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.890 
know no cracking here on the a7 it is
actually<00:03:34.070> a<00:03:34.130> plastic<00:03:34.550> plate<00:03:34.760> so<00:03:35.239> it<00:03:35.540> saves

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
actually a plastic plate so it saves

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.140 
actually a plastic plate so it saves
just<00:03:36.230> a<00:03:36.350> little<00:03:36.920> bit<00:03:37.070> of<00:03:37.190> weight<00:03:37.430> I<00:03:37.670> guess<00:03:38.000> the

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
just a little bit of weight I guess the

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.550 
just a little bit of weight I guess the
idea<00:03:38.180> there<00:03:38.660> is<00:03:38.690> if<00:03:38.810> you're<00:03:38.989> paying<00:03:39.200> a<00:03:39.350> premium

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
idea there is if you're paying a premium

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.440 
idea there is if you're paying a premium
of<00:03:39.890> you<00:03:40.010> know<00:03:40.100> a<00:03:40.130> few<00:03:40.280> hundred<00:03:40.340> dollars<00:03:40.610> why

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
of you know a few hundred dollars why

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.430 
of you know a few hundred dollars why
not<00:03:41.600> put<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:41.840> metal<00:03:42.080> on<00:03:42.200> it

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
not put the metal on it

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.630 
not put the metal on it
I<00:03:42.470> don't<00:03:42.769> think<00:03:42.830> technically<00:03:43.489> it<00:03:43.580> has

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
I don't think technically it has

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.520 
I don't think technically it has
anything<00:03:43.940> to<00:03:44.090> do<00:03:44.269> maybe<00:03:44.660> it<00:03:44.840> dissipates<00:03:45.290> heat

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
anything to do maybe it dissipates heat

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.620 
anything to do maybe it dissipates heat
better<00:03:45.769> with<00:03:46.070> the<00:03:46.280> you<00:03:47.120> know<00:03:47.150> the<00:03:47.239> more<00:03:47.450> pan

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
better with the you know the more pan

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.180 
better with the you know the more pan
megapixel<00:03:48.200> sensor<00:03:48.530> but<00:03:48.890> that's<00:03:49.010> another

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
megapixel sensor but that's another

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.920 
megapixel sensor but that's another
difference<00:03:49.580> now<00:03:50.090> you<00:03:50.150> mentioned<00:03:50.720> that<00:03:50.750> this

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
difference now you mentioned that this

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.740 
difference now you mentioned that this
is<00:03:51.080> a<00:03:51.110> relatively<00:03:51.680> new<00:03:51.800> system<00:03:52.220> but<00:03:52.760> Sony<00:03:53.450> has

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
is a relatively new system but Sony has

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.449 
is a relatively new system but Sony has
partnered<00:03:54.260> with<00:03:54.290> Zeiss<00:03:54.769> on<00:03:55.070> some<00:03:55.250> of<00:03:55.370> their

partnered with Zeiss on some of their

kit lens is not nothing stuck it doesn't
side<00:04:16.040> but<00:04:16.220> it's<00:04:16.310> not<00:04:16.400> great<00:04:16.669> the<00:04:16.880> thing<00:04:17.060> for

side but it's not great the thing for
shooting<00:04:17.540> video<00:04:17.989> would<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:18.769> kit<00:04:18.950> lens<00:04:18.979> that

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
shooting video would the kit lens that

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.770 
shooting video would the kit lens that
you<00:04:19.340> have<00:04:19.489> to<00:04:19.580> be<00:04:19.700> aware<00:04:19.910> of<00:04:19.970> is<00:04:20.239> that<00:04:20.450> it's<00:04:20.690> a

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
you have to be aware of is that it's a

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.450 
you have to be aware of is that it's a
variable<00:04:21.169> aperture<00:04:21.410> lens<00:04:21.799> so<00:04:21.979> going<00:04:22.130> from<00:04:22.310> F

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
variable aperture lens so going from F

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.060 
variable aperture lens so going from F
3.5<00:04:23.000> to<00:04:23.210> five<00:04:23.360> point<00:04:23.600> six<00:04:23.750> so<00:04:24.260> as<00:04:24.410> you<00:04:24.620> do<00:04:24.770> zoom

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
3.5 to five point six so as you do zoom

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.950 
3.5 to five point six so as you do zoom
through<00:04:25.760> the<00:04:25.910> range<00:04:26.120> your<00:04:26.419> aperture<00:04:26.660> is<00:04:26.840> going

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
through the range your aperture is going

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.490 
through the range your aperture is going
to

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
to

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.200 
to
so<00:04:27.770> lots<00:04:28.070> of<00:04:28.190> interesting<00:04:28.340> things<00:04:28.610> about<00:04:29.030> the

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
so lots of interesting things about the

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.180 
so lots of interesting things about the
body<00:04:29.450> and<00:04:29.750> the<00:04:29.810> lens<00:04:30.020> choices<00:04:30.320> one<00:04:31.010> of<00:04:31.100> the

body and the lens choices one of the

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.100 
body and the lens choices one of the
reasons<00:04:31.550> I<00:04:31.760> actually<00:04:31.970> got<00:04:32.330> this<00:04:32.480> cameras<00:04:32.870> for

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
reasons I actually got this cameras for

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.200 
reasons I actually got this cameras for
years<00:04:33.530> I've<00:04:33.770> been<00:04:33.800> messing<00:04:34.160> around<00:04:34.400> with<00:04:35.000> you

sort of transferring of image but I also

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.180 
sort of transferring of image but I also

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
wanted to sort of control the camera and

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.310 
wanted to sort of control the camera and
Sony<00:04:43.670> has<00:04:43.880> a<00:04:43.910> very<00:04:44.240> unique<00:04:44.600> system<00:04:44.810> obviously

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
Sony has a very unique system obviously

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.290 
Sony has a very unique system obviously
there's<00:04:45.680> Wi-Fi<00:04:45.950> built<00:04:46.400> in<00:04:46.550> but<00:04:47.000> what's<00:04:47.180> really

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
there's Wi-Fi built in but what's really

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.000 
there's Wi-Fi built in but what's really
cool<00:04:47.420> about<00:04:47.690> it<00:04:47.870> is<00:04:47.990> that<00:04:48.140> it<00:04:48.680> actually<00:04:48.830> is

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
cool about it is that it actually is

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.590 
cool about it is that it actually is
sort<00:04:49.190> of<00:04:49.280> a<00:04:49.370> computer<00:04:49.820> built<00:04:49.970> on<00:04:50.150> the<00:04:50.330> camera

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
sort of a computer built on the camera

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.900 
sort of a computer built on the camera
so<00:04:50.690> you<00:04:50.780> can<00:04:50.870> actually<00:04:50.990> download<00:04:51.260> apps<00:04:51.740> to<00:04:52.610> the

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
so you can actually download apps to the

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.400 
so you can actually download apps to the
camera<00:04:53.240> itself<00:04:53.690> to<00:04:53.900> do<00:04:54.020> different<00:04:54.380> things

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
camera itself to do different things

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:55.900 
camera itself to do different things
maybe<00:04:54.800> you<00:04:54.890> want<00:04:55.040> to<00:04:55.070> have<00:04:55.190> a<00:04:55.220> toy<00:04:55.490> camera

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
maybe you want to have a toy camera

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.210 
maybe you want to have a toy camera
effect<00:04:55.970> by<00:04:56.600> that<00:04:56.810> app<00:04:57.020> but<00:04:57.290> built-in<00:04:57.950> it<00:04:58.070> has

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
effect by that app but built-in it has

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.310 
effect by that app but built-in it has
Wi-Fi<00:04:58.490> so<00:04:59.270> I<00:04:59.300> can<00:04:59.570> not<00:04:59.690> only<00:04:59.840> control<00:05:00.290> the

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
Wi-Fi so I can not only control the

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.480 
Wi-Fi so I can not only control the
camera<00:05:00.680> and<00:05:00.770> trigger<00:05:00.980> the<00:05:01.130> camera<00:05:01.250> like<00:05:01.460> you

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
camera and trigger the camera like you

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.130 
camera and trigger the camera like you
can<00:05:01.700> on<00:05:01.730> Canon<00:05:02.210> and<00:05:02.330> Nikon<00:05:02.390> bodies<00:05:02.810> and<00:05:03.050> that

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
can on Canon and Nikon bodies and that

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.450 
can on Canon and Nikon bodies and that
kind<00:05:03.320> of<00:05:03.350> stuff<00:05:03.500> also<00:05:03.830> works<00:05:04.040> in<00:05:04.130> video<00:05:04.340> mode

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
kind of stuff also works in video mode

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.160 
kind of stuff also works in video mode
of<00:05:04.610> course<00:05:04.790> but<00:05:05.390> when<00:05:05.600> you<00:05:05.660> take<00:05:05.840> still<00:05:06.140> images

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
of course but when you take still images

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.170 
of course but when you take still images
you<00:05:06.560> can<00:05:06.710> transfer<00:05:07.040> those<00:05:07.160> images<00:05:07.490> off<00:05:07.700> to

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
you can transfer those images off to

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.330 
you can transfer those images off to
your<00:05:08.330> computer<00:05:08.720> or<00:05:09.020> to<00:05:09.290> your<00:05:09.440> phone<00:05:09.710> or<00:05:09.950> even

video professional using one of these
cameras<00:05:17.600> I<00:05:17.750> think<00:05:18.230> there<00:05:18.410> are<00:05:18.590> some<00:05:19.040> standout

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
cameras I think there are some standout

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.730 
cameras I think there are some standout
features<00:05:19.850> good<00:05:20.150> lens<00:05:20.420> choices<00:05:20.780> ability<00:05:21.650> to

work with standard cards solid bodies
really<00:05:24.890> good<00:05:25.070> articulating<00:05:25.730> viewfinder

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
really good articulating viewfinder

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.090 
really good articulating viewfinder
that's<00:05:26.360> nice<00:05:26.540> and<00:05:26.750> high-res<00:05:27.080> and<00:05:27.410> because

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
that's nice and high-res and because

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.950 
that's nice and high-res and because
it's<00:05:28.280> mirrorless<00:05:28.730> you<00:05:29.210> don't<00:05:29.420> get<00:05:29.660> some<00:05:29.930> of

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
it's mirrorless you don't get some of

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.840 
it's mirrorless you don't get some of
the<00:05:30.110> issues<00:05:30.530> that<00:05:30.560> you<00:05:30.770> have<00:05:31.010> with<00:05:31.040> the<00:05:31.490> DSLR

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
the issues that you have with the DSLR

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.790 
the issues that you have with the DSLR
you're<00:05:32.270> really<00:05:32.600> basically<00:05:32.990> seeing<00:05:33.440> what<00:05:33.680> the

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
you're really basically seeing what the

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.590 
you're really basically seeing what the
sensor<00:05:34.220> is<00:05:34.340> seeing<00:05:34.610> because<00:05:35.060> you're<00:05:35.270> directly

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
sensor is seeing because you're directly

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.420 
sensor is seeing because you're directly
monitoring<00:05:36.080> it<00:05:36.290> you<00:05:36.500> have<00:05:36.650> to<00:05:36.800> really<00:05:37.310> not

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
monitoring it you have to really not

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.640 
monitoring it you have to really not
worry<00:05:37.670> about<00:05:37.880> that<00:05:38.090> now<00:05:38.630> as<00:05:38.930> far<00:05:39.170> as<00:05:39.230> battery

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
worry about that now as far as battery

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.020 
worry about that now as far as battery
life<00:05:39.830> are<00:05:40.040> you<00:05:40.100> finding<00:05:40.370> it's<00:05:40.640> okay

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
life are you finding it's okay

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.360 
life are you finding it's okay
yeah<00:05:41.480> battery<00:05:41.780> life<00:05:41.900> is<00:05:41.960> so-so<00:05:42.590> I<00:05:42.800> got<00:05:43.220> to<00:05:43.310> be

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
yeah battery life is so-so I got to be

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.410 
yeah battery life is so-so I got to be
honest<00:05:43.550> with<00:05:43.640> you<00:05:43.760> the<00:05:43.820> batteries<00:05:44.180> on<00:05:44.300> these

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:44.420 
honest with you the batteries on these

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.800 
honest with you the batteries on these
cameras<00:05:44.780> are<00:05:44.930> very<00:05:45.350> small<00:05:45.950> I<00:05:46.280> find<00:05:47.210> that<00:05:47.420> I<00:05:47.480> get

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
cameras are very small I find that I get

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.090 
cameras are very small I find that I get
in<00:05:47.960> still<00:05:48.230> shooting<00:05:48.590> and<00:05:48.740> probably<00:05:49.010> only

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
in still shooting and probably only

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.370 
in still shooting and probably only
about<00:05:49.220> 300<00:05:50.060> shots<00:05:50.270> or<00:05:50.510> so<00:05:50.630> which<00:05:50.780> is<00:05:50.900> not<00:05:51.080> a<00:05:51.110> lot

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
about 300 shots or so which is not a lot

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.920 
about 300 shots or so which is not a lot
and<00:05:52.100> when<00:05:52.220> it<00:05:52.310> comes<00:05:52.460> to<00:05:52.640> video<00:05:52.850> shooting<00:05:53.270> yeah

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
and when it comes to video shooting yeah

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.260 
and when it comes to video shooting yeah
I<00:05:53.960> need<00:05:54.560> I<00:05:54.740> have<00:05:54.890> about<00:05:55.040> six<00:05:55.460> these<00:05:55.670> batteries

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
I need I have about six these batteries

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.030 
I need I have about six these batteries
now<00:05:56.480> because<00:05:57.230> I<00:05:57.320> do<00:05:57.380> go<00:05:57.680> through<00:05:57.860> when

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
now because I do go through when

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.070 
now because I do go through when
shooting<00:05:58.190> video<00:05:58.460> I<00:05:58.880> do<00:05:59.060> go<00:05:59.390> through<00:05:59.570> probably

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
shooting video I do go through probably

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.220 
shooting video I do go through probably
one<00:06:00.440> every<00:06:00.920> half<00:06:01.370> hour<00:06:01.550> to<00:06:01.910> 40<00:06:02.240> minutes<00:06:02.630> it's

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:03.230 
one every half hour to 40 minutes it's

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.330 
one every half hour to 40 minutes it's
actually<00:06:03.470> one<00:06:03.590> more<00:06:03.620> important<00:06:04.070> distinction

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:04.340 
actually one more important distinction

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.340 
actually one more important distinction
rich<00:06:04.610> just<00:06:04.910> to<00:06:05.000> note<00:06:05.150> on<00:06:05.270> the<00:06:05.330> camera<00:06:05.660> is<00:06:06.170> that

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350 
rich just to note on the camera is that

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.570 
rich just to note on the camera is that
the<00:06:06.440> cameras<00:06:06.770> that<00:06:06.860> for<00:06:07.010> in<00:06:07.070> comes<00:06:07.250> the<00:06:07.370> video

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
the cameras that for in comes the video

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.620 
the cameras that for in comes the video
can<00:06:07.790> actually<00:06:08.030> shoot<00:06:08.150> in<00:06:08.270> two<00:06:08.360> different

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
can actually shoot in two different

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.630 
can actually shoot in two different
modes<00:06:08.690> we<00:06:08.930> can<00:06:08.960> shoot<00:06:09.170> an<00:06:09.290> ABC<00:06:09.590> HD<00:06:09.710> or<00:06:10.340> we<00:06:10.520> can

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:10.640 
modes we can shoot an ABC HD or we can
