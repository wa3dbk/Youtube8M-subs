then I have heard of people talking

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.540 
then I have heard of people talking
about<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.350> foundation<00:00:49.500> saying<00:00:50.100> oh<00:00:50.220> no<00:00:50.250> it's

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
about this foundation saying oh no it's

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.700 
about this foundation saying oh no it's
totally<00:00:50.700> different<00:00:51.060> it<00:00:51.990> minimizes<00:00:52.680> your

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
totally different it minimizes your

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.580 
totally different it minimizes your
pores<00:00:52.860> has<00:00:53.700> more<00:00:53.970> coverage<00:00:54.240> it<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:55.050> just<00:00:55.410> it's

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
pores has more coverage it is just it's

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.130 
pores has more coverage it is just it's
like<00:00:55.730> silky<00:00:56.730> texture<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.570> thought<00:00:57.840> why<00:00:58.110> not

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
like silky texture so I thought why not

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.810 
like silky texture so I thought why not
I'll<00:00:58.410> give<00:00:58.560> it<00:00:58.650> a<00:00:58.710> try<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.130> I<00:00:59.160> went<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.640> Sephora

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
I'll give it a try so I went to Sephora

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.690 
I'll give it a try so I went to Sephora
and<00:01:00.360> price<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.290> $27<00:01:01.950> so<00:01:02.250> it's<00:01:02.400> pretty

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
and price is $27 so it's pretty

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.139 
and price is $27 so it's pretty
reasonable<00:01:02.970> but<00:01:03.960> then<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.259> saw<00:01:05.000> you<00:01:06.000> don't

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 
reasonable but then I saw you don't

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.149 
reasonable but then I saw you don't
really<00:01:06.329> get<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.630> lot<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:07.259> here<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.799> if<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.070> need

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
really get a lot in here and if you need

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.249 
really get a lot in here and if you need
a<00:01:08.250> lot<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.460> coverage<00:01:08.729> like<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.090> do<00:01:09.149> this<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:09.899> not

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
a lot of coverage like I do this is not

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.280 
a lot of coverage like I do this is not
going<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.439> last<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:10.950> long<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:11.850> about

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
back what's interesting about this is

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.300 
back what's interesting about this is
that<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.620> about<00:01:19.890> how<00:01:20.040> much<00:01:20.190> the

about the comparison between the
original<00:01:27.060> bare<00:01:27.420> minerals<00:01:27.750> but<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:29.150> 0.21

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150

interesting<00:01:33.540> about<00:01:33.870> this<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.440> it<00:01:34.680> has

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
interesting about this is that it has

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.280 
interesting about this is that it has
this<00:01:35.070> little<00:01:35.130> mesh<00:01:35.700> thingy<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> center<00:01:36.720> so

in<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.659> original<00:01:48.780> bare<00:01:49.110> minerals<00:01:49.409> foundation

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
in the original bare minerals foundation

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.070 
in the original bare minerals foundation
they<00:01:50.159> say<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.610> medium<00:01:50.880> beige<00:01:51.090> suits

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
they say that medium beige suits

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.060 
they say that medium beige suits
80%<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.830> skin<00:01:53.430> tones<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.439> it's<00:01:55.439> just<00:01:55.740> it's

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
80% of skin tones and it's just it's

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.160 
80% of skin tones and it's just it's
like<00:01:56.130> real<00:01:56.549> girl<00:01:56.760> good<00:01:57.150> neutral<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.780> has<00:01:57.900> not

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
like real girl good neutral it has not

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.690 
like real girl good neutral it has not
too<00:01:58.350> much<00:01:58.470> paint<00:01:58.710> not<00:01:58.860> too<00:01:59.010> much<00:01:59.130> yellow<00:01:59.430> I

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
too much paint not too much yellow I

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.460 
too much paint not too much yellow I
tend<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.420> like<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.659> foundation<00:02:00.900> to<00:02:01.140> be<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.260> little

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
tend to like a foundation to be a little

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.160 
tend to like a foundation to be a little
bit<00:02:01.619> more<00:02:01.740> yellow<00:02:01.890> but<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.090> super<00:02:03.720> yellow

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
bit more yellow but this is super yellow

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.479 
bit more yellow but this is super yellow
I<00:02:04.619> put<00:02:05.189> this<00:02:05.280> on<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:06.000> was<00:02:07.069> so<00:02:08.069> beyond

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
I put this on and it was so beyond

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.869 
I put this on and it was so beyond
yellow<00:02:08.939> and<00:02:09.269> because

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
yellow and because

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.250 
yellow and because
upon<00:02:11.209> initial<00:02:11.329> application<00:02:12.019> it<00:02:12.140> really

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
upon initial application it really

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.050 
upon initial application it really
wasn't<00:02:12.530> giving<00:02:12.950> me<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.099> coverage<00:02:13.400> I<00:02:13.519> wanted<00:02:13.909> I

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
wasn't giving me the coverage I wanted I

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.030 
wasn't giving me the coverage I wanted I
went<00:02:14.569> back<00:02:14.749> and<00:02:14.900> added<00:02:15.019> more<00:02:15.349> and<00:02:15.530> as<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:15.799> added

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
went back and added more and as I added

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.920 
went back and added more and as I added
more<00:02:16.249> it<00:02:16.459> just<00:02:16.489> got<00:02:16.760> more<00:02:16.999> yellow<00:02:17.329> and<00:02:17.689> more

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
more it just got more yellow and more

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.129 
more it just got more yellow and more
yellow<00:02:18.290> so<00:02:19.159> I<00:02:19.189> haven't<00:02:19.430> decided<00:02:19.849> if<00:02:20.239> I<00:02:20.629> want<00:02:20.989> to

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:21.139 
yellow so I haven't decided if I want to

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:24.339 
yellow so I haven't decided if I want to
go<00:02:21.260> back<00:02:21.469> and<00:02:21.739> get<00:02:22.099> a<00:02:22.459> different<00:02:23.060> color<00:02:23.420> or<00:02:23.749> if

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
go back and get a different color or if

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:25.539 
go back and get a different color or if
I<00:02:24.439> wanted<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.739> treat<00:02:24.829> from<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.069> foundation

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
I wanted to treat from the foundation

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.300 
I wanted to treat from the foundation
totally<00:02:25.969> because<00:02:26.450> while<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:27.170> did<00:02:27.560> have<00:02:28.189> that

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
totally because while it did have that

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.000 
totally because while it did have that
nice<00:02:28.459> creamy<00:02:28.670> consistency<00:02:29.599> it<00:02:29.959> did<00:02:30.560> not<00:02:30.739> have

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
nice creamy consistency it did not have

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.569 
nice creamy consistency it did not have
the<00:02:31.129> coverage<00:02:31.459> that<00:02:31.489> I<00:02:31.819> like<00:02:32.239> I<00:02:32.480> have<00:02:32.900> a<00:02:32.930> lot<00:02:33.290> of

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579 
the coverage that I like I have a lot of

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.009 
the coverage that I like I have a lot of
pigmentation<00:02:34.579> and<00:02:34.819> hyperpigmentation<00:02:35.180> here

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
pigmentation and hyperpigmentation here

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.039 
pigmentation and hyperpigmentation here
on<00:02:36.200> my<00:02:36.409> sides<00:02:36.889> of<00:02:37.040> my<00:02:37.099> face<00:02:37.310> so<00:02:38.060> that<00:02:38.810> is<00:02:38.930> where

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
on my sides of my face so that is where

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.720 
on my sides of my face so that is where
I<00:02:39.109> usually<00:02:39.409> like<00:02:39.560> to<00:02:39.590> put<00:02:39.709> my<00:02:39.980> foundations<00:02:40.519> to

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
I usually like to put my foundations to

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.000 
I usually like to put my foundations to
test<00:02:40.939> them<00:02:41.120> out<00:02:41.209> and<00:02:41.510> see<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:42.680> covers<00:02:42.919> that

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
test them out and see it covers that

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.699 
test them out and see it covers that
area<00:02:43.159> so<00:02:43.669> in<00:02:44.030> one<00:02:44.329> kind<00:02:44.540> of<00:02:44.659> swipe<00:02:45.019> it<00:02:45.260> didn't

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
area so in one kind of swipe it didn't

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.159 
area so in one kind of swipe it didn't
really<00:02:46.099> cover<00:02:46.280> that<00:02:46.400> that<00:02:47.000> very<00:02:47.180> well<00:02:47.329> so<00:02:48.109> I

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:48.169 
really cover that that very well so I

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:50.619

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
thirty dollars but being that I already

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:02.890 
thirty dollars but being that I already
had<00:03:01.340> so<00:03:01.489> many<00:03:01.579> bare<00:03:01.819> minerals<00:03:02.389> brushes<00:03:02.750> I

passed on that so I don't know if that
really<00:03:04.879> makes<00:03:05.269> a<00:03:05.359> difference

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
really makes a difference

really makes a difference
I<00:03:05.930> wouldn't<00:03:06.889> think<00:03:06.980> it<00:03:07.159> would<00:03:07.219> be<00:03:07.370> so<00:03:07.519> dramatic

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879

I wouldn't think it would be so dramatic
a<00:03:07.939> difference<00:03:08.239> between<00:03:08.599> any<00:03:08.810> of<00:03:08.930> these<00:03:08.989> three

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:33.009 
heavenly face so they all gave decent

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:37.270

you<00:03:34.009> know<00:03:34.389> medium<00:03:35.389> coverage<00:03:35.780> but<00:03:36.439> not<00:03:36.949> like

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
you know medium coverage but not like

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.129 
you know medium coverage but not like

the medium to full like I like it didn't
I<00:03:39.290> would<00:03:39.620> still<00:03:39.829> need<00:03:39.949> concealer<00:03:40.370> here<00:03:40.729> first

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
I would still need concealer here first

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.679 
I would still need concealer here first
and<00:03:42.519> once<00:03:43.519> again<00:03:43.729> and<00:03:44.060> just<00:03:44.180> like<00:03:44.479> the

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:44.689 
and once again and just like the

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:48.429 
and once again and just like the
original<00:03:45.109> it<00:03:45.500> kind<00:03:46.459> of<00:03:46.609> felt<00:03:47.000> a<00:03:47.389> little<00:03:48.169> itchy

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:48.439 
original it kind of felt a little itchy

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:53.229 
original it kind of felt a little itchy
on<00:03:48.680> my<00:03:48.859> skin<00:03:49.220> my<00:03:49.909> pores<00:03:50.650> were<00:03:51.849> minimizer<00:03:52.849> here

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
on my skin my pores were minimizer here

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.939 
on my skin my pores were minimizer here
but<00:03:53.419> they<00:03:53.540> were<00:03:53.599> still<00:03:53.930> rather<00:03:54.319> large<00:03:54.680> through

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:54.949 
but they were still rather large through

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:57.009 
but they were still rather large through
here<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.909> claim<00:03:56.209> is<00:03:56.449> that<00:03:56.479> it<00:03:56.750> will<00:03:56.870> reduce

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
here the claim is that it will reduce

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.280 
here the claim is that it will reduce
pore<00:03:57.530> size<00:03:57.769> over<00:03:58.189> time<00:03:58.219> and<00:03:59.000> that<00:03:59.870> might<00:04:00.139> very

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
pore size over time and that might very

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.749 
pore size over time and that might very
well<00:04:00.409> be<00:04:00.650> true<00:04:00.859> I<00:04:00.979> just<00:04:01.400> don't<00:04:01.549> know<00:04:01.609> if<00:04:01.669> I'm

just<00:05:16.970> pass<00:05:17.180> on<00:05:17.389> it<00:05:17.599> because<00:05:17.990> there's<00:05:18.320> just

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
just pass on it because there's just

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.500 
just pass on it because there's just
something<00:05:18.770> about<00:05:18.830> those<00:05:19.310> of<00:05:19.520> us<00:05:19.610> and<00:05:20.180> mineral
