density foam over that and trim that out

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:37.980 
density foam over that and trim that out
with<00:05:36.310> exacto<00:05:36.819> knife<00:05:37.000> then<00:05:37.330> we<00:05:37.449> had<00:05:37.539> to<00:05:37.569> insert

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
with exacto knife then we had to insert

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.350 
with exacto knife then we had to insert
that<00:05:38.229> in<00:05:38.439> our<00:05:38.590> tool<00:05:38.800> before<00:05:39.099> we<00:05:39.460> laid<00:05:40.120> up<00:05:40.270> the

so<00:05:46.650> there<00:05:46.830> you<00:05:46.860> have<00:05:46.950> it<00:05:47.130> five<00:05:47.639> reasons<00:05:47.910> that

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
so there you have it five reasons that

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.020 
so there you have it five reasons that
make<00:05:48.480> project<00:05:48.960> heretic<00:05:49.410> unique<00:05:49.920> the<00:05:50.760> next
