because we found out the new technology

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.729 
because we found out the new technology
which<00:00:44.230> can<00:00:44.530> get<00:00:45.219> much<00:00:45.579> better<00:00:45.789> some<00:00:46.149> royalty

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.220 
believe that nano sized sequence

side hmm well i'm looking forward to
learning<00:01:32.770> some<00:01:33.100> more<00:01:33.220> about<00:01:33.400> that<00:01:33.550> if

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
learning some more about that if

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.630 
learning some more about that if
possible<00:01:33.880> one<00:01:34.300> day<00:01:34.450> and<00:01:35.110> what<00:01:35.920> else<00:01:36.130> they

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
possible one day and what else they

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.850 
possible one day and what else they
looked<00:01:36.880> at<00:01:37.030> very<00:01:37.330> large<00:01:37.720> diaphragms<00:01:38.590> by<00:01:38.800> the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
looked at very large diaphragms by the

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.610 
looked at very large diaphragms by the
looks<00:01:39.160> of<00:01:39.280> it<00:01:39.400> this<00:01:39.550> is<00:01:39.610> a<00:01:39.760> very<00:01:39.970> large

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
this yeah the diaphragm is huge

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.900 
this yeah the diaphragm is huge
diaphragm<00:01:49.660> yeah<00:01:49.900> the<00:01:50.530> sample<00:01:51.310> of<00:01:51.430> the<00:01:51.580> kids

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
diaphragm yeah the sample of the kids

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.170 
diaphragm yeah the sample of the kids
they<00:01:52.800> benefit<00:01:53.800> from<00:01:53.830> that<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.550> soundstage

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
they benefit from that the soundstage

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.680 
they benefit from that the soundstage
and<00:01:55.450> image<00:01:55.780> is<00:01:55.810> perfect<00:01:56.230> I<00:01:56.880> was<00:01:57.880> very<00:01:58.330> it<00:01:58.570> was

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
and image is perfect I was very it was

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.040 
and image is perfect I was very it was
certainly<00:01:59.200> very<00:01:59.290> good<00:01:59.770> I<00:01:59.980> mean<00:02:00.190> I<00:02:00.340> was<00:02:00.580> really

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
certainly very good I mean I was really

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.920 
certainly very good I mean I was really
pretty<00:02:02.050> taken<00:02:02.470> aback<00:02:02.530> at<00:02:02.980> how<00:02:03.600> clean<00:02:04.600> then<00:02:04.810> the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
pretty taken aback at how clean then the

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.460 
pretty taken aback at how clean then the
bass<00:02:05.140> response<00:02:05.380> was<00:02:05.980> fabulous<00:02:06.850> it's<00:02:07.450> a

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
bass response was fabulous it's a

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.920 
bass response was fabulous it's a
really<00:02:08.710> powerful<00:02:09.399> you<00:02:09.820> know<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.060> bestest<00:02:10.630> is

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
really powerful you know the bestest is

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.020 
really powerful you know the bestest is
good<00:02:11.410> I<00:02:11.680> mean<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:11.980> reason<00:02:12.400> there<00:02:12.790> are<00:02:12.880> two

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
good I mean the reason there are two

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.910 
good I mean the reason there are two
ones<00:02:13.390> wearing<00:02:14.020> them<00:02:14.260> is<00:02:14.410> so<00:02:14.590> is<00:02:14.740> about

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
ones wearing them is so is about

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.150 
ones wearing them is so is about
diaphragm<00:02:15.400> is<00:02:15.520> huge<00:02:16.350> now<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.410> reason<00:02:17.680> is<00:02:17.950> it

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
be the day and um and we don't know the

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.590 
be the day and um and we don't know the
price<00:02:41.590> yet<00:02:41.860> we<00:02:42.400> don't<00:02:42.520> know<00:02:42.670> i<00:02:42.700> right<00:02:43.270> they're

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
price yet we don't know i right they're

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.460 
price yet we don't know i right they're
not<00:02:43.750> too<00:02:43.900> pricey<00:02:44.140> I<00:02:44.440> think<00:02:44.680> he's<00:02:44.770> bright<00:02:44.980> right

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
not too pricey I think he's bright right
