so<00:00:01.709> what<00:00:01.860> we're<00:00:01.949> going<00:00:02.070> to<00:00:02.129> do<00:00:02.340> here<00:00:02.580> is<00:00:02.820> take

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
so what we're going to do here is take

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.210 
so what we're going to do here is take
out<00:00:03.240> some<00:00:03.540> of<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:03.780> pavers<00:00:04.529> that<00:00:04.560> are<00:00:04.950> existing

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
out some of the pavers that are existing

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.280 
out some of the pavers that are existing
and<00:00:05.609> replace<00:00:06.509> them<00:00:06.779> with<00:00:06.810> some<00:00:07.109> of<00:00:07.200> these

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
and replace them with some of these

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.860 
and replace them with some of these
benefit<00:00:07.770> pavers<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.460> easiest<00:00:09.389> way<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.570> do

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
benefit pavers the easiest way to do

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.589 
benefit pavers the easiest way to do
this<00:00:09.900> is<00:00:10.349> if<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.920> sand<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:11.969> joints<00:00:12.450> has

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
this is if the sand and the joints has

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.169 
this is if the sand and the joints has
been<00:00:12.809> wet<00:00:13.080> or<00:00:13.380> after<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.160> good<00:00:14.400> rain<00:00:14.670> it<00:00:14.969> makes

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
been wet or after a good rain it makes

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.330 
been wet or after a good rain it makes
it<00:00:15.330> softer<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.870> work<00:00:16.080> with<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.529> then<00:00:17.130> if<00:00:17.279> you

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
it softer to work with and then if you

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.490 
it softer to work with and then if you
start<00:00:17.670> with<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.880> smaller<00:00:18.270> paver<00:00:18.660> that's

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
start with a smaller paver that's

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.170 
start with a smaller paver that's
definitely<00:00:20.160> easier<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.609> get<00:00:20.789> out<00:00:20.939> then<00:00:21.119> the

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
definitely easier to get out then the

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:21.890 
definitely easier to get out then the
larger<00:00:21.539> ones

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
larger ones

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.900 
larger ones
start<00:00:22.560> with<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.710> small<00:00:22.830> paver<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.580> then<00:00:23.670> work

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:37.419 
start with a small paver and then work
your<00:00:24.090> way<00:00:24.150> out<00:00:24.480> around<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.199> bigger<00:00:25.380> ones

between<00:01:42.970> the<00:01:43.300> joints<00:01:43.750> and<00:01:44.190> then<00:01:45.190> you<00:01:45.370> can

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
between the joints and then you can

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.410 
between the joints and then you can
easily<00:01:47.200> slip<00:01:47.680> your<00:01:47.920> next<00:01:48.670> paper<00:01:48.850> back<00:01:49.180> in

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
easily slip your next paper back in

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.820 
easily slip your next paper back in
they'll<00:01:49.600> just<00:01:49.750> drop<00:01:49.990> right<00:01:50.020> in<00:01:50.350> place<00:01:50.590> as<00:01:50.800> you

they'll just drop right in place as you

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.280 
they'll just drop right in place as you
can<00:01:51.100> see<00:01:51.310> there<00:01:51.720> from<00:01:52.720> here<00:01:52.900> I'm<00:01:52.960> going<00:01:53.080> to<00:01:53.140> go

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
can see there from here I'm going to go

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
can see there from here I'm going to go
and<00:01:53.470> do<00:01:53.560> some<00:01:53.800> more

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.800 

again<00:02:10.310> I'll<00:02:10.429> go<00:02:10.549> to<00:02:10.610> a<00:02:10.729> small<00:02:11.060> one

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:32.860 

before<00:02:15.319> I<00:02:15.380> tackle<00:02:15.830> that<00:02:15.920> big

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:42.440 

now<00:02:33.379> it's<00:02:33.620> easier<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:34.010> get<00:02:34.129> this<00:02:34.310> big<00:02:34.550> one<00:02:34.670> out

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.259 

my<00:02:43.450> fate<00:02:43.720> it<00:02:44.909> another<00:02:45.909> Samoan<00:02:46.390> out<00:02:46.540> of<00:02:46.659> here

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
my fate it another Samoan out of here

00:02:48.269 --> 00:03:31.930 
my fate it another Samoan out of here
where<00:02:49.269> you<00:02:49.360> fight<00:02:49.569> one<00:02:49.750> here

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:48.230 

go<00:03:32.940> ahead<00:03:33.150> clean<00:03:33.480> up<00:03:33.629> the<00:03:33.780> inside

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.330 

sometimes<00:03:49.080> if<00:03:49.260> it's<00:03:49.380> clean<00:03:49.650> enough<00:03:49.680> sand<00:03:50.160> you

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
sometimes if it's clean enough sand you

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.430 
sometimes if it's clean enough sand you
can<00:03:50.460> use<00:03:50.670> this<00:03:50.880> to<00:03:52.430> re-level<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:54.320> refill<00:03:55.320> in

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
can use this to re-level the refill in

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.750 
can use this to re-level the refill in
the<00:03:55.530> edges<00:03:55.860> here<00:03:58.040> there's<00:03:59.040> a<00:03:59.100> new<00:03:59.280> one<00:03:59.430> going

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
the edges here there's a new one going

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:15.040 
the edges here there's a new one going
in

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.540 

and<00:04:15.290> your<00:04:15.470> last<00:04:15.650> step<00:04:15.950> would<00:04:16.100> just<00:04:16.280> be<00:04:16.430> the

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:16.550 
and your last step would just be the

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.720 
and your last step would just be the
speech<00:04:17.239> Sandin
