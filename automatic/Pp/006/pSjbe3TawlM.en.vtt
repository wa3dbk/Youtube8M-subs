 you need to take out insurance because 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.330

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.370

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.170

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.780
 I need to first take out the insurance 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.720
 I need help because I need a 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.940

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.070

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.370

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.010
 help 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.110
 So, gentlemen , you know if they want 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.820
 this tractor if you want tractor or this 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.390
 rather truck that serves to cut 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.640
 which in English is called heavy avoid or 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.380
 avoid or something like that the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.480
 I really do not know how to pronounce it very well 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.520
 but because it's been the same 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.270
 being an industrial truck to cut 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.190
 more or less like that is translated and so 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.590
 obviously this tractor does not 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.300
 you get anywhere in the world 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.880
 history you can only get 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.920
 if I pass it so well all gift 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.230
 is that carnal already know do not forget 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.240

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.649
 video with all your friends remember 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.920
 I am also asking you to please 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.740
 if you know what that mission is called 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.080

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.180

 finally I'm going to put this truck here 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.180
 inside as I tell you it still does not have 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.220
 assured so I'm afraid that 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.380
 I get out the police I'm afraid that 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.850
 explode me or something like that and 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.760
 lose this truck so I'm going to 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.800
 leave saved here until I get what 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.750
 what is the insurance and once 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.390
 having insurance is obviously the 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.070
