today's showcase I will be showing yet
another<00:00:18.310> small<00:00:19.210> but<00:00:19.599> very<00:00:19.900> cool<00:00:20.259> mod<00:00:20.860> and<00:00:21.220> this

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
another small but very cool mod and this

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.600 
another small but very cool mod and this
is<00:00:21.700> the<00:00:21.880> time<00:00:22.180> control<00:00:22.869> mod<00:00:23.110> so<00:00:23.830> this<00:00:24.009> is<00:00:24.189> a

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
is the time control mod so this is a

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.599 
is the time control mod so this is a
relatively<00:00:25.800> older<00:00:26.800> mod<00:00:26.980> it's<00:00:27.189> at<00:00:27.310> least<00:00:27.490> a

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:27.609 
relatively older mod it's at least a

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.660 
relatively older mod it's at least a
couple<00:00:27.789> years<00:00:28.090> old<00:00:28.300> I<00:00:28.449> believe<00:00:29.039> but<00:00:30.039> it<00:00:30.220> is<00:00:30.250> a

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.670 
couple years old I believe but it is a

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.020 
couple years old I believe but it is a
really<00:00:31.390> cool<00:00:31.750> mod<00:00:32.280> because<00:00:33.280> it<00:00:33.489> allows<00:00:33.610> you<00:00:33.850> to

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
really cool mod because it allows you to

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.270 
really cool mod because it allows you to
control<00:00:35.070> time<00:00:36.070> in<00:00:36.430> Minecraft<00:00:37.769> so<00:00:38.769> we<00:00:39.160> have

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
control time in Minecraft so we have

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.369 
control time in Minecraft so we have
four<00:00:39.519> different<00:00:39.640> time<00:00:40.449> control<00:00:40.870> remotes<00:00:41.230> here

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
four different time control remotes here

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:42.660 
four different time control remotes here
and<00:00:41.650> then<00:00:41.769> we<00:00:41.920> have<00:00:42.040> an<00:00:42.159> instruction<00:00:42.640> manual

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
and then we have an instruction manual

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.030 
and then we have an instruction manual
which<00:00:43.629> automatically<00:00:44.140> comes<00:00:44.409> with<00:00:44.530> all<00:00:44.769> mods

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
which automatically comes with all mods

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.219 
which automatically comes with all mods

guide to all of the mods that you have

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.270 
guide to all of the mods that you have
that<00:00:58.299> are<00:00:58.540> made<00:00:58.720> by<00:00:58.750> Grimm<00:00:59.559> three<00:00:59.799> two<00:00:59.949> one<00:01:00.100> two

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
that are made by Grimm three two one two

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.910 
that are made by Grimm three two one two
hence<00:01:01.119> the<00:01:01.299> name<00:01:01.420> the<00:01:02.049> Grimm<00:01:02.290> three<00:01:02.680> two<00:01:02.799> one

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
hence the name the Grimm three two one

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.390 
hence the name the Grimm three two one
two<00:01:03.070> instruction<00:01:03.670> manual<00:01:04.119> and<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:06.070> you<00:01:06.159> can

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
two instruction manual and so you can

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.340 
two instruction manual and so you can
also<00:01:06.729> craft<00:01:07.119> it<00:01:07.330> in<00:01:07.450> survival<00:01:07.930> with<00:01:08.080> the<00:01:08.200> main

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
also craft it in survival with the main

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.800 
also craft it in survival with the main
sack<00:01:08.619> cocoa<00:01:08.950> beans<00:01:09.130> and<00:01:09.340> a<00:01:09.400> book<00:01:09.610> but<00:01:10.450> anyways

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
sack cocoa beans and a book but anyways

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.600 
sack cocoa beans and a book but anyways
so<00:01:11.140> that<00:01:11.290> that's<00:01:11.470> just<00:01:11.710> sort<00:01:11.979> of<00:01:12.070> a<00:01:12.159> side<00:01:12.400> note

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
so that that's just sort of a side note

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.120 
so that that's just sort of a side note
and<00:01:13.210> so<00:01:13.900> that's<00:01:14.320> really<00:01:14.410> nice<00:01:14.710> it<00:01:14.890> has<00:01:14.980> the

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
and so that's really nice it has the

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.410 
and so that's really nice it has the
crafting<00:01:15.460> recipes<00:01:15.820> and<00:01:15.970> it<00:01:16.030> tells<00:01:16.180> you<00:01:16.300> what

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
crafting recipes and it tells you what

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.070 
crafting recipes and it tells you what
the<00:01:16.540> items<00:01:16.840> do<00:01:17.050> so<00:01:17.890> yeah<00:01:18.790> it's<00:01:18.970> not<00:01:19.030> a<00:01:19.540> part<00:01:19.990> of

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
the items do so yeah it's not a part of

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.270 
the items do so yeah it's not a part of
this<00:01:20.260> mod<00:01:20.950> itself<00:01:21.430> specifically<00:01:22.140> but<00:01:23.140> yeah<00:01:23.830> so

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
this mod itself specifically but yeah so

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.710 
this mod itself specifically but yeah so
we<00:01:24.310> have<00:01:24.520> four<00:01:24.700> time<00:01:24.880> remotes<00:01:25.180> we've<00:01:25.360> got<00:01:25.570> the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
we have four time remotes we've got the

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.840 
we have four time remotes we've got the
normal<00:01:26.350> time<00:01:26.680> remote<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:27.100> fast<00:01:27.340> remote<00:01:27.700> the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
normal time remote the fast remote the

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.870 
normal time remote the fast remote the
slow<00:01:28.060> remote<00:01:28.360> in<00:01:28.480> the<00:01:28.570> matrix<00:01:29.050> remote<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:30.460> the

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
slow remote in the matrix remote so the

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.760 
slow remote in the matrix remote so the
time<00:01:31.180> control<00:01:31.540> remote<00:01:31.840> in<00:01:32.290> this<00:01:32.410> craft<00:01:32.620> with

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
time control remote in this craft with

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.500 
time control remote in this craft with
four<00:01:32.980> golden<00:01:33.310> gets<00:01:33.490> a<00:01:33.580> button<00:01:33.880> and<00:01:34.210> four

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510

four golden gets a button and four
diamonds<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:35.980> fast<00:01:36.370> remote<00:01:36.730> is<00:01:36.940> a<00:01:37.000> time

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
diamonds the fast remote is a time

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.090 
diamonds the fast remote is a time
control<00:01:38.020> remote<00:01:38.230> with<00:01:38.380> four<00:01:38.620> sugar

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
control remote with four sugar

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.060 
control remote with four sugar
slow<00:01:39.640> is<00:01:39.970> a<00:01:40.360> time<00:01:41.170> control<00:01:41.590> remote<00:01:41.800> with<00:01:41.890> four

slow is a time control remote with four
snowballs<00:01:42.490> and<00:01:42.909> the<00:01:43.030> matrix<00:01:43.420> one<00:01:43.630> is<00:01:43.840> a<00:01:43.870> time

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
snowballs and the matrix one is a time

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.920 
snowballs and the matrix one is a time
to<00:01:44.380> pull<00:01:44.560> them<00:01:44.710> out<00:01:44.740> with<00:01:44.890> four<00:01:45.100> diamonds<00:01:45.930> so

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
to pull them out with four diamonds so

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.300 
to pull them out with four diamonds so
I'll<00:01:47.080> go<00:01:47.200> ahead<00:01:47.350> and<00:01:47.560> show<00:01:47.710> you<00:01:47.770> what<00:01:48.010> each<00:01:48.130> of

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
I'll go ahead and show you what each of

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.100 
I'll go ahead and show you what each of
these<00:01:48.430> do<00:01:48.670> unfortunately

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
these do unfortunately

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.830 
these do unfortunately
the<00:01:50.440> matrix<00:01:50.920> one<00:01:51.159> seems<00:01:51.640> to<00:01:51.820> be<00:01:52.030> a<00:01:52.060> bit<00:01:52.300> bugged

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
the matrix one seems to be a bit bugged

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.610 
the matrix one seems to be a bit bugged
a<00:01:53.110> which<00:01:53.409> is<00:01:54.310> kind<00:01:54.940> of<00:01:55.000> disappointing<00:01:55.450> but<00:01:55.840> oh

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
a which is kind of disappointing but oh

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.010 
a which is kind of disappointing but oh
well<00:01:56.979> what<00:01:57.159> can<00:01:57.190> you<00:01:57.430> do

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
well what can you do

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.690 
well what can you do
so<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.320> time<00:01:59.500> control<00:01:59.860> remote<00:02:00.430> when<00:02:00.580> you

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
so the time control remote when you

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.899 
so the time control remote when you
click<00:02:01.330> it<00:02:01.450> it'll<00:02:01.630> cycle<00:02:01.870> through<00:02:02.290> fast<00:02:02.979> slow

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
click it it'll cycle through fast slow

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.610 
click it it'll cycle through fast slow
and<00:02:04.090> normal<00:02:04.390> not<00:02:04.600> necessarily<00:02:05.260> in<00:02:05.409> that<00:02:05.440> order

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
and normal not necessarily in that order

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.240 
and normal not necessarily in that order
I<00:02:05.890> think<00:02:05.979> it<00:02:06.700> goes<00:02:07.170> slow<00:02:08.170> yeah<00:02:08.590> slow<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:09.129> then

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
I think it goes slow yeah slow and then

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.830 
I think it goes slow yeah slow and then
faster<00:02:09.670> than<00:02:09.789> normal<00:02:10.090> so<00:02:10.179> I'm<00:02:10.299> in<00:02:10.450> slow<00:02:10.659> motion

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
faster than normal so I'm in slow motion

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.199 
faster than normal so I'm in slow motion
right<00:02:11.049> now<00:02:11.110> I<00:02:11.230> just<00:02:11.349> clicked<00:02:11.739> it<00:02:11.920> and

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
right now I just clicked it and

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.430 
right now I just clicked it and
everything<00:02:13.209> in<00:02:13.299> the<00:02:13.390> game<00:02:13.569> will<00:02:13.720> go<00:02:13.840> slightly

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
everything in the game will go slightly

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.880 
everything in the game will go slightly
slower<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:16.770> I<00:02:17.770> think<00:02:18.130> this<00:02:18.819> is<00:02:18.970> at<00:02:19.150> half<00:02:19.890> speed

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
slower and I think this is at half speed

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.920 
slower and I think this is at half speed
right<00:02:21.850> now

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
right now

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.559 
right now
as<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:23.680> can<00:02:23.769> see<00:02:23.980> it's<00:02:24.519> this<00:02:25.000> really<00:02:25.209> kind<00:02:25.480> of

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
as you can see it's this really kind of

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.479 
as you can see it's this really kind of
cool<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.810> be<00:02:25.870> going<00:02:26.110> in<00:02:26.230> slow<00:02:26.500> motion<00:02:26.769> all<00:02:27.040> that

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
cool to be going in slow motion all that

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.490 
cool to be going in slow motion all that
epic<00:02:27.849> style<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:28.420> when<00:02:29.049> you<00:02:29.140> click<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.409> again

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
epic style and when you click it again

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.530 
epic style and when you click it again
you<00:02:29.980> get<00:02:30.129> a<00:02:30.159> bit<00:02:30.310> faster<00:02:30.790> so<00:02:31.209> as<00:02:31.269> you<00:02:31.390> can<00:02:31.480> see

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
you get a bit faster so as you can see

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.390 
you get a bit faster so as you can see
it<00:02:31.750> all<00:02:31.840> goes<00:02:32.019> quicker<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:32.920> it<00:02:33.159> doesn't

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
it all goes quicker and it doesn't

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.649 
it all goes quicker and it doesn't
affect<00:02:33.760> you<00:02:33.970> it<00:02:34.209> effects<00:02:34.540> mobs<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:36.760> it

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:37.659 
affect you it effects mobs and it

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:41.309 
affect you it effects mobs and it
affects<00:02:37.930> your<00:02:38.110> surroundings<00:02:38.650> as<00:02:38.799> well<00:02:39.750> so<00:02:40.750> for

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
affects your surroundings as well so for

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.039 
affects your surroundings as well so for
example<00:02:41.859> when<00:02:42.430> we<00:02:42.459> got<00:02:43.239> some<00:02:43.390> paint<00:02:43.659> he'll

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
example when we got some paint he'll

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.039 
example when we got some paint he'll
show<00:02:44.379> show<00:02:45.280> that<00:02:45.519> so<00:02:46.420> this<00:02:46.750> affects

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
show show that so this affects

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.670 
show show that so this affects
everything<00:02:47.500> in<00:02:47.829> Minecraft<00:02:48.310> down<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.680> even

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
everything in Minecraft down to even

00:02:50.680 --> 00:03:04.259 
everything in Minecraft down to even
just<00:02:51.400> on<00:02:51.609> the<00:02:51.640> cloud<00:02:58.500> well<00:02:59.500> oh<00:03:03.090> okay

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
just on the cloud well oh okay

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.539 
just on the cloud well oh okay
so<00:03:04.810> I<00:03:05.049> guess<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.440> actual<00:03:05.709> explosion<00:03:06.069> happens

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
so I guess the actual explosion happens

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:14.940 
so I guess the actual explosion happens
a<00:03:06.670> bit<00:03:06.819> later<00:03:07.030> but<00:03:08.129> the<00:03:09.510> time<00:03:10.510> towards<00:03:11.230> it<00:03:13.950> how

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
a bit later but the time towards it how

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.229 
a bit later but the time towards it how
many<00:03:15.069> times<00:03:15.250> warden<00:03:16.230> whoops<00:03:18.060> what<00:03:19.060> just

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
many times warden whoops what just

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.890 
many times warden whoops what just
happened<00:03:19.629> okay<00:03:20.560> so<00:03:21.250> here<00:03:21.790> we<00:03:21.819> have<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.510> fast

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
happened okay so here we have the fast

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.920 
happened okay so here we have the fast
remote<00:03:23.290> which<00:03:23.560> will<00:03:24.040> you<00:03:24.579> guessed<00:03:24.909> it<00:03:25.060> I<00:03:25.299> allow

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
remote which will you guessed it I allow

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.599 
remote which will you guessed it I allow
you<00:03:25.989> to<00:03:26.139> go<00:03:26.409> faster<00:03:26.799> this<00:03:26.949> time<00:03:27.010> instead<00:03:27.430> of

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
you to go faster this time instead of

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:28.979 
you to go faster this time instead of
just<00:03:27.730> going<00:03:27.879> twice<00:03:28.269> the<00:03:28.419> speed<00:03:28.629> you<00:03:28.750> can<00:03:28.840> go

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
just going twice the speed you can go

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.640 
just going twice the speed you can go
four<00:03:29.650> times<00:03:29.949> the<00:03:30.310> speed<00:03:30.639> so<00:03:31.180> you<00:03:31.480> can<00:03:31.989> be<00:03:32.230> the

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
four times the speed so you can be the

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.159 
four times the speed so you can be the
flash<00:03:32.980> or<00:03:33.400> something<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:37.540> as<00:03:37.599> you<00:03:37.690> can<00:03:37.750> see<00:03:37.810> and

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:38.169 
flash or something so as you can see and

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:41.280 
flash or something so as you can see and
this<00:03:38.409> is<00:03:38.560> just<00:03:38.650> me<00:03:38.799> walking<00:03:39.569> sprinting<00:03:40.569> is

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
this is just me walking sprinting is

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.800 
this is just me walking sprinting is
even<00:03:41.560> quicker<00:03:44.760> going<00:03:45.760> so<00:03:46.090> fast<00:03:46.269> apparently

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
even quicker going so fast apparently

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.129 
even quicker going so fast apparently
even<00:03:46.989> shows<00:03:47.169> me<00:03:47.349> whacking<00:03:48.159> the<00:03:48.870> remote<00:03:49.870> around

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
even shows me whacking the remote around

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.369 
even shows me whacking the remote around
but<00:03:51.269> yeah<00:03:52.269> so<00:03:52.510> then<00:03:52.720> when<00:03:52.930> you<00:03:52.959> click<00:03:53.139> again

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
but yeah so then when you click again

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:54.719 
but yeah so then when you click again
you<00:03:53.530> go<00:03:53.620> back<00:03:53.650> to<00:03:53.889> normal<00:03:54.069> and<00:03:54.220> then<00:03:54.370> this<00:03:54.519> one

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:54.729 
you go back to normal and then this one

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:57.439 
you go back to normal and then this one
is<00:03:54.940> my<00:03:55.090> personal<00:03:55.120> favorite<00:03:55.569> the<00:03:55.930> slow<00:03:56.319> slow<00:03:57.129> mo

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
is my personal favorite the slow slow mo

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.360 
is my personal favorite the slow slow mo
because<00:03:58.449> obviously<00:03:58.840> you<00:03:59.769> are<00:03:59.919> slow<00:04:00.159> mo<00:04:00.340> and

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
because obviously you are slow mo and

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.559 
because obviously you are slow mo and
it's<00:04:00.790> just<00:04:01.000> really<00:04:01.299> neat<00:04:02.579> just<00:04:03.579> epic<00:04:04.030> slow<00:04:04.239> mo

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
it's just really neat just epic slow mo

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.219 
it's just really neat just epic slow mo
falling<00:04:06.269> as<00:04:07.269> you<00:04:07.449> can<00:04:07.569> see<00:04:07.720> all<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:07.930> particles

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:08.229 
falling as you can see all the particles

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:10.199 
falling as you can see all the particles
are<00:04:08.530> slow<00:04:08.739> mo<00:04:08.919> -<00:04:09.069> unfortunately<00:04:09.639> the<00:04:09.790> sounds

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
are slow mo - unfortunately the sounds

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.479 
are slow mo - unfortunately the sounds
don't<00:04:10.269> go<00:04:10.540> slow-motion<00:04:11.099> that's<00:04:12.099> a<00:04:12.190> bit<00:04:12.340> of<00:04:12.430> a

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
don't go slow-motion that's a bit of a

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.409 
don't go slow-motion that's a bit of a
disappointment<00:04:13.000> but<00:04:13.299> oh<00:04:14.139> well<00:04:15.120> okay<00:04:16.120> another

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
disappointment but oh well okay another

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.990 
disappointment but oh well okay another
everything<00:04:16.599> and<00:04:17.530> then<00:04:18.130> also<00:04:18.310> you're<00:04:18.609> looking

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
everything and then also you're looking

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.680 
everything and then also you're looking
you're<00:04:19.269> turning<00:04:19.630> around<00:04:20.010> he's<00:04:21.010> in<00:04:21.690> really

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
you're turning around he's in really

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.339 
you're turning around he's in really
slow<00:04:22.900> motion<00:04:23.260> either<00:04:23.699> and<00:04:24.699> finally<00:04:25.360> last<00:04:26.139> but

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
slow motion either and finally last but

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.649 
slow motion either and finally last but
I<00:04:26.830> guess<00:04:27.580> kind<00:04:27.849> of<00:04:27.909> least<00:04:28.150> because<00:04:28.419> it's<00:04:28.570> all

00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:28.659 
I guess kind of least because it's all

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:30.839 
I guess kind of least because it's all
bugged<00:04:28.930> it's<00:04:29.380> out<00:04:29.470> for<00:04:29.740> me<00:04:29.830> at<00:04:29.919> least<00:04:30.099> is<00:04:30.340> the

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:30.849 
bugged it's out for me at least is the

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:32.430 
bugged it's out for me at least is the
matrix<00:04:31.180> or<00:04:31.360> mode<00:04:31.510> when<00:04:31.719> it's<00:04:31.930> supposed<00:04:32.200> to<00:04:32.289> be

matrix or mode when it's supposed to be
do<00:04:32.830> is<00:04:33.039> slow<00:04:33.400> down<00:04:33.430> your<00:04:33.909> surroundings<00:04:34.630> and

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
do is slow down your surroundings and

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.470 
do is slow down your surroundings and
you're<00:04:36.300> able<00:04:36.540> to<00:04:36.720> move<00:04:36.990> at<00:04:37.350> normal<00:04:37.830> speed

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
you're able to move at normal speed

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.060 
you're able to move at normal speed
however<00:04:39.480> when<00:04:39.720> I<00:04:39.750> do<00:04:39.840> this<00:04:40.110> it<00:04:40.320> just<00:04:40.350> bugs<00:04:40.950> me

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
however when I do this it just bugs me

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.510 
however when I do this it just bugs me
out<00:04:41.780> and<00:04:42.780> so<00:04:42.930> my<00:04:43.080> field<00:04:43.500> of<00:04:43.770> view<00:04:44.010> and<00:04:44.220> I<00:04:44.280> get

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
out and so my field of view and I get

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.490 
out and so my field of view and I get
really<00:04:45.030> slow<00:04:45.690> and<00:04:45.930> everything<00:04:46.200> I<00:04:46.290> do<00:04:46.350> gets

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
really slow and everything I do gets

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.760 
really slow and everything I do gets
really<00:04:47.040> slow<00:04:47.370> and<00:04:47.640> it's<00:04:49.010> all<00:04:50.630> confusing<00:04:51.770> weird

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
really slow and it's all confusing weird

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.840 
really slow and it's all confusing weird
and<00:04:53.010> I<00:04:53.040> can't<00:04:53.280> really<00:04:53.460> do<00:04:53.790> much

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
and I can't really do much

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.870 
and I can't really do much
this<00:04:56.850> needs<00:04:57.090> to<00:04:57.150> be<00:04:57.240> reversed<00:04:57.690> I<00:04:58.400> seem<00:04:59.400> to<00:04:59.670> be

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
this needs to be reversed I seem to be

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.790 
this needs to be reversed I seem to be
the<00:05:00.090> one<00:05:00.240> he's<00:05:00.720> going<00:05:00.900> really<00:05:01.200> really<00:05:01.380> slowly

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
the one he's going really really slowly

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.230 
the one he's going really really slowly
and<00:05:02.070> then<00:05:02.190> everything<00:05:02.490> else<00:05:02.580> is<00:05:02.790> going<00:05:02.850> like

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
and then everything else is going like

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.050 
and then everything else is going like
normal<00:05:04.280> so<00:05:05.280> I<00:05:05.310> don't<00:05:05.610> know<00:05:05.670> what's<00:05:05.820> up<00:05:05.910> with

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
normal so I don't know what's up with

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.930 
normal so I don't know what's up with
that<00:05:06.170> but<00:05:09.980> see<00:05:10.980> they're<00:05:11.460> going<00:05:11.580> slightly

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
that but see they're going slightly

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.140 
that but see they're going slightly
slower<00:05:12.120> too<00:05:12.390> but<00:05:12.990> I<00:05:14.570> don't<00:05:15.570> know<00:05:15.630> it's<00:05:15.780> weird

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
slower too but I don't know it's weird

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:23.210 
slower too but I don't know it's weird
it<00:05:18.150> is<00:05:18.180> really<00:05:18.690> weird<00:05:21.200> and<00:05:22.200> I<00:05:22.710> can't<00:05:22.920> seem<00:05:23.070> this

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
it is really weird and I can't seem this

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:33.740 
it is really weird and I can't seem this
small<00:05:23.700> on<00:05:24.000> the<00:05:24.360> hot<00:05:24.900> bar<00:05:25.140> very<00:05:26.040> well<00:05:26.250> I<00:05:32.750> don't

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
small on the hot bar very well I don't

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:42.820 
small on the hot bar very well I don't
want<00:05:33.870> to<00:05:33.930> pick<00:05:34.170> block<00:05:34.440> I<00:05:34.620> want<00:05:34.740> to<00:05:34.890> scroll<00:05:37.640> now

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:50.270 

I'm<00:05:43.830> just<00:05:43.950> going<00:05:44.100> super<00:05:44.460> quickly<00:05:47.630> once<00:05:49.280> okay

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
I'm just going super quickly once okay

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.010 
I'm just going super quickly once okay
see<00:05:50.580> so<00:05:50.820> the<00:05:50.910> matrix<00:05:51.300> or<00:05:51.419> mode<00:05:51.540> is<00:05:51.690> really

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
see so the matrix or mode is really

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.700 
see so the matrix or mode is really
really<00:05:52.260> really<00:05:52.470> buggy<00:05:52.800> I<00:05:54.169> have<00:05:55.169> no<00:05:55.380> clue<00:05:55.590> why

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
really really buggy I have no clue why

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.440 
really really buggy I have no clue why
oh<00:05:58.730> yeah<00:05:59.730> and<00:05:59.820> the<00:05:59.880> other<00:05:59.910> thing<00:06:00.210> is<00:06:00.330> if

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.450 
oh yeah and the other thing is if

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.270 
oh yeah and the other thing is if
entities<00:06:00.930> as<00:06:01.080> well<00:06:01.110> in<00:06:01.380> like<00:06:01.530> slow<00:06:01.830> motion<00:06:02.190> at

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
entities as well in like slow motion at

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.070 
entities as well in like slow motion at
least<00:06:02.460> it<00:06:02.940> sort<00:06:03.150> of<00:06:03.180> just<00:06:03.360> bugs<00:06:03.810> out<00:06:04.050> and

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
least it sort of just bugs out and

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.190 
least it sort of just bugs out and
starts<00:06:04.440> teleporting<00:06:05.040> around<00:06:05.340> to<00:06:05.550> get<00:06:05.669> there

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
starts teleporting around to get there

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.619 
starts teleporting around to get there
at<00:06:07.200> the<00:06:07.350> normal<00:06:07.680> time

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:10.629 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:15.279 

whoa<00:06:11.659> rapidfire<00:06:13.089> but<00:06:14.089> yeah<00:06:14.569> it's<00:06:15.050> kind<00:06:15.259> of

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:19.159 
these two got a skeleton then don't slow

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:27.129 
these two got a skeleton then don't slow
motion<00:06:19.580> and<00:06:20.169> don't<00:06:21.369> forgot<00:06:22.369> you<00:06:22.580> burn<00:06:24.819> slow<00:06:26.139> oh

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:27.139 
motion and don't forgot you burn slow oh

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:31.179 
motion and don't forgot you burn slow oh
the<00:06:27.919> arrows<00:06:28.189> aren't<00:06:28.339> going<00:06:28.580> slow-mo<00:06:30.189> well

00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:31.189 
the arrows aren't going slow-mo well

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.779 
the arrows aren't going slow-mo well
there<00:06:31.339> we<00:06:31.459> go

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:31.789 
there we go
