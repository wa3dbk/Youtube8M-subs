00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
on and so I've got a lot lot more

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.850 
on and so I've got a lot lot more
movement<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.149> if<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:46.200> one's<00:01:46.439> too<00:01:46.619> long

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
movement on it if this one's too long

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.380 
movement on it if this one's too long
then<00:01:47.250> I've<00:01:47.430> got<00:01:47.460> another<00:01:47.790> one<00:01:47.939> which<00:01:48.210> I

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
then I've got another one which I

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.219 
then I've got another one which I
normally<00:01:48.719> use<00:01:49.369> pop<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.229> you're

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
normally use pop this on and you're

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.810 
normally use pop this on and you're
going<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.439> get<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.590> lot<00:01:52.680> lot<00:01:53.130> more<00:01:53.340> movement<00:01:53.729> on

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
going to get a lot lot more movement on

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.399 
going to get a lot lot more movement on
it<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.540> it's<00:01:54.659> going<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.840> be<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.930> lot<00:01:55.079> lot<00:01:55.229> easier

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
it so it's going to be a lot lot easier

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.069 
it so it's going to be a lot lot easier
to<00:01:55.590> control<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.759> that's<00:01:57.270> how<00:01:57.450> I've<00:01:57.630> resolved

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
to control so that's how I've resolved
