00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.150
 this is why we travel from 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.850
 all life really 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.550
 and almost that you can say that 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.640
 generations my dad and my grandfather 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.860
 They traveled a lot, they value me very traveler 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.849
 in northern santander and 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.860
 name of what he was doing was going to 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.000
 recover land and we what 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.329
 we accompany from very small 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.600
 then already 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:41.239
 At the age of 19, we organized a 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.179
 forced young pure health by the 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.579
 river that knocked him down and that's how we keep doing 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:51.680
 many trips until we 've done 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:54.049
 turbid and it grew and we started doing it already 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.479
 she with him already after I went 

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:58.399
 growing and I already made the frame 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:01.609
 piece of cupcake then also with my 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:06.030
 sofa and there the subject initially started to 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:11.990
 the coast can be marvel's adventure 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.990
 and then it's already in the engine 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.560
 there is a love for its very 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.720
 big that's like between the two all 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.409
 time 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.069
 Y 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.929
 we said good let's see an america 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:28.909
 the bikes appeared to us seemed 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:32.659
 vehicles to which none of motorcycles 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:35.090
 and we started to turn the head around and 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.850
 we finish is no longer to deserve it 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.759
 we did not start with the one we did until 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.450
 Buenos Aires or the Pacific of our 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.080
 daily 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.980
 together 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.130
 by South America and now we are going to have a 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.130
 future 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.190
 as we have always said that the 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.190
 way to travel by motorcycle is 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.530
 first coming out the elements is the 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.119
 first place we have to go to 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.560
 we chose as good we will finish 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.099
 make South America and when we did it in 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.269
 the 2009 those that are missing a piece 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.819
 then we said good if we want to give 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:15.249
 continuity fear the vials 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.720
 So we have to give the rest of 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:19.180
 South America 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.130
 and that's where we chose the route and with 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.470
 the same fate that is good you know 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.470
 additional that I think that influenced 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.990
 want to make this trip that reaching 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.890
 lime the last time benefits very 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.990
 pacific 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.090
 we meet the bikers who 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:39.400
 they had turned around 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:43.269
 from Córdoba Argentina had gone up 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:46.569
 by manaos until the guaira and 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:49.450
 They went down throughout Colombia and Ecuador and did not 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.340
 we found it in Peru and from that time 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.910
 also consumed we do not talk and how rich 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.220
 make that route 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.010
 forn has announced this formal route 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.600
 and the curiosity that started 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.160
 complemented with what you said of the 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.550
 world of the desire to meet 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:10.520
 suramérica of which if we are about 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.520
 convinced that we first want to know 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.980
 the route that kind of thing and like the 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.570
 we choose very from places we want 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.250
 know that we both bring us 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.810
 they are giving as the route the highway 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.930
 it also has a linearity that you have to 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.780
 follow 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.849
 and that gives us the points we take 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.490
 a basic route that is very susceptible 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.650
 of 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.950
 modify it in this case let's leave 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.010

 the border santa elena the border of 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.340
 venezuela and brazil then we are going to 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.530
 boavista 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.500
 of sight we go until sent up there 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.690
 We have been sailing on a motorcycle 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.810
 we embark the bikes on the drama 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.959
 areas to Bethlehem that the mouth 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.540
 from the Amazon to the Atlantic 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:04.480
 We disembarked the bikes and started by 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.540
 the entire Brazilian coast more or less than 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:11.530

 Bahía Savior of Bahia Rio de Janeiro and 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.989
 from sao paulo sao paulo montevideo 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.930
 Montevideo 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.560
 do not you know that 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.560
 of the light 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.039
 I'm facing an expectation as very 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:32.669
 special on which Simon has worked 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:34.070
 is that it's seeing the city from the 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.170
 point of view 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.410
 of the residents us what 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:41.840
 we want is a little to go to the city ​​the 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.570
 people who live and for that we have to 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.520
 entering the doors that happened on the day 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.730
 previous because just to us 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.370
 even when we travel without a tour guide 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.260
 without anything the city that offered us the 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.000
 people in a tourist town came up 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.520
 the question at the same time something happens and what 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.080
 would be what would happen if we enter the 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.950
 city ​​the people what would happen if we opened 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.010
 the door 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.800
 of that question the premise of 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:10.170
 travel opening doors we want to get there 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.900
 to house people have a whole 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.850
 structure to achieve that and that's something 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.890
 it's like a chain of favors 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:20.520
 in those named if people have a 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:22.560
 friend who lives salvable fortress in 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.260
 conditioning of the city of 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.000
 Uruguay, the idea is that they put us 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.820
 in contact with that person is that 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.830
 person is willing to receive us in 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:36.180
 your house and dedicate a morning of 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:37.860
 black one day and one night to show my 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.630
 society and that is the idea that we carry 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.340
 now and that's why we support it on the 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.470
 Web page 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.740
 the whole subject so that people can 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:48.520
 offer us that so that if people 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.520
 offer everything
