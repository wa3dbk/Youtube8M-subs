00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello welcome to disabled 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:09.110
 barrier-free we are in Bremen on the 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:12.570
 always 2014 and petri and empty 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:15.120
 offers here to a multifunction 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.010
 knob as I already have a lot of 10 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.570
 about using aids in the steering wheel but 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.900
 here always something very special 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.859
 first of all hello jörg biggest i all jörg 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.900
 that must already we tell you 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.849
 Of course, in advance, what does one tell 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.140
 very hot history look the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.880
 driving aids ex factory 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.820
 tell a little something about yours 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.370
 new function system so that's one 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.149
 multifunction knob this is called 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.920
 now multifunction printer of touch and 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.710
 that is a conditional thing on one 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.320
 identification number in the driver's license ultimately 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.510
 fully reacts before 35 without releasing the 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.860
 Steering wheel all secondary functions 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.890
 that means we would have to blink 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.500
 vision horns warning lights we have to 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.020
 can control because the right hand 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.340
 or just the left hand on the gas pedal is 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.649
 if I'm just paraplegic 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.170
 and the special thing about this device is 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.060
 that is very new and the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.119
 Transmission technology is also funk and 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.260
 we have the paired with the transmitter 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.420
 So she is wireless and is just up 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.619
 funkbasis and the beautiful is just that 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.799
 she is coupled that means I have 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.799
 no possibility somewhere stöhr 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.119
 frequencies or something 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.780
 to bring in something new 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.490
 the only of these same this 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.970
 Above all we have function 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.189
 proud that we have here it 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.759
 now retrofitted to an audi and 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:42.210
 a s5 convertible with 333 hp of course 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.560
 Also nice as a vehicle, yes, too 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.540
 to convert it for the disabled 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.340
 just everyone can drive on stroke 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.700
 or just weschnitz klemm plays no 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.009
 role 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.840
 Now a question from me prevails 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.060
 says in the audi course great 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.040
 But are you open to anybody? 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.950
 Build the vehicle in each vehicle 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.570
 or new audi no we have 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.100
 basically the possibility that in 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.750
 Every vehicle to install the game 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.890
 no role at all for us 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.439
 have different electronic 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.390
 possibilities different control devices 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.200
 which we then implement there 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.180
 no problem 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.040
 and where is it produced or 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.050
 He even produces himself 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.730
 We produce ourselves that means with us 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.040
 really starts from the thought of the 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.989
 Development from production to production 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.760
 for distribution and also for the construction and the 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.440
 means we cover the complete one 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.660
 that means someone who comes to us 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.849
 gets a device what with us too 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.349
 has been developed in-house and where 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.910
 it is used everywhere in 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.950
 germany has continued in germany 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.060
 who do you still have partner water? 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.099
 support 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.569
 of course we can in 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.360
 different areas in germany 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.520
 not in 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.140
 reach the end customer on site and we 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.940
 work with a dealer network of 20 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.310
 chosen dealers and also together 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.840
 qualified and on our homepage 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.850
 one finds among partner enterprises are 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.010
 all called by name and just 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.260
 Also shown on a Germany map 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.180
 so that a end customer can see ok where 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.280
 because my partner is with petri and 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.600
 works together and he can do that 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.160
 Of course , no one gets at all 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.420
 problem 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.640
 owns your own now where can you 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.770
 Going there if we ourselves are sitting 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.510
 near frankfurt dietzenbach the 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.750
 about ten kilometers below 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.340
 frankfurt offenbacher cross and me there 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.590
 is more likely the possibility with you 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.780
 to borrow on-site system to test 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.430
 that's exactly what you can do with us 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.930
 or we also have field service that 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.910
 means we would also end customer 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.860
 and suburbs show that too 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.360
 if of course it is near at 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.950
 then showing a partner operation 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.690
 of course, the operational partner on the spot the 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.690
 but I say so in the haze 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.060
 around 150 kilometers around frankfurt 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.820
 is that is that does not matter at all 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.110
 problem of our unite also for free 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.660
 that sounds good 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.580
 Great thing necessarily come by 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.620
 at Petri Lehr or a partner company 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.660
 try the mister 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.400
 Of course that will be the hammer there 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.650
 Of course we continue to charge 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.360
 very interesting because already so 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.190
 tell that is already one 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.170
 driving aids from the factory of mercedes was 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.180
 installed as standard, that's right 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.400
 that's exactly what actually shows something 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.950
 for a competence in this device 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.380
 we are since march this year 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.660
 official supplier at mercedes benz 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.190
 and this is distributed worldwide 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.530
 components that means we are through all 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.500
 quality in quality 'instances of 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.720
 daimler 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.340
 gone and that is of course one 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.590
 flagship for us, we are proud 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.750
 of course that sounds natural 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.130
 exciting we have one soon 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.800
 huge event in the 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.580
 mercedes-benz-museum day of the people 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.310
 with disability 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.110
 It's about auto conversions also grad 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.270
 Of course it is clear that the story is clear 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.250
 because we want something present 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.650
 because mobility is put first 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.450
 also at Mercedes and is 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.640
 of course, a great thing so 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.980
 be sure to stop by either 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.690
