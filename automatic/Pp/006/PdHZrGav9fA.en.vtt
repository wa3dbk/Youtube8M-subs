00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
look for his cutback ability because I

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.130 
look for his cutback ability because I
noted<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.670> down<00:01:08.880> as<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> pro<00:01:09.420> because<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.869> felt

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
noted that down as a pro because I felt

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.420 
noted that down as a pro because I felt
as<00:01:10.290> if<00:01:10.320> he<00:01:10.950> was<00:01:11.159> able<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.729> be<00:01:11.970> very<00:01:12.000> successful

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
as if he was able to be very successful

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.670 
as if he was able to be very successful
when<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.549> came<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:15.060> picking<00:01:15.509> up<00:01:15.810> extra<00:01:15.990> yardage

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
when it came to picking up extra yardage

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.340 
when it came to picking up extra yardage
after<00:01:17.490> his<00:01:17.640> cutback<00:01:18.150> yards<00:01:18.840> after<00:01:18.990> contact

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
after his cutback yards after contact

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.520 
after his cutback yards after contact
this<00:01:20.070> was<00:01:20.220> also<00:01:20.430> something<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.970> noted<00:01:21.380> he<00:01:22.380> was<00:01:22.500> a

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
this was also something I noted he was a

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.050 
this was also something I noted he was a
player<00:01:22.830> who<00:01:23.100> he<00:01:23.310> would<00:01:23.490> get<00:01:23.610> hit<00:01:23.820> by<00:01:24.030> one

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
player who he would get hit by one

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.660 
player who he would get hit by one
defender<00:01:24.720> two<00:01:25.229> defenders<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.920> he<00:01:26.189> would<00:01:26.369> keep

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
defender two defenders and he would keep

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.270 
defender two defenders and he would keep
moving<00:01:27.299> his<00:01:27.450> feet<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:28.140> pick<00:01:28.320> up<00:01:28.500> extra<00:01:28.710> yards

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
moving his feet to pick up extra yards

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.550 
moving his feet to pick up extra yards
so<00:01:29.729> whenever<00:01:30.090> he<00:01:30.240> would<00:01:30.390> get<00:01:30.540> hit<00:01:30.780> usually<00:01:31.439> he

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
so whenever he would get hit usually he

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.469 
so whenever he would get hit usually he
wouldn't<00:01:31.799> go<00:01:31.890> down<00:01:31.920> right<00:01:32.280> away<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:33.360> was

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
wouldn't go down right away that was

you know too many bumps and bruises at

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.850 
you know too many bumps and bruises at
the<00:01:51.149> position<00:01:51.630> that's<00:01:52.020> also<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.470> good<00:01:52.619> thing

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
the position that's also a good thing

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.679 
the position that's also a good thing
now<00:01:53.009> cons<00:01:53.310> first<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.759> all<00:01:53.850> his<00:01:53.970> power<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.509> don't

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
now cons first of all his power I don't

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.020 
now cons first of all his power I don't
think<00:01:54.960> he<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.259> power<00:01:55.590> back<00:01:55.920> he's<00:01:56.640> not<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.820> guy

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
think he is a power back he's not a guy

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.550 
think he is a power back he's not a guy
who's<00:01:57.210> going<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.630> hit<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.079> mouth<00:01:58.110> I

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
who's going to hit you in the mouth I

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.170 
who's going to hit you in the mouth I
didn't<00:01:59.189> see<00:01:59.310> too<00:01:59.340> many<00:01:59.640> times<00:01:59.880> where<00:02:00.060> he<00:02:00.149> would

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
didn't see too many times where he would

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.810 
didn't see too many times where he would
lower<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.750> shoulder<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.320> kind<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.790> make<00:02:02.790> a

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
lower the shoulder to kind of make a

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.569 
lower the shoulder to kind of make a
huge<00:02:03.180> impact<00:02:03.570> on<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:04.100> defensive<00:02:05.100> back<00:02:05.310> or<00:02:05.340> a

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
huge impact on a defensive back or a

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.479 
huge impact on a defensive back or a
linebacker<00:02:06.090> just<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.840> kind<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.250> knock<00:02:08.250> them

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
linebacker just to kind of knock them

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.100 
linebacker just to kind of knock them
off<00:02:08.610> their<00:02:08.789> balance<00:02:09.000> or<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.869> know<00:02:09.959> whatever

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
off their balance or you know whatever

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.869 
off their balance or you know whatever
the<00:02:10.259> case<00:02:10.319> was<00:02:10.739> he<00:02:10.979> just<00:02:11.129> was<00:02:11.310> not<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.520> power

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
the case was he just was not a power

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.910 
the case was he just was not a power
running<00:02:12.239> back<00:02:12.480> also<00:02:12.720> his<00:02:12.930> speed

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
running back also his speed

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.670 
running back also his speed
he<00:02:14.069> ran<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.250> 449<00:02:14.970> at<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.390> 40-yard<00:02:16.140> dash<00:02:16.319> at<00:02:16.650> the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
he ran a 449 at the 40-yard dash at the

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.280 
he ran a 449 at the 40-yard dash at the
combine<00:02:17.160> but<00:02:17.490> I<00:02:17.700> felt<00:02:18.420> as<00:02:18.540> if<00:02:18.690> his<00:02:18.810> speed<00:02:19.140> was

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
combine but I felt as if his speed was

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.990 
combine but I felt as if his speed was
also<00:02:19.620> something<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:20.040> when<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.520> pop<00:02:20.730> in<00:02:20.880> the

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
also something that when you pop in the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.570 
also something that when you pop in the
tape<00:02:21.680> just<00:02:22.680> because<00:02:22.920> his<00:02:23.040> straight-line

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
tape just because his straight-line

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.420 
tape just because his straight-line
speed<00:02:23.790> is<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.209> 449<00:02:25.140> doesn't<00:02:25.680> necessarily<00:02:26.220> mean

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
speed is a 449 doesn't necessarily mean

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.490 
speed is a 449 doesn't necessarily mean
you<00:02:26.970> know<00:02:27.090> with<00:02:27.239> pads<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.900> your<00:02:28.110> helmet<00:02:28.470> and

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
you know with pads and your helmet and

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.199 
you know with pads and your helmet and
all<00:02:28.620> that<00:02:28.800> stuff<00:02:29.040> on<00:02:29.250> that<00:02:29.819> you're<00:02:29.970> gonna<00:02:30.060> be

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
all that stuff on that you're gonna be

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.850 
all that stuff on that you're gonna be
running<00:02:30.450> for<00:02:30.480> 4<00:02:30.870> 9<00:02:31.050> out<00:02:31.230> on<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.470> field<00:02:31.680> and

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
running for 4 9 out on the field and

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.550 
running for 4 9 out on the field and
that's<00:02:32.100> also<00:02:32.540> before<00:02:33.540> contact<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.319> all<00:02:34.410> that

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
that's also before contact and all that

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.740 
that's also before contact and all that
stuff<00:02:34.830> so<00:02:34.860> his<00:02:35.430> speed<00:02:35.730> could<00:02:36.150> potentially<00:02:36.660> be

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
stuff so his speed could potentially be

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.180 
stuff so his speed could potentially be
a<00:02:36.780> con<00:02:37.020> also<00:02:37.350> his<00:02:37.440> pass<00:02:37.620> protection<00:02:38.100> I<00:02:38.160> think

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
a con also his pass protection I think

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.160 
a con also his pass protection I think
this<00:02:38.489> was<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.700> weakness<00:02:38.940> as<00:02:39.239> well<00:02:39.420> he<00:02:39.930> needs<00:02:40.110> to

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
this was a weakness as well he needs to

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.650 
this was a weakness as well he needs to
work<00:02:40.410> on<00:02:40.620> being<00:02:41.430> able<00:02:41.640> to<00:02:41.790> plant<00:02:42.060> his<00:02:42.180> feet<00:02:42.390> get

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
work on being able to plant his feet get

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.170 
work on being able to plant his feet get
his<00:02:42.810> hands<00:02:43.019> on<00:02:43.170> defenders<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.160> keep<00:02:44.790> them<00:02:45.000> out

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
his hands on defenders and keep them out

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.840 
his hands on defenders and keep them out
of<00:02:45.209> his<00:02:45.510> quarterbacks<00:02:46.050> face<00:02:46.459> one<00:02:47.459> thing<00:02:47.730> I

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
of his quarterbacks face one thing I

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.460 
of his quarterbacks face one thing I
noticed<00:02:48.180> about<00:02:48.269> Sankey<00:02:48.780> is<00:02:48.870> he<00:02:49.050> would<00:02:49.170> like<00:02:49.319> to

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
noticed about Sankey is he would like to

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.090 
noticed about Sankey is he would like to
go<00:02:49.590> low<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:49.860> just<00:02:50.160> kind<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.450> dive<00:02:51.450> at

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
go low and just kind of dive at

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.250 
go low and just kind of dive at
defensive<00:02:53.100> defensive<00:02:53.790> players<00:02:54.030> legs<00:02:54.450> so<00:02:55.110> that

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
defensive defensive players legs so that

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.930 
defensive defensive players legs so that
didn't<00:02:55.500> really<00:02:55.620> work<00:02:55.739> so<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:56.280> think<00:02:56.489> sank<00:02:56.850> he

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
didn't really work so I think sank he

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.520 
didn't really work so I think sank he
needs<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.239> work<00:02:57.390> on<00:02:57.540> his<00:02:57.660> pass<00:02:57.930> protection<00:02:58.110> now

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
needs to work on his pass protection now

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.170 
needs to work on his pass protection now
his<00:02:58.680> drive<00:02:58.950> projection<00:02:59.459> I<00:02:59.549> actually<00:02:59.790> liked

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
his drive projection I actually liked

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.000 
his drive projection I actually liked
Sankey<00:03:00.540> I<00:03:00.569> liked<00:03:00.780> what<00:03:00.959> I<00:03:00.989> saw<00:03:01.049> I<00:03:01.530> think<00:03:01.920> he's

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
Sankey I liked what I saw I think he's

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.710 
Sankey I liked what I saw I think he's
gonna<00:03:02.130> be<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.280> second-round<00:03:02.730> guy<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.209> in<00:03:03.540> that

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
gonna be a second-round guy and in that

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.470 
gonna be a second-round guy and in that
37<00:03:04.319> to<00:03:04.380> 52<00:03:04.830> range<00:03:05.100> five<00:03:05.670> teams<00:03:05.970> in<00:03:06.150> that<00:03:06.239> range

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
37 to 52 range five teams in that range

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.720
