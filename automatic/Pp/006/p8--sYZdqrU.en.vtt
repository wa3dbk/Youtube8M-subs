00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
into a vertical dive from a great height

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.400 
into a vertical dive from a great height
straight<00:00:29.250> into<00:00:29.610> the<00:00:29.730> tarmac<00:00:30.210> what<00:00:31.079> should<00:00:31.290> I

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
straight into the tarmac what should I

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.909 
straight into the tarmac what should I
bring

bring

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:37.450 
bring
hello<00:00:32.340> we<00:00:32.759> will<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.000> crash<00:00:33.210> video<00:00:33.480> be<00:00:34.760> TVNZ

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
hello we will the crash video be TVNZ

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.590 
hello we will the crash video be TVNZ
yeah<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.820> think<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.149> might<00:00:39.300> have<00:00:39.330> thrown<00:00:39.570> a

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
yeah I think you might have thrown a

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.810 
yeah I think you might have thrown a
stone<00:00:39.870> edit<00:00:40.200> or<00:00:40.290> something<00:00:40.560> Barry<00:00:41.250> start<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
stone edit or something Barry start the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.840 
stone edit or something Barry start the
microwave<00:00:42.530> don't<00:00:43.530> be<00:00:43.650> a<00:00:43.680> vulture<00:00:43.950> Barry

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
microwave don't be a vulture Barry

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.640 
microwave don't be a vulture Barry
so<00:00:45.420> yeah<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> motors<00:00:46.020> looking<00:00:46.230> at<00:00:46.350> secondhand

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
so yeah the motors looking at secondhand

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.530 
so yeah the motors looking at secondhand
now<00:00:47.010> she<00:00:47.520> was<00:00:47.610> vertical<00:00:47.760> into<00:00:48.150> the<00:00:48.240> runway

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
now she was vertical into the runway

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.650 
now she was vertical into the runway
it's<00:00:48.660> pretty<00:00:48.870> impressive<00:00:49.050> on<00:00:49.350> my<00:00:49.440> site<00:00:50.390> it<00:00:51.390> did

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
it's pretty impressive on my site it did

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.560 
it's pretty impressive on my site it did
but<00:00:51.840> we<00:00:51.989> don't<00:00:52.200> know<00:00:52.320> what<00:00:52.470> caused<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:56.570> from

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
but we don't know what caused it from

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:05.329 
but we don't know what caused it from
the<00:00:57.660> drag<00:00:57.870> racing<00:01:03.920> it<00:01:04.920> could<00:01:05.040> be<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.159> tree

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
the drag racing it could be a tree

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.010 
the drag racing it could be a tree
growing<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.670> listen<00:01:05.970> um<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.720> yeah<00:01:06.899> I<00:01:06.930> was

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
growing it listen um so yeah I was

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.569 
growing it listen um so yeah I was
flowing<00:01:07.229> along<00:01:07.500> coming<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:07.920> for<00:01:08.009> approach<00:01:08.250> and

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 
flowing along coming in for approach and

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:11.599 
flowing along coming in for approach and
then<00:01:08.759> from<00:01:08.909> about<00:01:09.030> how<00:01:09.270> high<00:01:09.420> was<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.780> yeah<00:01:10.770> 70

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:11.609 
then from about how high was it yeah 70

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:14.029 
then from about how high was it yeah 70
12<00:01:11.880> CBO<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.840> pretty<00:01:13.049> high<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.469> it<00:01:13.590> just<00:01:13.770> tucked

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
12 CBO is pretty high and it just tucked

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:15.950 
12 CBO is pretty high and it just tucked
his<00:01:14.159> nose<00:01:14.340> down<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.759> went<00:01:14.969> vertically<00:01:15.509> into

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
his nose down and went vertically into

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.249 
his nose down and went vertically into
the<00:01:16.079> runway<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:17.450> it<00:01:18.450> didn't<00:01:18.719> flare<00:01:18.899> very<00:01:19.139> much

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
the runway and it didn't flare very much

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:19.730 
the runway and it didn't flare very much
do<00:01:19.439> it

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
do it

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.039 
do it
nice<00:01:20.579> oh<00:01:20.819> there<00:01:20.969> we<00:01:21.060> go<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:21.719> kind<00:01:21.960> of

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
nice oh there we go it's kind of

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.260 
nice oh there we go it's kind of
second-hand<00:01:22.350> now<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:23.459> the<00:01:23.609> next<00:01:23.639> step<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.149> to

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
second-hand now so the next step is to

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.129 
second-hand now so the next step is to
find<00:01:24.420> out<00:01:24.569> why<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.170> crashed<00:01:25.499> and<00:01:26.689> and<00:01:27.689> now<00:01:28.079> we

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:28.139 
find out why it crashed and and now we

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:30.469 
find out why it crashed and and now we
can't<00:01:28.409> doing<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.740> yet<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.850> yeah<00:01:30.060> but<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.359> have

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
can't doing it yet so yeah but this have

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.929 
can't doing it yet so yeah but this have
a<00:01:30.509> closer<00:01:30.749> look<00:01:30.899> at<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.889> props<00:01:32.490> gonna<00:01:32.729> need

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
a closer look at that props gonna need

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.029 
a closer look at that props gonna need
rebalancing<00:01:33.569> quite<00:01:33.749> severely<00:01:34.109> but<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:34.920> was

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
rebalancing quite severely but this was

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:36.289 
rebalancing quite severely but this was
a<00:01:35.069> pretty<00:01:35.219> seeking<00:01:35.609> hand<00:01:35.759> motor<00:01:35.909> anyway<00:01:36.240> see

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
a pretty seeking hand motor anyway see

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.910 
a pretty seeking hand motor anyway see
that<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:36.869> we<00:01:36.899> can<00:01:37.049> go<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.380> was<00:01:37.529> pretty<00:01:37.679> crappy

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
that so we can go that was pretty crappy

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.109 
that so we can go that was pretty crappy
see<00:01:38.609> I<00:01:38.639> think<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.909> needle<00:01:39.119> valve<00:01:39.149> might<00:01:39.569> pop

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
see I think the needle valve might pop

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.449 
see I think the needle valve might pop
the<00:01:42.119> snot<00:01:42.389> out<00:01:42.539> of<00:01:42.569> it<00:01:42.719> it's<00:01:43.380> actually<00:01:44.130> sheared

00:01:44.449 --> 00:01:44.459 
the snot out of it it's actually sheared

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:46.370 
the snot out of it it's actually sheared
off<00:01:44.609> the<00:01:44.759> bolts<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.659> hold<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.990> motor<00:01:46.170> in

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
off the bolts that hold the motor in

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.989 
off the bolts that hold the motor in
place<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.829> subject<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.520> motor<00:01:47.700> took<00:01:47.939> a

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:47.999 
place and the subject the motor took a

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:49.399 
place and the subject the motor took a
lot<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.149> impact<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.569> don't<00:01:48.810> think<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.109> motors

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
lot of impact I don't think that motors

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.800 
lot of impact I don't think that motors
going<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.619> be<00:01:49.679> too<00:01:50.369> good<00:01:50.399> anymore<00:01:50.810> the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
going to be too good anymore the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.870 
going to be too good anymore the
bearings<00:01:52.409> will<00:01:52.560> be<00:01:52.679> severely<00:01:53.099> burn<00:01:53.999> old<00:01:55.880> teams

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
bearings will be severely burn old teams

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.899 
bearings will be severely burn old teams
over<00:01:57.090> it's<00:01:57.719> not<00:01:58.429> moving<00:01:59.429> further<00:01:59.579> down<00:01:59.819> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
over it's not moving further down the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.149 
over it's not moving further down the
chain<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.119> destruction<00:02:00.709> the<00:02:01.709> beautiful

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
chain of destruction the beautiful

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.099 
chain of destruction the beautiful
hobbyking<00:02:02.490> servos<00:02:02.819> I<00:02:02.880> mean<00:02:02.999> they<00:02:03.119> look<00:02:03.959> it's

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:04.109 
hobbyking servos I mean they look it's

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:05.779 
hobbyking servos I mean they look it's
even<00:02:04.289> got<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.439> stone<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.099> they<00:02:05.549> worked

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
even got a stone in it they worked

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.480 
even got a stone in it they worked
really<00:02:05.880> well<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.479> think<00:02:07.319> was<00:02:07.529> their<00:02:07.649> fault<00:02:07.889> the

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
really well I think was their fault the

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.150 
really well I think was their fault the
receiver<00:02:08.910> here<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.119> looking<00:02:09.470> looking<00:02:10.470> not<00:02:11.009> too

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
receiver here is looking looking not too
