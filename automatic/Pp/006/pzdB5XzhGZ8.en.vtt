00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.440
 what's up guys 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.150
 now where the tank in the third channel a 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.070
 third video on the channel 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.710
 This video will show you this one. 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.730
 plugin here the gates environment 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.640
 It's a kind of portal club, but I 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.310
 I think plugin very complete type has like 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.289
 do sugar cane portal has 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.099
 awareness of the importance of lava 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.340
 I then think I played too full 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:37.380
 It's from what I already know I think 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.219
 This is more complex than it has so let's 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.320
 over there 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:48.500
 the server and I go in the plugs folder play 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:53.870
 It's ok now, let's turn on the server. 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:01:00.149
 I was connected here to close the 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:07.049
 from it I used the bank 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:16.920
 be it gay was made in 2014 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:33.110
 January new year is it has a lot of version 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:33.110
 and only that it also rotates the wheel does not 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:53.880
 there is 1.8 of nothing here 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:55.729
 the configuration is more to craft through 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.719
 of commands 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:04.880
 so let's go guys here in my 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.880
 most craft is so come 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.080
 here is the banquet brazil youtube goes 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.590
 Sign in to your twitter 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.510
 between ivaiporÃ£ the portal does not matter 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.530
 format matters nothing that a portal 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.210
 that simple 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.580
 but you can use all objects that 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.760
 your material creativity that you 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.860
 want the format you want 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.770
 everything all the way you want 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.730
 so we're going to create a portal then 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:47.020
 You're going to be the bar, I think it's 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:53.560
 I really think that's it , I'm going now. 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:03:05.130
 come here the good where the portal is bar 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:05.130
 gate 7 from opa test 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:21.120
 now you can get out of close bar let the 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:27.450
 ppi opa de aib to open test is 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:31.670
 I need to have the door opened and he's there. 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:35.250
 open by such then only exploded is 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.890
 pure while I do not have a method of 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.750
 between the portals was the creative 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.990
 entry into force of tolls 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.970
 this is not also an experiment if 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.590
 it should actually export little 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.080
 if I create the portal here on the side places 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.600
 to teleport ahead of him is seems 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.810
 that are linked to tom jobim yet 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:58.410
 you can not do this but just put 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.150
 this portal for him to teleport to 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:07.440
 here 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:15.000
 so let's go right gate bar 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:15.870
 leave now I'm going to work to go back 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.660
 on here 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:22.830
 there appeared the gunner this portal 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.570
 I found it very long. 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.980
 there it is imported grandson and we will give tone 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:36.670
 is it going to dictate bar ii 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:42.140
 the test now you will try to bar the 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:48.650
 i7 material to this headline material 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:49.610
 for example wash or create a 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.370
 washing portal 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.650
 this is a very creative thing was the guy 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:05:00.560
 will stay until as it enters the port of the 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:03.200
 nava understood is and will write material 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.530
 the available materials I will leave in the 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.110
 description but is to wash the water between 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.760
 some other sugar cane 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.670
 many possible blocks to make the 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:17.300
 portal but then this is a plugin to 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:19.580
 configuration, no need to move, that's it. 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.380
 A compliment then everyone who can 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:26.350
 write apply promotion clicks 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.350
 in the video who can do it then I went
