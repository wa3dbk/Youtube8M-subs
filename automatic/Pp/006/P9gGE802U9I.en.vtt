00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.410
 well here we are to see how to do 

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:08.290
 this structure we already saw how to do the 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.150
 closed circle based on hips or in 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.789
 magic ring base now let's do 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.320
 this other one that remains with the gap in the 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:16.810
 we can do it in the size that 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.609
 are the totals of today a basic one 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.619
 but it can be a lot bigger if 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:22.330
 they want or a little more closed this is 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.099
 to everyone's taste and according to 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.289
 employer who is doing or inventing 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:29.450
 well first let's see the chain 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.280
 as we did before with the previous 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.970
 we are going to have the amount of chains that 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.330
 we want 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.790
 that number of chains is going to be the 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.530
 perimeter of the inner circle yes 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.020
 remember in the primary the perimeter 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.270
 of the perimeter is the entire circumference 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:51.020
 and the long then we're going to weave by 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:53.360
 example 1 2 3 4 5 6 for example 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.910
 once we have this what are we going to 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.970
 to do is to unite what 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.670
 if this is going to give us the ring of 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.670
 center then there one chooses the 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.470
 number of chains they use and what 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.810
 let's do let's go to the 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.310
 first chain and this is like a 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.010
 kind of dog that bites its tail 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.670
 so we see the head snail here good goes 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.650
 to go there 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.350
 and with a pointer again we close there and 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.229
 we have a ring now this ring 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.290
 just like before we are going to knit you points 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.430
 above 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:36.250
 until it is completely full then 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.250
 let's knit 12 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.080
 Four. Five 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:51.650
 78 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.650
 9 10 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.950
 to 10 for example if I put more together I'll 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.890
 to reach more points and in the first 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.909
 point where the first spiritist is 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:09.429
 we close with a dwarf point and see there 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:12.770
 there is the circle with the center open 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:17.870
 they see that it is very easy this is the way 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:21.530
 easier and in this case the circle 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.050
 open in the difference between 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.110
 chains or the magic ring is not so much 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.780
 let's say no more or less are achieved 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.570
 prolixity or what it is that when 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.760
 we are inventing a pattern to 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.560
 Sometimes it happens that the magic ring 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.900
 allows you to close it to the place where 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.200
 we want instead in this case we have 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.060
 to know in advance how much of 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.040
 chains we have to lay the foundation for 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.640
 that gives us the amount of points that 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.680
 they go up then this differs in 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.020
 what are we doing 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.200
 lets go see it 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.360
 how to do it with the magic ring it 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.670
 imagine that it is almost the same as the 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.740
 above but I'll show 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.740
 let's make the magic ring 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.670
 and remember that this is and weak and 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:14.609
 let's weave over the ring first 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.079
 a chain to secure it and now 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.780
 let's weave the amount of points that 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:22.400
 we want for example ten or twelve or 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.300
 fifteen the amount of grams 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.960
 12 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.960
 3 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.920
 Four. Five 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.930
 and this 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.780
 8 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.500
 9 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.660
 and 10 for example the particularity of 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.290
 magic ring is that if I want what 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.290
 I can close there 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.280
 or I can reopen it and say no 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.400
 I want more points then I go back to 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:04:01.739
 throw 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:01.739
 and continued weaving until 11 12 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:10.620
 14 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:13.549
 15 for example let's do it up to 15 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.549
 we look 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:22.320
 and we stop there on the center 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.030
 little hole what is good is that 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.880
 we can load the amount of points that 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.530
 we want and we're never going to have to know 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.020
 in advance how many chains 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.630
 we have to ride then that will give us 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.760
 freedom when we are creating things 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.050
 new 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.740
 and just as we always do 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.180
 we close 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.180
 with a point and nagano 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:49.589
 in the first good point these are all 

00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:52.709
 the ways to start a fabric 

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:56.639
 circulate whenever we talk about media 

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:58.979
 points and a perfect circle 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.899
 obviously there are many variants how 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:02.489
 let's see the next one let's start 

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:04.919
 with a great one and it 's what you do with 

00:05:02.489 --> 00:05:10.049
 twists and have form are actually 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:11.369
 square and it 's what squares but if 

00:05:10.049 --> 00:05:13.739
 do with this weaving technique 

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:15.839
 circular there is also another way to weave 

00:05:13.739 --> 00:05:17.399
 what is called spiral fabric that is 

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:20.009
 basically the same thing but instead of 

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:21.809
 close the round we continue weaving in 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:23.699
 fairy spiral shape and it never closes 

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:25.649
 but we're going to see that in the 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:27.839
 next tutorials I hope there's 

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:30.719
 it became clear if something was not understood by 

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:33.629
 please comment and if it was understood and 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:36.479
 liked the video also comment and put 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:37.679
 I love how much you liked it so I can 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:41.309
 tell them what are the next ones 

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:43.729
 tutorials that we are going to do and can 

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:46.339
 prevent me from even doing things 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.809
 so I wait for your comments your 

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:51.249
 subscriptions and see you next 

00:05:47.809 --> 00:05:51.249
 bye bye
