00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.730 
a suggestion of doing a template out of
wood<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:19.230> I'm<00:00:19.380> gonna<00:00:19.560> try<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.359> cut<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.660> in<00:00:22.410> the

wood so I'm gonna try to cut that in the
plywood<00:00:23.779> and<00:00:24.779> then<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:25.109> use<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.920> plywood<00:00:26.340> as

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
plywood and then you use the plywood as

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.750 
plywood and then you use the plywood as
a<00:00:26.490> template<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.380> cut<00:00:28.380> my<00:00:28.650> hole<00:00:28.920> in<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.519> top<00:00:29.730> of

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
a template to cut my hole in the top of

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.359 
a template to cut my hole in the top of
the<00:00:29.939> case<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.480> then<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.260> can<00:00:31.439> use<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.590> pilot<00:00:32.130> as

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
the case and then I can use a pilot as

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.100 
the case and then I can use a pilot as
well<00:00:33.410> when<00:00:34.410> I'm<00:00:34.620> using<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.610> router<00:00:35.820> bit<00:00:36.120> on<00:00:36.540> my

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
well when I'm using the router bit on my

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:50.920 
well when I'm using the router bit on my
dream<00:00:37.320> own<00:00:37.469> pool

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930

to<00:01:41.350> see<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:43.450> line<00:01:43.660> that<00:01:44.110> I<00:01:44.140> drew

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
to see the the line that I drew

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:51.360 
to see the the line that I drew
mm-hmm<00:01:48.690> last<00:01:49.690> time<00:01:49.930> we<00:01:50.140> cut<00:01:50.410> we<00:01:50.770> could<00:01:50.980> kind<00:01:51.280> of

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
mm-hmm last time we cut we could kind of

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.400 
mm-hmm last time we cut we could kind of
swing<00:01:51.640> wide<00:01:51.880> but<00:01:52.270> I<00:01:52.510> got<00:01:52.840> to<00:01:52.960> be<00:01:53.050> more<00:01:53.230> careful

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
swing wide but I got to be more careful

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.030 
swing wide but I got to be more careful
this<00:01:53.740> time

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
this time

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.770 
this time
yep<00:01:54.430> so<00:01:55.180> I<00:01:55.450> might<00:01:56.380> not<00:01:57.060> mess<00:01:58.060> with<00:01:58.090> that<00:01:58.570> I

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
yep so I might not mess with that I

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:33.620 
yep so I might not mess with that I
might<00:01:58.990> just<00:01:59.290> Dremel<00:01:59.740> it<00:01:59.830> out

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.180 

seems<00:02:34.630> like<00:02:34.840> it's<00:02:35.020> splintering<00:02:35.530> up<00:02:35.770> kind<00:02:36.130> of

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
seems like it's splintering up kind of

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.000 
seems like it's splintering up kind of
in<00:02:36.280> places<00:02:36.820> like<00:02:36.850> that<00:02:37.650> miss<00:02:38.650> Blair

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
in places like that miss Blair

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.700 
in places like that miss Blair
yeah<00:02:39.460> yeah<00:02:39.940> it's<00:02:40.150> just<00:02:40.360> like<00:02:40.540> flaking<00:02:41.080> out<00:02:41.410> and

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
yeah yeah it's just like flaking out and

00:02:41.710 --> 00:03:15.300 
yeah yeah it's just like flaking out and
I<00:02:41.740> don't<00:02:41.830> know<00:02:42.070> what's<00:02:42.250> awesome<00:02:42.520> there

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:04:03.420 

so<00:03:16.310> now<00:03:16.490> put<00:03:17.120> some<00:03:17.330> holes<00:03:18.140> for<00:03:18.470> the<00:03:18.560> screws

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.550 

looks<00:04:04.430> okay<00:04:04.820> other<00:04:04.970> than<00:04:05.210> that<00:04:05.360> mm-hmm

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
looks okay other than that mm-hmm

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.030 
looks okay other than that mm-hmm
and<00:04:07.100> again<00:04:07.460> other<00:04:07.730> than<00:04:07.880> the<00:04:08.570> pink<00:04:09.040> there's

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
and again other than the pink there's

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.500 
and again other than the pink there's
not<00:04:10.190> many<00:04:10.280> interesting<00:04:10.760> things<00:04:11.000> to<00:04:11.150> look<00:04:11.330> at

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
not many interesting things to look at

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.800 
not many interesting things to look at
through<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:11.840> top<00:04:12.050> I<00:04:13.330> mean<00:04:14.330> you<00:04:14.480> don't<00:04:14.570> really

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
what can I see at the top of the case

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.310 
what can I see at the top of the case

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
top of your computer case that might be

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.170 
top of your computer case that might be
an<00:04:45.200> interesting<00:04:45.350> effect<00:04:46.600> yeah<00:04:48.700> so<00:04:49.700> once<00:04:50.000> we
