00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
starting to enjoy the relaxed melodies

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.699

of this LP is definitely not deafening I
would<00:03:36.739> almost<00:03:36.890> say<00:03:37.100> it's<00:03:37.310> ambient<00:03:38.000> if<00:03:38.120> the

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
would almost say it's ambient if the

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.150 
would almost say it's ambient if the
songs<00:03:38.510> weren't<00:03:38.810> so<00:03:39.049> engaging<00:03:39.500> and<00:03:39.890> I'm<00:03:40.010> really

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
songs weren't so engaging and I'm really

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.580 
songs weren't so engaging and I'm really
starting<00:03:40.430> to<00:03:40.610> enjoy<00:03:40.850> the<00:03:41.209> hooks<00:03:41.420> to<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:42.320> heavy

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590

the<00:03:45.980> lyrics<00:03:46.190> a<00:03:46.579> little<00:03:46.820> difficult<00:03:47.480> from<00:03:48.049> time

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
the lyrics a little difficult from time

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.580 
the lyrics a little difficult from time
to<00:03:48.590> time<00:03:48.620> however<00:03:49.430> I<00:03:49.700> think<00:03:50.120> the<00:03:50.329> mood<00:03:50.750> of<00:03:51.049> this

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
to time however I think the mood of this

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.300 
to time however I think the mood of this
album<00:03:51.859> is<00:03:52.220> actually<00:03:52.459> more<00:03:53.030> important<00:03:53.750> than

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
album is actually more important than

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.400 
album is actually more important than
understanding<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.459> words<00:03:55.760> in<00:03:56.209> the<00:03:56.630> songs<00:03:56.930> and

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
understanding the words in the songs and

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.170 
understanding the words in the songs and
I<00:03:57.530> think<00:03:57.560> I<00:03:57.829> pretty<00:03:58.010> much<00:03:58.130> owe<00:03:58.340> my<00:03:58.640> enjoyment

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
I think I pretty much owe my enjoyment

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.840 
I think I pretty much owe my enjoyment
of<00:03:59.570> this<00:03:59.780> album<00:04:00.079> to<00:04:00.500> several<00:04:00.859> tracks<00:04:01.190> that<00:04:01.609> on

to<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.199> point<00:04:52.380> where<00:04:52.620> it<00:04:52.740> hurts<00:04:52.979> my<00:04:53.250> ears<00:04:53.550> if<00:04:53.699> I

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
to the point where it hurts my ears if I

turn<00:04:54.090> it<00:04:54.270> up<00:04:54.360> loud<00:04:55.759> maybe<00:04:56.759> it's<00:04:57.000> intentional

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
turn it up loud maybe it's intentional

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.029 
turn it up loud maybe it's intentional
but<00:04:57.900> that<00:04:58.020> doesn't<00:04:58.289> mean<00:04:58.380> I<00:04:58.440> have<00:04:58.650> to<00:04:58.680> like<00:04:59.009> it

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
but that doesn't mean I have to like it

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:01.969 
but that doesn't mean I have to like it
but<00:04:59.970> still<00:05:00.270> this<00:05:00.509> is<00:05:00.630> a<00:05:00.660> really<00:05:00.990> solid<00:05:01.350> release
