the bucket truck in and I'm gonna hang
see<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.230> plywood<00:01:01.500> there<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.340> goes<00:01:02.489> along

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
see that plywood there that goes along

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.530 
see that plywood there that goes along
the<00:01:02.940> bottom<00:01:04.640> I'm<00:01:05.640> gonna<00:01:05.820> hang<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.150> rest<00:01:06.270> of

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
the bottom I'm gonna hang the rest of

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.399 
the bottom I'm gonna hang the rest of
these<00:01:06.720> I'm<00:01:07.650> glad<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.040> waited<00:01:09.049> but<00:01:10.049> it's<00:01:10.200> now

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
these I'm glad I waited but it's now

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.780 
these I'm glad I waited but it's now
time<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:11.060> to<00:01:12.060> put<00:01:12.240> these<00:01:12.450> in<00:01:13.430> which<00:01:14.430> will<00:01:14.610> tie

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
time to to put these in which will tie

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.410 
time to to put these in which will tie
this<00:01:15.060> beam<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.390> this<00:01:15.810> beam<00:01:16.080> together<00:01:17.060> then<00:01:18.060> I

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
this beam and this beam together then I

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.249 
this beam and this beam together then I
can<00:01:18.540> build<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.229> wall<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.860> here<00:01:20.130> 2x4<00:01:20.970> wall<00:01:21.259> that

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
can build a wall in here 2x4 wall that

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.640 
can build a wall in here 2x4 wall that
will<00:01:22.439> run<00:01:22.740> up<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.540> beam<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.020> then<00:01:25.530> I'll

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
will run up to that beam and then I'll

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.060 
will run up to that beam and then I'll
be<00:01:25.799> able<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.009> tie<00:01:26.610> these<00:01:26.670> together<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:28.070> make

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
be able to tie these together and make

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.929 
be able to tie these together and make
this<00:01:29.430> beam<00:01:30.060> connect<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.110> beam<00:01:31.939> so

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
this beam connect to that beam so

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.370 
this beam connect to that beam so
essentially<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:33.540> beam<00:01:33.810> will<00:01:34.020> connect<00:01:34.290> to

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
essentially this beam will connect to

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.630 
essentially this beam will connect to
this<00:01:34.500> beam<00:01:34.770> which<00:01:35.040> will<00:01:35.130> connect<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.490> this

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
this beam which will connect to this

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.490 
this beam which will connect to this
beam<00:01:35.909> will<00:01:36.090> connect<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.600> beam<00:01:36.869> that's

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
beam will connect to that beam that's

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.130 
beam will connect to that beam that's
pretty<00:01:37.710> crazy<00:01:38.030> it's<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.090> lot<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.360> 2<00:01:39.509> by<00:01:39.689> 12<00:01:39.990> by

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
pretty crazy it's a lot of 2 by 12 by

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.359 
pretty crazy it's a lot of 2 by 12 by
20s<00:01:40.500> but<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.610> I'm<00:01:42.320> I'm<00:01:43.320> basically<00:01:43.890> borrowing

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
20s but so I'm I'm basically borrowing

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.340 
20s but so I'm I'm basically borrowing
the<00:01:44.700> strength<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.420> all<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.590> my<00:01:46.740> beams<00:01:48.350> I'm

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
the strength of all of my beams I'm

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.859 
the strength of all of my beams I'm
letting<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.399> share<00:01:50.790> its<00:01:51.000> strength<00:01:51.360> with<00:01:51.659> this

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
letting it share its strength with this

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:59.569 
letting it share its strength with this
one<00:01:52.280> huge<00:01:54.200> big<00:01:55.200> square<00:01:56.030> so<00:01:57.890> these<00:01:58.890> floors<00:01:59.280> law

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
one huge big square so these floors law

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.100 
one huge big square so these floors law
and<00:01:59.850> there<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.240> roof<00:02:00.390> rafters<00:02:00.570> will<00:02:00.960> all

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
and there and the roof rafters will all

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.530 
and there and the roof rafters will all
share<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.560> load<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.640> that's<00:02:02.969> pretty<00:02:03.149> cool

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
share the load so that's pretty cool

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.279 
share the load so that's pretty cool
I<00:02:03.570> like<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:04.310> so

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
I like that so

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:13.449 
I like that so
I<00:02:07.149> put<00:02:08.149> plywood<00:02:09.050> up<00:02:09.379> here<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:12.290> I've<00:02:13.069> started

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
I put plywood up here and I've started

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:20.140 
I put plywood up here and I've started
to<00:02:13.670> do<00:02:13.849> it<00:02:13.970> on<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.150> other<00:02:14.239> side<00:02:18.790> so<00:02:19.790> again

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
to do it on the other side so again

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.970 
to do it on the other side so again
whenever<00:02:21.050> you're<00:02:21.319> working<00:02:21.410> with<00:02:21.709> sheet

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
whenever you're working with sheet

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.190 
whenever you're working with sheet
materials<00:02:22.610> it's<00:02:22.849> nearly<00:02:23.150> impossible<00:02:23.599> to<00:02:24.050> do

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
materials it's nearly impossible to do

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.290 
materials it's nearly impossible to do
it<00:02:24.319> alone<00:02:24.500> so<00:02:25.810> what<00:02:26.810> I've<00:02:26.989> done<00:02:27.370> since<00:02:28.370> Stahl

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
it alone so what I've done since Stahl

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.500 
it alone so what I've done since Stahl
the<00:02:29.510> ledger<00:02:29.810> board<00:02:30.489> on<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:31.910> bottom<00:02:32.239> of<00:02:32.330> the

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
the ledger board on the bottom of the

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.220 
the ledger board on the bottom of the
beam<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:34.030> that<00:02:35.030> way<00:02:35.180> I<00:02:35.239> can<00:02:35.390> set<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.840> plywood

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
beam and that way I can set the plywood

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.229 
beam and that way I can set the plywood
on<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.379> this<00:02:36.709> one's<00:02:36.980> not<00:02:37.160> even<00:02:37.220> tacked<00:02:37.730> in<00:02:37.940> yet

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
the only thing on this upper floor was

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.379 
the only thing on this upper floor was
the<00:03:18.109> fourth<00:03:18.380> floor<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:19.010> I<00:03:19.609> put<00:03:19.850> in<00:03:19.970> all<00:03:20.209> the

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
the fourth floor and I put in all the

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:22.449 
the fourth floor and I put in all the
beams<00:03:20.660> all<00:03:21.109> the<00:03:21.260> upper<00:03:21.560> posts<00:03:22.040> all<00:03:22.220> these

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
beams all the upper posts all these

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.449 
beams all the upper posts all these
pieces<00:03:22.700> of<00:03:23.000> plywood<00:03:23.590> and<00:03:24.590> this<00:03:24.889> wall<00:03:25.160> that<00:03:25.190> I'm

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
pieces of plywood and this wall that I'm

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.220 
pieces of plywood and this wall that I'm
building<00:03:25.700> here<00:03:25.880> so<00:03:26.120> these<00:03:26.690> studs<00:03:27.019> were

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
building here so these studs were

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.949 
building here so these studs were
basically<00:03:27.560> put<00:03:27.859> in<00:03:27.980> there<00:03:28.190> kind<00:03:28.790> of<00:03:28.940> just<00:03:29.420> to

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
basically put in there kind of just to

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.349 
basically put in there kind of just to
hold<00:03:30.170> the<00:03:30.350> seams<00:03:30.709> of<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.250> plywood<00:03:31.489> I<00:03:31.970> mean

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
hold the seams of the plywood I mean

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:34.090 
hold the seams of the plywood I mean
they're<00:03:32.510> not<00:03:32.600> really<00:03:32.660> holding<00:03:33.530> any<00:03:33.709> strength

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
they're not really holding any strength

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.420 
they're not really holding any strength
or<00:03:34.340> holding<00:03:34.940> any<00:03:35.150> you<00:03:35.480> know<00:03:36.250> holding<00:03:37.250> anything

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
or holding any you know holding anything

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.190 
or holding any you know holding anything
up<00:03:37.700> so<00:03:38.500> I<00:03:39.500> would<00:03:40.430> argue<00:03:40.609> if<00:03:40.970> if<00:03:41.630> those<00:03:41.989> are

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
up so I would argue if if those are

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.640 
up so I would argue if if those are
actually<00:03:42.680> necessary<00:03:43.389> but<00:03:44.389> they're<00:03:45.170> in<00:03:45.350> there

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
actually necessary but they're in there

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.250 
actually necessary but they're in there
so<00:03:47.769> this<00:03:48.769> gave<00:03:49.280> me<00:03:49.549> I<00:03:50.060> built<00:03:50.750> that<00:03:50.959> basically

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
so this gave me I built that basically

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.440 
so this gave me I built that basically
this<00:03:51.470> humongous<00:03:52.220> square<00:03:52.730> in<00:03:52.940> the<00:03:53.030> middle<00:03:53.060> two

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
this humongous square in the middle two

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.849 
this humongous square in the middle two
humongous<00:03:53.989> squares<00:03:54.290> in<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:54.500> middle<00:03:54.739> of<00:03:54.799> the

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
humongous squares in the middle of the

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.339 
humongous squares in the middle of the
garage<00:03:55.099> that<00:03:55.130> have<00:03:55.790> just<00:03:56.180> an<00:03:56.420> unbelievable

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
garage that have just an unbelievable

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.559 
garage that have just an unbelievable
amount<00:03:57.440> of<00:03:57.709> strength<00:03:58.040> tying<00:03:58.819> all<00:03:59.030> those<00:03:59.209> beams

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
amount of strength tying all those beams

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.400 
amount of strength tying all those beams
together<00:04:01.359> so<00:04:02.359> I'm<00:04:02.720> definitely<00:04:03.079> not<00:04:03.139> worried

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
together so I'm definitely not worried

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.309 
together so I'm definitely not worried
about<00:04:03.530> that<00:04:03.829> part<00:04:04.130> of<00:04:04.160> the<00:04:04.250> garage<00:04:04.430> being

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
about that part of the garage being

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.890 
about that part of the garage being
being<00:04:06.319> wobbly<00:04:06.919> at<00:04:07.010> all<00:04:07.130> so<00:04:07.519> here<00:04:08.269> I<00:04:08.299> am<00:04:08.540> on<00:04:08.810> the

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
being wobbly at all so here I am on the

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.720 
being wobbly at all so here I am on the
other<00:04:08.930> side<00:04:09.260> putting<00:04:09.739> all<00:04:09.859> the<00:04:09.980> studs<00:04:10.250> in<00:04:10.430> and

other side putting all the studs in and

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.849 
other side putting all the studs in and
then<00:04:10.849> I<00:04:10.910> go<00:04:11.090> around<00:04:11.209> up<00:04:11.540> top<00:04:11.750> here<00:04:12.260> we<00:04:12.440> are<00:04:12.560> and

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:12.859
