you'll<00:04:22.500> see<00:04:22.710> other<00:04:22.979> than<00:04:23.190> on<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.340> first<00:04:23.700> floor

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
you'll see other than on the first floor

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.310 
you'll see other than on the first floor
will<00:04:24.120> visit<00:04:24.390> that<00:04:24.539> later<00:04:24.780> but<00:04:24.960> there's<00:04:25.169> one

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
will visit that later but there's one

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.660 
will visit that later but there's one
just<00:04:25.710> like<00:04:25.950> it

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
just like it

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.740 
just like it
underneath<00:04:27.210> this<00:04:27.480> on<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:28.350> first<00:04:28.620> floor<00:04:29.750> so

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
underneath this on the first floor so

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.350 
underneath this on the first floor so
let's<00:04:31.230> make<00:04:31.770> our<00:04:31.950> way<00:04:31.980> down<00:04:32.190> stairs<00:04:33.000> and<00:04:33.300> out

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
let's make our way down stairs and out

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.820 
let's make our way down stairs and out
and<00:04:33.570> I'm<00:04:33.660> going<00:04:33.810> to<00:04:33.900> keep<00:04:34.050> the<00:04:34.290> camera<00:04:34.740> rolling

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
and I'm going to keep the camera rolling

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.520 
and I'm going to keep the camera rolling
so<00:04:35.610> we<00:04:35.760> can<00:04:36.000> look<00:04:36.420> at<00:04:36.540> all<00:04:36.690> these<00:04:36.840> rooms<00:04:37.230> a

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
so we can look at all these rooms a

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.740 
so we can look at all these rooms a
second<00:04:38.130> time<00:04:38.400> and<00:04:38.790> from<00:04:39.390> a<00:04:39.480> different

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
second time and from a different

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.890 
second time and from a different
perspective<00:04:40.970> you'll<00:04:41.970> notice<00:04:42.300> it's<00:04:42.810> almost

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
perspective you'll notice it's almost

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.190 
perspective you'll notice it's almost
difficult<00:04:43.380> to<00:04:44.010> see<00:04:44.430> where<00:04:44.640> the<00:04:44.990> stairways<00:04:45.990> are

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
difficult to see where the stairways are

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.380 
difficult to see where the stairways are
at<00:04:46.320> times<00:04:46.560> because<00:04:46.980> you<00:04:47.790> know<00:04:47.910> we<00:04:48.120> don't<00:04:48.270> have

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
at times because you know we don't have

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.560 
at times because you know we don't have
any<00:04:49.340> unique<00:04:50.340> lighting<00:04:50.670> in<00:04:50.970> here<00:04:51.000> but<00:04:51.330> once<00:04:51.480> you

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
any unique lighting in here but once you

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.240 
any unique lighting in here but once you
have<00:04:51.690> your<00:04:51.810> decorations<00:04:52.470> up<00:04:52.710> and<00:04:52.890> you<00:04:53.040> have

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
have your decorations up and you have

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.060 
have your decorations up and you have
some<00:04:53.760> lighting<00:04:54.450> that's<00:04:54.870> casting<00:04:55.350> shadows<00:04:55.620> and

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
some lighting that's casting shadows and

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.860 
some lighting that's casting shadows and
stuff<00:04:56.280> like<00:04:56.460> that<00:04:56.520> this<00:04:57.150> whole<00:04:57.360> area<00:04:57.630> is<00:04:57.690> going

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
stuff like that this whole area is going

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.670 
stuff like that this whole area is going
to<00:04:57.930> warm<00:04:58.260> up<00:04:58.440> and<00:04:58.650> pop<00:04:58.920> really<00:04:59.340> nice<00:04:59.520> and

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
to warm up and pop really nice and

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.140 
to warm up and pop really nice and
here's<00:05:01.680> another<00:05:01.800> brief<00:05:02.160> look<00:05:02.400> at<00:05:02.580> one<00:05:02.880> of<00:05:03.030> the

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
here's another brief look at one of the

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.300 
here's another brief look at one of the
second-floor<00:05:03.870> rooms<00:05:04.320> which<00:05:04.650> apparently<00:05:05.100> I

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
second-floor rooms which apparently I

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.510 
second-floor rooms which apparently I
got<00:05:05.550> lost<00:05:05.760> and<00:05:06.030> on<00:05:06.690> my<00:05:06.900> way<00:05:07.050> out<00:05:07.400> jumped<00:05:08.400> into

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
got lost and on my way out jumped into

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.910 
got lost and on my way out jumped into
and<00:05:08.880> here's<00:05:09.540> the<00:05:09.660> front<00:05:09.840> door<00:05:10.020> so<00:05:10.320> let's<00:05:10.500> exit

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
and here's the front door so let's exit

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.180 
and here's the front door so let's exit
the<00:05:11.010> front<00:05:11.220> door<00:05:11.430> and<00:05:12.530> take<00:05:13.530> a<00:05:13.590> look<00:05:13.890> at<00:05:14.040> this

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
the front door and take a look at this

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.210 
the front door and take a look at this
structure<00:05:14.910> from<00:05:15.060> the<00:05:15.240> outside<00:05:15.860> now<00:05:16.860> we<00:05:16.920> have

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
structure from the outside now we have

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.710 
structure from the outside now we have
some<00:05:17.520> torches<00:05:17.820> here<00:05:18.120> that<00:05:18.270> we<00:05:18.360> can<00:05:18.480> light<00:05:18.690> up

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
some torches here that we can light up

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.170 
some torches here that we can light up
which<00:05:19.710> is<00:05:19.830> pretty<00:05:20.010> cool<00:05:20.600> and<00:05:22.670> that<00:05:23.670> probably

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
which is pretty cool and that probably

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.750 
which is pretty cool and that probably
comes<00:05:24.300> in<00:05:24.510> really<00:05:24.690> nice<00:05:25.080> at<00:05:25.320> night<00:05:25.530> time<00:05:25.800> be

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
comes in really nice at night time be

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.890 
comes in really nice at night time be
interesting<00:05:26.910> if<00:05:27.270> we<00:05:27.360> can<00:05:27.510> put<00:05:27.630> them<00:05:27.750> on<00:05:27.870> a

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
interesting if we can put them on a

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.400 
interesting if we can put them on a
timer<00:05:28.230> of<00:05:28.440> sorts<00:05:29.480> let's<00:05:30.480> take<00:05:30.660> a<00:05:30.720> quick<00:05:31.110> jog

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
timer of sorts let's take a quick jog

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.440 
timer of sorts let's take a quick jog
around<00:05:31.620> the<00:05:31.860> building<00:05:32.340> and<00:05:32.490> you'll<00:05:33.090> notice

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
around the building and you'll notice

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.900 
around the building and you'll notice
that<00:05:33.480> it<00:05:33.810> has<00:05:33.840> a<00:05:33.960> huge<00:05:34.350> footprint<00:05:34.890> and<00:05:35.130> almost

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
that it has a huge footprint and almost

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.210 
that it has a huge footprint and almost
comes<00:05:36.300> out<00:05:36.510> to<00:05:37.200> the<00:05:37.350> wall<00:05:37.530> making<00:05:37.890> it<00:05:38.070> on

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
comes out to the wall making it on

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.630 
comes out to the wall making it on
almost<00:05:38.790> zero<00:05:39.450> lot<00:05:39.810> line<00:05:39.860> property<00:05:40.860> but<00:05:41.490> that's

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
almost zero lot line property but that's

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.190 
almost zero lot line property but that's
okay<00:05:41.940> that<00:05:42.120> that<00:05:42.450> means<00:05:42.630> that<00:05:42.810> there's<00:05:42.960> a<00:05:43.020> lot

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 
okay that that means that there's a lot

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.080 
okay that that means that there's a lot
more<00:05:43.260> space<00:05:43.740> inside<00:05:43.950> and<00:05:44.250> here's<00:05:44.430> that<00:05:44.640> first

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
more space inside and here's that first

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.790 
more space inside and here's that first
floor<00:05:45.570> deck<00:05:45.930> that<00:05:46.110> I<00:05:46.140> was<00:05:46.290> talking<00:05:46.440> about

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
floor deck that I was talking about
