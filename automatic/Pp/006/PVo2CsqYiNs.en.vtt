choose full crown Victorian scepter just
gets<00:00:37.910> a<00:00:37.970> bit<00:00:38.000> tougher<00:00:38.510> even<00:00:38.930> though<00:00:39.020> it<00:00:39.079> might

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
gets a bit tougher even though it might

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.180 
gets a bit tougher even though it might
be<00:00:39.260> a<00:00:39.350> bit<00:00:39.500> harder<00:00:39.739> to<00:00:39.800> handle

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
be a bit harder to handle

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.700 
be a bit harder to handle
so<00:00:40.850> this<00:00:41.000> is<00:00:41.090> a<00:00:41.180> hop<00:00:41.510> shoot<00:00:41.810> then<00:00:42.050> and<00:00:42.290> it's<00:00:42.500> set

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
so this is a hop shoot then and it's set

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.440 
so this is a hop shoot then and it's set

this<00:00:44.540> at<00:00:44.660> night<00:00:44.899> it<00:00:45.140> makes<00:00:45.320> it<00:00:45.500> a<00:00:45.530> bit<00:00:45.649> more

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
this at night it makes it a bit more
