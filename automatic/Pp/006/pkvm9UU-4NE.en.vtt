00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
with air but I thought I would just use

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.020 
with air but I thought I would just use
a<00:00:31.289> rubber<00:00:31.529> band<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:32.070> attach<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.640> my<00:00:32.669> hose

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
a rubber band and attach it to my hose

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.770 
a rubber band and attach it to my hose
and<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:34.440> see<00:00:34.649> how<00:00:34.800> big<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.130> could<00:00:35.309> make<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.780> so

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780
