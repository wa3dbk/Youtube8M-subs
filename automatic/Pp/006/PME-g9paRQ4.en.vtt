nice to look at and that is when the pro

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.390 
nice to look at and that is when the pro

settings<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.950> manipulate<00:01:23.549> but<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.909> can<00:01:24.060> bring

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
settings to manipulate but you can bring

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.780 
settings to manipulate but you can bring

negative 2 for example and you'll get a

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.319 
negative 2 for example and you'll get a
somewhat<00:01:28.770> better<00:01:28.890> shot<00:01:29.220> but<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.909> g4<00:01:30.210> was

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
somewhat better shot but the g4 was

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.450 
somewhat better shot but the g4 was
better<00:01:30.630> at<00:01:30.810> exposing<00:01:31.170> properly<00:01:31.950> despite<00:01:32.340> the

fact that with the higher and faster

and<00:01:37.079> thus<00:01:37.320> there's<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.710> lot<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.250> grain<00:01:38.490> all<00:01:38.670> over

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
and thus there's a lot of grain all over

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.210 
and thus there's a lot of grain all over
the<00:01:39.000> place<00:01:39.210> here<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.630> with<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:41.189> can

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
the place here and with that you can

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.710 
the place here and with that you can
really<00:01:41.579> take<00:01:41.700> your<00:01:41.790> pick<00:01:41.970> between<00:01:42.090> these<00:01:42.450> two

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
really take your pick between these two

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.810 
really take your pick between these two
either<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.140> want<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.560> photo<00:01:44.189> that's<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.579> little

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
either you want a photo that's a little

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.880 
either you want a photo that's a little
bit<00:01:44.970> overexposed<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.750> s6<00:01:46.170> or<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.590> can<00:01:46.740> get

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
bit overexposed in the s6 or you can get

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.620 
bit overexposed in the s6 or you can get
a<00:01:46.920> somewhat<00:01:47.340> better<00:01:47.549> looking<00:01:47.939> photo<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.360> color

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
a somewhat better looking photo in color

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.289 
a somewhat better looking photo in color
and<00:01:48.840> exposure<00:01:49.500> in<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.860> g4<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.490> has<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.850> lot<00:01:51.149> of

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
and exposure in the g4 that has a lot of

00:01:51.299 --> 00:02:20.339 
and exposure in the g4 that has a lot of
grain

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.440 

now<00:02:21.280> you're<00:02:21.400> probably<00:02:21.670> noticed<00:02:21.999> already<00:02:22.150> in

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
now you're probably noticed already in

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.300 
now you're probably noticed already in
those<00:02:22.599> last<00:02:22.840> two<00:02:23.049> videos<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.709> when<00:02:24.129> you<00:02:24.189> hit

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
those last two videos that when you hit

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.649 
those last two videos that when you hit
the<00:02:24.400> record<00:02:24.549> button<00:02:24.879> on<00:02:25.150> either<00:02:25.359> of<00:02:25.599> these

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
the record button on either of these

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.629 
the record button on either of these
phones<00:02:26.019> the<00:02:26.349> video<00:02:26.590> goes<00:02:26.799> back<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.249> the<00:02:27.400> auto

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:27.639 
phones the video goes back to the auto

phones the video goes back to the auto
exposure<00:02:28.060> settings<00:02:28.719> it's<00:02:29.139> kind<00:02:29.319> of<00:02:29.379> a<00:02:29.469> bummer

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
exposure settings it's kind of a bummer

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:30.899 
exposure settings it's kind of a bummer
that<00:02:29.799> the<00:02:29.980> manual<00:02:30.310> settings<00:02:30.639> don't<00:02:30.760> do

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:30.909 
that the manual settings don't do

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.059 
that the manual settings don't do
anything<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.569> video<00:02:31.810> content<00:02:32.349> but<00:02:32.950> now

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
anything to the video content but now

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.009 
anything to the video content but now
we're<00:02:33.219> in<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.430> Anaheim<00:02:33.730> packing<00:02:34.510> district

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
we're in the Anaheim packing district

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.929 
we're in the Anaheim packing district
where<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.590> welded<00:02:36.010> photos<00:02:36.310> will<00:02:36.489> really<00:02:36.730> show

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:36.939 
where the welded photos will really show

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:38.670 
where the welded photos will really show
us<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.209> kinds<00:02:37.540> of<00:02:37.599> details<00:02:38.049> we<00:02:38.230> can<00:02:38.349> get<00:02:38.530> with

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
us the kinds of details we can get with

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.129 
us the kinds of details we can get with
these<00:02:38.829> photos<00:02:39.790> now<00:02:40.389> both<00:02:40.659> cameras<00:02:40.989> do<00:02:41.109> a

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:41.139 
these photos now both cameras do a

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.140 
these photos now both cameras do a
really<00:02:41.530> great<00:02:41.680> job<00:02:41.920> with<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.159> galaxy<00:02:42.519> s6<00:02:42.879> as

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
really great job with the galaxy s6 as

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.550 
really great job with the galaxy s6 as
you<00:02:43.239> should<00:02:43.450> come<00:02:43.599> as<00:02:43.900> no<00:02:43.930> surprise<00:02:44.200> to

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
you should come as no surprise to

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.360 
you should come as no surprise to
everybody

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
everybody

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.399 
everybody
it<00:02:45.609> really<00:02:45.790> does<00:02:46.060> over<00:02:46.540> saturate<00:02:47.079> a<00:02:47.109> little

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
it really does over saturate a little

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:49.170 
it really does over saturate a little
bit<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.709> in<00:02:47.799> some<00:02:48.010> situations<00:02:48.579> it<00:02:48.760> means<00:02:48.969> that

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
bit and in some situations it means that

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.550 
bit and in some situations it means that
there<00:02:49.359> are<00:02:49.389> deeper<00:02:49.780> blacks<00:02:50.019> a<00:02:50.230> little<00:02:50.469> bit

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
there are deeper blacks a little bit

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.530 
there are deeper blacks a little bit
more<00:02:50.799> contrast<00:02:51.519> but<00:02:51.700> really<00:02:51.939> that<00:02:52.090> punch<00:02:52.359> in

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
more contrast but really that punch in

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.839 
more contrast but really that punch in
the<00:02:52.599> colors<00:02:52.989> it's<00:02:53.409> a<00:02:53.560> little<00:02:53.769> bit<00:02:53.919> much<00:02:54.189> but<00:02:54.669> a

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
the colors it's a little bit much but a

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.399 
the colors it's a little bit much but a
lot<00:02:55.000> of<00:02:55.030> people<00:02:55.180> do<00:02:55.419> tend<00:02:55.629> to<00:02:55.689> like<00:02:55.900> those<00:02:56.169> and

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409 
lot of people do tend to like those and

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.170 
lot of people do tend to like those and
in<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:56.829> case<00:02:57.010> of<00:02:57.129> the<00:02:57.219> g4<00:02:57.609> it<00:02:57.730> gets<00:02:57.909> a<00:02:58.030> more

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
in the case of the g4 it gets a more

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.879 
in the case of the g4 it gets a more
accurate<00:02:58.419> photo<00:02:59.019> because<00:02:59.290> of<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.680> color

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889 
accurate photo because of the color

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.369 
accurate photo because of the color
spectrum<00:03:00.040> sensor<00:03:00.340> but<00:03:01.269> this<00:03:01.540> photo<00:03:01.870> was<00:03:02.199> one

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
spectrum sensor but this photo was one

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:03.899 
spectrum sensor but this photo was one
of<00:03:02.530> those<00:03:02.650> rare<00:03:02.889> occasions<00:03:03.370> when<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.579> g4

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
of those rare occasions when the g4

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:05.699 
of those rare occasions when the g4
actually<00:03:04.389> saturated<00:03:05.049> the<00:03:05.139> photo<00:03:05.349> a<00:03:05.439> little

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
actually saturated the photo a little

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.129 
actually saturated the photo a little
bit<00:03:05.829> more<00:03:06.069> than<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.370> s6<00:03:06.519> again<00:03:07.480> very<00:03:07.840> rare

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:08.139 
bit more than the s6 again very rare

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:11.610 
bit more than the s6 again very rare
instance<00:03:08.739> but<00:03:09.040> it<00:03:09.159> did<00:03:09.340> happen<00:03:09.669> here<00:03:10.439> but<00:03:11.439> like

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
instance but it did happen here but like

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.110 
instance but it did happen here but like
I<00:03:11.739> mentioned<00:03:11.919> already<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:12.489> color<00:03:12.669> spectrum

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
I mentioned already the color spectrum

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.199 
I mentioned already the color spectrum
sensor<00:03:13.150> does<00:03:13.719> help<00:03:14.049> the<00:03:14.319> g4<00:03:14.889> provide<00:03:15.609> a<00:03:15.819> more

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
sensor does help the g4 provide a more

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.509 
sensor does help the g4 provide a more
accurate<00:03:16.419> photo<00:03:17.049> a<00:03:17.409> bit<00:03:17.650> more<00:03:17.829> drawn<00:03:18.219> back

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
accurate photo a bit more drawn back

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.819 
accurate photo a bit more drawn back
than<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.909> over<00:03:19.180> saturation<00:03:19.569> of<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.840> s6<00:03:20.379> so

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
than the over saturation of the s6 so

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:21.929 
than the over saturation of the s6 so
you<00:03:20.889> really<00:03:21.069> just<00:03:21.219> have<00:03:21.280> to<00:03:21.430> take<00:03:21.579> your<00:03:21.730> pick

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:21.939 
you really just have to take your pick

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:23.879 
you really just have to take your pick
here<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.389> g4<00:03:22.719> will<00:03:22.959> allow<00:03:23.260> you<00:03:23.319> to<00:03:23.650> manipulate

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
here the g4 will allow you to manipulate

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:25.830 
here the g4 will allow you to manipulate
the<00:03:24.340> photo<00:03:24.639> a<00:03:24.729> little<00:03:24.790> bit<00:03:25.120> better<00:03:25.269> using<00:03:25.750> the

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
the photo a little bit better using the

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.479 
the photo a little bit better using the
manual<00:03:26.049> mode<00:03:26.409> and<00:03:26.739> then<00:03:26.919> of<00:03:27.040> course<00:03:27.069> you<00:03:27.370> can

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
manual mode and then of course you can

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.490 
manual mode and then of course you can
capture<00:03:27.879> in<00:03:28.030> RAW<00:03:28.239> simultaneously<00:03:29.109> so<00:03:29.259> you<00:03:29.349> can

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
capture in RAW simultaneously so you can

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.379 
capture in RAW simultaneously so you can
use<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.829> raw<00:03:30.009> capture<00:03:30.280> photo<00:03:30.699> in<00:03:30.939> a<00:03:31.000> program

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
use the raw capture photo in a program

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:32.999 
use the raw capture photo in a program
like<00:03:31.419> Lightroom<00:03:32.109> in<00:03:32.439> order<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.709> make<00:03:32.859> it<00:03:32.979> look

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
auto photos aren't really your style but

do<00:03:42.310> have<00:03:42.609> one<00:03:42.879> remark<00:03:43.239> to<00:03:43.419> say<00:03:43.599> about<00:03:43.930> the

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.169 
do have one remark to say about the

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:47.159 
do have one remark to say about the
picture-taking<00:03:44.639> experience<00:03:45.639> itself<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.720> s6

picture-taking experience itself the s6

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.020 
picture-taking experience itself the s6
did<00:03:47.470> introduce<00:03:47.799> a<00:03:47.919> new<00:03:48.069> shortcut<00:03:48.400> in<00:03:48.699> double

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
did introduce a new shortcut in double

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.550 
did introduce a new shortcut in double
tapping<00:03:49.209> the<00:03:49.419> home<00:03:49.569> button<00:03:49.840> to<00:03:49.900> quickly<00:03:50.079> bring

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
tapping the home button to quickly bring

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.069 
tapping the home button to quickly bring
up<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:50.859> camera<00:03:51.340> and<00:03:51.519> you<00:03:51.939> can<00:03:51.970> start<00:03:52.509> shooting

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
up the camera and you can start shooting

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.699 
up the camera and you can start shooting
right<00:03:53.259> away<00:03:53.590> but<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.459> g4<00:03:54.759> also<00:03:55.030> has<00:03:55.180> its<00:03:55.389> own

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
right away but the g4 also has its own

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.960 
right away but the g4 also has its own
shortcut<00:03:56.709> as<00:03:56.859> well<00:03:57.159> double<00:03:57.579> tapping<00:03:57.759> the

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
shortcut as well double tapping the

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.759 
shortcut as well double tapping the
volume<00:03:58.239> down<00:03:58.419> button<00:03:58.479> now<00:03:59.259> the<00:03:59.319> problem<00:03:59.680> is

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
volume down button now the problem is

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.289 
volume down button now the problem is
when<00:03:59.949> you<00:04:00.040> do<00:04:00.220> that<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:00.519> camera<00:04:00.819> comes<00:04:01.030> up<00:04:01.180> and

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
when you do that the camera comes up and

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.030 
when you do that the camera comes up and
tries<00:04:01.419> to<00:04:01.509> take<00:04:01.810> a<00:04:01.840> photo<00:04:02.169> now<00:04:02.500> if<00:04:02.769> you<00:04:02.889> haven't

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
tries to take a photo now if you haven't

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.159 
tries to take a photo now if you haven't
framed<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:04.180> scene<00:04:04.719> in<00:04:04.870> your<00:04:04.900> viewfinder

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:05.169 
framed the scene in your viewfinder

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:06.809 
framed the scene in your viewfinder
correctly<00:04:05.919> or<00:04:06.069> if<00:04:06.159> there's<00:04:06.340> just<00:04:06.489> nothing<00:04:06.790> to

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
correctly or if there's just nothing to

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.580 
correctly or if there's just nothing to
take<00:04:07.060> at<00:04:07.239> the<00:04:07.359> time<00:04:07.599> it<00:04:08.079> will<00:04:08.199> take<00:04:08.229> a<00:04:08.349> couple

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
take at the time it will take a couple

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.499 
take at the time it will take a couple
of<00:04:08.739> seconds<00:04:09.099> to<00:04:09.189> focus<00:04:09.579> on<00:04:09.699> basically<00:04:10.060> nothing

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:10.509 
of seconds to focus on basically nothing

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:12.539 
of seconds to focus on basically nothing
and<00:04:10.629> then<00:04:11.049> once<00:04:11.409> it<00:04:11.560> takes<00:04:11.709> that<00:04:11.949> photo<00:04:12.219> that

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
and then once it takes that photo that

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.399 
and then once it takes that photo that
extra<00:04:13.150> time<00:04:13.389> is<00:04:13.569> wasted<00:04:14.019> until<00:04:14.169> you're

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409 
extra time is wasted until you're

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:16.050 
extra time is wasted until you're
actually<00:04:14.859> able<00:04:14.979> to<00:04:15.129> manipulate<00:04:15.489> the<00:04:15.790> camera

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
actually able to manipulate the camera

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.719 
actually able to manipulate the camera
to<00:04:16.479> get<00:04:16.659> your<00:04:16.840> shot<00:04:17.079> it<00:04:17.560> just<00:04:17.620> makes<00:04:18.070> a<00:04:18.190> g4<00:04:18.549> that

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
to get your shot it just makes a g4 that

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.729 
to get your shot it just makes a g4 that
little<00:04:19.209> bit<00:04:19.419> slower<00:04:19.840> and<00:04:19.989> going<00:04:20.500> from<00:04:20.590> the

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
little bit slower and going from the

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:27.570 
little bit slower and going from the
prone<00:04:20.949> position<00:04:20.979> to<00:04:21.489> actually<00:04:21.639> taking<00:04:22.000> photos

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.890 

now<00:04:28.580> here's<00:04:28.760> a<00:04:28.820> video<00:04:29.030> of<00:04:29.180> me<00:04:29.389> walking<00:04:29.570> around

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
now here's a video of me walking around

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.810 
now here's a video of me walking around
and<00:04:30.440> just<00:04:30.949> a<00:04:31.070> bit<00:04:31.280> of<00:04:31.370> a<00:04:31.430> behind-the-scenes

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
and just a bit of a behind-the-scenes

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.420 
and just a bit of a behind-the-scenes
take<00:04:32.510> on<00:04:32.690> this<00:04:32.810> I<00:04:32.960> put<00:04:33.229> both<00:04:33.440> phones<00:04:33.800> on<00:04:34.070> a<00:04:34.100> rig

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
take on this I put both phones on a rig

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.610 
take on this I put both phones on a rig
on<00:04:34.639> a<00:04:34.669> rail<00:04:34.970> so<00:04:35.479> that<00:04:35.510> they<00:04:35.780> were<00:04:35.840> the<00:04:36.199> same

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
on a rail so that they were the same

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.560 
on a rail so that they were the same
ecwid<00:04:37.010> distance<00:04:37.280> away<00:04:37.490> from<00:04:37.669> any<00:04:37.820> subject<00:04:38.419> and

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
ecwid distance away from any subject and

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.879 
ecwid distance away from any subject and
then<00:04:38.930> I<00:04:39.020> picked<00:04:39.229> it<00:04:39.350> up<00:04:39.440> and<00:04:39.560> started<00:04:39.650> walking

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
then I picked it up and started walking

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.219 
then I picked it up and started walking
around<00:04:40.370> with<00:04:40.580> it<00:04:40.610> now<00:04:41.150> this<00:04:41.270> is<00:04:41.330> an<00:04:41.479> OS<00:04:41.900> test

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
around with it now this is an OS test

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.650 
around with it now this is an OS test
and<00:04:42.500> the<00:04:42.830> larger<00:04:43.220> sensor<00:04:43.669> with<00:04:43.880> the<00:04:44.030> much<00:04:44.449> more

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
and the larger sensor with the much more

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.540 
and the larger sensor with the much more
enhanced<00:04:45.050> OS<00:04:45.470> of<00:04:45.650> the<00:04:45.710> g4<00:04:46.070> really<00:04:46.370> does<00:04:46.520> a

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
enhanced OS of the g4 really does a

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.400 
enhanced OS of the g4 really does a
great<00:04:46.790> job<00:04:46.850> here<00:04:47.449> you<00:04:47.780> can<00:04:47.900> see<00:04:48.020> on<00:04:48.139> the<00:04:48.229> left

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
great job here you can see on the left

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.080 
great job here you can see on the left
side<00:04:48.560> with<00:04:48.740> the<00:04:48.830> s6<00:04:49.280> that<00:04:49.520> it's<00:04:49.850> still<00:04:50.060> a

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
side with the s6 that it's still a

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.150 
side with the s6 that it's still a
little<00:04:50.360> bit<00:04:50.449> wobbly<00:04:50.690> meanwhile<00:04:51.470> the<00:04:51.620> g4<00:04:51.979> does

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
little bit wobbly meanwhile the g4 does

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.550 
little bit wobbly meanwhile the g4 does
a<00:04:52.190> great<00:04:52.520> job<00:04:52.580> of<00:04:53.120> minimizing<00:04:53.419> that<00:04:53.960> when<00:04:54.350> in

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
a great job of minimizing that when in

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.860 
a great job of minimizing that when in
comparison<00:04:55.340> so<00:04:55.520> that's<00:04:56.180> a<00:04:56.300> really<00:04:56.660> big

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
comparison so that's a really big

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.140 
comparison so that's a really big
feather<00:04:57.169> in<00:04:57.380> the<00:04:57.470> cap<00:04:57.500> of<00:04:57.860> the<00:04:58.430> g4<00:05:00.970> while<00:05:01.970> the

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
feather in the cap of the g4 while the

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.360 
feather in the cap of the g4 while the
s6<00:05:02.539> might<00:05:02.780> somewhat<00:05:03.229> over<00:05:03.530> saturate<00:05:04.070> and<00:05:04.280> the

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
s6 might somewhat over saturate and the

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.550 
s6 might somewhat over saturate and the
g4<00:05:04.669> might<00:05:04.850> somewhat<00:05:05.240> over<00:05:05.510> expose<00:05:05.960> when<00:05:06.470> it

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
g4 might somewhat over expose when it

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.260 
g4 might somewhat over expose when it
comes<00:05:06.710> to<00:05:06.830> details<00:05:07.190> I<00:05:07.430> do<00:05:07.490> think<00:05:07.910> that<00:05:08.030> both<00:05:08.240> of

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
comes to details I do think that both of

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.480 
comes to details I do think that both of
these<00:05:08.479> cameras<00:05:08.840> do<00:05:08.960> a<00:05:08.990> really<00:05:09.289> great<00:05:09.440> job<00:05:09.560> it's

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
these cameras do a really great job it's

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.430 
these cameras do a really great job it's
only<00:05:10.639> one<00:05:10.850> you<00:05:10.970> really<00:05:11.270> zoom<00:05:11.570> into<00:05:11.810> the<00:05:12.080> photos

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
only one you really zoom into the photos

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.170 
only one you really zoom into the photos
that<00:05:12.620> you<00:05:12.740> might<00:05:12.919> find<00:05:13.100> some<00:05:13.340> disparities<00:05:13.970> and

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
that you might find some disparities and

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.090 
that you might find some disparities and
really<00:05:14.419> it's<00:05:14.600> not<00:05:14.690> even<00:05:14.840> that<00:05:15.199> big<00:05:15.410> in<00:05:15.650> this

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
really it's not even that big in this

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.740 
really it's not even that big in this
particular<00:05:16.400> photo<00:05:16.880> you<00:05:17.060> can<00:05:17.240> see<00:05:17.419> that<00:05:17.570> some

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
particular photo you can see that some

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.629 
particular photo you can see that some
post-processing<00:05:18.320> is<00:05:18.830> detracting<00:05:19.370> from<00:05:19.400> the

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
post-processing is detracting from the

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.939 
post-processing is detracting from the
overall<00:05:20.030> sharpness<00:05:20.600> of<00:05:20.690> the<00:05:20.750> g4<00:05:21.260> photo<00:05:21.620> and

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:21.949 
overall sharpness of the g4 photo and

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:24.129 
overall sharpness of the g4 photo and
like<00:05:22.760> I<00:05:22.850> said<00:05:22.910> it<00:05:23.180> really<00:05:23.210> only<00:05:23.570> happens<00:05:24.020> when

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
like I said it really only happens when

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:26.020 
like I said it really only happens when
you<00:05:24.260> really<00:05:24.620> zoom<00:05:24.830> in<00:05:25.070> if<00:05:25.310> you<00:05:25.430> take<00:05:25.639> the

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
you really zoom in if you take the

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.820 
you really zoom in if you take the
photos<00:05:26.360> the<00:05:26.510> way<00:05:26.660> that<00:05:26.840> they<00:05:26.990> are<00:05:27.229> both<00:05:27.620> of

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
photos the way that they are both of

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.230 
photos the way that they are both of
them<00:05:27.860> look<00:05:28.190> really<00:05:28.460> great<00:05:28.700> it's<00:05:28.970> just<00:05:29.120> a

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
them look really great it's just a

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.180 
them look really great it's just a
matter<00:05:29.450> of<00:05:29.539> which<00:05:29.960> one<00:05:29.990> looks<00:05:30.410> better<00:05:30.710> to<00:05:30.979> you

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
matter of which one looks better to you

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.980 
matter of which one looks better to you
and<00:05:31.460> that's<00:05:31.820> the<00:05:31.940> reason<00:05:32.330> why<00:05:32.450> despite<00:05:32.870> these

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
and that's the reason why despite these

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.170 
and that's the reason why despite these
100<00:05:33.410> crops<00:05:33.650> I<00:05:33.830> wanted<00:05:34.070> to<00:05:34.160> show<00:05:34.340> you<00:05:34.400> some<00:05:34.669> very

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
100 crops I wanted to show you some very

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.570 
100 crops I wanted to show you some very
concrete<00:05:35.720> examples<00:05:36.380> of<00:05:36.560> a<00:05:36.650> horizontal<00:05:37.340> view

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
concrete examples of a horizontal view

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.790 
concrete examples of a horizontal view
rather<00:05:37.729> than<00:05:37.880> these<00:05:38.150> close-up<00:05:38.800> side-by-sides

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
rather than these close-up side-by-sides

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.010 
rather than these close-up side-by-sides
in<00:05:40.039> order<00:05:40.490> for<00:05:40.610> you<00:05:40.669> to<00:05:40.820> actually<00:05:41.000> see<00:05:41.300> you

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
in order for you to actually see you

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.690 
in order for you to actually see you
know<00:05:42.080> at<00:05:42.349> a<00:05:42.380> first<00:05:42.620> glance<00:05:42.830> which<00:05:43.250> one<00:05:43.460> looks

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:43.700 
know at a first glance which one looks

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.690 
know at a first glance which one looks
better<00:05:43.849> to<00:05:44.090> you<00:05:44.300> and<00:05:45.169> honestly<00:05:46.039> I<00:05:46.070> could<00:05:46.520> take

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
better to you and honestly I could take

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.670 
better to you and honestly I could take
either<00:05:46.970> one<00:05:47.300> of<00:05:47.330> these<00:05:47.539> photos<00:05:48.050> and<00:05:48.289> either

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
either one of these photos and either

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.070 
either one of these photos and either
one<00:05:48.889> of<00:05:48.950> these<00:05:49.070> cameras<00:05:49.669> and<00:05:49.910> probably<00:05:50.870> still

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
one of these cameras and probably still

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.990 
one of these cameras and probably still
be<00:05:51.200> happy<00:05:51.500> with<00:05:51.530> what<00:05:51.800> comes<00:05:52.039> out<00:05:52.250> definitely

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
be happy with what comes out definitely

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.960 
be happy with what comes out definitely
good<00:05:53.210> for<00:05:53.240> social<00:05:53.750> media<00:05:53.840> no<00:05:54.289> matter<00:05:54.500> what<00:05:54.970> but

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
good for social media no matter what but

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.670 
good for social media no matter what but
we<00:05:56.120> do<00:05:56.270> have<00:05:56.419> some<00:05:56.630> very<00:05:56.840> concrete<00:05:57.289> examples

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
we do have some very concrete examples

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.010 
we do have some very concrete examples
of<00:05:57.770> the<00:05:57.860> color<00:05:58.099> in<00:05:58.370> these<00:05:58.490> video<00:05:59.000> shots<00:05:59.360> I<00:05:59.599> went

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
of the color in these video shots I went

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.480 
of the color in these video shots I went
ahead<00:06:00.080> and<00:06:00.260> hit<00:06:00.349> record<00:06:00.500> on<00:06:00.800> both<00:06:00.979> of<00:06:01.190> them<00:06:01.310> and

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
ahead and hit record on both of them and

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.159 
ahead and hit record on both of them and
put<00:06:01.610> them<00:06:01.699> on<00:06:01.849> the<00:06:01.970> rig<00:06:02.150> and<00:06:02.479> it's<00:06:02.720> obvious

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 
put them on the rig and it's obvious

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.560 
put them on the rig and it's obvious
that<00:06:03.199> in<00:06:03.500> these<00:06:03.770> videos<00:06:04.280> the<00:06:04.820> left<00:06:05.120> side<00:06:05.360> the

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:05.570 
that in these videos the left side the

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.600 
that in these videos the left side the
s6<00:06:06.020> definitely<00:06:06.560> punches<00:06:06.919> out<00:06:07.039> its<00:06:07.220> colors<00:06:07.580> a

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
s6 definitely punches out its colors a

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.240 
s6 definitely punches out its colors a
lot<00:06:08.120> but<00:06:08.780> the<00:06:08.900> thing<00:06:09.080> is<00:06:09.199> the<00:06:09.349> g4<00:06:09.710> colors<00:06:10.039> are

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
lot but the thing is the g4 colors are

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.159 
lot but the thing is the g4 colors are
far<00:06:10.729> from<00:06:10.970> bland<00:06:11.389> and<00:06:11.690> they<00:06:11.780> still<00:06:12.020> look

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:12.169 
far from bland and they still look

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:14.439 
far from bland and they still look
really<00:06:12.710> nice<00:06:12.919> it's<00:06:13.460> just<00:06:13.639> that<00:06:13.729> the<00:06:13.820> s6<00:06:14.210> kind

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:14.449 
really nice it's just that the s6 kind

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:15.879 
really nice it's just that the s6 kind
of<00:06:14.539> over<00:06:14.840> achieves<00:06:15.199> and<00:06:15.470> if<00:06:15.530> it's<00:06:15.650> a<00:06:15.710> little

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:15.889 
of over achieves and if it's a little

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:17.920 
of over achieves and if it's a little
bit<00:06:15.979> too<00:06:16.160> gross<00:06:16.910> of<00:06:17.120> a<00:06:17.180> punch<00:06:17.419> for<00:06:17.630> you<00:06:17.750> guys

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
bit too gross of a punch for you guys

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.870 
bit too gross of a punch for you guys
then<00:06:18.260> of<00:06:18.590> course<00:06:18.830> the<00:06:19.010> s6<00:06:19.340> is<00:06:19.460> probably<00:06:19.729> not

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
then of course the s6 is probably not

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.570 
then of course the s6 is probably not
the<00:06:20.000> one<00:06:20.120> you<00:06:20.300> want

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.369 

all<00:06:23.120> right<00:06:23.360> so<00:06:23.509> we<00:06:23.629> covered<00:06:23.930> a<00:06:23.990> lot<00:06:24.020> of<00:06:24.259> ground

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:24.379 
all right so we covered a lot of ground

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:26.409 
all right so we covered a lot of ground
in<00:06:24.830> this<00:06:24.949> video<00:06:25.220> a<00:06:25.280> lot<00:06:25.400> of<00:06:25.550> photos<00:06:25.879> and<00:06:26.060> videos

and<00:06:39.500> I<00:06:39.530> can't<00:06:39.740> emphasize<00:06:40.129> that<00:06:40.159> enough<00:06:40.310> we've

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:40.789 
and I can't emphasize that enough we've

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:42.429 
and I can't emphasize that enough we've
come<00:06:41.000> to<00:06:41.180> a<00:06:41.210> point<00:06:41.449> in<00:06:41.629> Android<00:06:42.110> where<00:06:42.319> the

00:06:42.429 --> 00:06:42.439 
come to a point in Android where the

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:44.529 
come to a point in Android where the
cameras<00:06:42.770> are<00:06:42.860> really<00:06:43.729> getting<00:06:44.030> really<00:06:44.210> good

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:44.539 
cameras are really getting really good

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:47.379 
cameras are really getting really good
and<00:06:45.409> they<00:06:45.830> are<00:06:46.099> probably<00:06:46.370> able<00:06:46.819> to<00:06:47.000> replace

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:47.389 
and they are probably able to replace

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:49.240 
and they are probably able to replace
the<00:06:47.659> typical<00:06:48.139> small<00:06:48.680> point-and-shoot

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
the typical small point-and-shoot

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.800 
the typical small point-and-shoot
cameras<00:06:49.580> that<00:06:49.699> people<00:06:49.969> tend<00:06:50.180> to<00:06:50.270> have<00:06:50.419> along

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.810 
cameras that people tend to have along

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.330 
cameras that people tend to have along
with<00:06:50.870> their<00:06:51.169> phones<00:06:51.409> and<00:06:51.830> that's<00:06:52.069> a<00:06:52.159> great

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:52.340 
with their phones and that's a great

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.980 
with their phones and that's a great
notion<00:06:52.610> and<00:06:52.909> hopefully<00:06:53.240> it<00:06:53.360> only<00:06:53.539> get<00:06:53.810> better

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:53.990 
notion and hopefully it only get better

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.260 
notion and hopefully it only get better
for<00:06:54.229> more<00:06:54.560> phones<00:06:54.860> in<00:06:55.550> this<00:06:55.699> upcoming<00:06:55.909> year

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.270 
for more phones in this upcoming year

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.450 
for more phones in this upcoming year

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:58.460 
but nonetheless keep it tuned here to

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.709
