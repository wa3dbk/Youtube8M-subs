we<00:00:20.369> have<00:00:20.520> one<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.270> largest<00:00:21.420> sensors<00:00:22.109> that

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
we have one of the largest sensors that

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.040 
we have one of the largest sensors that
we<00:00:22.560> know<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:22.800> on<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.279> mobile<00:00:23.550> phone<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:24.570> bring<00:00:24.810> a

we know of on a mobile phone to bring a

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.470 
we know of on a mobile phone to bring a
lot<00:00:25.289> higher<00:00:25.470> quality<00:00:26.160> for<00:00:26.760> your<00:00:26.910> pictures<00:00:27.269> a

larger camera sensor will allow allow

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.630 
larger camera sensor will allow allow
you<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.900> take<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.109> lot<00:00:31.380> higher<00:00:31.679> quality<00:00:32.279> picture

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
you to take a lot higher quality picture

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.810 
you to take a lot higher quality picture
if<00:00:32.820> your<00:00:33.420> camera<00:00:33.690> sensor<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.290> too<00:00:34.469> small<00:00:34.820> the

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
if your camera sensor is too small the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.770 
if your camera sensor is too small the
pixels<00:00:36.690> get<00:00:37.290> far<00:00:37.559> too<00:00:37.860> little<00:00:38.399> light<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.510> then

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
pixels get far too little light and then

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.319 
pixels get far too little light and then
can<00:00:39.989> introduce<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.530> lot<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.800> noise<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.550> we've

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
can introduce a lot of noise so we've

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.090 
can introduce a lot of noise so we've
really<00:00:42.360> optimized<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.350> for<00:00:43.620> taking<00:00:43.920> high

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
really optimized this for taking high

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.830 
really optimized this for taking high
quality<00:00:44.489> pictures<00:00:45.110> with<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.320> then<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:47.340> can

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
quality pictures with this then you can

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.049

your partnership with Toby and outdoor
surrounds<00:02:58.500> right<00:02:58.680> so<00:02:59.340> basically<00:02:59.489> with<00:03:00.030> video

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
surrounds right so basically with video

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.509 
surrounds right so basically with video
we<00:03:00.540> are<00:03:00.569> supporting<00:03:01.200> we<00:03:02.040> are<00:03:02.160> working<00:03:02.310> with

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
we are supporting we are working with

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.420 
we are supporting we are working with
Dolby<00:03:03.239> to<00:03:03.359> support<00:03:03.690> Dolby<00:03:04.290> surround<00:03:04.560> sound<00:03:04.829> 51

so basically if you have a home theater

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:13.370 
so basically if you have a home theater
this<00:03:09.359> will<00:03:09.540> support<00:03:10.400> up<00:03:11.400> to<00:03:11.430> five<00:03:12.150> speakers<00:03:12.510> so

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
this will support up to five speakers so

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.030 
this will support up to five speakers so
that<00:03:13.709> you<00:03:13.889> can<00:03:14.069> have<00:03:14.250> you<00:03:15.180> know<00:03:15.209> left<00:03:15.540> right

that you can have you know left right

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.340 
that you can have you know left right
center<00:03:17.040> subwoofer<00:03:17.700> etc<00:03:18.450> so<00:03:19.019> that<00:03:19.049> you

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
center subwoofer etc so that you

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.449 
center subwoofer etc so that you
basically<00:03:19.650> will<00:03:20.190> have<00:03:21.799> the<00:03:22.799> ability<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.220> play

we're<00:04:10.189> seeing<00:04:10.579> a<00:04:10.790> front-facing<00:04:11.379> camera<00:04:12.379> so

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
we're seeing a front-facing camera so

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.860 
we're seeing a front-facing camera so
here<00:04:13.340> we<00:04:13.459> have<00:04:13.489> a<00:04:13.819> front<00:04:14.120> facing<00:04:14.180> camera

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
here we have a front facing camera

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.319 
here we have a front facing camera
automatic<00:04:15.739> light<00:04:15.920> sensor<00:04:16.370> and<00:04:16.609> you<00:04:16.820> can't<00:04:17.060> see

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
automatic light sensor and you can't see

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:18.939 
automatic light sensor and you can't see
it<00:04:17.449> because<00:04:17.630> it's<00:04:17.900> partially<00:04:18.349> obscured

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:18.949 
it because it's partially obscured

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.080 
it because it's partially obscured
proximity<00:04:19.820> sensor<00:04:20.180> and<00:04:21.310> also<00:04:22.310> the<00:04:22.520> case<00:04:22.759> is

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
proximity sensor and also the case is

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.129 
proximity sensor and also the case is
made<00:04:23.330> out<00:04:23.570> of<00:04:24.130> aluminum<00:04:25.130> the<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.660> end<00:04:26.840> caps

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
made out of aluminum the the end caps

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.020 
made out of aluminum the the end caps
are<00:04:27.500> a<00:04:27.530> plastic<00:04:28.220> for<00:04:28.430> getting<00:04:28.849> better

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
are a plastic for getting better

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.120 
are a plastic for getting better
reception<00:04:29.750> and<00:04:30.820> then<00:04:31.820> we<00:04:32.120> also<00:04:32.150> do<00:04:32.919> stereo<00:04:33.919> mic

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
reception and then we also do stereo mic

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.820 
reception and then we also do stereo mic
recording<00:04:34.669> as<00:04:34.789> well<00:04:34.970> and<00:04:35.270> is<00:04:36.259> this<00:04:36.440> the<00:04:36.500> glass

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
recording as well and is this the glass

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.650 
recording as well and is this the glass
screen<00:04:37.190> it's<00:04:37.490> capacitive<00:04:38.180> touch<00:04:38.330> yeah

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
screen it's capacitive touch yeah

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.760 
screen it's capacitive touch yeah
capacitive<00:04:39.169> touch<00:04:39.789> active-matrix<00:04:41.380> amo<00:04:42.380> let

capacitive touch active-matrix amo let

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.719 
capacitive touch active-matrix amo let
so<00:04:43.520> that<00:04:43.729> the<00:04:44.560> screen<00:04:45.560> quality<00:04:45.800> is<00:04:46.160> actually

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
so that the screen quality is actually
