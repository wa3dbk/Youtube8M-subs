00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
Ravens and if they can I think that win

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.140 
Ravens and if they can I think that win
the<00:01:04.739> football<00:01:04.860> game<00:01:05.100> because<00:01:05.400> as<00:01:05.820> we've<00:01:05.970> seen

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
the football game because as we've seen

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.359 
the football game because as we've seen
with<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.390> Ravens<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.900> these<00:01:07.049> playoffs<00:01:07.369> they

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
with the Ravens in these playoffs they

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.800 
with the Ravens in these playoffs they
just<00:01:08.580> seem<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.729> be<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.030> resilient<00:01:09.360> just<00:01:09.689> seemed

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
just seem to be so resilient just seemed

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.990 
just seem to be so resilient just seemed
to<00:01:09.900> come<00:01:10.110> back<00:01:10.320> from<00:01:10.560> insurmountable<00:01:11.400> leads

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
to come back from insurmountable leads

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.090 
to come back from insurmountable leads

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
directly into the line actually be

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.910 
directly into the line actually be
creative<00:01:45.210> with<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.570> running<00:01:45.780> game<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.320> think

the<00:02:05.800> playoffs<00:02:06.160> however<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:07.180> think<00:02:07.480> really<00:02:07.600> the

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
the playoffs however I think really the

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.540 
the playoffs however I think really the
key<00:02:08.020> for<00:02:08.259> coaching<00:02:08.740> here<00:02:08.950> is<00:02:09.040> the<00:02:09.160> special

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
key for coaching here is the special

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.210 
key for coaching here is the special
teams<00:02:09.790> coach<00:02:10.119> because<00:02:10.929> Baltimore<00:02:11.830> special

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
teams coach because Baltimore special

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.890 
teams coach because Baltimore special
