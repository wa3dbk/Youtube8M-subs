you have one of those little bottles and
you<00:01:22.900> pick<00:01:23.230> up<00:01:23.350> a<00:01:23.380> little<00:01:23.710> thing<00:01:24.070> which<00:01:24.220> has<00:01:24.340> a

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
you pick up a little thing which has a

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.250 
you pick up a little thing which has a
circle<00:01:24.790> on<00:01:24.850> it<00:01:25.000> right<00:01:25.630> there<00:01:25.840> and<00:01:26.020> then<00:01:26.110> you

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
circle on it right there and then you

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.550 
circle on it right there and then you
blow<00:01:26.560> it<00:01:26.770> and<00:01:27.100> the<00:01:27.430> bubbles<00:01:27.580> come<00:01:27.880> out<00:01:28.000> but<00:01:28.560> I'm

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.120 
he got that one right and I'll be able
to<00:01:49.090> use<00:01:49.360> them<00:01:49.570> to<00:01:49.960> buy<00:01:50.110> colors<00:01:50.620> and<00:01:50.800> different

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
to use them to buy colors and different

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.420 
to use them to buy colors and different
things<00:01:51.159> later<00:01:51.700> on<00:01:51.960> but<00:01:52.960> now<00:01:53.140> is<00:01:53.440> his<00:01:53.860> turn<00:01:54.130> he

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
things later on but now is his turn he

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.820 
things later on but now is his turn he
drew<00:01:54.670> a<00:01:54.700> picture<00:01:54.940> for<00:01:55.060> me<00:01:55.330> so<00:01:55.930> let's<00:01:56.170> see<00:01:56.380> if<00:01:56.590> I

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
drew a picture for me so let's see if I

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.440 
drew a picture for me so let's see if I
can<00:01:56.860> get<00:01:57.159> it<00:01:57.340> right<00:01:57.670> so<00:01:59.580> it's<00:02:00.580> only<00:02:00.820> four<00:02:01.210> words

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
can get it right so it's only four words

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.830 
can get it right so it's only four words
so<00:02:01.720> hopefully<00:02:02.170> it<00:02:02.229> should<00:02:02.350> be<00:02:02.470> quite<00:02:02.650> easy

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:19.410 

looks<00:02:08.840> like<00:02:09.229> a<00:02:09.259> mug<00:02:11.590> but<00:02:12.590> I<00:02:12.650> don't<00:02:13.610> have<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.620> G

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:29.020 

and<00:02:20.420> he<00:02:21.319> looks<00:02:21.650> like

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.690 

he<00:02:30.030> is<00:02:30.210> dropping<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.660> biscuit<00:02:31.490> now<00:02:32.490> I<00:02:32.520> think

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
he is dropping a biscuit now I think

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.670 
he is dropping a biscuit now I think
that's<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.120> bit<00:02:33.300> cheating<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.960> be<00:02:34.080> honest<00:02:34.350> I

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
that's a bit cheating to be honest I

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.230 
that's a bit cheating to be honest I
don't<00:02:34.950> think<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.280> should<00:02:35.310> use<00:02:35.580> any<00:02:35.820> words<00:02:36.030> at

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
don't think you should use any words at

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.470 
don't think you should use any words at
all<00:02:36.300> but<00:02:36.690> i<00:02:37.280> think<00:02:38.280> he's<00:02:38.760> given<00:02:39.150> me<00:02:39.180> another

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
all but i think he's given me another

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.090 
all but i think he's given me another
clue<00:02:39.950> so<00:02:40.950> i<00:02:41.010> dunk<00:02:41.640> my<00:02:42.000> biscuit<00:02:42.510> in<00:02:42.690> my<00:02:42.840> mug<00:02:43.140> so

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
clue so i dunk my biscuit in my mug so

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.090 
clue so i dunk my biscuit in my mug so
he<00:02:45.060> gets<00:02:45.300> some<00:02:45.540> coins<00:02:45.870> they're<00:02:46.350> forgetting

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
he gets some coins they're forgetting

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.650 
he gets some coins they're forgetting
that<00:02:47.250> one<00:02:47.400> correct<00:02:47.730> but<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:47.970> do<00:02:48.420> for<00:02:48.570> not

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
that one correct but I do for not

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.230 
that one correct but I do for not
cheating<00:02:49.020> so<00:02:49.500> now<00:02:49.740> it's<00:02:49.890> my<00:02:50.070> turn<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.340> give<00:02:50.940> him

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
cheating so now it's my turn to give him

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.990 
cheating so now it's my turn to give him
a<00:02:51.590> picture<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:55.280> that's<00:02:56.280> probably<00:02:56.790> going<00:02:56.940> to

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
a picture and that's probably going to

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.290 
a picture and that's probably going to
be<00:02:57.060> too<00:02:57.270> hard<00:02:58.070> that's<00:02:59.070> an<00:02:59.520> American

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
be too hard that's an American

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.880 
be too hard that's an American
expression<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:01.050> I'm<00:03:01.170> not<00:03:01.320> intelligible<00:03:01.800> a

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
expression and I'm not intelligible a

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.470 
expression and I'm not intelligible a
Twinkie<00:03:02.280> is<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.490> think<00:03:02.550> it's<00:03:02.820> some<00:03:02.970> soft<00:03:03.150> sponge

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
Twinkie is I think it's some soft sponge

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.390 
Twinkie is I think it's some soft sponge
thing<00:03:03.840> is<00:03:03.960> it<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.650> those<00:03:04.830> have<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.070> do<00:03:05.160> an<00:03:05.250> easy

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
thing is it and those have to do an easy

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.420 
thing is it and those have to do an easy
one<00:03:05.640> which<00:03:05.790> is<00:03:05.940> a<00:03:05.970> ladder<00:03:06.210> so<00:03:06.900> here<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.500> go<00:03:07.830> off<00:03:08.100> i

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
one which is a ladder so here I go off i

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.480 
one which is a ladder so here I go off i
draw<00:03:08.810> and<00:03:09.810> of<00:03:10.050> course<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.440> tablet<00:03:10.920> means<00:03:11.250> that

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
draw and of course the tablet means that

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:18.880 
draw and of course the tablet means that
this<00:03:11.700> is<00:03:12.080> quite<00:03:13.080> an<00:03:13.320> easy<00:03:14.310> device<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.360> draw<00:03:15.570> on

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.340 

so<00:03:19.890> i<00:03:20.250> think<00:03:20.700> i<00:03:21.210> can't<00:03:21.840> think<00:03:21.960> of<00:03:22.140> anything

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
so i think i can't think of anything

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.590 
so i think i can't think of anything
else<00:03:22.530> really<00:03:22.740> I<00:03:23.070> could<00:03:23.340> try<00:03:23.550> and<00:03:23.730> put<00:03:24.330> picture

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
else really I could try and put picture

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.270 
else really I could try and put picture
of<00:03:24.690> somebody<00:03:24.930> climbing<00:03:25.200> up<00:03:25.410> it<00:03:25.590> but<00:03:26.130> i'm<00:03:26.220> not

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
of somebody climbing up it but i'm not

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.650 
of somebody climbing up it but i'm not
sure<00:03:26.340> if<00:03:26.580> that<00:03:26.610> will<00:03:26.820> help<00:03:29.510> because<00:03:30.510> i<00:03:30.600> think

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
sure if that will help because i think

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.350 
sure if that will help because i think
i've<00:03:31.080> just<00:03:31.710> made<00:03:32.130> a<00:03:32.190> complete<00:03:32.820> mess<00:03:32.850> of<00:03:33.120> that

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
i've just made a complete mess of that

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
i've just made a complete mess of that
picture<00:03:33.709> but<00:03:34.709> hopefully<00:03:35.390> if<00:03:36.390> i<00:03:36.510> draw<00:03:36.780> an<00:03:36.930> hour

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
picture but hopefully if i draw an hour

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.890 
picture but hopefully if i draw an hour
arrow<00:03:38.370> pointed<00:03:39.060> towards<00:03:39.360> a<00:03:39.420> ladder<00:03:39.630> that

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
arrow pointed towards a ladder that

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.480 
arrow pointed towards a ladder that
should<00:03:40.380> be<00:03:40.500> enough<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:40.860> where's<00:03:41.070> my<00:03:41.190> picture

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
should be enough so where's my picture

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.360 
should be enough so where's my picture
done<00:03:41.670> press<00:03:42.150> done<00:03:42.420> I<00:03:42.630> have<00:03:43.320> finished<00:03:43.530> so

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
done press done I have finished so

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.740 
done press done I have finished so

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.780 
picture and it's just a fun diversion
really<00:03:55.140> something<00:03:55.440> that<00:03:55.530> you<00:03:55.620> can<00:03:55.770> do<00:03:55.920> with<00:03:56.760> a

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
really something that you can do with a

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.720 
really something that you can do with a
few<00:03:57.060> spare<00:03:57.390> minutes<00:03:58.220> and<00:03:59.220> then<00:03:59.370> carry<00:03:59.640> on

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
few spare minutes and then carry on

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.160 
few spare minutes and then carry on
obviously<00:04:00.120> this<00:04:00.239> is<00:04:00.390> a<00:04:00.420> free<00:04:00.720> version<00:04:00.750> because

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
obviously this is a free version because

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.040 
obviously this is a free version because
I<00:04:01.290> got<00:04:01.440> an<00:04:01.530> advert<00:04:01.860> there<00:04:02.630> so<00:04:03.630> I<00:04:03.660> now<00:04:04.020> have
