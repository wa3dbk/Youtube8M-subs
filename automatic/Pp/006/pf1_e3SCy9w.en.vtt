Monster<00:00:15.619> I'm<00:00:16.619> using<00:00:16.890> these<00:00:17.189> eat<00:00:17.689> 3.36<00:00:18.689> spark

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
Monster I'm using these eat 3.36 spark

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:27.859 
Monster I'm using these eat 3.36 spark
plugs<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:20.400> replace<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.849> the<00:00:20.939> original<00:00:21.829> NGK<00:00:26.869> get

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
plugs to replace to the original NGK get

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.089 
plugs to replace to the original NGK get
exact<00:00:28.200> NGK<00:00:28.829> number<00:00:29.099> they<00:00:29.219> are<00:00:29.250> it's<00:00:29.610> like<00:00:29.790> DC

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
exact NGK number they are it's like DC

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.660 
exact NGK number they are it's like DC
p38<00:00:32.129> or<00:00:32.460> something<00:00:33.120> like<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.860> anyways<00:00:34.860> you

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
p38 or something like that anyways you

p38 or something like that anyways you
have<00:00:35.700> one<00:00:35.969> spark<00:00:36.239> plug<00:00:36.510> this<00:00:36.690> right<00:00:36.809> here<00:00:37.140> at

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
have one spark plug this right here at

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.080 
have one spark plug this right here at
the<00:00:37.289> top<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:38.309> your<00:00:38.579> seat<00:00:39.000> your<00:00:39.870> other<00:00:40.110> one<00:00:40.379> I

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
here you had the new plug it kind of has

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.820 
here you had the new plug it kind of has
like<00:02:03.300> a<00:02:03.450> dual<00:02:03.659> strike<00:02:03.990> almost<00:02:04.440> a<00:02:04.500> triple

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
like a dual strike almost a triple

this is a very very simple fast process

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.920 
this is a very very simple fast process
to<00:02:14.060> do<00:02:14.180> especially<00:02:14.510> on<00:02:15.410> a<00:02:16.010> twin<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:20.780> know<00:02:20.840> we

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
to do especially on a twin you know we

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.320 
to do especially on a twin you know we
had<00:02:21.080> two<00:02:21.290> spark<00:02:21.650> plugs<00:02:24.820> which<00:02:25.820> makes<00:02:26.090> this

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
had two spark plugs which makes this

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:36.450 
had two spark plugs which makes this
very<00:02:26.630> very<00:02:26.959> very<00:02:27.380> easy

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460
