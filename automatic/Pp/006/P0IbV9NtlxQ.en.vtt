find that as a big problem like I said
everything<00:04:05.640> in<00:04:05.940> this<00:04:06.510> is<00:04:06.860> very<00:04:07.860> good<00:04:08.000> like<00:04:09.000> I

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
everything in this is very good like I

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.110 
everything in this is very good like I
have<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.200> sub<00:04:10.440> set<00:04:10.680> up<00:04:10.860> so<00:04:11.040> it<00:04:11.160> gets<00:04:11.280> in<00:04:11.520> the

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
have the sub set up so it gets in the

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.290 
have the sub set up so it gets in the
component<00:04:12.990> speaker<00:04:13.710> so<00:04:13.890> my<00:04:14.520> sound<00:04:14.790> audio<00:04:15.090> is

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
component speaker so my sound audio is

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:21.440 
component speaker so my sound audio is
good<00:04:16.040> it<00:04:17.040> comes<00:04:17.370> with<00:04:18.739> its<00:04:19.739> own<00:04:20.459> separate

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
good it comes with its own separate

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.380 
good it comes with its own separate
volume<00:04:22.080> which<00:04:22.950> is<00:04:22.980> key<00:04:23.460> like<00:04:23.880> if<00:04:24.060> you<00:04:24.180> have<00:04:24.360> a

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
volume which is key like if you have a

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.290 
volume which is key like if you have a
setup<00:04:24.780> like<00:04:24.810> mine<00:04:25.200> it<00:04:25.740> will<00:04:26.310> kind<00:04:27.060> of

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
setup like mine it will kind of

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.220 
setup like mine it will kind of
interfere<00:04:27.960> with<00:04:28.230> your<00:04:29.240> like<00:04:30.240> Mike<00:04:30.630> my<00:04:30.810> ipod

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
interfere with your like Mike my ipod

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.610 
interfere with your like Mike my ipod
setup<00:04:31.530> which<00:04:31.650> I<00:04:31.740> have<00:04:31.890> hooked<00:04:32.190> up<00:04:32.400> through<00:04:32.820> the

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
setup which I have hooked up through the

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.510 
setup which I have hooked up through the
tuner<00:04:35.030> and<00:04:36.260> when<00:04:37.260> it's<00:04:37.410> up<00:04:37.620> too<00:04:37.830> high<00:04:37.860> you<00:04:38.100> can

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
tuner and when it's up too high you can

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.030 
tuner and when it's up too high you can
hear<00:04:39.030> you<00:04:39.630> can<00:04:39.810> hear<00:04:40.080> the<00:04:40.350> difference<00:04:42.050> but<00:04:43.050> so

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
hear you can hear the difference but so

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.670 
hear you can hear the difference but so
I<00:04:44.070> would<00:04:44.430> put<00:04:44.640> it<00:04:44.760> at<00:04:44.940> you<00:04:45.240> know<00:04:45.390> I<00:04:45.630> want<00:04:46.440> to<00:04:46.530> put

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
I would put it at you know I want to put

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.950 
I would put it at you know I want to put
much<00:04:46.890> power<00:04:47.160> through<00:04:47.610> volume<00:04:48.420> power<00:04:48.630> through

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
much power through volume power through

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.690 
much power through volume power through
the<00:04:49.320> tuner<00:04:49.530> just<00:04:49.920> leave<00:04:50.070> it<00:04:50.160> at<00:04:50.280> 50<00:04:50.550> and

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
the tuner just leave it at 50 and

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.700 
the tuner just leave it at 50 and
control<00:04:51.060> it<00:04:51.210> through<00:04:51.450> your<00:04:52.020> regular<00:04:52.350> receiver

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
because it kind of stresses you know you

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.050 
because it kind of stresses you know you
can<00:04:55.650> hear<00:04:55.920> that<00:04:56.190> you<00:04:56.670> can<00:04:56.790> hear<00:04:56.970> the

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
thing can do it besides put in like a

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.630 
thing can do it besides put in like a
video<00:05:22.410> game<00:05:22.560> system<00:05:23.070> what<00:05:23.160> I'm<00:05:23.250> not<00:05:23.430> going<00:05:23.580> to

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
video game system what I'm not going to

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.270 
video game system what I'm not going to
do<00:05:23.760> but<00:05:24.510> you<00:05:25.170> know<00:05:25.260> the<00:05:25.470> quality<00:05:25.830> of<00:05:26.100> the

will not pick up the signal of the

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.880 
will not pick up the signal of the
station<00:05:44.970> in<00:05:45.419> motion<00:05:46.260> which<00:05:46.440> is<00:05:46.470> a<00:05:46.620> good<00:05:46.830> thing

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890
