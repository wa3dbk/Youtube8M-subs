radiation so you means there was some
kind<00:03:52.930> of<00:03:53.079> radioactive<00:03:53.980> creature<00:03:54.340> present<00:03:54.879> not

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
kind of radioactive creature present not

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.580 
kind of radioactive creature present not
likely

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
likely

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.280 
likely
there<00:03:56.859> was<00:03:57.010> no<00:03:57.220> tissue<00:03:57.549> found<00:03:58.079> but<00:03:59.079> there

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
there was no tissue found but there

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.599 
there was no tissue found but there
wouldn't<00:03:59.680> be<00:03:59.709> of<00:03:59.889> the<00:04:00.040> creature<00:04:00.280> never

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
wouldn't be of the creature never

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.600 
wouldn't be of the creature never
touched<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:01.299> city

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.710 

I<00:04:05.800> do<00:04:06.800> believe<00:04:07.430> there<00:04:07.640> was<00:04:07.790> some<00:04:08.030> organism

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
I do believe there was some organism

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.740 
I do believe there was some organism
president<00:04:09.380> Atlantis<00:04:10.010> but<00:04:10.670> it<00:04:10.790> swam<00:04:11.150> past<00:04:11.240> it

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
president Atlantis but it swam past it

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.670 
president Atlantis but it swam past it
then<00:04:12.500> how<00:04:12.770> could<00:04:13.010> so<00:04:13.310> much<00:04:13.460> damage<00:04:13.820> be<00:04:14.150> caused

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
then how could so much damage be caused

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.140 
then how could so much damage be caused

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.420

whatever<00:04:17.870> was<00:04:18.170> there<00:04:18.290> was<00:04:18.350> so<00:04:18.739> large<00:04:19.040> that<00:04:19.130> its

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430

radiation spread over the Pacific so you

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.790 
radiation spread over the Pacific so you

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:15.890 
blueprints from a man's bomb you

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.010 
blueprints from a man's bomb you
actually<00:06:16.550> think<00:06:17.030> that'll<00:06:17.479> work

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
actually think that'll work

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.960 
actually think that'll work
you<00:06:18.470> have<00:06:18.620> a<00:06:18.650> better<00:06:18.949> idea<00:06:21.729> when<00:06:22.729> can<00:06:22.940> we

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:22.970 
you have a better idea when can we

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.790 
you have a better idea when can we
expect<00:06:23.090> this<00:06:23.479> creature<00:06:23.780> to<00:06:24.020> reach<00:06:24.199> super<00:06:24.560> city

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
expect this creature to reach super city

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.490 
expect this creature to reach super city
within<00:06:25.340> days<00:06:25.879> and<00:06:26.479> if<00:06:26.599> we<00:06:26.720> don't<00:06:26.930> stop<00:06:27.319> it<00:06:27.470> now

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
within days and if we don't stop it now

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.100 
within days and if we don't stop it now
it<00:06:28.310> will<00:06:28.759> continue<00:06:29.240> to<00:06:29.389> rampage<00:06:29.870> and

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
it will continue to rampage and

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.520 
it will continue to rampage and
eventually<00:06:30.800> hit<00:06:31.400> the<00:06:31.580> United<00:06:32.030> States<00:06:32.530> we

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
eventually hit the United States we

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:34.899 
eventually hit the United States we
can't<00:06:33.860> let<00:06:34.159> that<00:06:34.220> happen

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:34.909 
can't let that happen

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:37.510 
can't let that happen
and<00:06:35.259> that's<00:06:36.259> why<00:06:36.470> we<00:06:36.620> need<00:06:36.770> to<00:06:36.800> gather<00:06:37.099> as<00:06:37.370> many

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 
and that's why we need to gather as many

00:06:37.520 --> 00:07:21.970 
and that's why we need to gather as many
heroes<00:06:37.940> as<00:06:38.090> we<00:06:38.240> can<00:06:38.509> we<00:06:39.349> don't<00:06:39.710> have<00:06:40.250> any<00:06:40.460> time
