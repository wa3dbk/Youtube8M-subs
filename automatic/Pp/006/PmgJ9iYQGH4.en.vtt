again<00:02:42.510> there<00:02:43.290> was<00:02:43.409> a<00:02:43.439> part<00:02:43.829> of<00:02:43.950> me<00:02:44.159> after

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
again there was a part of me after

watching it that wanted to go two and a

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:48.619 
watching it that wanted to go two and a
half<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:47.099> i<00:02:47.430> think<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.790> was<00:02:47.879> because<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.299> that

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
half and i think it was because of that

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.539 
half and i think it was because of that
rushed<00:02:48.930> ending<00:02:49.469> and<00:02:49.680> that<00:02:49.859> unnecessary

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
rushed ending and that unnecessary

rushed ending and that unnecessary
melodramatic<00:02:51.209> nest<00:02:52.109> and<00:02:52.469> predictability<00:02:53.099> in

melodramatic nest and predictability in

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.000 
melodramatic nest and predictability in
the<00:02:54.150> ending<00:02:54.719> but<00:02:55.019> when<00:02:55.379> i<00:02:55.409> think<00:02:55.499> about<00:02:55.769> my

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
the ending but when i think about my

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.739 
the ending but when i think about my
overall<00:02:56.459> enjoyment<00:02:56.879> for<00:02:57.299> a<00:02:57.359> dog<00:02:57.569> named
