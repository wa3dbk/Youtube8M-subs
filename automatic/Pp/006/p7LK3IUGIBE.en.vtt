00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
using the flexaway system well I was

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.410 
using the flexaway system well I was
originally<00:02:14.890> recruited<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.520> tested<00:02:16.120> a<00:02:16.210> while

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
originally recruited to tested a while

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.990 
originally recruited to tested a while
back<00:02:16.690> but<00:02:17.050> just<00:02:17.320> got<00:02:17.830> into<00:02:18.130> it<00:02:18.250> this<00:02:18.370> year<00:02:18.730> and

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
back but just got into it this year and

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.840 
back but just got into it this year and
decided<00:02:19.600> to<00:02:19.630> give<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:19.960> serious<00:02:20.140> try<00:02:20.500> I<00:02:20.850> was

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
decided to give it a serious try I was

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.770 
decided to give it a serious try I was
seeing<00:02:22.210> a<00:02:22.600> lot<00:02:23.080> of<00:02:23.110> fat<00:02:23.620> under<00:02:24.040> my<00:02:24.190> chin<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:25.090> I

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
seeing a lot of fat under my chin and I

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.510 
seeing a lot of fat under my chin and I
thought<00:02:26.560> it<00:02:26.680> would<00:02:26.770> be<00:02:26.830> a<00:02:26.860> lot<00:02:27.070> easier<00:02:27.400> than

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
thought it would be a lot easier than

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.350 
thought it would be a lot easier than
starving<00:02:27.970> myself<00:02:28.090> for<00:02:28.450> three<00:02:28.540> months

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
starving myself for three months

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.350 
starving myself for three months
so<00:02:29.840> but<00:02:30.170> yeah<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.160> definitely<00:02:31.490> works<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:32.120> it's

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
so but yeah it definitely works and it's

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.390 
so but yeah it definitely works and it's
a<00:02:32.510> lot<00:02:32.780> easier<00:02:33.020> than<00:02:33.290> going<00:02:33.560> on<00:02:33.740> a<00:02:33.800> diet<00:02:34.070> I<00:02:34.250> will

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
a lot easier than going on a diet I will

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.250 
a lot easier than going on a diet I will
say<00:02:34.580> that<00:02:34.790> so<00:02:35.210> on<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:35.390> scale<00:02:35.690> of<00:02:35.720> one<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:35.960> ten
