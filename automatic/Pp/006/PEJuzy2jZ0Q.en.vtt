00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello people i want you guys today 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.250
 welcome back in a fsx tutorial 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.460
 I 'll talk to you today 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.320
 how you find your way around like that 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.900
 everything works and so on me 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.619
 go once for the fa and once for 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.910
 Danger we start with bfa us 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.230
 We are here at the beautiful 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.880
 Airport of Stuttgart in Germany 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:33.230
 I am still at the gate with mine 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:37.230
 737 and first of all we should 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.450
 press for the radio then stand here 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.989
 below always two options or so 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.309
 At the very beginning, it's just time 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.239
 the standard what happens when you're on 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.149
 airport stands 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.690
 this can now be done on stuttgart 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.460
 Adjust on ground that is the ground 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.539
 Monitoring ground frequency which tell you 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.280
 where you have to roll and so on and on 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:03.020
 on old this is automatic 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.020
 weather with the sv feltes 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:10.290
 so now you can see up here quite a 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.750
 keep on betting all the time 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.700
 information will be sent 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.320
 that can go down permanently 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.820
 That's why we go now 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.820
 stuttgart soil 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.340
 now you can request roll in here 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.960
 every imaginable direction or here 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:34.560
 to refuel or roll to the money and 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.720
 the park area and that is only 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.229
 important if we landed on 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.720
 next airport and do it now 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.940
 just once direct takeoff is 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.190
 actually the universal thing for you 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.970
 can use everything and that has become 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.970
 then as follows 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:00.050
 then you have to stop briefly the 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.050
 instruction from the air traffic controllers 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.369
 when you 're at a runway 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.619
 then always want to go down to earth so 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.570
 on the floor frequency and then stop the 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.050
 Request free gave and still have 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.050
 to confirm 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.330
 if we have confirmed that then do 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.510
 here the option continuous role 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.480
 turn on instructions then you will 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:35.310
 Exactly on the texts Wales directed on 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.160
 the one you should be so 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.940
 I will spare you that very briefly 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.520
 if you in the meantime 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.840
 any road user in one 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.209
 ground vehicle or another plane 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.940
 should come then the or 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.880
 he also stops and says please stop 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.200
 the positions and so on that now 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.730
 but also rather unimportant you have to 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.170
 then you just have to confirm 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.730
 as good as confirm everything 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.410
 You can not even turn off the flaps 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.090
 drive without it before any 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.280
 Bank has approved but that is now 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.519
 even if we are then halfway to the 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.650
 runway then you can stand 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:12.450
 should read it either by or 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:14.340
 to hear a bit but then you can 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.080
 in any case, a Stuttgart 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.569
 control tower that has also told us 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.459
 that when we are three we are 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.849
 contact controls the Tower 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.260
 should we do it again the same 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.330
 and then got stuck down here 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.310
 route clearance we request driver 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.310
 from stuttgart control 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.820
 We would have the track clearance 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.820
 of course we also confirm 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.400
 and more scene the same as in 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.110
 are the air 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.700
 I do not know if he to this 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.189
 hear radio because I had that before 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.280
 problems a few videos that one the 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:02.390
 Fund has not heard but that is now 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.900
 not so important they hauptsache 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.040
 now, to some extent, the next one understands 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.209
 that's what comes when we speak 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.220
 it is also lifted now 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:18.049
 simply then it's the same 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:20.510
 the consequences of no not the now 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:28.310
 it helped the funkspruch it comes 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:29.500
 now things are about to come right now 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.100
 exactly 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.449
 Now there are a few again 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.430
 possibilities we can do 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.199
 after we have received the message 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.780
 You can either fly to the airport 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.740
 choose or is your first 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.940
 airports 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:47.449
 that would be for example Pattonville Day 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.280
 stuttgart and so on now you could 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:52.760
 for example a complete landing 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.250
 request from the airport again the 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.800
 Airspace over transition request that 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:01.090
 you have to stop 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.090
 we experience it 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:14.969
 you have to confirm everything again and 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:18.449
 then you will be free to d class is 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:21.240
 women so that also came back the 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:23.300
 leave sign up and so on now 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.770
 Let's go over in the approach second 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.629
 I ask the unclean fly now 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.430
 Here in the approach I just got myself 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:30.629
 only briefly offset because I have none 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.110
 highest place wound to fly when i am 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:32.939
 I am honest 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.389
 but that is only for now 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:38.219
 demonstration of the radio so let 's go 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:39.840
 full charge request that needs 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:42.620
 one at the airport to Amrum also 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.620
 country clear 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:53.669
 exactly the say then stop a 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.779
 Everything and you always have to confirm it 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:56.779
 confirm more and more 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.949
 ok before that you should stop 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:06.110
 Little information about the airport 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:08.030
 which runway is high and so on and so on 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:12.939
 so on and then there is one more 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.939
 few funk spells on the ground 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.110
 just full, the recording stops again 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:20.449
 In any case, he has to start now 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.909
 said train if possible leave 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:24.259
 You do not have to confirm anything now 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:27.469
 so on you just have to go by the 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:31.520
 roll down and then comes namely 

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:37.879
 We also have to get the next message 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:41.469
 down are so henndorf on 

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:41.469
 ground control to confirm 

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:45.740
 well because I'm just that again 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:48.129
 adjust the ground and then you can 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:51.129
 to claim the park area is more for 

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:52.879
 smaller planes for such a big one 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:55.990
 then you make traffic machines stop 

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:55.990
 your taxi to the gate 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.520
 so if you do not know exactly which 

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.530
 Taxiways are you can do again 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.920
 have to start 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:14.890
 one does the continuous role instruction 

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:16.180
 it does not always have to turn it on completely 

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.830
 Just as well as now, for example 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.960
 I know I have no desire for it 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:22.990
 to roll that's totally me 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:25.990
 Let's be honest and that will lead you then 

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:28.000
 right to your money and that was it 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:33.580
 so far, I think of the 

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.740
 FunksprÃ¼chen of four drivers the 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.640
 elfer point I'll show you another 

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.860
 part 

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.450
 that's all else in these too 

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.690
 complicated if only one after me 

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:45.640
 look for jealousy so do not care if 

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:48.070
 she still wants to see the apparatus 

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.060
 you the apparatus to missing christian 

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:49.800
 I hope I could guide you 

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.800
 help 

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.800
 bye
