Welcome to the second episode of the series

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
in which I draw famous architectural buildings

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Last time I was drawing Villa Savoye

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Today it is a building of 1935

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This building was designed by the American architect, Frank Lloyd Wright

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Was built on the waterfall

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Therefore called Waterfalling house

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Therefore called Waterfalling house

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The whole video is not accelerated

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Some moments are played back at normal speed

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And I will comment on what I draw

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Don't scroll the whole video

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Maybe I say something interesting

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.500
