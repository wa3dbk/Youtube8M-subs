00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
gonna have on screen a little bit of my

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.910 
gonna have on screen a little bit of my
little<00:00:42.270> pictures<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.050> stuff<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.890> guys

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
little pictures and stuff that you guys

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.500 
little pictures and stuff that you guys
can<00:00:44.370> look<00:00:44.550> at<00:00:44.670> while<00:00:44.850> I'm<00:00:44.969> going<00:00:45.210> through<00:00:45.390> it

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
can look at while I'm going through it

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.680 
can look at while I'm going through it
so<00:00:45.750> we<00:00:46.320> have<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.950> first<00:00:47.160> one<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.670> says<00:00:48.030> dead

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
so we have the first one that says dead

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.420 
so we have the first one that says dead
drunk<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.350> pound<00:00:49.559> shit<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.010> these<00:00:50.160> are<00:00:50.340> the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
drunk and pound shit and these are the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.450 
drunk and pound shit and these are the
coding<00:00:50.820> that's<00:00:51.030> been<00:00:51.379> previously<00:00:52.379> like<00:00:53.190> they

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
coding that's been previously like they

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.369 
coding that's been previously like they
would<00:00:53.610> those<00:00:53.940> ones<00:00:54.329> were<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.899> ones<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.289> were

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
would those ones were the ones that were

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.420 
would those ones were the ones that were
in<00:00:55.969> GTA<00:00:57.230> 1.1<00:00:59.840> 1.10<00:01:00.840> 1.11<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.859> think<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.370> is

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
in GTA 1.1 1.10 1.11 I think this is

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.810 
in GTA 1.1 1.10 1.11 I think this is
before<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.969> 1.1<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.860> update<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.070> these<00:01:05.670> are

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
before the 1.1 to update and these are

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.310 
before the 1.1 to update and these are
what<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.030> code<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.420> did<00:01:06.600> look<00:01:06.780> like<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.290> then

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
what the code and did look like and then

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.190 
what the code and did look like and then
I'll<00:01:08.159> have<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.460> one<00:01:08.640> on<00:01:08.880> screen<00:01:09.600> now<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:10.049> the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
I'll have the one on screen now of the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.630 
I'll have the one on screen now of the
1.1<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.040> update<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:12.270> says<00:01:12.510> drunk<00:01:13.640> jetpack

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
and that maybe they've already added

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.249 
and that maybe they've already added
that<00:01:55.439> in<00:01:55.590> because<00:01:56.270> we<00:01:57.270> can<00:01:57.479> get<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.840> jet<00:01:58.049> pack

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
before maybe we didn't know how to get

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.069 
before maybe we didn't know how to get
it<00:02:00.540> or<00:02:00.780> what<00:02:01.170> not<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:02.329> maybe<00:02:03.329> they<00:02:03.600> just<00:02:03.630> like

they do and offers a think it's only
just<00:03:08.190> ran<00:03:08.459> out<00:03:08.640> but<00:03:08.880> they<00:03:09.030> were<00:03:09.090> doing<00:03:09.360> like

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720
