by<00:02:35.780> default<00:02:36.110> name<00:02:36.290> mine<00:02:36.620> came<00:02:36.860> with<00:02:36.890> the

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
by default name mine came with the

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.240 
by default name mine came with the
double-a<00:02:38.120> battery<00:02:38.510> tray<00:02:38.780> installed<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.980> I

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
double-a battery tray installed and I

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.060 
double-a battery tray installed and I
went<00:02:40.400> ahead<00:02:40.459> and<00:02:40.640> installed<00:02:41.300> the<00:02:41.840> lithium<00:02:42.770> ion

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
went ahead and installed the lithium ion

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.180 
went ahead and installed the lithium ion
one<00:02:43.310> instead<00:02:43.730> I<00:02:43.970> prefer<00:02:44.570> to<00:02:44.630> use<00:02:44.690> that

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
one instead I prefer to use that

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.260 
one instead I prefer to use that
personally<00:02:46.190> but<00:02:46.400> it's<00:02:46.640> your<00:02:46.820> choice<00:02:47.000> because

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
personally but it's your choice because

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.410 
personally but it's your choice because
it<00:02:47.420> comes<00:02:47.540> with<00:02:47.600> both<00:02:48.340> there<00:02:49.340> we<00:02:49.400> go

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.990 

and<00:02:53.420> next<00:02:54.380> up<00:02:54.650> we'll<00:02:54.860> open<00:02:54.980> this<00:02:55.280> little<00:02:55.610> side

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
and next up we'll open this little side

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.340 
and next up we'll open this little side
flap<00:02:56.480> down<00:02:56.780> here<00:02:57.280> we<00:02:58.280> get<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:59.540> second<00:02:59.989> battery

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
flap down here we get the second battery

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.229 
flap down here we get the second battery
tray<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:00.890> this<00:03:00.980> will<00:03:01.130> be<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.400> lithium<00:03:01.790> ion

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
tray and this will be the lithium ion

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.350 
tray and this will be the lithium ion
one<00:03:02.510> by<00:03:02.989> default<00:03:03.500> but<00:03:03.800> I<00:03:03.860> put<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.360> double

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
one by default but I put the double

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.460 
one by default but I put the double
anyone<00:03:05.600> in<00:03:05.750> here<00:03:05.930> just<00:03:06.170> because<00:03:06.350> I'm<00:03:06.440> not

anyone in here just because I'm not
going<00:03:06.680> to<00:03:06.769> use<00:03:06.860> it<00:03:07.010> now<00:03:07.580> they<00:03:07.760> both<00:03:07.880> have<00:03:07.940> the

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
going to use it now they both have the

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.199 
going to use it now they both have the
silver<00:03:08.540> on<00:03:08.660> the<00:03:08.780> side<00:03:09.670> that's<00:03:10.670> nice<00:03:10.940> little

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
different version I'm not sure what is

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.580 
different version I'm not sure what is
different<00:03:27.520> offhand<00:03:27.970> but<00:03:28.270> it's<00:03:29.230> a<00:03:29.290> different

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
different offhand but it's a different

something like that don't know what the
difference<00:03:47.500> is<00:03:47.709> haven't<00:03:47.980> messed<00:03:48.099> with<00:03:48.220> it

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
difference is haven't messed with it

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.910 
difference is haven't messed with it
extensively<00:03:49.060> ever<00:03:49.300> and<00:03:50.290> then<00:03:50.500> we<00:03:50.620> have<00:03:50.739> not

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
extensively ever and then we have not

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.000 
extensively ever and then we have not
one<00:03:51.690> but<00:03:52.690> two<00:03:54.510> DLI<00:03:55.510> 90<00:03:55.900> batteries<00:03:56.350> and

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
one but two DLI 90 batteries and

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.660 
one but two DLI 90 batteries and
interestingly<00:03:57.700> enough<00:03:58.660> these<00:03:58.989> are<00:03:59.670> older

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
interestingly enough these are older

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.289 
interestingly enough these are older
serial<00:04:01.060> numbers<00:04:01.360> from<00:04:01.840> late<00:04:02.680> 2012<00:04:03.340> so<00:04:04.150> they

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
serial numbers from late 2012 so they

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:05.550 
serial numbers from late 2012 so they
haven't<00:04:04.450> changed<00:04:04.660> that<00:04:04.930> at<00:04:05.049> all<00:04:05.200> that's<00:04:05.470> the

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
haven't changed that at all that's the

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.229 
haven't changed that at all that's the
same<00:04:05.769> battery<00:04:06.099> if<00:04:06.459> you<00:04:06.580> have<00:04:06.670> the<00:04:06.790> Wasabi's

same battery if you have the Wasabi's

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.559 
same battery if you have the Wasabi's
you<00:04:07.480> can<00:04:07.630> use<00:04:07.750> those<00:04:07.930> too<00:04:08.349> and<00:04:08.650> it's<00:04:09.580> all<00:04:09.819> the

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
you can use those too and it's all the

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:16.319 
you can use those too and it's all the

I get this stuff out of the way real
quick<00:04:43.960> and<00:04:44.169> I'll<00:04:44.229> mount<00:04:44.380> them<00:04:44.590> a<00:04:44.740> silver

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
quick and I'll mount them a silver

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.060 
quick and I'll mount them a silver
limited<00:04:46.060> lens<00:04:46.300> that<00:04:46.570> you<00:04:46.720> can<00:04:46.870> see<00:04:47.200> the

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
limited lens that you can see the

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.670 
limited lens that you can see the
difference<00:04:48.550> in<00:04:48.820> color<00:04:49.050> there's<00:04:50.050> a<00:04:50.169> little<00:04:50.530> bit

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
difference in color there's a little bit

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.830

special edition okay here's a Pentax 31
limited<00:05:10.830> put<00:05:11.830> that<00:05:11.979> on<00:05:12.160> there<00:05:12.370> and<00:05:12.520> let<00:05:13.270> me

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
limited put that on there and let me

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.629 
limited put that on there and let me
focus<00:05:13.660> this<00:05:16.020> you<00:05:17.020> can<00:05:17.169> see<00:05:17.440> that<00:05:17.770> the<00:05:18.250> color<00:05:18.460> is

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
focus this you can see that the color is

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.760 
focus this you can see that the color is
a<00:05:18.669> little<00:05:18.789> bit<00:05:19.150> different<00:05:19.570> but<00:05:19.780> it's<00:05:20.169> overall

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
a little bit different but it's overall

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.580 
a little bit different but it's overall
pretty<00:05:21.340> close<00:05:21.700> I<00:05:22.150> do<00:05:22.840> have<00:05:23.020> the<00:05:23.139> harsh<00:05:23.350> light

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
pretty close I do have the harsh light

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.190 
pretty close I do have the harsh light
from<00:05:23.830> the<00:05:24.060> fall<00:05:25.060> windows<00:05:25.600> coming<00:05:25.930> through

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
from the fall windows coming through

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.170 
from the fall windows coming through
here<00:05:26.470> so<00:05:26.770> it<00:05:27.700> is<00:05:27.820> a<00:05:27.850> little<00:05:29.400> deceptive<00:05:30.400> as<00:05:30.940> far

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
here so it is a little deceptive as far

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.709 
here so it is a little deceptive as far
as<00:05:31.710> lighting<00:05:32.710> quality<00:05:32.919> goes<00:05:33.400> you<00:05:33.580> can<00:05:33.700> see<00:05:33.849> the

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:34.719 
as lighting quality goes you can see the

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:38.219 
as lighting quality goes you can see the
highlights<00:05:35.080> are<00:05:35.259> kind<00:05:35.439> of<00:05:35.619> blown<00:05:36.039> here<00:05:37.229> but

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
highlights are kind of blown here but

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:40.829 
highlights are kind of blown here but
overall<00:05:38.679> it<00:05:39.099> is<00:05:39.159> a<00:05:39.339> great<00:05:39.759> looking<00:05:40.330> camera<00:05:40.629> I

00:05:40.829 --> 00:05:40.839 
overall it is a great looking camera I

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:45.779 
overall it is a great looking camera I
think<00:05:41.309> that<00:05:42.309> goes<00:05:42.459> very<00:05:42.669> well<00:05:42.789> with<00:05:42.939> the<00:05:44.789> famed

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:45.789 
think that goes very well with the famed

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:47.009 
think that goes very well with the famed
FA<00:05:46.299> limited's

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:47.019 
FA limited's

00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:55.289 
FA limited's
here's<00:05:47.529> another<00:05:47.739> view<00:05:47.979> for<00:05:48.249> you<00:05:53.249> so<00:05:54.249> the<00:05:54.610> HDD<00:05:55.089> a

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:55.299 
here's another view for you so the HDD a

00:05:55.299 --> 00:05:58.079 
here's another view for you so the HDD a
Limited's<00:05:55.959> might<00:05:56.339> have<00:05:57.339> a<00:05:57.369> better<00:05:57.669> color

00:05:58.079 --> 00:05:58.089 
Limited's might have a better color

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:00.809 
Limited's might have a better color
match<00:05:58.389> but<00:05:58.719> for<00:05:58.959> me<00:05:59.799> I<00:05:59.829> think<00:06:00.069> this<00:06:00.459> is<00:06:00.639> about

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:00.819 
match but for me I think this is about

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:03.869 
match but for me I think this is about
as<00:06:01.299> good<00:06:01.419> as<00:06:01.659> we're<00:06:01.809> gonna<00:06:01.899> get<00:06:02.219> and<00:06:03.219> I<00:06:03.639> have<00:06:03.759> no

as good as we're gonna get and I have no

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:08.939 
as good as we're gonna get and I have no
