00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
I'll be compatible for most phones that

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.870 
I'll be compatible for most phones that
are<00:00:07.350> like<00:00:07.470> deed<00:00:07.770> just<00:00:08.160> with<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.370> buttons<00:00:08.700> on

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
are like deed just with the buttons on

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.430 
are like deed just with the buttons on
here<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:10.260> screens<00:00:10.769> obviously<00:00:11.550> they<00:00:11.700> slide<00:00:12.000> up

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440

also<00:01:16.530> matter<00:01:16.710> how<00:01:16.920> wide<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.520> what<00:01:17.850> mine<00:01:18.060> is

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
also matter how wide it is what mine is

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.810 
also matter how wide it is what mine is
one<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:18.659> one<00:01:18.840> half<00:01:19.110> inch<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.650> add<00:01:20.520> about<00:01:20.759> a

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
one in one half inch and add about a

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.350 
one in one half inch and add about a
half<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.390> for<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.750> wideness<00:01:22.430> so<00:01:23.430> for<00:01:24.119> why<00:01:24.299> do

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
half in for the wideness so for why do

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.010 
half in for the wideness so for why do
you<00:01:24.720> want<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.049> about<00:01:25.259> two<00:01:25.530> inches<00:01:26.009> so

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
you want it about two inches so

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.319 
you want it about two inches so
obviously<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.229> wouldn't<00:01:28.530> fit<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.040> phone<00:01:29.689> so

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
obviously that wouldn't fit the phone so

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:37.660 
obviously that wouldn't fit the phone so
um<00:01:33.350> so<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.530> need<00:01:35.150> take<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.270> first<00:01:36.509> two<00:01:36.659> pieces

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
um so you need take the first two pieces

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:45.440 
um so you need take the first two pieces
and<00:01:38.670> stick<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:38.970> on<00:01:39.299> top<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.509> each<00:01:39.659> other<00:01:44.450> i'm

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
and stick that on top of each other i'm

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.330 
and stick that on top of each other i'm
using<00:01:45.600> cosmic<00:01:46.259> tight<00:01:46.470> i<00:01:46.500> think<00:01:47.009> i've<00:01:47.159> looked

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
using cosmic tight i think i've looked

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.260 
using cosmic tight i think i've looked
over<00:01:47.579> phone<00:01:48.060> case<00:01:49.130> this<00:01:50.130> video<00:01:51.000> has<00:01:51.060> been

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270
