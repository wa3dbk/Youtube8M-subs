00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:48.880 
chickens so so what our ideal goal is

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.490 
chickens so so what our ideal goal is
that<00:00:49.090> we<00:00:49.210> want<00:00:49.239> to<00:00:49.540> harvest<00:00:49.750> all<00:00:50.170> of<00:00:50.380> our

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
that we want to harvest all of our

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.650 
that we want to harvest all of our
animals<00:00:50.950> and<00:00:51.220> then<00:00:51.850> we<00:00:52.000> want<00:00:52.180> to<00:00:52.300> feed<00:00:52.480> them

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
animals and then we want to feed them

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.600 
animals and then we want to feed them
against<00:00:52.930> straightaway<00:00:53.650> so<00:00:54.070> that<00:00:54.250> there's<00:00:54.460> no

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
against straightaway so that there's no

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.760 
against straightaway so that there's no
kind<00:00:54.820> of<00:00:54.940> long<00:00:55.180> gaps<00:00:55.480> between<00:00:55.750> harvesting<00:00:56.590> one

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
kind of long gaps between harvesting one

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.950 
kind of long gaps between harvesting one
and<00:00:57.100> they're<00:00:57.280> positive<00:00:57.790> yeah<00:00:58.000> exactly<00:00:58.420> so<00:00:58.870> we

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
and they're positive yeah exactly so we

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.060 
and they're positive yeah exactly so we
want<00:00:59.080> to<00:00:59.140> get<00:00:59.200> that<00:00:59.320> little<00:00:59.560> cycle<00:00:59.890> going

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
want to get that little cycle going

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.830 
want to get that little cycle going
although<00:01:00.880> you're<00:01:01.060> harvesting<00:01:01.300> all<00:01:01.630> of<00:01:01.720> them

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
although you're harvesting all of them

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.210 
although you're harvesting all of them
and<00:01:01.960> feeding<00:01:02.170> all<00:01:02.380> of<00:01:02.410> them<00:01:02.560> so<00:01:02.829> what<00:01:03.040> do<00:01:03.160> we

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
and feeding all of them so what do we

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.230 
and feeding all of them so what do we
actually<00:01:03.820> need<00:01:04.300> to<00:01:04.809> get<00:01:05.259> that<00:01:05.500> process

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
actually need to get that process

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.090 
actually need to get that process
running<00:01:07.240> smoothly<00:01:07.780> well<00:01:08.229> the<00:01:08.320> first<00:01:08.590> thing<00:01:08.860> is

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
running smoothly well the first thing is

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.460 
running smoothly well the first thing is
that<00:01:09.550> we<00:01:09.670> need<00:01:09.880> that<00:01:10.240> when<00:01:10.479> we<00:01:10.660> log<00:01:10.900> on<00:01:10.930> to<00:01:11.320> hay

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
that we need that when we log on to hay

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.590 
that we need that when we log on to hay
day<00:01:11.770> all<00:01:12.100> of<00:01:12.430> our<00:01:12.550> animals<00:01:12.970> need<00:01:13.180> to<00:01:13.300> be<00:01:13.420> ready

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
day all of our animals need to be ready

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.340 
day all of our animals need to be ready
to<00:01:13.780> harvest

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
to harvest

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.469 
to harvest
start<00:01:14.680> away<00:01:14.920> and<00:01:15.190> so<00:01:15.460> that<00:01:15.729> means<00:01:16.030> that<00:01:16.360> when

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
start away and so that means that when

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.810 
start away and so that means that when
you<00:01:16.630> log<00:01:16.869> off<00:01:17.050> from<00:01:17.440> hay<00:01:17.830> day<00:01:18.040> you<00:01:18.490> need<00:01:18.670> to

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
you log off from hay day you need to

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.370 
you log off from hay day you need to
leave<00:01:19.000> them<00:01:19.180> all<00:01:19.330> well-fed<00:01:19.810> so<00:01:20.050> they<00:01:20.200> get

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
leave them all well-fed so they get

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.469 
leave them all well-fed so they get
producing<00:01:21.310> their<00:01:21.460> milk<00:01:21.700> or<00:01:21.940> producing<00:01:22.360> their

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
producing their milk or producing their

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:23.850 
producing their milk or producing their
bacon<00:01:22.810> or<00:01:22.899> work<00:01:23.050> whereas<00:01:23.410> that<00:01:23.530> would<00:01:23.710> you<00:01:23.830> say

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
bacon or work whereas that would you say

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.310 
bacon or work whereas that would you say
exactly<00:01:24.670> so<00:01:24.790> we've<00:01:24.910> just<00:01:25.180> logged<00:01:25.479> on<00:01:25.750> here<00:01:26.080> and

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
exactly so we've just logged on here and

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.340 
exactly so we've just logged on here and
we<00:01:26.440> can<00:01:26.619> know<00:01:26.890> they're<00:01:27.340> absolutely<00:01:27.910> I'm<00:01:28.350> ready

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
need to make sure that we've got enough

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.599

crops<00:03:46.090> ready<00:03:46.620> for<00:03:47.620> our<00:03:47.709> next<00:03:47.949> round<00:03:48.190> of<00:03:48.400> food

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
crops ready for our next round of food

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.330 
crops ready for our next round of food
exactly<00:03:49.269> so<00:03:49.629> if<00:03:49.720> we<00:03:49.840> then<00:03:49.989> double<00:03:50.410> check<00:03:50.680> what

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
exactly so if we then double check what

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.339 
exactly so if we then double check what
each<00:03:51.519> animal<00:03:51.910> feed<00:03:52.180> needs<00:03:52.480> for<00:03:52.629> example<00:03:53.049> so<00:03:53.230> we

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
each animal feed needs for example so we

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.379 
each animal feed needs for example so we
can<00:03:53.590> see<00:03:53.709> we've<00:03:53.980> got<00:03:54.190> a<00:03:54.220> fairly<00:03:54.730> decent<00:03:55.000> amount

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
can see we've got a fairly decent amount

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.800 
can see we've got a fairly decent amount
of<00:03:55.510> corn<00:03:55.810> and<00:03:56.190> and<00:03:57.190> things<00:03:57.579> like<00:03:57.940> that<00:03:58.269> but<00:03:58.720> if

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
of corn and and things like that but if

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.150 
of corn and and things like that but if
we<00:03:58.900> check<00:03:59.139> maybe<00:03:59.319> the<00:03:59.500> pig<00:03:59.709> one<00:03:59.919> we're<00:04:00.069> getting

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
we check maybe the pig one we're getting

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.580 
we check maybe the pig one we're getting
bit<00:04:00.340> low<00:04:00.489> on<00:04:00.669> the<00:04:00.819> soy<00:04:01.230> especially<00:04:02.230> if<00:04:02.319> we<00:04:02.410> got

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
bit low on the soy especially if we got

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.990 
bit low on the soy especially if we got
the<00:04:02.709> Sheep<00:04:02.949> feed<00:04:03.220> there<00:04:03.430> as<00:04:03.609> well<00:04:03.760> so<00:04:03.910> that's
