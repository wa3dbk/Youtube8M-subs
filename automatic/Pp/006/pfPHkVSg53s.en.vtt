00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:10.230
 [Music] 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.179
 ah 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.430
 hello today we're going to see how we have to 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:17.740
 open the wines first we'll start with 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.510
 a white wine we will continue with cava 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.720
 we will finish with a red wine 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.430
 white wine or rosÃ© wine will taste 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.220
 in the same way within a 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:32.870
 bucket with water and ice we put the 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:36.250
 came and what we call lithium in this case 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.080
 Napkin or liter is the same 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.040
 we will cover the neck of the bottle with 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:44.640
 this liquid we will catch the opener 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.460
 this is a waiter opener or 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.950
 sommelier 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.630
 [Music] 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.180
 I suppose at home you have others 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:55.410
 different starters at the moment 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.110
 used this or I use this which is a 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.810
 sheet opener or butler 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:05.600
 called mostly for plugs that wines 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.600
 old and plugs that are a bit bad 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.890
 let's see the wine 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:16.530
 we will take the knife 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:20.420
 and cut below the mouth of the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.850
 came to take out the capsule 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:27.689
 because it is cut here in the past 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.759
 the capsules that is the part that covers 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.130
 the mouth of the and the cork of the bottle 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.040
 they were made of lead then they discovered that the 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.360
 Lead was contaminated and was harmful 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.700
 to health 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.560
 in this way it cuts through here and not 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.110
 there is a problem that the capsule touches the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.190
 it came when we are serving it 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.190
 we nail the opener 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.960
 always holding on so that we do not get 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.170
 twist so we avoid breaking once 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.830
 we have it for sure we finish off 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.830
 nail it all 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.039
 We take out the cork and we read it in case the 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.249
 wine had some defect 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.249
 [Music] 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.790
 we clean the neck of the bottle now 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.090
 no cork left 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.340
 and we can serve it 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.459
 in the case of the cava 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.819
 we will also serve them in a bucket 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.640
 but the way to open is different 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.600
 we would not take out 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.600
 the capsule 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.950
 and the place instead of opening it inside 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:44.460
 the garage will open it to the air because 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.950
 in the air because we hold the bottle with 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.750
 one hand and with the other hand we will hold 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.750
 the cork so that it does not make noise 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.590
 also in this way what we rotate is 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.330
 the bottle 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.770
 if we choose to make the cork it would cost us 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.310
 more open 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.220
 [Music] 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.260
 with this hand I turn and with the one on top and 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.489
 with the right I'm holding the 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.489
 cork so it does not make noise 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:20.860
 [Music] 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.780
 is also allowed at home if 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.140
 you want to shoot some relative 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.970
 It can also be done later with wine 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.760
 red 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.920
 how important they are usually 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.040
 reserves large reserves and contain 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.450
 well we never open it to the air it never 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.410
 must move the wine at the time of opening 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.700
 forever 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:46.520
 on the table in this case we have 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.530
 the ball of the 2006 blinding that goes 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.870
 accompanied with a grate this fence was 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.110
 very typical at the beginning of the century 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.450
 20 because because well the wineries 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.240
 they prevented people from faking 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.070
 the wine that was inside was a time 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.530
 of much falsification opened the 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.470
 bottles changed the wine and sold one 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.140
 bad instead of the good then 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.870
 they put these meshes of these bars 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.440
 Now it's a sign of distinction for 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.440
 open this wine 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.760
 we cut a little 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.760
 Y 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.650
 from below 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.400
 we have the mesh to the shoulders of the 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.610
 bottle 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.210
 let's remember here inside so you do not 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.680
 see 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.680
 [Music] 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:42.200
 and we can open the bottle we will take a 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.870
 napkin also a liter 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.870
 We put the bottle to touch it with the 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:52.150
 hands and the white wine came 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.150
 pink we will cut below the mouth 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.419
 we will record the corkscrew 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.230
 we will be back 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:22.250
 and we already have the three wines ready for 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.250
 serve you enjoy 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:32.850
 [Music] 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:38.710
 do not
