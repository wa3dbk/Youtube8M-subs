now<00:00:25.650> I've<00:00:25.830> used<00:00:26.070> him<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.970> team<00:00:27.210> before<00:00:27.439> but

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
now I've used him in a team before but

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.689 
now I've used him in a team before but
it<00:00:28.529> was<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.769> team<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.130> was<00:00:29.160> mainly<00:00:29.429> built

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
it was in a team that was mainly built

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.269 
it was in a team that was mainly built
around<00:00:30.060> Neymar<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:30.869> wanted<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.199> try<00:00:31.439> him

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
around Neymar and I wanted to try him

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.010 
around Neymar and I wanted to try him
out<00:00:32.369> in<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.669> different<00:00:33.059> formation<00:00:33.630> one<00:00:33.809> that

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
out in a different formation one that

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.580 
out in a different formation one that
didn't<00:00:34.320> have<00:00:34.530> wingers<00:00:34.950> him<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.219> see<00:00:35.399> if<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.820> more

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
didn't have wingers him to see if a more

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.819 
didn't have wingers him to see if a more
slow<00:00:37.590> based<00:00:38.180> possession-based<00:00:39.180> team<00:00:40.110> would

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
slow based possession-based team would

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.319 
slow based possession-based team would
fit<00:00:41.129> his<00:00:41.370> playstyle<00:00:41.790> because<00:00:42.030> he's<00:00:42.149> obviously

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
fit his playstyle because he's obviously

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.869 
fit his playstyle because he's obviously
a<00:00:42.570> very<00:00:43.200> very<00:00:43.469> good<00:00:43.710> target<00:00:44.190> man<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.610> i<00:00:44.670> think

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
a very very good target man and i think

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.840 
a very very good target man and i think
this<00:00:45.000> formation<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.690> really<00:00:46.559> really<00:00:46.739> good<00:00:47.100> for

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
this formation is really really good for

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.850 
this formation is really really good for
those<00:00:48.030> target<00:00:48.600> men<00:00:48.750> saw<00:00:48.989> striker<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:49.620> i<00:00:49.649> wanted

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
those target men saw striker so i wanted

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.910 
those target men saw striker so i wanted
to<00:00:49.920> try<00:00:50.100> out<00:00:50.160> see<00:00:50.910> if<00:00:50.940> my<00:00:51.329> theory<00:00:51.840> was<00:00:51.989> correct

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
to try out see if my theory was correct

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.770 
to try out see if my theory was correct
and<00:00:53.460> it's<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.699> really<00:00:53.879> cool<00:00:54.180> team<00:00:54.420> it's<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:54.750> a

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
and it's a really cool team it's in a

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.470 
and it's a really cool team it's in a
formation<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.530> i<00:00:55.860> think<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.370> probably<00:00:56.940> one

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
formation that i think is probably one

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.139 
formation that i think is probably one
of<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.960> best<00:00:58.289> for<00:00:58.980> keeping<00:00:59.460> hold<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.969> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
of the best for keeping hold of the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.189 
of the best for keeping hold of the
bullet<00:01:00.480> if<00:01:00.570> you're<00:01:00.719> good<00:01:00.960> at<00:01:01.079> keeping

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
bullet if you're good at keeping

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.490 
bullet if you're good at keeping
possession<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:02.520> formation<00:01:02.879> is

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
possession this formation is

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.289 
possession this formation is
unbelievable<00:01:04.500> at<00:01:04.650> every<00:01:05.040> single<00:01:05.280> game<00:01:05.580> you

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
unbelievable at every single game you

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.940 
unbelievable at every single game you
will<00:01:06.450> dominate<00:01:06.840> possession<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.500> if<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.740> can

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
will dominate possession and if you can

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.830 
will dominate possession and if you can
do<00:01:08.549> some<00:01:08.760> good<00:01:08.790> things<00:01:08.939> with<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.330> ball<00:01:09.510> you

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
do some good things with the ball you

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.350 
do some good things with the ball you
will<00:01:10.080> pretty<00:01:10.590> much<00:01:10.680> win<00:01:11.130> most<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.880> your<00:01:12.119> games

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
will pretty much win most of your games

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.270 
will pretty much win most of your games
because<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.290> defense<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.770> getting<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.070> team

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
because the defense is getting this team

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.270 
because the defense is getting this team
and<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:15.180> attack<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.689> very<00:01:16.110> very<00:01:16.320> good<00:01:16.439> now<00:01:16.710> we

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
and the attack is very very good now we

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.850 
and the attack is very very good now we
have<00:01:17.490> got<00:01:17.520> some<00:01:18.439> relatively<00:01:19.439> expensive

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
have got some relatively expensive

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.240 
have got some relatively expensive
players<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.700> here<00:01:21.060> other<00:01:21.299> than<00:01:21.680> levendusky<00:01:22.680> so

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
players in here other than levendusky so

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.760 
players in here other than levendusky so
it's<00:01:23.640> quite<00:01:24.360> interesting<00:01:24.689> because<00:01:24.900> some<00:01:25.740> of

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
it's quite interesting because some of

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.080 
it's quite interesting because some of
the<00:01:25.890> players<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.310> might<00:01:26.520> think<00:01:26.729> hang<00:01:26.970> on

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
the players you might think hang on

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.060 
the players you might think hang on
there<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.240> bit<00:01:27.450> wasted<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.170> have<00:01:28.560> Royce<00:01:28.799> in

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
there a bit wasted that I have Royce in

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.969 
there a bit wasted that I have Royce in
this<00:01:29.280> team<00:01:29.520> at<00:01:29.820> left<00:01:30.360> mid<00:01:30.600> might<00:01:30.990> think<00:01:31.259> it's<00:01:31.860> a

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
this team at left mid might think it's a

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.490 
this team at left mid might think it's a
bit<00:01:32.159> wasted<00:01:32.670> but<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:33.030> my<00:01:33.210> opinion<00:01:33.360> he<00:01:34.229> really

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
bit wasted but in my opinion he really

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.410 
bit wasted but in my opinion he really
does<00:01:34.770> support<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.280> team<00:01:35.490> quite<00:01:35.790> nicely<00:01:36.000> and

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
does support the team quite nicely and

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.319 
does support the team quite nicely and
to<00:01:37.409> be<00:01:37.530> fair<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.009> cheaper<00:01:38.490> right<00:01:39.000> mid<00:01:39.210> that

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
to be fair the cheaper right mid that

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.120 
to be fair the cheaper right mid that
you're<00:01:39.420> gonna<00:01:39.509> see<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.350> minute<00:01:40.500> was

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
you're gonna see in a minute was

bombing<00:03:16.239> up<00:03:16.360> and<00:03:16.540> down<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:16.750> field<00:03:16.900> if<00:03:17.709> you

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
bombing up and down the field if you

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.340 
bombing up and down the field if you
just<00:03:17.859> control<00:03:18.280> Ramirez<00:03:18.790> you'll<00:03:19.450> have<00:03:19.840> a<00:03:20.079> very

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
just control Ramirez you'll have a very

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.930 
just control Ramirez you'll have a very
easy<00:03:20.650> time<00:03:20.920> to<00:03:21.190> vendor<00:03:21.519> because<00:03:21.579> your<00:03:21.790> other

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
easy time to vendor because your other

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.309 
easy time to vendor because your other
players<00:03:22.180> will<00:03:22.690> probably<00:03:22.930> do<00:03:23.019> the<00:03:23.109> rest<00:03:23.260> for

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
players will probably do the rest for

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.610 
players will probably do the rest for
you<00:03:23.440> William<00:03:23.799> was<00:03:24.420> phenomenal<00:03:25.420> like<00:03:25.720> he's<00:03:26.410> got

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
a hat-trick in one of the games which is

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.110 
a hat-trick in one of the games which is
pretty<00:03:28.690> rare<00:03:29.049> for<00:03:29.650> a<00:03:29.680> right<00:03:30.190> mid<00:03:30.430> in<00:03:30.639> this

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
pretty rare for a right mid in this

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.690 
pretty rare for a right mid in this
position<00:03:31.690> and<00:03:32.440> he<00:03:32.560> just<00:03:32.769> really<00:03:33.220> got<00:03:33.340> involved

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
position and he just really got involved

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.990 
position and he just really got involved
like<00:03:33.940> he<00:03:34.180> was<00:03:34.329> always<00:03:34.690> attacking<00:03:35.470> I'm<00:03:35.829> so<00:03:36.130> so

eighty<00:04:00.430> one<00:04:00.790> pace<00:04:01.090> would<00:04:01.299> suggest<00:04:01.569> that<00:04:01.840> you'd

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
eighty one pace would suggest that you'd

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.740 
eighty one pace would suggest that you'd
think<00:04:02.290> he'd<00:04:02.620> be<00:04:02.829> a<00:04:02.859> little<00:04:03.250> bit<00:04:03.430> sluggish

compared to the Pacey strike is that a

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.610 
compared to the Pacey strike is that a

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
lot of my slides views but he's really

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.190 
lot of my slides views but he's really
not<00:04:08.829> and<00:04:09.010> using<00:04:09.819> his<00:04:09.970> dribbling<00:04:10.389> and<00:04:10.540> just<00:04:11.079> a

not and using his dribbling and just a

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.129 
not and using his dribbling and just a
few<00:04:11.230> little<00:04:11.950> skills<00:04:12.700> they're<00:04:13.630> very<00:04:13.810> effective

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
few little skills they're very effective

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:15.740 
few little skills they're very effective
like<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.349> ball<00:04:14.560> roll<00:04:14.799> and<00:04:15.010> the<00:04:15.069> roulette

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
like the ball roll and the roulette

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.539 
like the ball roll and the roulette
sometimes<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:17.410> motor<00:04:17.620> spin<00:04:17.889> you<00:04:18.010> can<00:04:18.220> really

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
sometimes the motor spin you can really

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.569 
sometimes the motor spin you can really
easily<00:04:19.000> get<00:04:19.599> past<00:04:19.870> your<00:04:20.079> opponent<00:04:20.560> I<00:04:20.709> was<00:04:20.919> like

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
I said very very impressed with how we

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.740 
I said very very impressed with how we
performed<00:04:24.250> passing<00:04:24.729> as<00:04:24.820> well<00:04:24.970> pretty<00:04:25.570> decent

loving over
to<00:04:26.770> Royce<00:04:26.980> for<00:04:27.220> him<00:04:27.340> to<00:04:27.520> bag<00:04:28.090> it<00:04:28.210> into<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.450> back

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
to Royce for him to bag it into the back

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.410 
to Royce for him to bag it into the back
of<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.750> net<00:04:28.900> and<00:04:29.050> you<00:04:29.980> can<00:04:30.280> play<00:04:30.700> so<00:04:31.240> many

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
of the net and you can play so many

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.760 
of the net and you can play so many
different<00:04:31.630> places<00:04:31.780> on<00:04:32.230> but<00:04:32.380> you<00:04:32.500> really

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
different places on but you really

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.310 
different places on but you really
really<00:04:33.580> have<00:04:33.730> to<00:04:33.910> optimize<00:04:34.389> your<00:04:34.600> possession

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
really have to optimize your possession

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.540 
really have to optimize your possession
you<00:04:35.350> have<00:04:35.560> to<00:04:35.680> make<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:35.950> most<00:04:36.100> of<00:04:36.220> it<00:04:36.310> because

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
you have to make the most of it because

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.060 
you have to make the most of it because
it<00:04:36.820> is<00:04:37.240> a<00:04:37.270> very<00:04:37.630> slow<00:04:37.870> formation<00:04:38.620> I'd<00:04:38.710> say<00:04:38.919> it's

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
it is a very slow formation I'd say it's

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.390 
it is a very slow formation I'd say it's
probably<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:40.180> slowest<00:04:40.720> in<00:04:40.990> terms<00:04:41.620> of<00:04:41.889> build

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
probably the slowest in terms of build

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.159 
probably the slowest in terms of build

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
up play and counter taxes is about you

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.560 
up play and counter taxes is about you
really<00:04:44.680> have<00:04:44.889> to<00:04:45.040> work<00:04:45.220> the<00:04:45.400> ball<00:04:45.550> about<00:04:45.820> using

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
really have to work the ball about using

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.590 
really have to work the ball about using
passing<00:04:46.990> and<00:04:47.340> using<00:04:48.340> these<00:04:48.490> little<00:04:48.880> channels

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
passing and using these little channels

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.690
