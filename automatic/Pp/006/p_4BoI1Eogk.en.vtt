00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
cooler because that's a more street

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.480 
cooler because that's a more street
rather<00:01:42.730> than<00:01:42.970> the<00:01:43.150> Nismo<00:01:43.390> spec<00:01:44.010> so<00:01:45.010> the<00:01:45.250> hood

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
rather than the Nismo spec so the hood

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.160 
rather than the Nismo spec so the hood
that<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:45.850> actual<00:01:46.150> Nismo<00:01:46.540> has<00:01:46.720> some<00:01:46.900> little

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
that the actual Nismo has some little

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.720 
that the actual Nismo has some little
vents<00:01:47.470> on<00:01:47.590> it<00:01:47.710> but<00:01:47.890> we<00:01:47.980> can't<00:01:48.220> actually<00:01:48.460> get

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730 
vents on it but we can't actually get

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:49.770 
vents on it but we can't actually get
that<00:01:48.880> so<00:01:49.030> we're<00:01:49.180> just<00:01:49.210> going<00:01:49.420> to<00:01:49.450> leave<00:01:49.630> it

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
that so we're just going to leave it

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.930 
that so we're just going to leave it
stuck<00:01:50.080> and<00:01:50.290> playing<00:01:50.560> for<00:01:50.770> now<00:01:50.890> put<00:01:51.520> some<00:01:51.729> Zen

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
stuck and playing for now put some Zen

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.210 
stuck and playing for now put some Zen
and<00:01:52.060> headlights<00:01:52.390> on<00:01:52.570> to<00:01:52.750> spice<00:01:53.680> it<00:01:53.710> up<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:54.010> bit

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
and headlights on to spice it up a bit

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.620 
and headlights on to spice it up a bit
so<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:54.700> color<00:01:54.940> we're<00:01:55.090> going<00:01:55.210> to<00:01:55.270> go<00:01:55.360> for<00:01:55.570> an

going to put that in the actual nism it

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.530 
going to put that in the actual nism it
doesn't<00:02:00.460> have<00:02:00.550> a<00:02:00.580> roll<00:02:00.850> cage<00:02:01.090> but<00:02:01.300> just<00:02:01.450> going

the bottom so for these skirts now we're

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.330 
the bottom so for these skirts now we're
going<00:02:10.300> to<00:02:10.360> put<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.570> custom<00:02:10.989> skirts<00:02:11.320> too<00:02:11.620> now

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
going to put the custom skirts too now

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.040 
going to put the custom skirts too now
the<00:02:12.370> custom<00:02:12.820> skirts<00:02:13.090> for<00:02:13.390> is<00:02:13.540> carbon<00:02:13.900> all<00:02:13.989> the

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
the custom skirts for is carbon all the

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.660 
the custom skirts for is carbon all the
way<00:02:14.140> around<00:02:14.320> it<00:02:14.500> as<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.770> extended<00:02:15.220> arch<00:02:15.459> as

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
way around it as the extended arch as

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.850 
way around it as the extended arch as
well<00:02:15.850> but<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.270> carbon<00:02:16.720> goes<00:02:17.230> over<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.590> arts

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
well but the carbon goes over the arts

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.630 
well but the carbon goes over the arts
which<00:02:18.010> we<00:02:18.130> don't<00:02:18.250> want

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
which we don't want

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.910 
which we don't want
now<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.300> spoiler<00:02:19.959> we<00:02:20.200> could<00:02:20.440> we<00:02:20.590> could<00:02:20.739> have<00:02:20.830> a

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
now the spoiler we could we could have a

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.590 
now the spoiler we could we could have a
low-level<00:02:21.190> spoiler<00:02:21.730> that's<00:02:21.940> probably<00:02:22.450> the

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
low-level spoiler that's probably the

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.760 
low-level spoiler that's probably the
cleanest<00:02:22.989> but<00:02:23.140> we're<00:02:23.260> going<00:02:23.380> to<00:02:23.440> go<00:02:23.530> for<00:02:23.680> the

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
cleanest but we're going to go for the

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.410 
cleanest but we're going to go for the
carbon<00:02:24.040> wing<00:02:24.340> because<00:02:24.580> it<00:02:24.700> does<00:02:24.850> have<00:02:25.000> a<00:02:25.060> black

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
carbon wing because it does have a black

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.130 
carbon wing because it does have a black
spoiler<00:02:25.870> as<00:02:25.989> well<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:28.420> suspension<00:02:29.020> we're

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
spoiler as well the suspension we're

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.390 
spoiler as well the suspension we're
going<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.350> go<00:02:29.440> for<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.739> competition

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400

turbo<00:02:33.520> full<00:02:33.989> so<00:02:34.989> for<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:35.380> wheels<00:02:35.620> we<00:02:35.800> could

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
turbo full so for the wheels we could

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.340 
turbo full so for the wheels we could
actually<00:02:36.220> go<00:02:36.459> for<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.700> endo<00:02:37.060> v1<00:02:37.600> now<00:02:38.050> we<00:02:38.110> could

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
actually go for the endo v1 now we could

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.900 
actually go for the endo v1 now we could
go<00:02:38.500> for<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.739> endo<00:02:38.950> v2<00:02:39.310> but<00:02:39.459> they're<00:02:39.610> a<00:02:39.640> little

it<00:02:56.530> for<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.739> build<00:02:57.010> now<00:02:57.489> Chow<00:02:57.760> is<00:02:57.910> going<00:02:58.060> to

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
it for the build now Chow is going to

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.240 
it for the build now Chow is going to
show<00:02:58.239> us<00:02:58.390> how<00:02:58.510> it<00:02:58.630> performs<00:02:59.019> on<00:02:59.110> the<00:02:59.200> road<00:02:59.410> so

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
show us how it performs on the road so

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.800 
show us how it performs on the road so
the<00:03:00.400> car<00:03:00.610> is<00:03:00.730> all<00:03:00.880> wheel<00:03:01.000> drive<00:03:01.030> so<00:03:01.480> this<00:03:01.600> gives

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
the car is all wheel drive so this gives

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.690 
the car is all wheel drive so this gives
it<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:01.989> unique<00:03:02.320> style<00:03:02.590> and<00:03:03.160> as<00:03:03.250> he<00:03:03.400> makes<00:03:03.550> for

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
it a unique style and as he makes for

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.370

some<00:03:03.880> great<00:03:04.030> negative<00:03:04.570> entry<00:03:04.810> drifts<00:03:05.230> some

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
some great negative entry drifts some

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.960 
some great negative entry drifts some
smooth<00:03:05.650> donuts<00:03:06.070> and<00:03:06.220> some<00:03:06.340> great<00:03:06.550> corner<00:03:06.880> in

as<00:03:07.120> well<00:03:07.330> so<00:03:07.570> for<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.380> donuts<00:03:08.769> what<00:03:08.920> you<00:03:08.980> guys

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
as well so for the donuts what you guys

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.949 
as well so for the donuts what you guys
want<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.489> do<00:03:09.640> is<00:03:09.850> tap<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.180> handbrake<00:03:10.690> and<00:03:10.720> up

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
want to do is tap the handbrake and up

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.720 
want to do is tap the handbrake and up
until<00:03:11.110> it<00:03:11.350> gets<00:03:11.500> into<00:03:11.800> quite<00:03:12.160> a<00:03:12.220> tight<00:03:12.489> circle

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
until it gets into quite a tight circle

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.790 
until it gets into quite a tight circle
keep<00:03:13.690> all<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:13.989> vo<00:03:14.140> analog<00:03:14.380> stick<00:03:14.590> in<00:03:14.709> the

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
keep all the vo analog stick in the

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.200 
keep all the vo analog stick in the
direction<00:03:15.190> that<00:03:15.340> you<00:03:15.490> drift<00:03:15.730> in<00:03:15.880> keep<00:03:16.180> the

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
direction that you drift in keep the

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.300 
direction that you drift in keep the
throttle<00:03:16.510> on<00:03:16.810> you<00:03:17.530> can<00:03:17.680> stop<00:03:17.920> tapping<00:03:18.250> the

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
throttle on you can stop tapping the

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.500 
throttle on you can stop tapping the
handbrake<00:03:18.610> once<00:03:18.819> it's<00:03:18.940> in<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.120> tight<00:03:19.300> circle

handbrake once it's in the tight circle
in<00:03:19.810> that<00:03:19.840> way<00:03:20.110> you're<00:03:20.710> just<00:03:20.890> going<00:03:21.010> to<00:03:21.069> be<00:03:21.160> able

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
in that way you're just going to be able

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.190 
in that way you're just going to be able
to<00:03:21.370> get<00:03:21.490> some<00:03:21.670> nice<00:03:21.880> pretzel<00:03:22.660> shaped<00:03:22.960> tire

to get some nice pretzel shaped tire
marks<00:03:23.530> on<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.710> ground<00:03:23.800> and<00:03:24.100> it's<00:03:24.190> just<00:03:24.370> quite

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
marks on the ground and it's just quite

drifts<00:03:27.550> what<00:03:27.700> you<00:03:27.790> guys<00:03:27.880> need<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.180> do<00:03:28.360> is<00:03:28.450> just

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
drifts what you guys need to do is just

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.450 
drifts what you guys need to do is just
to<00:03:28.750> eat<00:03:28.870> slight<00:03:29.440> Scandinavian<00:03:30.130> flick<00:03:30.340> so

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 
to eat slight Scandinavian flick so

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.620 
to eat slight Scandinavian flick so
that's<00:03:30.610> when<00:03:30.730> you<00:03:30.819> turn<00:03:31.000> up<00:03:31.060> before<00:03:31.540> the

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
that's when you turn up before the

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.540 
that's when you turn up before the
corner<00:03:31.930> and<00:03:32.080> then<00:03:32.200> turn<00:03:32.410> into<00:03:32.620> it<00:03:32.830> so<00:03:33.310> add<00:03:33.520> your

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
corner and then turn into it so add your

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.950 
corner and then turn into it so add your
turn<00:03:33.880> then<00:03:34.030> you<00:03:34.090> want<00:03:34.270> to<00:03:34.330> hold<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.630> handbrake

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:34.960 
turn then you want to hold the handbrake

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.750 
turn then you want to hold the handbrake
for<00:03:35.110> a<00:03:35.170> split<00:03:35.410> second<00:03:35.860> so<00:03:36.340> that<00:03:36.370> I'll<00:03:36.550> get<00:03:36.670> you

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
for a split second so that I'll get you

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.420 
for a split second so that I'll get you
into<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.060> drift<00:03:37.360> and<00:03:37.959> keep<00:03:38.709> keep<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.220> power

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
into the drift and keep keep the power

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.699 
into the drift and keep keep the power
on<00:03:39.459> but<00:03:39.940> don't<00:03:40.569> keep<00:03:40.810> turning<00:03:41.230> in<00:03:41.380> because<00:03:41.620> it

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
on but don't keep turning in because it

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.949 
on but don't keep turning in because it
will<00:03:41.800> slide<00:03:42.069> itself<00:03:42.430> and<00:03:42.730> then<00:03:43.540> once<00:03:43.810> you've

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
will slide itself and then once you've

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.170 
will slide itself and then once you've
gotten<00:03:44.170> to<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:44.530> 180<00:03:45.190> degrees<00:03:45.580> position<00:03:46.030> then

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
gotten to the 180 degrees position then

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.730 
gotten to the 180 degrees position then
you<00:03:46.270> can<00:03:46.390> start<00:03:46.600> to<00:03:46.750> counter<00:03:47.050> see<00:03:47.200> a<00:03:47.230> full<00:03:47.500> lock

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
you can start to counter see a full lock

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.130 
you can start to counter see a full lock
to<00:03:47.920> exit<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.370> drift<00:03:48.670> and<00:03:49.240> that's<00:03:49.840> pretty<00:03:50.050> much

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
to exit the drift and that's pretty much

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.110 
to exit the drift and that's pretty much
it<00:03:50.350> for<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.530> negative<00:03:50.890> entry<00:03:51.130> drips<00:03:51.430> and<00:03:51.670> now

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
it for the negative entry drips and now

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.570 
it for the negative entry drips and now
onto<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.540> racing<00:03:53.110> you'll<00:03:54.100> probably<00:03:54.310> know

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
onto the racing you'll probably know

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.830 
onto the racing you'll probably know
that<00:03:54.700> it's<00:03:54.819> got<00:03:55.030> one<00:03:55.150> of<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.300> best<00:03:55.600> top

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
that it's got one of the best top

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.380 
that it's got one of the best top
launches<00:03:56.230> on<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:56.440> game<00:03:56.680> and<00:03:56.950> probably<00:03:57.940> if<00:03:58.330> not

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
launches on the game and probably if not

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.420 
launches on the game and probably if not
the<00:03:58.780> best<00:03:58.990> and<00:03:59.350> you<00:03:59.620> can<00:03:59.740> also<00:03:59.890> go<00:04:00.130> full

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
the best and you can also go full

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.130 
the best and you can also go full
throttle<00:04:00.459> through<00:04:00.970> a<00:04:01.030> lot<00:04:01.180> of<00:04:01.270> corners<00:04:01.660> it's

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
throttle through a lot of corners it's

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.780 
throttle through a lot of corners it's
easy<00:04:02.380> to<00:04:02.560> recover<00:04:02.890> when<00:04:03.069> you<00:04:03.190> oversteer<00:04:03.670> or

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
easy to recover when you oversteer or

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.190 
easy to recover when you oversteer or
understeer<00:04:03.940> you<00:04:04.599> can<00:04:04.720> just<00:04:04.870> let<00:04:05.020> off<00:04:05.110> the

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
understeer you can just let off the

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.170 
understeer you can just let off the
throttle<00:04:05.230> and<00:04:05.650> it<00:04:05.740> corrects<00:04:06.099> itself<00:04:06.220> and<00:04:06.940> it's

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
throttle and it corrects itself and it's

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.180 
throttle and it corrects itself and it's
also<00:04:07.300> got<00:04:07.540> great<00:04:07.750> control<00:04:08.230> after<00:04:08.650> going

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
also got great control after going

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.710 
also got great control after going
airborne<00:04:09.370> as<00:04:09.700> well<00:04:09.849> it<00:04:09.970> doesn't<00:04:10.150> lose

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
airborne as well it doesn't lose

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.270 
airborne as well it doesn't lose
traction<00:04:11.020> when<00:04:11.290> you<00:04:11.380> land<00:04:11.560> again<00:04:11.830> like<00:04:12.069> most

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
traction when you land again like most

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.550 
traction when you land again like most
of<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.520> cars<00:04:13.050> anyway<00:04:14.050> guys<00:04:14.200> that's<00:04:14.440> pretty
