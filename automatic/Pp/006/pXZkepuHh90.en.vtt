00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.700
 Exact chords as they are and good as

 to open quickly with the video 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.000
 tutorial come tuning equations 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.710
 standard finishing the chords I'm going to 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.840
 teach the way of touching that this is 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.760
 difficult or dear and very pretty then 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.020
 we said with the song and well we started 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.620
 here in spaces I had a minor I 'm going to 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.620
 be a little slower 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.730
 so you see almost the entire song until the 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.730
 half of the guitar 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.890
 ah 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.189
 i 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.290
 ah 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.290
 same 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.860
 the song I'll see if until the intermediate 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.360
 be all the same everything is repeated all this 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.590
 pretty until the intermediate where it's going 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.580
 enter the sun or the guitar and here goes to 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.540
 change it and start after this 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.520
 here will change 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.650
 we are going to put here this that came to be 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.310
 the 62 but you're going to play the last 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.310
 ropes here 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.159
 all right 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.610
 they did not realize the only change is 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.400
 when the sun was going to enter the 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.650
 guitar just with jim and play them and 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.080
 sixth fifth agreement to attend everyone like that 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.080
 everything so that you can remember 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.360
 now 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.810
 Another detail that I can give you is for 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.330
 change the sound to be heard 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.360
 very repetitive instead of him I can 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.180
 put your investment and you are seeing it 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.100
 then perfect instead of me 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.690
 certain parts put investment not all 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.130
 the time I'm changing and instead of the 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.130
 mostly in the two 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.860
 then it would sound more or less and black from 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.850
 fence forms the first normal and the 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.850
 next I'm going to vary the level 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.900
 the two years 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.430
 and grab a different sound now 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.750
 let's apply with the way we play and 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.220
 of the way to touch can be a little bit 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.990
 confused what will happen in the form of 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.510
 touch is the following there are two times 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.370
 this correct complete residue has been 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.050
 complete is divided into two chords and 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.700
 when in the last two actors 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.830
 they are also divided into another base, that is, 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.990
 account are 41 23 watts then in 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.360
 a part received was lived here between 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.130
 this and this and the other part features today 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.630
 day between this one 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.800
 you have to be very careful with the 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.730
 aberration and go the following way 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.730
 also look at the dates 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.890
 look 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.860
 and so much 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.310
 plus 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.520
 and then the same thing 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.370
 but I find some more 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.480
 i 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.440
 ah 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.180
 and the arrows also in different 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.919
 colors is a color is a chord and the 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.030
 another then you already know that it is divided into 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.030
 two did not look at one 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.580
 and that's where the first boss and the 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.810
 another pattern is the same and that between 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.810
 divide between the air minutes 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.030
 ah 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.150
 brother 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.150
 ah 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.600
 two 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.600
 and they have the whole song super easy 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.010
 expression that radio war in limited 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.050
 to change the chords where they should 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.820
 be been by this video tutorial this 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.170
 can not learn comments here 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.150
