00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:11.180
 hello and welcome be tomb raider 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:14.330
 definitive edition this is the version of 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.219
 xbox one and good as you see in the title 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.110
 first impressions I could try 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.980
 both versions of both the playstation 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:25.220
 4 as the export one and good 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.690
 graphically to start in principle 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.560
 I have not noticed any difference 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:33.520
 graphic to the naked eye more or less 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:38.810
 meet both expectations 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:41.420
 and yes that noticed difference to simple 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:44.570
 view of frames per second 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.450
 this is the version of xbox one and good 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.350
 when turning the camera move around the 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:54.020
 most scored scenario better fluency 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.329
 more that goes more loose the version of 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.020
 playstation 4 thing that came talking 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.270
 that was going to 60 frames to 45 I really 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.210
 I do not know how many frames bach but yes 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.170
 has noticed that fluidity that does not give me the 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.180
 version of xbox one 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.509
 I'm lucky and I say to be able to try 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.939
 the two of them and he has given me to record the 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:18.680
 export because when uploading the video to 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.900
 youtube you will see at 30 fps 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.660
 and good as you can see the graphic quality is 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.120
 awesome we would be talking about that is 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:30.500
 let's say the PC version to the maximum already 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:33.170
 what resolution is 1080 and with the 3 fx 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.620
 activated that you may like may not 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.840
 like but it is clear that it is a point to 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:44.229
 please what these can do 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.229
 consoles and I do not know if 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.040
 Of course, this game has been different 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.270
 different studies 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.240
 the version of x force one 'and that of 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.040
 accuracy 4 we do not know if it is that they have not 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.490
 could get more export performance 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.560
 one to keep the game firm at 30 o 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.920
 that really can not give more in this 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.119
 game then good if you are thinking 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.350
 in buying one version or another because I 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.410
 I sincerely recommend the version of 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.510
 playstation 4 because it shows the 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.100
 difference at first glance is worth it 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.100
 that I can not exactly say if it's going to 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.760
 60 45 50 but yes it is true that 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:27.780
 note when turning the camera over everything 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.340
 we see how it is put here to the best 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.040
 you can get to put something blurry the 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.709
 image when you rotate the camera and at 4 you 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.329
 everything is crystal clear and 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.329
 it works very well 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.739
 If you have any doubt put it in the 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.360
 comments since they are already about 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.870
 first impressions so you can see a 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.599
 little the game and if you want me to bring 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.640
 some specific video tells me jce 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.440
 if you want to see the game if you want to see 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.430
 You have the let's play on the page 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.170
 principal 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.030
 since in its day play the version of 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.819
 pc I will put it anyway by the 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.290
 description somewhere in the video and 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.150
 if you want I say some video 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.969
 specific or if you want to raise the 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.260
 version of playstation 4 you tell me 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:14.489
 although in principle you will see the same 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.739
 because when captured it is recorded at 30 fps 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:21.900
 I hope it helps you and what I said 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:25.650
 winning version playstation 4 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.209
 If you have anything that has been 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.769
 jumped or if I was wrong in something what 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.230
 I feel very much worth it but they have been first 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.840
 impressions what at first glance has 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.819
 seemed better and worse a greeting to all 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.819
 and until the next video goodbye
