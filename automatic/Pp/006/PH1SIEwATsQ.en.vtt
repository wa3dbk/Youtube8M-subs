estimate the adult size of that dog if

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.630 
estimate the adult size of that dog if
you<00:04:51.290> get<00:04:51.470> a<00:04:51.500> crate<00:04:51.800> that's<00:04:52.040> large<00:04:52.280> enough<00:04:52.310> for

you get a crate that's large enough for
your<00:04:52.760> dog<00:04:52.940> isn't<00:04:53.180> a<00:04:53.300> dog<00:04:53.480> just<00:04:54.050> make<00:04:54.260> sure<00:04:54.290> you

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
your dog isn't a dog just make sure you

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.580 
your dog isn't a dog just make sure you
partition<00:04:55.010> it<00:04:55.250> off<00:04:55.400> so<00:04:56.150> that<00:04:56.180> it's<00:04:56.480> only<00:04:56.690> big

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
partition it off so that it's only big

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.200 
partition it off so that it's only big
enough<00:04:57.620> to<00:04:57.980> allow<00:04:58.160> the<00:04:58.190> puppy<00:04:58.640> in<00:04:58.730> its<00:04:58.880> current

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
enough to allow the puppy in its current

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.510 
enough to allow the puppy in its current
size<00:04:59.419> and<00:04:59.960> this<00:05:00.470> could<00:05:00.680> easily<00:05:00.860> change<00:05:01.100> you

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
size and this could easily change you

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.030 
size and this could easily change you
know<00:05:01.640> as<00:05:01.760> a<00:05:01.790> puppy<00:05:02.150> grows

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
know as a puppy grows

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.890 
know as a puppy grows
so<00:05:05.040> if<00:05:05.160> you<00:05:05.280> give<00:05:05.460> a<00:05:05.490> puppy<00:05:05.790> a<00:05:05.940> very<00:05:06.389> you<00:05:06.780> know<00:05:06.840> a

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
so if you give a puppy a very you know a

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.260 
so if you give a puppy a very you know a
small<00:05:07.169> puppy<00:05:07.380> a<00:05:07.680> very<00:05:08.220> large<00:05:08.430> area<00:05:08.639> to<00:05:08.790> stay<00:05:09.030> in

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
small puppy a very large area to stay in

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.420 
small puppy a very large area to stay in
when<00:05:09.630> it's<00:05:09.660> created<00:05:10.199> it<00:05:10.530> can<00:05:10.800> easily<00:05:10.949> relieve

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
when it's created it can easily relieve

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.159 
when it's created it can easily relieve
itself<00:05:11.610> in<00:05:11.880> one<00:05:12.060> area<00:05:12.270> and<00:05:12.509> sleeping<00:05:12.870> another

itself in one area and sleeping another
and<00:05:13.500> once<00:05:13.830> it<00:05:13.949> establishes<00:05:14.430> this<00:05:14.729> habit<00:05:15.150> it's

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
and once it establishes this habit it's

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.540 
and once it establishes this habit it's
really<00:05:15.810> hard<00:05:16.080> to<00:05:16.199> break<00:05:16.440> one<00:05:17.130> way<00:05:17.310> to<00:05:17.370> avoid

really hard to break one way to avoid
this<00:05:17.820> problem<00:05:18.030> entirely<00:05:18.539> it's<00:05:19.199> by<00:05:19.440> allowing

this problem entirely it's by allowing
