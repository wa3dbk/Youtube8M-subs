 how to make these cards which 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.460
 consists of a single bend and the 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.410
 decoration will depend on your 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.760
 Imagination and creativity 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.760
 let's see how to make them 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.530
 you're going to need a rectangle of 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.550
 cardboard of 30 centimeters x 20 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:32.200
 centimeters resistol scissors rule and 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.200
 things to decorate your card 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.530
 The first thing he will do is take the 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:43.300
 cardboard and make marks at 5 to 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:46.950
 10 to 20 and 25 centimeters from the part 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.950
 bottom and top 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.030
 later you will join the brands with 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.520
 a line and then with the help of your rule 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.740
 and the back of your scissors are going to 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.270
 mark each line so you can 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.270
 fold the card better 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.000
 now we proceed to bend the piece of 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.000
 cardboard as shown below 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.109

 now what follows is to decorate the card 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.120
 the way you want, I made 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.100
 rectangles with respect to measures 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.140
 of the card and it subtracts half 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.300
 centimeter to be able to take off and 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.450
 write a space between them you can 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.460
 use stickers and everything 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.660

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.660

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.100
