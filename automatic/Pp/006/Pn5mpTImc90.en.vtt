00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
important things about the show is the

important things about the show is the

strategies the surrealist drawing
strategy<00:01:40.250> so<00:01:41.649> collage<00:01:42.649> is<00:01:43.390> definitely<00:01:44.390> at<00:01:44.810> the

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
strategy so collage is definitely at the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.499 
strategy so collage is definitely at the
core<00:01:45.259> of<00:01:45.579> of<00:01:46.579> this<00:01:47.179> project<00:01:47.780> where<00:01:48.049> I<00:01:48.350> have

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
core of of this project where I have

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.179 
core of of this project where I have
collage<00:01:50.509> elements<00:01:51.079> that<00:01:51.170> are<00:01:51.320> found<00:01:51.619> that

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
collage elements that are found that

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.029 
collage elements that are found that
I've<00:01:52.429> created<00:01:53.049> that<00:01:54.049> are<00:01:54.320> directly<00:01:54.829> on<00:01:55.009> the

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
I've created that are directly on the

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.620 
I've created that are directly on the
wall<00:01:55.310> but<00:01:56.030> also<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.750> animations<00:01:57.350> are<00:01:57.590> collage

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
wall but also the animations are collage

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.859 
wall but also the animations are collage
elements<00:01:59.630> that<00:01:59.780> will<00:02:01.329> you<00:02:02.329> know<00:02:02.420> interact

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
elements that will you know interact

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.239 
elements that will you know interact
with<00:02:03.079> a<00:02:03.109> static<00:02:03.530> element<00:02:03.920> so<00:02:04.009> they'll<00:02:04.130> be

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:04.249 
with a static element so they'll be

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:07.179 
with a static element so they'll be
dynamic<00:02:05.240> moments<00:02:05.749> of<00:02:05.869> collage<00:02:06.770> that's<00:02:07.070> been

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
dynamic moments of collage that's been

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.980 
dynamic moments of collage that's been
animated<00:02:07.670> interacting<00:02:08.330> the<00:02:08.420> static

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.410 

it's<00:02:11.990> a<00:02:12.080> temporary<00:02:12.440> piece<00:02:12.800> and<00:02:13.190> it's<00:02:13.580> created

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
it's a temporary piece and it's created

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.360 
it's a temporary piece and it's created
here<00:02:14.599> in<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.780> gallery<00:02:14.959> over<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.980> course<00:02:16.190> of<00:02:16.280> a

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
here in the gallery over the course of a

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.960 
here in the gallery over the course of a
week<00:02:16.550> and<00:02:16.870> so<00:02:17.980> it's<00:02:18.980> not<00:02:19.130> always<00:02:19.340> clear<00:02:19.610> like

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
week and so it's not always clear like

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.180 
week and so it's not always clear like
where<00:02:20.180> it<00:02:20.330> will<00:02:20.450> end<00:02:20.599> up<00:02:20.750> for<00:02:21.050> me<00:02:21.170> so<00:02:21.470> you<00:02:22.099> know

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
where it will end up for me so you know

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.150 
where it will end up for me so you know
I<00:02:22.220> start<00:02:22.580> out<00:02:22.700> with<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:22.940> few<00:02:23.739> small<00:02:24.739> sketches

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
I start out with a few small sketches

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.100 
I start out with a few small sketches
which<00:02:26.030> are<00:02:26.180> kind<00:02:26.390> of<00:02:26.450> like<00:02:26.600> automatic

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
which are kind of like automatic

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.240 
which are kind of like automatic
drawings<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.709> then<00:02:28.670> I<00:02:29.290> just<00:02:30.290> kind<00:02:30.500> of<00:02:30.590> start

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
drawings and then I just kind of start

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.130 
drawings and then I just kind of start
out<00:02:31.459> and<00:02:31.760> it<00:02:32.180> kind<00:02:32.360> of<00:02:32.390> unfolds<00:02:32.870> while<00:02:33.020> I'm

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
out and it kind of unfolds while I'm

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.500 
out and it kind of unfolds while I'm
here<00:02:33.319> working<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:36.860> really<00:02:37.220> turned<00:02:37.580> into<00:02:37.790> a

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
here working it really turned into a

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.670 
here working it really turned into a
text<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:39.650> image<00:02:39.920> project<00:02:40.610> for<00:02:40.819> me<00:02:41.500> songs<00:02:42.500> of

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
text and image project for me songs of

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.650 
text and image project for me songs of
mountain<00:02:43.010> lore<00:02:43.160> as<00:02:43.459> it's<00:02:43.850> translated<00:02:44.540> is

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
mountain lore as it's translated is

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.890 
mountain lore as it's translated is
probably<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.350> most<00:02:46.120> Illustrated<00:02:47.120> text<00:02:47.750> by

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
probably the most Illustrated text by

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.780 
probably the most Illustrated text by
the<00:02:47.959> Surrealists<00:02:49.420> we<00:02:50.420> have<00:02:50.540> spoken<00:02:50.780> about<00:02:51.049> the

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
the Surrealists we have spoken about the

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.520 
the Surrealists we have spoken about the
surrealist<00:02:52.790> gesture<00:02:53.239> of<00:02:53.269> giving<00:02:53.840> drawings

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
surrealist gesture of giving drawings

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.270 
surrealist gesture of giving drawings
away<00:02:54.940> printing<00:02:55.940> them<00:02:56.090> on<00:02:56.209> newsprint<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.890> the

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
away printing them on newsprint the the

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.979 
away printing them on newsprint the the
act<00:02:58.459> of<00:02:58.700> a<00:02:59.150> gift<00:02:59.450> of<00:02:59.660> a<00:02:59.750> free<00:03:00.190> object<00:03:01.190> and<00:03:01.370> I

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
act of a gift of a free object and I

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.090 
act of a gift of a free object and I
immediately<00:03:02.989> sort<00:03:03.230> of<00:03:03.290> came<00:03:03.709> up<00:03:03.890> with<00:03:03.920> this

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
immediately sort of came up with this

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.539 
immediately sort of came up with this
notion<00:03:04.430> of<00:03:04.880> I<00:03:05.299> could<00:03:06.200> translate<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:07.069> text<00:03:07.250> but

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
notion of I could translate the text but

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.240 
notion of I could translate the text but
also<00:03:07.580> illustrate<00:03:08.569> it<00:03:08.750> in<00:03:08.930> a<00:03:09.350> way<00:03:09.500> that<00:03:10.069> would

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
also illustrate it in a way that would

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.890 
also illustrate it in a way that would
be<00:03:10.280> something<00:03:10.880> that<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.299> public<00:03:11.600> could<00:03:11.720> take

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
be something that the public could take

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.690 
be something that the public could take
away<00:03:12.110> for<00:03:12.290> free<00:03:12.500> a<00:03:13.000> lot<00:03:14.000> of<00:03:14.180> these<00:03:14.410> surrealist

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
away for free a lot of these surrealist

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.670 
away for free a lot of these surrealist
techniques<00:03:16.700> and<00:03:17.060> things<00:03:17.209> you<00:03:17.959> know<00:03:18.079> I<00:03:18.200> never

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
techniques and things you know I never

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.979 
techniques and things you know I never
learned<00:03:18.950> them<00:03:19.190> from<00:03:19.390> studying<00:03:20.390> surrealism<00:03:20.900> I

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
learned them from studying surrealism I

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:21.970 
learned them from studying surrealism I
learned<00:03:21.170> them<00:03:21.320> from<00:03:21.350> my<00:03:21.590> first-grade<00:03:21.859> teacher

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
learned them from my first-grade teacher

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.690 
learned them from my first-grade teacher
you<00:03:22.519> know<00:03:22.640> and<00:03:22.820> so<00:03:22.940> like<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.420> collage<00:03:24.200> and

frottage and all these things are just

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.060 
frottage and all these things are just
sort<00:03:27.950> of<00:03:28.040> like<00:03:28.280> normal<00:03:28.880> teaching<00:03:29.890> what<00:03:30.890> you
