00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.810
 we have 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:18.439
 Dr 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.010
 on 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.100
 Dr 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.100
 Dr 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.250
 the children is it 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.120
 so to speak core model 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.120
 our picture quality all engines 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.050
 as much as ten cents trimmed on performance 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.850
 and of course BMW Efficient Dynamics comes like that 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.850
 standard use 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.259
 is adjusted 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.340
 the round 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.720
 welcome to process tires available 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.730

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.940
 Vehicles nobody would be elongated would they be the Ostracher and that 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.470
 we are causing a stir in China 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.950
 in the new movie 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.810
 Melle if you can do it 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.600
 so to develop these proportions 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.940
 then the city will send 60 percent cheaper 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.360

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.640
 the teacher stopped 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.010
 the master dreams customers want in this street 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.700
 they know each other only for our brand 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.380
 and finally to be in the final 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.870
 that's why I would say 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.950
 maybe he means for the new one 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.780
