mind<00:02:19.000> is<00:02:19.450> that<00:02:19.750> they<00:02:19.930> are<00:02:20.140> in<00:02:20.349> the<00:02:20.470> environment

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
mind is that they are in the environment

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.289 
mind is that they are in the environment
as<00:02:21.220> well<00:02:21.430> as<00:02:21.790> in<00:02:21.909> the<00:02:22.030> bird<00:02:22.209> and<00:02:22.540> you<00:02:23.079> often<00:02:23.290> get

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
as well as in the bird and you often get

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.640 
as well as in the bird and you often get
recontamination<00:02:25.299> and<00:02:25.689> you<00:02:25.810> need<00:02:26.019> to<00:02:26.170> get<00:02:26.319> rid

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
recontamination and you need to get rid

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.910 
recontamination and you need to get rid
of<00:02:26.709> you<00:02:27.489> need<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.760> get<00:02:27.909> rid<00:02:28.150> of<00:02:28.209> all<00:02:28.599> that<00:02:28.920> reset

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
of you need to get rid of all that reset

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.940 
of you need to get rid of all that reset
those<00:02:30.069> residual<00:02:31.079> bugs<00:02:32.079> that<00:02:32.409> are<00:02:32.470> out<00:02:32.680> there

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
those residual bugs that are out there

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.610 
those residual bugs that are out there
so<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.579> three<00:02:34.060> weeks<00:02:34.299> apart<00:02:34.450> three<00:02:35.379> doses

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
so the three weeks apart three doses

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.160 
so the three weeks apart three doses
should<00:02:36.310> clean<00:02:36.610> your<00:02:36.640> Avery<00:02:37.120> up<00:02:37.269> then<00:02:37.959> you<00:02:38.140> go
