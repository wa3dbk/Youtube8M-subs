00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 figures here command plays and today for 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.799
 teach like another from to 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:14.850
 the biggest tutorial the best your tutor and 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:19.310
 today to mop come 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.859
 Today I will explain 5 ways 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.500
 very important to bring the most 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:29.580
 good and today 5 forms of peeled 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.710
 the 1 through bid look at the players 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.809
 that are about to end and those that 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.270
 still predators are cheap 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.430
 selections and bids when you see that 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.309
 they are in an amount in which they no longer 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.500
 you're going to take out just coins and the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.540
 pre-selection removals by others 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.199
 another way to do it by puja 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:52.350
 Extending the criteria maximum price 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:55.320
 200 or 250 this the players that we see 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.970
 to 150 initial price that have a value 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.950
 very big we keep it in preselection 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.720
 and when they go to finish we look at 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.079
 will save the bid 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.350
 now the method 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.930
 this is also through bidding but 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:12.500
 I prefer to prefer in a section 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.899
 apart but it does not matter is to look 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.570
 Gold players without brightness at price 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:20.750
 maximum of 250 those who see the 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.909
 stripped to 250 and you forget that is 7 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.520
 they surpass they do not return they do not return to bid 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.930
 in this way they have lincoln series of 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.320
 lose coins in the worst case 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.570
 I would rule it out that there are already 50 coins 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.220
 benefit seems not but doing 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.210
 this can be abusively removed 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.640
 considerable amount of coins this does not 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.310
 it's all there are many gold players without 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.720
 Brightness sold easy to 500 purchase 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.649
 already or even more 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.679
 anderson from manchester united rafael 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:57.020
 wise arsenal vips 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:58.970
 koski leslie or how would it be and so on 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.280
 all to players of the premiere of this 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.860
 way of seeing them at 450 initial price 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.200
 of 500 would buy 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.320
 the benefits would no longer be 50 currencies 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.610
 that we would follow the 200 250 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.510
 net coins that should be noted that 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.490
 as I said not all players 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.830
 are sold at 500 already easy to buy 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.680
 find and have very good games but 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.680
 I have done it like this form has 50 if 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.440
 You put a player at 450 initial price of 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.730
 500 buy now on sale three times and 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.520
 you see that no one bought it for you 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.810
 letters if you take 50 the fire can be 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.240
 it can be done with the tightening 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.050
 buying the 550 and coming to the 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.960
 less than 750 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:44.110
 I'm doing this for a while 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.760
 long and certainly is fine because no 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.980
 it loses a lot of time what it did is that 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.590
 before going to bed I pushed for 150 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.260
 shiny gold players 600 coins 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.510
 and surely someone took me and is 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.390
 awards could sell up to a thousand and one 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.800
 coins the same very good method 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:06.820
 everything works and the tea is the most 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:10.180
 rooted but if you get it you gain a 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.920
 lot of money to monopolize the 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.330
 fifa market 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.810
 that 's a free market so 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:22.060
 5% although it takes it away and therefore 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.740
 You can buy all the cards that you have 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.600
 of a player in the market and put them to 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.600
 the sale at a much higher price 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.550
 this form can be very affected but 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.380
 it is also a form of this hatred if 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.870
 In addition to the cards you own your 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.850
 besides that guy in the market is in 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.100
 very complicated to take profit with this 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.650
 trade form or asked me on Mondays 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.020
 in the market and I put them all to 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.860
 four very very affected because if 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.190
 we buy 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.830
 the bars but if you get st4 the 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:54.160
 market roles will come the moment in 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.710
 that someone wants to rolle and that at 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.600
 see that there are no devices buy it in 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.820
 this is this method this is no longer 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.830
 applicable to the nor fÃ©lix versions and are 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.840
 the orange and blue black letters already 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.520
 that others continue to come out in envelopes 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.520
 and it is impossible to monopolize it 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.750
 Another way 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.090
 but for when you have a big 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.019
 amount of money is to put price 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.329
 minimum 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.639
 they have coins to avoid everyone 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.500
 those of price less than there is too much 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.690
 so 2k players who go for a price 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.390
 lower real inequality tries to take you 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.900
 through bids 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:36.940
 and well this is the trick I'm going to 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:40.600
 explain now is the last one that is 5 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.600
 and good 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:48.270
 in minute 59 the trick is called minute 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.220
 59 this consists of putting some criteria 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.130
 of search that fit your currency 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:57.090
 for example if you have 50 here then a thousand 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:59.070
 initial price and 50 of the price of 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.380
 buy and elite at minute 59 when 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.050
 you are at minute 59 the players that 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.960
 see that they are at a purchase price already 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:10.020
 lower your professional by shopping 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:13.320
 they sell their price what I usually 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.300
 do I have already seen all the ways of 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.950
 try possible now I am going to show you 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.870
 What I do personally is that 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.009
 thanks to this I got the team 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.529
 that I have now 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:26.469
 what I do is that the player who 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:28.629
 be from 4000 per beach and as 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:30.309
 maximum boxes that are because I made 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:33.460
 alright I'm going to a league of great 

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:36.490
 would be barclays bbva is with player who 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.129
 be for the price that we have said but 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.809
 the purchase price already lower than this 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:44.919
 player and I put auction at the price 

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:47.229
 reduced by a thousand to see if I take 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:48.669
 some and get benefits with a 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:50.469
 example I will understand it better for example 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:53.800
 richard Seeking the right side of 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:55.919
 manchester city the lowest price 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.319
 time to buy the 4 thousand 500 coins 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:03.039
 so now he deleted the purchase and I put 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:04.930
 push the 3700 maximum price add all 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:08.770
 the players that come out to me try 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:11.559
 bet up to 3,700 every day 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:14.199
 several once I 've taken some 

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:16.659
 equal to the minimum purchase price 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:20.050
 I saw when the customer is buying 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:22.869
 sure if you are taking coins today 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.249
 minimums of the game what is important 

00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:25.839
 is that I have to say is that 

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:27.100
 depending on the formation a player 

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:28.720
 it's more or less 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.270
 that you pay attention to the price you have 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.680
 a player for each formation because yes 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.900
 they can not cheat you and lose a lot 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.150
 money is important that not only do you 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.820
 you feel in a player the bigger 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:42.500
 be the field of players that you know the 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:48.980
 your best price will be your 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:50.840
 well thanks now I do not know whether to say the 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.280
 some players have already made some 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:58.290
 how many but 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:07:02.310
 I say sneijder 6000 but the 7000 pp 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:05.040
 9000 alonso you can buy it for 6000 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:09.180
 so they can sell it for 9 thousand 9 thousand 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:13.230
 and half a cavani 7 can sell it for 7 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:17.160
 thousand and the purchase 5500 mario gÃ³mez but 

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:20.550
 well for 4000 and sell it for 6000 of 

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:23.490
 rossi for 2500 and can sell it for 5 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:25.380
 thousand 6 thousand 10,000 possibly all for 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:29.930
 three thousand can sell it for 5,000 or 

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:32.340
 6,000 Suarez per 10,000 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:38.400
 look good and I can not have for 20 thousand 

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:41.910
 28 emails and the best range in this has been 

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.590
