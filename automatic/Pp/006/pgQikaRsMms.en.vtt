four then we've got EEO ta I helped
vector<00:00:15.870> them<00:00:15.990> this<00:00:16.170> design<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:17.039> he<00:00:17.490> came<00:00:17.609> to

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
vector them this design and he came to

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.390 
vector them this design and he came to
me<00:00:17.880> with<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.090> black<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.510> white<00:00:18.600> sketch<00:00:18.930> i

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
me with a black and white sketch i

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.859 
me with a black and white sketch i
developing<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:20.609> turned<00:00:20.789> out<00:00:20.910> super<00:00:21.300> super

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
developing and it turned out super super

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.349 
developing and it turned out super super
nice<00:00:22.100> first<00:00:23.100> time<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.340> had<00:00:23.490> really<00:00:23.730> done<00:00:23.939> like<00:00:24.330> a

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
nice first time I had really done like a

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.439 
nice first time I had really done like a
I<00:00:24.869> guess<00:00:25.289> realistic<00:00:25.920> coloring<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.670> vector

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
I guess realistic coloring to a vector

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.050 
I guess realistic coloring to a vector
image<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:28.109> like<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.529> guess<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> lot<00:00:29.099> digital

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
image so like I guess a lot digital

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.510 
image so like I guess a lot digital
painting<00:00:30.480> almost<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:31.529> they're<00:00:31.650> not<00:00:31.800> cool<00:00:32.009> he

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
painting almost that they're not cool he

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.040 
painting almost that they're not cool he
was<00:00:32.640> really<00:00:32.820> happy<00:00:32.969> with<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.390> then<00:00:33.930> we've

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
was really happy with that then we've

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.130 
was really happy with that then we've
got<00:00:34.200> another<00:00:34.460> GE<00:00:35.460> f<00:00:35.700> TD<00:00:36.300> inkjet<00:00:36.780> vinyls

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
got another GE f TD inkjet vinyls

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.220 
got another GE f TD inkjet vinyls
hundred<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.620> those<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.460> then<00:00:38.579> 104<00:00:39.210> fig<00:00:39.750> moons

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
hundred of those and then 104 fig moons

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.889 
hundred of those and then 104 fig moons
he<00:00:40.739> left<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.340> line<00:00:41.550> on<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.910> border<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.780> he

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
he left the line on the border so he

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.470 
he left the line on the border so he
could<00:00:43.050> do<00:00:43.500> some<00:00:43.680> die<00:00:43.829> cuts<00:00:44.100> himself<00:00:44.550> he<00:00:45.450> just

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
could do some die cuts himself he just

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.690 
could do some die cuts himself he just
wanted<00:00:45.899> them<00:00:46.079> cheaper<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.280> if<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.460> would<00:00:47.579> do

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
wanted them cheaper so if you would do

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.790 
wanted them cheaper so if you would do
the<00:00:47.730> cutting<00:00:48.120> himself<00:00:48.559> next<00:00:49.559> up<00:00:49.649> we've<00:00:49.770> got

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
the cutting himself next up we've got

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.920 
the cutting himself next up we've got
some<00:00:50.100> four<00:00:50.250> blind<00:00:50.520> two<00:00:51.000> different<00:00:51.270> designs<00:00:51.600> a

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
some four blind two different designs a

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.619 
some four blind two different designs a
hundred<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.500> each<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.039> both<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.210> three<00:00:54.420> by<00:00:54.570> four

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
hundred of each and both a three by four

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.770 
hundred of each and both a three by four
in<00:00:56.600> thermals

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
in thermals

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.529 
in thermals
next<00:00:58.320> up<00:00:58.469> she'll<00:00:59.190> got<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.579> couple<00:01:00.359> different

got a hundred of these and then 104 by

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.130 
got a hundred of these and then 104 by
four<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.659> these<00:01:13.590> designs<00:01:13.979> he's<00:01:14.159> gotten

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
four of these designs he's gotten

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.570 
four of these designs he's gotten
variants<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.290> those<00:01:16.530> before<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.189> don't<00:01:17.280> think

variants of those before I don't think

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.830 
variants of those before I don't think
he's<00:01:17.759> gotten<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.119> one<00:01:18.299> before<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.570> know<00:01:18.659> he's

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
he's gotten this one before I know he's

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.740 
he's gotten this one before I know he's
gotten<00:01:19.110> variant<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.830> Chron<00:01:20.820> got<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
last of the 200 for my four super

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.100 
last of the 200 for my four super
special<00:01:24.060> he<00:01:25.100> got<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.310> with<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:27.390> design<00:01:27.810> it

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
special he got on with this design it

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.520 
special he got on with this design it
was<00:01:28.579> running<00:01:29.579> for<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.759> couple<00:01:30.000> weeks<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.530> he

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
was running for a couple weeks and he

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.800 
was running for a couple weeks and he
just<00:01:31.710> was<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.460> little<00:01:32.610> slow<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.030> getting<00:01:33.540> me<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
just was a little slow on getting me the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.990 
just was a little slow on getting me the
image<00:01:34.170> there<00:01:34.920> was<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.070> little<00:01:35.250> bit<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.430> mix-up

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
image there was a little bit of mix-up

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.330 
image there was a little bit of mix-up
there<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:37.110> it's<00:01:37.590> not<00:01:37.710> available<00:01:38.130> anymore

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
there so that it's not available anymore

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.690 
there so that it's not available anymore
but<00:01:38.729> these<00:01:39.509> were<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.290> last<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.680> them<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.100> CK

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
but these were the last of them so CK

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.870 
but these were the last of them so CK
