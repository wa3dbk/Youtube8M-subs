okay<00:01:27.360> who<00:01:27.840> could<00:01:28.049> do<00:01:28.229> one<00:01:30.140> he<00:01:31.140> takes<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.680> sin

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
okay who could do one he takes the sin

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:41.990 
okay who could do one he takes the sin
ID<00:01:32.040> form<00:01:36.979> he<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.100> taking<00:01:40.159> didn't<00:01:41.159> expect<00:01:41.880> that

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
ID form he is taking didn't expect that

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.700 
ID form he is taking didn't expect that
but<00:01:42.600> okay<00:01:42.799> he<00:01:43.799> can<00:01:44.040> play<00:01:44.220> it

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.399 

yeah<00:01:51.710> with<00:01:51.979> Bishop<00:01:52.310> b3<00:01:52.659> coming<00:01:56.020> white<00:01:57.020> some

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
yeah with Bishop b3 coming white some

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.940 
yeah with Bishop b3 coming white some
rationale<00:01:58.310> here<00:01:58.340> is<00:01:58.760> that<00:01:58.970> the<00:01:59.510> bishop<00:01:59.690> on<00:02:00.050> h5

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
rationale here is that the bishop on h5

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.420 
rationale here is that the bishop on h5
is<00:02:01.220> somewhat<00:02:01.640> off<00:02:01.670> side<00:02:02.950> it<00:02:03.950> is<00:02:04.010> some<00:02:06.430> very

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
is somewhat off side it is some very

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.520 
is somewhat off side it is some very
often<00:02:07.880> not<00:02:08.060> not<00:02:08.390> doing<00:02:08.690> much<00:02:08.869> I<00:02:11.200> tried<00:02:12.200> to<00:02:12.350> play

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
often not not doing much I tried to play

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.010 
often not not doing much I tried to play
this<00:02:12.800> quickly<00:02:13.190> because<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:13.820> know<00:02:13.880> that<00:02:14.240> he<00:02:14.870> is<00:02:14.900> a

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
this quickly because I know that he is a

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.870 
this quickly because I know that he is a
very<00:02:15.489> fast<00:02:16.489> player<00:02:17.000> at<00:02:18.250> at<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.459> end<00:02:19.640> so<00:02:19.850> I

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
very fast player at at the end so I

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.770 
very fast player at at the end so I
don't<00:02:20.150> want<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.510> get<00:02:22.030> totally<00:02:23.030> behind<00:02:23.239> on<00:02:23.630> the

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
don't want to get totally behind on the

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:36.040 
don't want to get totally behind on the
clock<00:02:25.150> let's<00:02:26.150> see<00:02:31.900> yeah<00:02:32.900> I<00:02:33.110> think<00:02:34.239> g4<00:02:35.239> f4<00:02:35.900> is<00:02:35.930> a

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
clock let's see yeah I think g4 f4 is a

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.440 
clock let's see yeah I think g4 f4 is a
bit<00:02:36.410> birdie<00:02:36.850> should<00:02:37.850> probably<00:02:40.120> control<00:02:41.120> C

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
bit birdie should probably control C

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:56.210 
bit birdie should probably control C
five-year<00:02:44.590> g4<00:02:45.590> a<00:02:45.830> form

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220
