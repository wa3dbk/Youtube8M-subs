looks<00:01:42.509> like<00:01:42.630> an<00:01:42.720> F<00:01:42.869> right<00:01:43.110> there<00:01:43.409> with<00:01:43.619> a

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
looks like an F right there with a

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.859 
looks like an F right there with a
circle<00:01:44.070> on<00:01:44.189> top<00:01:44.220> if<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:45.390> were<00:01:45.509> looking<00:01:45.780> at

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
circle on top if you were looking at

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.289 
circle on top if you were looking at
like<00:01:46.020> kind<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.009> like<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.460> was<00:01:47.670> him<00:01:47.909> kind<00:01:48.270> of

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
like kind of like this was him kind of

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.569 
like kind of like this was him kind of
like<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.689> here's<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.320> long<00:01:49.979> part<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.460> F

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
like that here's the long part of the F

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.100 
like that here's the long part of the F
and<00:01:50.790> here's<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.090> other<00:01:51.210> that's<00:01:51.869> how<00:01:52.049> I'm

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
and here's the other that's how I'm

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.200 
and here's the other that's how I'm
seeing<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.560> but<00:01:52.740> just<00:01:53.250> hiding<00:01:53.790> right<00:01:53.909> between

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
seeing it but just hiding right between

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.690 
seeing it but just hiding right between
the<00:01:54.420> rover's<00:01:54.780> legs<00:01:54.990> there<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.829> more<00:01:56.130> look<00:01:56.579> at

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
the rover's legs there and more look at

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.520 
the rover's legs there and more look at
that<00:01:56.850> look<00:01:57.030> at<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.180> symmetry<00:01:57.689> in<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.380> was

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
that look at the symmetry in that it was

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.109 
that look at the symmetry in that it was
looks<00:01:58.740> like<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.860> wall<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.310> find<00:01:59.610> down<00:01:59.790> at<00:02:00.000> puma

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
looks like a wall you find down at puma

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.750 
of it and sit down here that perfect
circle<00:02:08.039> can't<00:02:08.429> be<00:02:08.550> cooler<00:02:08.759> than<00:02:08.879> that

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.270 

up<00:02:12.629> here<00:02:12.989> on<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.260> ridge<00:02:13.470> you<00:02:13.680> can<00:02:13.860> see<00:02:14.069> these

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
up here on the ridge you can see these

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.100 
up here on the ridge you can see these
big<00:02:14.519> huge<00:02:14.790> rocks<00:02:15.180> kind<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.569> strong<00:02:15.840> about

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
big huge rocks kind of strong about

big huge rocks kind of strong about
they'll<00:02:16.500> kind<00:02:16.799> of<00:02:17.010> uh<00:02:17.040> look<00:02:17.700> pretty<00:02:17.939> big<00:02:18.150> like

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
they'll kind of uh look pretty big like

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:19.490 
they'll kind of uh look pretty big like
they<00:02:18.480> could<00:02:18.629> have<00:02:18.720> been<00:02:18.780> used<00:02:19.019> at<00:02:19.170> one<00:02:19.290> time

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
they could have been used at one time

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.369 
they could have been used at one time
and<00:02:19.860> they<00:02:20.459> seemed<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.819> be<00:02:21.000> kind<00:02:21.269> of<00:02:21.510> shaped<00:02:22.170> out

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
and they seemed to be kind of shaped out

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.780 
and they seemed to be kind of shaped out
a<00:02:22.409> little<00:02:22.650> bit<00:02:22.829> like<00:02:23.040> they<00:02:23.159> were<00:02:23.280> used<00:02:23.489> at<00:02:23.640> one

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
a little bit like they were used at one

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.630 
a little bit like they were used at one
time<00:02:24.000> for<00:02:24.299> something<00:02:24.560> here<00:02:25.560> more<00:02:25.980> more<00:02:26.519> of

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
time for something here more more of

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.600 
time for something here more more of
them<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:26.909> are<00:02:26.970> kind<00:02:27.180> of<00:02:27.239> shaped<00:02:27.450> out<00:02:28.549> up<00:02:29.549> here

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
them that are kind of shaped out up here

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.890 
them that are kind of shaped out up here
you've<00:02:30.000> got<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.209> couple<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.629> are<00:02:30.690> actually

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
you've got a couple that are actually

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.690 
you've got a couple that are actually
round<00:02:31.290> look<00:02:31.560> here<00:02:31.769> you've<00:02:31.890> got<00:02:31.920> some<00:02:32.250> circular

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
round look here you've got some circular

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.520 
round look here you've got some circular
type<00:02:32.909> ones<00:02:33.209> up<00:02:33.420> there<00:02:33.450> it's<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.319> little<00:02:34.409> bit

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
type ones up there it's a little bit

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.039 
type ones up there it's a little bit
darker<00:02:35.010> hard<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.459> see<00:02:35.670> that's<00:02:36.659> one<00:02:36.840> looks<00:02:37.019> like

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
darker hard to see that's one looks like

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.440 
darker hard to see that's one looks like
a<00:02:37.170> perfect<00:02:37.530> little<00:02:37.650> triangle<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.549> it<00:02:39.180> kind<00:02:39.390> of

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
a perfect little triangle and it kind of

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.059 
a perfect little triangle and it kind of
goes<00:02:39.569> up<00:02:39.810> over<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.170> hill<00:02:40.319> you<00:02:40.560> can<00:02:40.590> see<00:02:40.950> you

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
goes up over the hill you can see you

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.530 
goes up over the hill you can see you
really<00:02:41.159> can't<00:02:41.459> see<00:02:41.519> what's<00:02:41.849> up<00:02:42.030> over<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.359> hill

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
really can't see what's up over the hill

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.729 
really can't see what's up over the hill
but<00:02:42.840> if<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.500> look<00:02:43.650> at<00:02:43.799> the<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:45.590> love<00:02:46.590> this

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
but if you look at the I love this

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.110 
but if you look at the I love this
camera<00:02:46.980> this<00:02:47.159> camera<00:02:47.250> does<00:02:47.579> get<00:02:47.760> some<00:02:47.970> good

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
camera this camera does get some good

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.610 
camera this camera does get some good
pictures<00:02:48.180> especially<00:02:48.780> when<00:02:49.140> it's<00:02:49.290> like<00:02:49.470> doing

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
pictures especially when it's like doing

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.129 
pictures especially when it's like doing
up<00:02:49.859> close<00:02:50.129> stuff<00:02:50.459> you've<00:02:51.299> really<00:02:51.629> take<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:51.900> look

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
up close stuff you've really take a look

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:53.899 
up close stuff you've really take a look
at<00:02:52.290> how<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.500> wear<00:02:52.829> and<00:02:52.980> tear<00:02:53.069> has<00:02:53.400> been<00:02:53.579> going

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
at how the wear and tear has been going

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:58.280 
at how the wear and tear has been going
on<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.180> machines<00:02:56.599> what's<00:02:57.599> interesting<00:02:57.780> is

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
on the machines what's interesting is

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.990 
on the machines what's interesting is
the<00:02:58.470> red<00:02:58.709> of<00:02:58.980> everything<00:02:59.459> here<00:02:59.760> and<00:02:59.909> how

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
the red of everything here and how

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.849 
the red of everything here and how
everything's<00:03:00.480> just<00:03:00.720> got<00:03:00.900> that<00:03:01.139> if<00:03:01.379> you<00:03:01.739> look

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
everything's just got that if you look

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.099 
everything's just got that if you look
at<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.010> one<00:03:02.250> back<00:03:02.549> at<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.940> shop<00:03:03.540> it's<00:03:03.599> just

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
at the one back at the shop it's just

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.649 
at the one back at the shop it's just
totally<00:03:04.500> different<00:03:05.090> they<00:03:06.090> showed<00:03:06.299> us<00:03:06.420> some<00:03:06.569> of

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
totally different they showed us some of

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:07.879 
totally different they showed us some of
the<00:03:06.720> pictures<00:03:06.870> look<00:03:07.079> at<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.260> wheels<00:03:07.470> it's<00:03:07.769> how

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889 
the pictures look at the wheels it's how

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:09.530 
the pictures look at the wheels it's how
busted<00:03:08.370> they<00:03:08.519> are<00:03:08.700> from<00:03:08.940> being<00:03:09.180> out<00:03:09.299> there<00:03:09.480> on

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
busted they are from being out there on

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.479 
busted they are from being out there on
the<00:03:09.750> surface<00:03:10.139> travel<00:03:11.099> and<00:03:11.190> this<00:03:11.280> thing's

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
the surface travel and this thing's

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.569 
the surface travel and this thing's
pretty<00:03:11.670> awesome<00:03:12.209> but<00:03:12.530> Picabo<00:03:13.530> what<00:03:14.340> do<00:03:14.459> we

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
pretty awesome but Picabo what do we

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.430 
pretty awesome but Picabo what do we
have<00:03:14.760> up<00:03:15.000> here<00:03:15.030> on<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.599> ridge<00:03:15.780> we<00:03:16.049> got<00:03:16.199> this

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
have up here on the ridge we got this

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.949 
have up here on the ridge we got this
over<00:03:16.799> here<00:03:17.099> and<00:03:17.449> then<00:03:18.449> see<00:03:18.840> that's

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
over here and then see that's
