00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
these files over first by the way

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.010 
these files over first by the way
because<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:29.479> recognize<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.509> doesn't<00:01:30.900> really

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
because it recognize it doesn't really

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.080 
because it recognize it doesn't really
recognize<00:01:31.200> external<00:01:31.979> drives<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.490> things<00:01:32.700> so

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
now we're going to go back and reverse

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.679 
now we're going to go back and reverse
layer<00:01:36.990> order<00:01:38.119> because<00:01:39.119> they're<00:01:39.270> all<00:01:39.329> mixed<00:01:39.509> up

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
layer order because they're all mixed up

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.679 
layer order because they're all mixed up
right<00:01:39.900> or<00:01:40.140> backwards<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.189> just<00:01:41.570> give<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.659> a

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
right or backwards and just give it a

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.060 
right or backwards and just give it a
sec<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.960> do<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.350> now<00:01:43.649> we're<00:01:43.740> going<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.890> go

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
sec to do that now we're going to go

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.560 
sec to do that now we're going to go
back<00:01:44.909> up<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.329> layer<00:01:46.820> and<00:01:47.820> we're<00:01:48.299> going<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.479> go

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
back up to layer and we're going to go

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.929 
back up to layer and we're going to go
down<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.259> mask<00:01:49.560> then<00:01:50.460> we're<00:01:50.549> going<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.700> add

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
down and to mask then we're going to add

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.670 
down and to mask then we're going to add
layer<00:01:51.180> mask<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:52.020> then<00:01:52.259> we're<00:01:52.380> going<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.530> pull

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
layer mask and then we're going to pull

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.999 
layer mask and then we're going to pull
out<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:53.009> window<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.750> select<00:01:54.750> black<00:01:55.049> full

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
out that window and select black full

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.249 
out that window and select black full
transparency<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.119> then<00:01:57.869> click<00:01:58.170> add<00:01:58.670> and<00:02:00.259> now

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
transparency and then click add and now

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.780 
transparency and then click add and now
we've<00:02:01.439> got<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.770> black<00:02:02.040> square<00:02:02.460> there<00:02:02.670> you

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
we've got that black square there you

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.609 
we've got that black square there you
can<00:02:02.939> see<00:02:03.240> just<00:02:03.810> give<00:02:03.960> them<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.110> photo<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.439> hard

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
can see just give them the photo is hard

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.340 
can see just give them the photo is hard
to<00:02:04.710> catch<00:02:04.860> up<00:02:05.509> software<00:02:06.509> isn't<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.780> fastest

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
to catch up software isn't the fastest

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.229 
to catch up software isn't the fastest
now<00:02:08.129> we're<00:02:08.250> going<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.429> select<00:02:08.550> our<00:02:08.759> paintbrush

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
now we're going to select our paintbrush

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.040 
now we're going to select our paintbrush
tool<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.840> turn<00:02:10.050> up<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.289> size<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:11.569> do<00:02:12.569> this<00:02:12.810> just

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
tool and turn up the size I do this just

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.460 
tool and turn up the size I do this just
so<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.170> can<00:02:13.260> go

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
so I can go

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.830 
so I can go
little<00:02:13.620> bit<00:02:13.710> faster<00:02:14.130> but<00:02:14.370> yeah<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.510> then

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
little bit faster but yeah and then

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.780 
little bit faster but yeah and then
we're<00:02:15.930> going<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.110> select<00:02:16.260> our<00:02:16.650> go<00:02:17.430> over<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.700> the

we're going to select our go over to the

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.820 
we're going to select our go over to the
two<00:02:17.910> squares<00:02:18.300> here<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:18.810> select<00:02:19.080> white<00:02:19.410> as<00:02:19.650> the

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
two squares here and select white as the

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.410 
two squares here and select white as the
foreground<00:02:20.070> and<00:02:20.730> then<00:02:20.880> black<00:02:21.120> is<00:02:21.300> the

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
foreground and then black is the

we're going to paint that would just

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.910 
we're going to paint that would just
give<00:02:48.240> it<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:48.390> sec<00:02:48.630> we're<00:02:49.410> going<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.590> paint<00:02:49.830> that

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
one in it's important you don't overlap

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.510

as<00:02:59.580> you<00:02:59.940> can<00:03:00.030> see<00:03:00.240> that<00:03:00.390> we've<00:03:00.540> painted<00:03:00.810> the

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
as you can see that we've painted the

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.220 
as you can see that we've painted the
dog<00:03:01.230> in<00:03:01.730> so<00:03:02.730> now<00:03:02.820> we<00:03:02.880> have<00:03:03.120> three<00:03:03.510> dogs<00:03:03.780> just

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
dog in so now we have three dogs just

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.600 
dog in so now we have three dogs just
being<00:03:04.530> very<00:03:04.560> careful<00:03:05.040> with<00:03:05.459> this<00:03:05.750> and<00:03:07.610> when

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
being very careful with this and when

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.130 
being very careful with this and when
you<00:03:08.700> do<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:08.940> image<00:03:09.390> sequence<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:09.959> should

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
you do the image sequence you should

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.570 
you do the image sequence you should
always<00:03:10.290> have<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.709> to<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:10.920> side<00:03:11.160> of<00:03:11.400> what's

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
always have it to the side of what's

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.760 
always have it to the side of what's
going<00:03:11.850> on<00:03:14.090> so<00:03:15.090> we'll<00:03:15.300> just<00:03:15.450> speed<00:03:16.200> this<00:03:16.230> up<00:03:16.560> now

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
going on so we'll just speed this up now

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.620 
going on so we'll just speed this up now
we<00:03:16.830> can<00:03:17.250> see<00:03:17.489> that<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.910> dog<00:03:18.120> is<00:03:18.150> almost<00:03:18.450> going

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
we can see that the dog is almost going

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.040 
we can see that the dog is almost going
to<00:03:18.690> overlap<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.860> last<00:03:20.519> frame<00:03:21.000> you<00:03:21.840> can<00:03:21.959> see

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
to overlap to the last frame you can see

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.509 
to overlap to the last frame you can see
that<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.290> nose<00:03:22.500> is<00:03:22.530> faded<00:03:23.070> out<00:03:23.190> there<00:03:23.370> so

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
that the nose is faded out there so

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:24.650 
that the nose is faded out there so
we're<00:03:23.610> going<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:23.760> go<00:03:23.880> down<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.120> magnifying

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
we're going to go down the magnifying

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.979 
we're going to go down the magnifying
glass<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:24.959> zoom<00:03:25.470> in<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:26.840> we're<00:03:27.840> going<00:03:27.959> to

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
glass and zoom in and we're going to

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.610 
glass and zoom in and we're going to
select<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.470> paintbrush<00:03:28.800> tool<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:30.620> we're

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
select the paintbrush tool and we're

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.410 
select the paintbrush tool and we're
going<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.830> do<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.130> size<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:32.970> you<00:03:33.269> can<00:03:33.300> see

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
going to do the size and you can see

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.540 
going to do the size and you can see
we're<00:03:33.780> carefully<00:03:34.500> trying<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:36.950> put<00:03:37.950> that<00:03:38.190> nose

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
we're carefully trying to put that nose
