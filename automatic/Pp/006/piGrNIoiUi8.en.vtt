gonna<00:00:37.530> be<00:00:37.649> pretty<00:00:37.800> awesome<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.050> map

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
gonna be pretty awesome so that the map

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.690 
gonna be pretty awesome so that the map
just<00:00:40.350> generally<00:00:40.680> does<00:00:40.829> look<00:00:40.980> really<00:00:41.100> big<00:00:41.430> and

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
just generally does look really big and

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.190 
just generally does look really big and
it<00:00:41.879> goes<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.059> root<00:00:42.239> cause<00:00:42.510> nobody<00:00:42.780> can<00:00:42.870> report

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
it goes the root cause nobody can report

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.240 
it goes the root cause nobody can report
out<00:00:43.350> when<00:00:43.530> there's<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.680> top<00:00:43.860> left<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.219> the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
not true damn is obviously right in the

not true damn is obviously right in the
middle<00:00:47.640> slightly<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.329> left<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.690> little<00:00:48.840> bit

thus<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:18.150> as<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.360> can<00:01:18.450> see<00:01:18.540> how<00:01:18.630> small<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.110> is

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
thus like as you can see how small it is

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.510 
thus like as you can see how small it is
like<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.650> little<00:01:19.890> buildings<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.310> can't

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
like the little buildings you can't

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.980 
like the little buildings you can't
really<00:01:20.610> make<00:01:20.759> them<00:01:20.880> out<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.240> that'll<00:01:21.869> she

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
really make them out and that'll she

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.899 
really make them out and that'll she
shows<00:01:22.170> how<00:01:22.350> big<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.710> for<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.549> map<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.820> have

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
shows how big it is for the map to have

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.039 
shows how big it is for the map to have
to<00:01:24.030> be<00:01:24.119> like<00:01:24.299> kind<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.659> small<00:01:24.840> if<00:01:24.930> that

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
to be like kind of that small if that

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.800 
to be like kind of that small if that
makes<00:01:25.229> sense<00:01:25.439> um<00:01:26.150> but<00:01:27.150> yeah<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.360> map<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.659> going

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
makes sense um but yeah the map is going

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.050 
makes sense um but yeah the map is going
to<00:01:27.869> be<00:01:27.930> huge<00:01:28.200> like<00:01:28.590> was<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.070> bigger<00:01:29.700> than<00:01:29.759> Black

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
to be huge like was it bigger than Black

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.249 
to be huge like was it bigger than Black
Flag<00:01:30.329> when<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.570> get<00:01:30.659> all<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.960> landmass

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
Flag when you get all of the landmass

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.719 
Flag when you get all of the landmass
and<00:01:31.470> put<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.619> all<00:01:31.680> together<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.610> is

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
and put it all together and that is

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:33.980 
and put it all together and that is
pretty<00:01:32.909> damn<00:01:33.060> big<00:01:33.210> there<00:01:33.390> was<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.509> lot<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.750> land

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
pretty damn big there was a lot of land

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.179 
pretty damn big there was a lot of land
and<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.229> put<00:01:34.380> you've<00:01:34.619> got<00:01:34.770> beyond<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.040> life

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
and you put you've got beyond this life

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.530 
and you put you've got beyond this life
you<00:01:35.369> could<00:01:35.460> if<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.640> went<00:01:35.970> from<00:01:36.060> one<00:01:36.270> end<00:01:36.450> of

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
you could if you went from one end of

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.850 
you could if you went from one end of
Black<00:01:36.750> Flag<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.229> other<00:01:37.350> but<00:01:37.500> if<00:01:37.590> it's<00:01:37.710> just

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
Black Flag to the other but if it's just

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.770 
Black Flag to the other but if it's just
the<00:01:37.890> land<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.790> would<00:01:39.000> take<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.420> long<00:01:39.570> while

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
the land it would take you a long while

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.719 
the land it would take you a long while
and<00:01:39.990> parish<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.740> bigger<00:01:40.950> than<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.520> I

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
and parish is bigger than that so I

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.069 
and parish is bigger than that so I
can't<00:01:41.970> wait<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.180> see<00:01:42.299> what<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.600> has<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.840> store

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
can't wait to see what it has in store

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.480 
can't wait to see what it has in store
tell<00:01:43.590> me<00:01:43.680> was<00:01:43.860> thinking<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.100> complex<00:01:44.369> but

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
tell me was thinking the complex but

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.830 
tell me was thinking the complex but
about<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.700> maps<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.210> didn't<00:01:45.360> make<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.479> video<00:01:45.659> box

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
about the maps I didn't make a video box

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.120 
about the maps I didn't make a video box
before<00:01:46.049> actually<00:01:46.470> but<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.680> was<00:01:46.770> just<00:01:46.799> kind<00:01:47.070> of

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
before actually but it was just kind of

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.590 
before actually but it was just kind of
generally<00:01:47.399> getting<00:01:47.759> an<00:01:47.909> idea<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.450> map

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
generally getting an idea of the map

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.690 
generally getting an idea of the map
size<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.020> it's<00:01:49.439> probably<00:01:49.649> very<00:01:49.920> very<00:01:50.399> similar

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
size and it's probably very very similar

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.069 
size and it's probably very very similar
to<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.360> can<00:01:51.479> go<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.689> find<00:01:51.810> out<00:01:51.960> my
