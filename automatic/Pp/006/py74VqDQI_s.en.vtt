00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.060 
know might really roll but I'll take the
time<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.510> it's<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.990> pretty<00:01:46.140> good<00:01:46.229> lap<00:01:46.500> time<00:01:46.800> and

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
time and it's a pretty good lap time and

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.160 
time and it's a pretty good lap time and
we'll<00:01:47.250> go<00:01:47.790> racing<00:01:48.150> I<00:01:48.420> don't<00:01:48.840> know<00:01:48.900> it<00:01:49.050> just

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
to go out and lay a lap down and I

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.350 
to go out and lay a lap down and I
wasn't<00:03:04.200> that<00:03:04.440> thrilled<00:03:04.650> with<00:03:05.010> with<00:03:05.819> my<00:03:06.030> was<00:03:06.209> I

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
wasn't that thrilled with with my was I

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.910 
wasn't that thrilled with with my was I
was<00:03:06.540> happy<00:03:06.720> with<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:06.959> lap<00:03:07.140> time<00:03:07.380> don't<00:03:07.709> get<00:03:07.770> me

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
was happy with a lap time don't get me

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.400 
was happy with a lap time don't get me
wrong<00:03:07.950> but<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.459> didn't<00:03:09.060> think<00:03:09.209> that<00:03:09.330> was<00:03:09.660> that

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
wrong but I didn't think that was that

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.470 
wrong but I didn't think that was that
was<00:03:10.560> my<00:03:10.710> best<00:03:10.920> lap<00:03:11.220> by<00:03:11.460> any<00:03:11.640> means<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.150> car<00:03:12.360> was

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
was my best lap by any means the car was

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.840 
was my best lap by any means the car was
sliding

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
sliding

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.130 
sliding
quite<00:03:13.000> a<00:03:13.030> bit<00:03:13.270> so<00:03:13.450> I<00:03:13.480> guess<00:03:13.720> it's<00:03:13.900> sliding

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
quite a bit so I guess it's sliding

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.830 
quite a bit so I guess it's sliding
because<00:03:14.230> that's<00:03:14.440> going<00:03:14.620> to
