damage is drawn randomly from a random

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.030 
damage is drawn randomly from a random
 pal<00:01:44.000> you've<00:01:45.000> also<00:01:45.180> got<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:46.049> range<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.770> nine

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
 pal you've also got a range of nine

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.490 
 pal you've also got a range of nine
here<00:01:48.049> and<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:50.040> cost<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.790> two<00:01:51.150> to<00:01:51.540> fire<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:52.140> unit

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
here and a cost of two to fire this unit

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.640 
here and a cost of two to fire this unit
so<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.770> can<00:01:53.040> move<00:01:53.600> one<00:01:54.600> space<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.409> costs

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
so you can move one space and it costs

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.120 
so you can move one space and it costs
you<00:01:55.890> one<00:01:56.130> or<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:57.390> can<00:01:57.600> fire<00:01:57.900> it<00:01:57.930> across<00:01:58.380> 22<00:01:58.860> so

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
you one or you can fire it across 22 so

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.920 
you one or you can fire it across 22 so
you<00:01:59.189> use<00:01:59.460> those<00:01:59.700> seven<00:02:00.090> points<00:02:00.360> for<00:02:00.540> each<00:02:00.659> unit

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
you use those seven points for each unit

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.350 
you use those seven points for each unit
to<00:02:01.590> try<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.130> get<00:02:02.250> things<00:02:02.490> done<00:02:02.580> in<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.939> game<00:02:03.150> I

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
to try to get things done in the game I

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.270 
to try to get things done in the game I
want<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.840> switch<00:02:04.049> over<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.619> normal<00:02:05.010> view

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
want to switch over to the normal view

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.980 
want to switch over to the normal view
which<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.610> kind<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.909> an<00:02:06.030> overhead<00:02:06.570> view<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.810> the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
which is kind of an overhead view of the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.290 
which is kind of an overhead view of the
game

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.150 

and<00:02:10.540> you<00:02:11.140> can<00:02:11.260> see<00:02:11.410> we<00:02:11.500> have<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.650> top-down<00:02:12.100> view

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
and you can see we have a top-down view

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.660 
and you can see we have a top-down view
of<00:02:12.460> the<00:02:12.550> game<00:02:12.700> now<00:02:12.940> so<00:02:13.800> I'm<00:02:14.800> going<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.100> show<00:02:15.610> you

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
of the game now so I'm going to show you

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.510 
of the game now so I'm going to show you
something<00:02:15.940> kind<00:02:16.180> of<00:02:16.210> cool<00:02:16.420> about<00:02:16.750> this<00:02:17.050> game

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
something kind of cool about this game

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.550 
something kind of cool about this game
versus<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.610> board<00:02:18.820> game<00:02:19.030> is<00:02:19.270> that<00:02:19.450> you<00:02:19.960> have<00:02:20.170> 7

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
versus the board game is that you have 7

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.470 
versus the board game is that you have 7
AP<00:02:20.890> per<00:02:21.130> unit<00:02:21.490> just<00:02:21.640> like<00:02:21.820> in<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.000> board<00:02:22.240> game

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
AP per unit just like in the board game

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:30.480 
AP per unit just like in the board game
so<00:02:23.520> as<00:02:24.520> you<00:02:27.870> move<00:02:28.870> forward<00:02:29.230> you<00:02:30.040> can<00:02:30.250> see<00:02:30.460> that

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
so as you move forward you can see that

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.430 
so as you move forward you can see that
I<00:02:30.670> have<00:02:30.730> four<00:02:31.120> points<00:02:31.450> left<00:02:31.660> on<00:02:31.840> this<00:02:31.990> unit<00:02:32.290> and

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
I have four points left on this unit and

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.040 
I have four points left on this unit and
seven<00:02:32.860> left<00:02:33.190> here<00:02:33.610> I<00:02:33.760> can<00:02:34.480> activate<00:02:34.870> a

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
seven left here I can activate a

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.440 
seven left here I can activate a
different<00:02:35.440> unit<00:02:35.680> if<00:02:35.770> I<00:02:35.890> wish<00:02:36.130> and<00:02:36.430> still<00:02:37.180> keep

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
different unit if I wish and still keep

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.730 
different unit if I wish and still keep
the<00:02:37.630> full<00:02:37.870> for<00:02:38.220> AP<00:02:39.220> on<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.550> other<00:02:39.700> unit<00:02:40.740> and

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
the full for AP on the other unit and

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.440 
the full for AP on the other unit and
then<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:42.070> can<00:02:42.220> switch<00:02:42.430> back<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.850> other<00:02:42.970> unit

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
then I can switch back to the other unit

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.390 
then I can switch back to the other unit
you<00:02:44.050> also<00:02:44.230> notice<00:02:44.680> that<00:02:44.710> there's<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:45.100> fog<00:02:45.370> of

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
you also notice that there's a fog of

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.430 
you also notice that there's a fog of
war<00:02:45.580> and<00:02:45.970> as<00:02:46.120> I<00:02:46.150> move<00:02:46.540> through<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:46.990> field<00:02:47.230> here

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
war and as I move through the field here

war and as I move through the field here
I<00:02:47.470> can<00:02:47.710> see<00:02:47.890> more<00:02:48.130> into<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.430> game<00:02:48.640> and<00:02:48.940> I'm

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
I can see more into the game and I'm

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.360 
I can see more into the game and I'm
going<00:02:50.020> to<00:02:50.050> try<00:02:50.200> to<00:02:50.230> activate<00:02:50.560> this<00:02:50.860> unit<00:02:51.190> here

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
going to try to activate this unit here

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.450 
going to try to activate this unit here
for<00:02:51.580> a<00:02:51.640> fire<00:02:52.060> attack<00:02:52.420> against<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.440> student<00:02:53.890> so

here so I'm going to click on there do a

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.030 
here so I'm going to click on there do a
fire<00:03:22.480> attack<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:23.140> I<00:03:23.200> did<00:03:23.410> damage<00:03:23.830> to<00:03:24.010> that

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
fire attack and I did damage to that

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.510 
fire attack and I did damage to that
unit<00:03:25.140> so<00:03:26.140> we<00:03:26.170> had<00:03:26.440> a<00:03:26.470> hidden<00:03:26.709> unit<00:03:27.160> here<00:03:27.370> who

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
unit so we had a hidden unit here who

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.050 
unit so we had a hidden unit here who
popped<00:03:27.820> up<00:03:28.060> and<00:03:28.270> he's<00:03:28.480> tackling<00:03:28.900> my<00:03:29.020> lmg<00:03:29.560> and

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
popped up and he's tackling my lmg and

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.270 
popped up and he's tackling my lmg and
so<00:03:31.060> he's<00:03:31.270> got<00:03:31.480> to<00:03:31.750> fire<00:03:32.200> power<00:03:32.470> left<00:03:32.770> it<00:03:32.920> costs

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
so he's got to fire power left it costs

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.130 
so he's got to fire power left it costs
him<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.610> to<00:03:33.790> fire<00:03:34.030> so<00:03:34.720> he's<00:03:34.870> going<00:03:35.020> to<00:03:35.080> attack

I<00:04:11.450> probably<00:04:12.440> should<00:04:12.620> have<00:04:12.800> used<00:04:12.890> some<00:04:13.130> action

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
I probably should have used some action

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.490 
I probably should have used some action
points<00:04:13.700> there<00:04:13.850> I've<00:04:14.210> got<00:04:14.510> five<00:04:14.780> action<00:04:15.200> points

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
here it cost me three two fires so I'm

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.880

going to click on that unit fire there
and<00:04:22.040> I<00:04:22.100> had<00:04:22.220> a<00:04:22.250> twenty-seven<00:04:22.850> percent<00:04:22.940> chance

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
and I had a twenty-seven percent chance

and I had a twenty-seven percent chance
of<00:04:23.480> hitting<00:04:23.630> and<00:04:23.840> I<00:04:23.930> did<00:04:24.170> and<00:04:24.410> now<00:04:25.400> I've<00:04:25.550> only

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
got two left but it cost me three to

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.590 
got two left but it cost me three to
fire<00:04:27.680> so<00:04:28.520> I<00:04:28.550> can<00:04:28.790> take<00:04:28.910> some<00:04:29.120> of<00:04:29.210> those<00:04:29.270> command

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
fire so I can take some of those command

action<00:04:29.930> points<00:04:30.880> convert<00:04:31.880> one<00:04:32.120> of<00:04:32.240> those<00:04:32.390> to<00:04:32.660> an

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
action points convert one of those to an

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.140 
action points convert one of those to an
AP<00:04:33.140> and<00:04:33.380> now<00:04:33.500> i<00:04:33.530> have<00:04:33.650> three<00:04:34.130> to<00:04:34.790> work<00:04:34.940> and<00:04:35.090> do

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
AP and now i have three to work and do

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.060

another<00:04:35.240> attack<00:04:35.810> I<00:04:38.470> only<00:04:39.470> had<00:04:39.620> a<00:04:39.650> sixteen

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
another attack I only had a sixteen

another attack I only had a sixteen
percent<00:04:40.340> chance<00:04:40.550> of<00:04:40.730> hitting<00:04:40.880> but<00:04:41.210> it's

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
percent chance of hitting but it's

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.960 
percent chance of hitting but it's
better<00:04:41.480> than<00:04:41.600> nothing<00:04:45.370> he's<00:04:46.370> out<00:04:46.550> of<00:04:46.580> action

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
better than nothing he's out of action

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.020 
better than nothing he's out of action
point<00:04:47.180> so<00:04:47.270> he<00:04:47.390> can't<00:04:47.630> do<00:04:47.810> anything<00:04:48.430> so<00:04:49.430> both

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
point so he can't do anything so both

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.700 
point so he can't do anything so both
these<00:04:50.270> units<00:04:50.630> are<00:04:50.750> damaged<00:04:51.170> once<00:04:51.410> you<00:04:51.530> take

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
these units are damaged once you take

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.820 
these units are damaged once you take
the<00:04:51.740> second<00:04:52.220> unit<00:04:52.370> of<00:04:52.700> hit<00:04:53.450> second<00:04:54.290> damage<00:04:54.590> hit

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
the second unit of hit second damage hit

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.340 
the second unit of hit second damage hit
those<00:04:55.640> units<00:04:55.970> are<00:04:56.120> gone<00:04:56.540> so<00:04:56.900> i'm<00:04:56.990> going<00:04:57.140> to<00:04:57.230> try

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
those units are gone so i'm going to try

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.400 
those units are gone so i'm going to try
to<00:04:57.410> get<00:04:57.650> up<00:04:57.950> there
