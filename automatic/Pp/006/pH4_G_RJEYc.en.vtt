00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.760 

it<00:00:05.940> was<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.120> first<00:00:06.150> swell<00:00:06.750> of<00:00:06.990> this<00:00:07.140> year<00:00:07.589> and

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
it was the first swell of this year and

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.339 
it was the first swell of this year and
we'd<00:00:08.760> always<00:00:08.910> wondered<00:00:09.690> what<00:00:09.809> jaws<00:00:10.019> would<00:00:10.230> be

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
we'd always wondered what jaws would be

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.870 
we'd always wondered what jaws would be
like<00:00:10.500> if<00:00:10.650> we<00:00:10.769> ever<00:00:10.800> got<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.099> big<00:00:11.340> day<00:00:11.550> out<00:00:11.700> there

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
like if we ever got a big day out there

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.580 
like if we ever got a big day out there
when<00:00:12.059> it<00:00:12.150> was<00:00:12.210> actually<00:00:12.509> glassy<00:00:12.870> and<00:00:12.900> we<00:00:13.410> just

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
when it was actually glassy and we just

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.770 
when it was actually glassy and we just
got<00:00:13.710> super<00:00:14.099> super<00:00:14.549> lucky<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.330> winds<00:00:15.690> were

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
got super super lucky the the winds were

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.900 
got super super lucky the the winds were
in<00:00:15.929> kind<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.379> mellow<00:00:16.650> pattern<00:00:17.100> at<00:00:17.430> that<00:00:17.670> time

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
in kind of a mellow pattern at that time

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.150 
in kind of a mellow pattern at that time
and<00:00:18.210> we<00:00:19.080> actually<00:00:19.230> got<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.529> see<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:20.010> was

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
and we actually got to see it it was

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.320 
and we actually got to see it it was
pretty<00:00:20.279> interesting<00:00:20.520> because<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:21.000> was<00:00:21.119> really

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
pretty interesting because it was really

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.790 
pretty interesting because it was really

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.230 
small in the morning so everyone was
