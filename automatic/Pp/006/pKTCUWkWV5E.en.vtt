am<00:01:10.790> choreographing<00:01:11.360> something<00:01:11.570> onstage<00:01:11.960> I

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
am choreographing something onstage I

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.230 
am choreographing something onstage I
have<00:01:12.409> this<00:01:12.619> blank<00:01:12.920> canvas<00:01:13.040> I<00:01:13.640> have<00:01:13.790> this<00:01:13.939> box

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
have this blank canvas I have this box

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.999 
have this blank canvas I have this box
and<00:01:14.630> it's<00:01:15.110> easy<00:01:15.380> to<00:01:15.500> map<00:01:15.799> out<00:01:16.040> positions<00:01:16.750> and

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
and it's easy to map out positions and

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.890 
and it's easy to map out positions and
structures<00:01:19.009> but<00:01:19.340> with<00:01:19.490> this<00:01:19.670> film<00:01:20.180> you've<00:01:20.750> got

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
structures but with this film you've got

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.450 
structures but with this film you've got
to<00:01:21.020> think<00:01:21.140> about<00:01:21.439> where<00:01:21.650> the<00:01:21.770> camera<00:01:22.130> angle<00:01:22.430> is

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
to think about where the camera angle is

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.770 
to think about where the camera angle is
going<00:01:22.579> to<00:01:22.640> be<00:01:22.820> where<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.090> location<00:01:23.600> is<00:01:23.689> going

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
going to be where the location is going

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.600 
going to be where the location is going
to<00:01:23.960> be<00:01:24.140> whether<00:01:24.320> they'll<00:01:24.619> be<00:01:24.650> you<00:01:25.579> know

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
to be whether they'll be you know

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.520 
to be whether they'll be you know
dancing<00:01:26.090> around<00:01:26.210> a<00:01:26.479> tree<00:01:26.900> whether<00:01:27.229> they'll<00:01:27.500> be

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
dancing around a tree whether they'll be

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.480 
dancing around a tree whether they'll be
having<00:01:28.220> to<00:01:28.520> you<00:01:28.909> know<00:01:29.030> go<00:01:29.360> around<00:01:29.479> a<00:01:29.720> lake<00:01:30.490> and

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
having to you know go around a lake and

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.580 
having to you know go around a lake and
so<00:01:32.090> it's<00:01:32.270> been<00:01:32.479> different<00:01:32.750> in<00:01:33.140> the<00:01:33.290> way<00:01:33.409> that

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
so it's been different in the way that

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.219 
so it's been different in the way that
I've<00:01:33.680> had<00:01:33.829> to<00:01:33.950> think<00:01:34.159> about<00:01:34.570> the<00:01:35.570> choreography

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
I've had to think about the choreography

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.960 
I've had to think about the choreography
and<00:01:36.259> where<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:36.799> camera<00:01:37.159> might<00:01:37.369> be<00:01:37.610> pointing

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
and where the camera might be pointing

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.880 
and where the camera might be pointing
out<00:01:38.030> also<00:01:38.390> you<00:01:38.899> know<00:01:39.020> would<00:01:39.500> it<00:01:39.530> be<00:01:39.619> quite

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
out also you know would it be quite

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.030 
out also you know would it be quite
close<00:01:40.100> up<00:01:40.340> would<00:01:40.549> it<00:01:40.670> be<00:01:40.759> quite<00:01:41.060> far<00:01:41.600> away<00:01:42.040> and

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
close up would it be quite far away and

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.310 
close up would it be quite far away and
thinking<00:01:43.820> more<00:01:44.060> about<00:01:44.299> the<00:01:44.450> story<00:01:44.899> and

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
thinking more about the story and

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.560 
thinking more about the story and
telling<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.009> story<00:01:46.340> so<00:01:46.670> really<00:01:46.969> focusing<00:01:47.479> on

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
telling the story so really focusing on

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.660 
telling the story so really focusing on
their<00:01:47.780> facial<00:01:48.320> expressions<00:01:49.219> and<00:01:49.610> body

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
their facial expressions and body

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.980 
their facial expressions and body
language<00:01:51.399> filming<00:01:52.399> wise<00:01:52.600> what<00:01:53.600> would<00:01:53.719> happen

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
language filming wise what would happen

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.800 
language filming wise what would happen
is<00:01:54.110> you<00:01:54.259> have<00:01:54.290> probably<00:01:54.860> sort<00:01:55.640> of<00:01:55.700> just<00:01:55.969> come

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
is you have probably sort of just come

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.139 
is you have probably sort of just come
into<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.259> camera<00:01:57.649> and<00:01:58.070> then<00:01:58.369> begin<00:01:58.759> so<00:01:59.090> you

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
into the camera and then begin so you

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.359 
into the camera and then begin so you
kind<00:01:59.450> of<00:01:59.509> we<00:01:59.840> would<00:01:59.990> see<00:02:00.170> so<00:02:00.649> your<00:02:00.799> shadow<00:02:01.100> and

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
kind of we would see so your shadow and

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:02.529 
kind of we would see so your shadow and
then<00:02:01.430> your<00:02:01.579> shoulder<00:02:01.969> and<00:02:02.119> your<00:02:02.299> whole<00:02:02.509> body

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
then your shoulder and your whole body

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.029 
then your shoulder and your whole body
and<00:02:02.869> then<00:02:03.009> this<00:02:04.009> bird-like<00:02:04.820> figure<00:02:05.240> comes

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
and then this bird-like figure comes

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.249 
and then this bird-like figure comes
well<00:02:07.039> the<00:02:07.130> vocabulary<00:02:07.670> I'm<00:02:07.909> using<00:02:08.270> I've<00:02:08.660> gone

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
well the vocabulary I'm using I've gone

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.110 
well the vocabulary I'm using I've gone
for<00:02:09.500> quite<00:02:09.530> a<00:02:09.680> classical<00:02:10.280> base<00:02:10.520> but<00:02:10.970> then

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
for quite a classical base but then

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.110 
for quite a classical base but then
again<00:02:11.270> this<00:02:12.170> you<00:02:12.830> know<00:02:12.980> it's<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.580> character<00:02:14.000> of

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
again this you know it's a character of

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.870 
again this you know it's a character of
a<00:02:14.240> bird<00:02:14.570> so<00:02:15.170> I've<00:02:15.320> incorporated<00:02:15.890> bird-like

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
a bird so I've incorporated bird-like

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
a bird so I've incorporated bird-like
movements

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
movements

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.509 
movements
and<00:02:17.989> that<00:02:18.349> could<00:02:18.590> be<00:02:18.620> associated<00:02:19.340> with<00:02:19.370> a

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
and that could be associated with a

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.289 
and that could be associated with a
little<00:02:19.760> bit<00:02:19.849> of<00:02:19.939> contemporary<00:02:20.510> influence<00:02:22.299> my

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
little bit of contemporary influence my

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.420 
little bit of contemporary influence my
dancers<00:02:23.780> are<00:02:23.930> Clare<00:02:24.379> Calvert<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.129> Eric

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
dancers are Clare Calvert and Eric

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.970 
dancers are Clare Calvert and Eric
Underwood<00:02:25.879> and<00:02:26.319> I've<00:02:27.319> never<00:02:27.620> worked<00:02:27.829> with

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
Underwood and I've never worked with

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.250 
Underwood and I've never worked with
these<00:02:28.220> two<00:02:28.430> before<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:29.269> I<00:02:29.810> think<00:02:29.870> I've<00:02:30.110> been

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
these two before and I think I've been

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.539 
these two before and I think I've been
really<00:02:30.530> lucky<00:02:30.680> in<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:30.980> fact<00:02:31.010> that<00:02:31.280> they<00:02:31.430> have

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
really lucky in the fact that they have

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.789 
really lucky in the fact that they have
a<00:02:31.579> really<00:02:31.849> good<00:02:32.090> chemistry<00:02:32.680> especially<00:02:33.680> with

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
a really good chemistry especially with

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.399 
a really good chemistry especially with
this<00:02:33.950> story<00:02:34.400> I<00:02:34.849> think<00:02:35.480> it's<00:02:35.659> important<00:02:36.260> to

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409 
this story I think it's important to

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:45.290 
this story I think it's important to
have<00:02:36.590> that

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.360
