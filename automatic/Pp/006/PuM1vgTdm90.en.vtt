00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.290
 and there Album guys okay with you 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.139
 Let's start this is a debate in this 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.330
 Monday with the dollar here opening the 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.310
 group programming grid during 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.170
 all this second is it guys have 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.410
 choice for those who have just 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.210
 They are then posted the discussion is about 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.510
 What happens between these two 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.219
 characters called ex break and falls 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.320
 so that even the role of the river with sun 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.170
 touched the ball with my friends and one of them 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.820
 do not judge and eliminate the smell 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.600
 Horrible a joke but sometimes it works 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.239
 Anyway, what do you get from that line to 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.579
 people saw on the carbon cover is that oo 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.170
 ex old drake got there and ended up with the 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.989
 revolution is not that the guy is good trump 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.809
 was there with that bunch of the rooster and 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.930
 apparently we can judge by the 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.210
 image he is with ex's father 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.789
 benfiquista with cardozo and then you stay 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.619
 thinking to be here is a potential 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:07.549
 antagonist is when this alliance of ol 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.560
 and in the end and went against a cover 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.590
 probably only there you think a lot 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.909
 thing with that the old one is the supernovas 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.820
 when I was in soap and did 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.770
 contacts with each other and 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.650
 They are known the point where he was rolling 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.640
 the alliances between supernovas lol and 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:30.720
 huff you and pound the kit cake with 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.900
 ten rockets scratch 6 puna and type fico 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.900
 Thinking will be the fall of the could be 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.460
 an alliance with supernovae 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.680
 They plan to overthrow the cast at the moment. 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.450
 All right with that kaka pong 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.560
 good bedwell, huh? 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.540
 we do not even know what happened 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.509
 with her from that meeting she had 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.720
 with the new car I can not not intend 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.520
 to follow tension, that's good 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.530
 So I keep thinking that he can too. 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.390
 be in the alliance with these lines already 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.850
 that we know the old is 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.219
 suddenly with with the gold alliance 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.590
 stayed with the alliance of quiriri apo and 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.200
 rock is already a lot if you thought I'm 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.090
 I really like to open my relatives. 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.790
 here as it looks is addressing the 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.060
 a pool without showing any kohl because 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.800
 Do you see the attention that 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.500
 falls from a brother friend to the point of 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.630
 supernova pirates who are already pirates 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.319
 may be looking for alliances to 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:26.770
 fight the guy, fuck this, you stay 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.750
 there all this reflection know what 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.140
 it's happening, this relationship will 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.780
 of the former drake and the fall of I was going to stay 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.190
 surprised and liking if it was a betrayal 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.110
 with kai sun 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.000
 but I think he's allied to the guy 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.250
 It's all this mystery must have been a 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.769
 ex-marine I really want to see you still talk 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.239
 about the drake is very cool this 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.190
 although I hope you have enjoyed it 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.489

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.700
