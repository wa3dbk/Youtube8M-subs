00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.980
 elite dog club and orphanage 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.500
 spring culture continue to acquaint 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.240
 young viewers dogs of different breeds in 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.259
 when or the main character was German 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.480
 boxer companion first 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:18.560
 sports dog that is in winter 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:23.699
 sledding 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:26.430
 kids benefit very fun interesting well 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.110
 And in the summer itself in the forest along also 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.890
 you can go fishing with them better 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.390
 my husband's interesting threshold has always been 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.820
 boxer breed dogs 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.520
 so when we decided to have dogs 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.500
 that we only have a boxer know 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.870
 that the dog is very energetic very 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:48.130
 good-natured therefore the choice or we have two 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:50.350
 children this is not an aggressive dog can not 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.770
 worry left alone with the child 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.290
 and and 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.900
 faced only with the fact that she is very 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.150
 strong and when a little baby she 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.040
 can even walk for children baby 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.920
 just sits down here is the only thing 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.340
 Like this leads to such on children 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.310
 insult and so we experienced it nothing 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.170
 accustomed boxer dog is very energetic 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.600
 and because such a companion does not 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.660
 each walk four times a day 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:21.149
 sure we do not get less often 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:25.660
 walk you early in the morning 5-6 am 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:27.910
 then I walk at three o'clock in the afternoon 5 hours and 8 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.310
 hours or 10 pm before bed 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.159
 can of course withstand the forests of snow walk 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.799
 5-6 she can stand till the morning but so that 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.049
 was all sound sleep so she is not 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.970
 woke up nobody in the toilet so we walk 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:44.140
 nine hours before bedtime 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:47.440
 three times and I walk for long is 15 20 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.680
 minutes on a leash not let go 1 time in 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.210
 day must walk for 30 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.520
 minutes 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.580
 loose without a leash because dogs 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.560
 you need a movement that she worked 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.210
 She developed muscles very much 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:06.210
 moveable otherwise it will just be there 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:08.700
 nibble all references go once in 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.730
 a bigger day on the field is desirable where 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.180
 you can run and find amber 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:19.440
 wand can and then she will play 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.480
 became a nurture boxer needed as 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.340
 any other dog during dog training 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.530
 just learn how to execute commands 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.590
 and you instructor will teach them correctly 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.120
 give and properly demand execution 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.290
 therefore it is best to take helpers 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.810
 experienced instructor 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.030
 When starting a dog, you need to understand whether 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.100
 you have time to deal with pet and have 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.200
 Are there any other conditions for keeping a dog ? 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.260
 breed suitable for both apartment 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:48.870
 content also for 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:51.690
 private house yes on the street aviary Niv 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.190
 Do not flat and very tion 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.090
 dangerous holidays 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.350
 yes we have a separate sofa for the dog to 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.320
 her favorite 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.600
 and we still have a special cell 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.790
 cell exhibition and cell it remains 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.450
 at home alone sometimes in a cage when she 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:12.930
 long because from the entity can 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.659
 just hurt things oat there 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.750
 flowers on the windowsill so he has 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:20.489
 a big bulk Inca which she is waiting for 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.280
 the arrival of the hosts is okay 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:26.489
 firstly actually a dog originally 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.980
 like a wild norway dog and vice versa 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.469
 in a cage she finds herself a couple 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.209
 when children don't run very often 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:35.189
 want to play with her she's just in this 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.739
 cage even find calm go there and 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:38.489
 there lies aids it is even more for her 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.310
 shelters 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.019
 than some prison is not the most important thing 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.230
 choose the right cage for the dog 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.629
 could calmly stand still 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.669
 even now turn around and go full length 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.290
 In general, a boxer dog is enough 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:53.760
 healthy and subject to good 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.220
 heredity and correct 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.680
 growing but there is one feature 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.980
 which you need to remember all your life heat 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.439
 Of course I did not want to transfer if the card 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.280
 leave the paragraph you should not ponds or 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:13.189
 Vodichku is the fact that even now how much 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:16.440
 we are often are simply run 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:20.639
 let the short nose does not give normal 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:23.070
 air access these need to look and 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.380
 understand and if earlier all German 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.909
 the boxers were occupied ears and 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.789
 tail today are increasingly common 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:32.250
 dogs whose hangs are hanging and tail 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:33.360
 wags in full power in many countries 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.349
 European standard 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:40.680
 about the breed we are humane animal attitude 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:43.580
 That is, does not torment because it is stopped 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:47.849
 ears is a certain difficult operation 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:51.360
 lulls they lull a dog under anesthesia 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:51.570
 anesthetized vanity well and they tail for the third 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.729
 day 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:59.639
 rested hurt not to torment now 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:02.220
 probably trend is the countries in 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.229
 many and so the German boxer can be 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.210
 perfect companion for active and 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.460
 sports much for those who are ready 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.130
 walk the dog a lot and practice and 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.630
 bringing up such meetings dog handlers with 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.270
 young viewers have not only 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.820
 entertaining but also educational role because 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:21.139
 the more guys learn about the dog order 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.139
 will understand them better
