with<00:02:31.880> with<00:02:32.360> a<00:02:32.390> cube<00:02:32.810> I'm<00:02:33.530> going<00:02:33.650> to<00:02:33.709> go<00:02:33.800> ahead

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
with with a cube I'm going to go ahead

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.900 
with with a cube I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:34.160> scale<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.610> cube<00:02:34.910> up<00:02:36.400> holding<00:02:37.400> my<00:02:37.519> ctrl

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
and scale the cube up holding my ctrl

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.240 
and scale the cube up holding my ctrl
key<00:02:38.090> down<00:02:38.530> now<00:02:39.530> I'm<00:02:39.590> going<00:02:39.739> to<00:02:39.800> select<00:02:40.040> the

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
key down now I'm going to select the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.580 
key down now I'm going to select the
outer<00:02:40.400> boundaries<00:02:40.880> of<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.209> geometry<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:41.959> go

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
outer boundaries of the geometry and go

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.320 
outer boundaries of the geometry and go
ahead<00:02:42.799> and<00:02:43.010> hit<00:02:43.040> extrude<00:02:46.030> I'm<00:02:47.030> going<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:47.239> use

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
ahead and hit extrude I'm going to use

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.620 
ahead and hit extrude I'm going to use
the<00:02:47.480> scale<00:02:47.720> functionality<00:02:48.560> to<00:02:48.769> kind<00:02:48.980> of

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
the scale functionality to kind of

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.440 
the scale functionality to kind of
minimize<00:02:50.630> that<00:02:51.049> geometry<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:51.920> out<00:02:52.850> of<00:02:53.150> out<00:02:53.420> of

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
minimize that geometry and out of out of

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.560 
minimize that geometry and out of out of
here<00:02:53.870> I'm<00:02:54.110> going<00:02:54.290> to<00:02:54.350> pull<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.970> tubes<00:02:56.299> out

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
here I'm going to pull the the tubes out

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.930 
here I'm going to pull the the tubes out
for<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:56.959> rear<00:02:57.140> wheel<00:02:57.380> so<00:02:58.040> I<00:02:58.100> probably<00:02:58.549> need

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
for the rear wheel so I probably need

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.650 
for the rear wheel so I probably need
one<00:02:59.480> more<00:02:59.720> rung<00:03:00.079> in<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.470> in<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.850> geometry<00:03:02.150> so

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
one more rung in the in the geometry so

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.500 
one more rung in the in the geometry so
I'm<00:03:03.410> going<00:03:03.560> to<00:03:03.620> select<00:03:03.890> this<00:03:04.549> outer<00:03:04.910> boundary

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
I'm going to select this outer boundary

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.069 
I'm going to select this outer boundary
and<00:03:05.750> this<00:03:06.290> outer<00:03:06.590> boundary<00:03:07.100> and<00:03:07.690> go<00:03:08.690> ahead<00:03:08.900> and

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
and this outer boundary and go ahead and

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.110 
and this outer boundary and go ahead and
hit<00:03:09.170> extrude<00:03:09.590> again<00:03:09.709> and<00:03:10.250> I'll<00:03:10.430> use<00:03:10.609> the<00:03:10.820> scale

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
hit extrude again and I'll use the scale

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.099 
hit extrude again and I'll use the scale
button<00:03:11.359> to<00:03:11.540> kind<00:03:11.750> of<00:03:11.840> minimize<00:03:12.709> that<00:03:14.049> okay<00:03:15.049> so

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
button to kind of minimize that okay so

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.770 
button to kind of minimize that okay so
I'm<00:03:16.010> going<00:03:16.190> to<00:03:16.250> use<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.609> split<00:03:16.850> functionality

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
I'm going to use the split functionality

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.569 
I'm going to use the split functionality
to<00:03:17.900> show<00:03:18.109> you<00:03:18.170> that<00:03:18.410> I<00:03:18.440> can<00:03:18.620> split<00:03:19.459> the

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
to show you that I can split the

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.539 
to show you that I can split the
geometry<00:03:20.239> I'm<00:03:20.450> going<00:03:20.630> to<00:03:20.690> hit<00:03:20.780> ctrl<00:03:21.200> Z<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:21.709> do

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
geometry I'm going to hit ctrl Z and do

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.400 
geometry I'm going to hit ctrl Z and do
it<00:03:22.670> again<00:03:22.880> just<00:03:23.209> you<00:03:23.390> can<00:03:23.570> sort<00:03:23.900> of<00:03:23.959> see<00:03:24.230> what

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
it again just you can sort of see what

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.110 
it again just you can sort of see what
I'm<00:03:24.440> doing<00:03:24.859> out<00:03:26.680> here<00:03:27.680> and<00:03:27.829> here<00:03:28.670> I'm<00:03:28.850> going<00:03:29.030> to

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
I'm doing out here and here I'm going to

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.699 
I'm doing out here and here I'm going to
hit<00:03:29.209> the<00:03:29.329> delete<00:03:29.630> function<00:03:29.660> so<00:03:30.230> you<00:03:30.260> can<00:03:30.470> see

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
hit the delete function so you can see

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.720 
hit the delete function so you can see
that<00:03:31.160> I<00:03:31.359> basically<00:03:32.359> have<00:03:32.690> around<00:03:33.109> now<00:03:33.560> if<00:03:34.459> this

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
that I basically have around now if this

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.699 
that I basically have around now if this
is<00:03:35.000> a<00:03:35.060> production<00:03:35.600> model<00:03:35.900> we<00:03:36.170> would<00:03:36.350> we<00:03:36.680> would

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
is a production model we would we would

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.479 
is a production model we would we would
probably<00:03:37.070> use<00:03:37.959> an<00:03:38.959> aluminum<00:03:39.290> or<00:03:39.920> some<00:03:40.130> cited

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
probably use an aluminum or some cited

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.410 
probably use an aluminum or some cited
some<00:03:41.120> type<00:03:41.450> of<00:03:41.480> titanium<00:03:42.230> race

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
some type of titanium race

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.150 
some type of titanium race
I'm<00:03:45.110> going<00:03:45.230> to<00:03:45.290> extrude<00:03:45.560> up<00:03:45.740> now<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:48.160> geometry

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
I'm going to extrude up now the geometry

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.699 
I'm going to extrude up now the geometry
and<00:03:49.280> I<00:03:49.310> can<00:03:49.489> control<00:03:49.819> the<00:03:50.000> radiuses<00:03:50.599> at<00:03:51.140> will

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
and I can control the radiuses at will

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.640 
and I can control the radiuses at will
as<00:03:51.980> I<00:03:52.730> build<00:03:52.940> these<00:03:53.180> geometries<00:03:53.480> up<00:03:53.959> and<00:03:54.140> down

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.410 

let<00:03:57.650> me<00:03:57.739> go<00:03:57.770> ahead<00:03:57.980> and<00:03:58.099> pull<00:03:58.760> this<00:03:58.910> one<00:03:59.090> pretty

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
let me go ahead and pull this one pretty

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.900 
let me go ahead and pull this one pretty
far<00:03:59.720> and<00:04:00.050> then<00:04:00.890> extrude<00:04:01.190> it<00:04:01.340> one<00:04:01.459> more<00:04:01.670> time

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
far and then extrude it one more time

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.180 
far and then extrude it one more time
and<00:04:02.239> then<00:04:03.080> I'm<00:04:03.200> going<00:04:03.319> to<00:04:03.350> hit<00:04:03.500> delete<00:04:03.620> to<00:04:03.860> pull

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
and then I'm going to hit delete to pull

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.630 
and then I'm going to hit delete to pull
it<00:04:04.340> off<00:04:04.459> the<00:04:04.489> top<00:04:06.190> now<00:04:07.190> I'm<00:04:07.250> going<00:04:07.370> to<00:04:07.430> do<00:04:07.520> the

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
it off the top now I'm going to do the

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.009 
it off the top now I'm going to do the
same<00:04:07.850> thing<00:04:08.150> for<00:04:08.420> the<00:04:08.620> for<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:09.709> up<00:04:09.890> tube<00:04:10.190> here

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
same thing for the for the up tube here

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.690 
same thing for the for the up tube here
except<00:04:12.019> I'm<00:04:12.650> going<00:04:12.709> to<00:04:12.860> go<00:04:12.980> ahead<00:04:13.069> and<00:04:13.340> extrude

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
except I'm going to go ahead and extrude

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.120 
except I'm going to go ahead and extrude
it<00:04:13.880> out<00:04:14.060> you<00:04:14.420> can<00:04:14.569> kind<00:04:14.840> of<00:04:14.930> see<00:04:15.170> how<00:04:15.920> I<00:04:15.950> can

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
it out you can kind of see how I can

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.840 
it out you can kind of see how I can
kind<00:04:16.579> of<00:04:16.720> leverage<00:04:17.720> that<00:04:18.669> I'm<00:04:19.669> going<00:04:19.820> to

kind of leverage that I'm going to

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.300 
kind of leverage that I'm going to
rotate<00:04:20.299> out<00:04:20.570> here<00:04:21.079> and<00:04:21.290> now<00:04:22.040> I'm<00:04:22.130> going<00:04:22.220> to

rotate out here and now I'm going to

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.370 
rotate out here and now I'm going to
extrude<00:04:22.610> the<00:04:22.760> face<00:04:23.000> again<00:04:23.240> middle<00:04:24.110> click<00:04:24.350> a

extrude the face again middle click a
couple<00:04:24.650> times<00:04:25.040> this<00:04:25.850> one<00:04:26.090> I'm<00:04:26.180> going<00:04:26.270> to<00:04:26.330> go

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
couple times this one I'm going to go

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.810 
couple times this one I'm going to go
relatively<00:04:27.139> far<00:04:27.380> away<00:04:27.650> and<00:04:27.889> then<00:04:28.310> one<00:04:28.520> more<00:04:28.729> at

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
relatively far away and then one more at

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.110 
relatively far away and then one more at
the<00:04:28.940> top<00:04:29.290> that<00:04:30.290> that<00:04:31.160> sort<00:04:31.669> of<00:04:31.760> helps<00:04:32.060> me

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
the top that that sort of helps me

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.150 
the top that that sort of helps me
organize<00:04:32.690> my<00:04:32.720> my<00:04:33.320> geometry<00:04:34.060> and<00:04:35.770> I<00:04:36.770> could

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
organize my my geometry and I could

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.189 
organize my my geometry and I could
click<00:04:37.639> delete<00:04:38.030> there<00:04:38.240> if<00:04:38.330> I<00:04:38.450> wanted<00:04:38.810> to

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.379 

now<00:04:41.800> if<00:04:41.889> I<00:04:41.979> wanted<00:04:42.219> to<00:04:42.310> change<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.759> angle<00:04:43.210> of

now if I wanted to change the angle of

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.510 
now if I wanted to change the angle of
all<00:04:43.810> this<00:04:43.990> geometry<00:04:44.620> I<00:04:44.650> would<00:04:45.039> I<00:04:45.159> would<00:04:45.370> either

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
all this geometry I would I would either

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.899 
all this geometry I would I would either
sort<00:04:45.879> of<00:04:45.999> built<00:04:46.479> you<00:04:46.689> know<00:04:47.249> exercise<00:04:48.249> the<00:04:48.699> tube

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:48.909 
sort of built you know exercise the tube

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:51.510 
sort of built you know exercise the tube
like<00:04:49.180> that<00:04:49.210> or<00:04:49.749> sort<00:04:49.990> of<00:04:50.139> rotate<00:04:50.590> it<00:04:50.800> and<00:04:50.949> move

like that or sort of rotate it and move

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.300 
like that or sort of rotate it and move
all<00:04:51.699> at<00:04:51.789> the<00:04:51.879> same<00:04:52.060> time<00:04:52.120> and<00:04:52.990> if<00:04:53.800> I<00:04:53.919> if<00:04:54.159> I

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
all at the same time and if I if I

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.550 
all at the same time and if I if I
really<00:04:54.610> cared<00:04:54.969> about<00:04:55.120> this<00:04:55.900> specific

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
really cared about this specific

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.800 
really cared about this specific
geometry<00:04:57.129> like<00:04:57.310> one<00:04:57.550> would<00:04:57.759> on<00:04:57.999> a<00:04:58.029> bicycle<00:04:58.689> I

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
geometry like one would on a bicycle I

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.330 
geometry like one would on a bicycle I
would<00:04:59.139> probably<00:04:59.349> have<00:04:59.560> some<00:04:59.919> underlying

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
would probably have some underlying

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.489 
would probably have some underlying
curved<00:05:00.610> geometry<00:05:00.849> that<00:05:01.749> helped<00:05:01.990> me<00:05:02.139> sort<00:05:02.349> of

00:05:02.489 --> 00:05:02.499 
curved geometry that helped me sort of

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:04.320 
curved geometry that helped me sort of
obtain<00:05:03.159> the<00:05:03.400> shapes<00:05:03.699> that<00:05:03.909> I'm<00:05:03.999> trying<00:05:04.270> to

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
obtain the shapes that I'm trying to

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.149 
obtain the shapes that I'm trying to
look<00:05:04.509> for<00:05:04.749> now<00:05:05.199> I<00:05:05.229> need<00:05:05.349> to<00:05:05.529> pull<00:05:05.710> out<00:05:05.860> this

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:06.159 
look for now I need to pull out this

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:08.369 
look for now I need to pull out this
geometry<00:05:06.789> over<00:05:07.029> on<00:05:07.150> the<00:05:07.300> side<00:05:07.539> and<00:05:07.870> this<00:05:08.199> is

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:08.379 
geometry over on the side and this is

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:10.140 
geometry over on the side and this is
this<00:05:08.800> is<00:05:09.009> the<00:05:09.099> geometry<00:05:09.639> that's<00:05:09.789> going<00:05:10.090> to

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
this is the geometry that's going to

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.869 
this is the geometry that's going to
clear<00:05:10.930> for<00:05:11.169> the<00:05:11.229> bicycle<00:05:11.740> wheel<00:05:11.889> now<00:05:12.669> there's

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:12.879 
clear for the bicycle wheel now there's

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:14.610 
clear for the bicycle wheel now there's
a<00:05:12.939> lot<00:05:13.060> of<00:05:13.150> things<00:05:13.330> one<00:05:13.599> could<00:05:13.810> do<00:05:13.960> we<00:05:14.199> could<00:05:14.229> we

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
a lot of things one could do we could we

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.369 
a lot of things one could do we could we
could<00:05:14.830> scale<00:05:15.580> them<00:05:15.819> in<00:05:15.999> and<00:05:16.270> then<00:05:17.020> extrude

00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:17.379 
could scale them in and then extrude

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:20.969 
could scale them in and then extrude
them<00:05:17.469> out<00:05:18.689> okay<00:05:19.689> and<00:05:19.900> I<00:05:20.199> could<00:05:20.379> use<00:05:20.499> my<00:05:20.650> scale

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
them out okay and I could use my scale

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:22.739 
them out okay and I could use my scale
functionality<00:05:21.819> to<00:05:21.969> kind<00:05:22.150> of<00:05:22.240> bring<00:05:22.419> them<00:05:22.599> in

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:22.749 
functionality to kind of bring them in

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:29.790 
functionality to kind of bring them in
and<00:05:23.639> scale<00:05:24.639> them<00:05:24.789> out<00:05:24.879> again<00:05:28.650> I'm<00:05:29.650> going<00:05:29.740> to

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
and scale them out again I'm going to

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.320 
and scale them out again I'm going to
scale<00:05:30.039> it<00:05:30.279> one<00:05:30.490> more<00:05:30.729> and<00:05:30.909> that<00:05:30.999> this<00:05:31.089> one's

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
scale it one more and that this one's

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.600 
scale it one more and that this one's
going<00:05:31.479> to<00:05:31.539> go<00:05:31.629> pretty<00:05:32.379> far<00:05:32.680> and<00:05:33.039> then<00:05:33.490> I'm

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
going to go pretty far and then I'm

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.309 
going to go pretty far and then I'm
going<00:05:33.729> to<00:05:33.759> hit<00:05:33.879> one<00:05:34.150> that's<00:05:34.389> not<00:05:34.569> going<00:05:34.810> far

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 
going to hit one that's not going far

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:38.309 
going to hit one that's not going far
and<00:05:35.789> then<00:05:36.789> I'll<00:05:36.909> delete<00:05:37.599> the<00:05:37.779> outer<00:05:37.930> boundary

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:38.319 
and then I'll delete the outer boundary

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:39.839 
and then I'll delete the outer boundary
of<00:05:38.409> that<00:05:38.589> and<00:05:38.740> see<00:05:38.860> how<00:05:38.979> I've<00:05:39.129> got<00:05:39.430> a<00:05:39.639> nice

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:39.849 
of that and see how I've got a nice

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:44.219 
of that and see how I've got a nice
ellipse<00:05:41.039> so<00:05:42.039> that's<00:05:42.249> my<00:05:42.539> four<00:05:43.539> minute<00:05:43.839> five

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:44.229 
ellipse so that's my four minute five

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:47.730 
ellipse so that's my four minute five
minute<00:05:44.560> effort<00:05:44.770> to<00:05:45.520> share<00:05:46.060> sub<00:05:46.810> D<00:05:46.960> modeling<00:05:47.500> in

really<00:05:54.639> look<00:05:54.759> forward<00:05:55.089> to<00:05:56.039> creo<00:05:57.039> 2.0<00:05:57.879> at<00:05:58.479> which

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
really look forward to creo 2.0 at which

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.889 
really look forward to creo 2.0 at which
point<00:05:59.139> we'll<00:05:59.319> be<00:05:59.379> able<00:05:59.560> to<00:06:00.419> do<00:06:01.419> quite<00:06:01.629> a<00:06:01.719> bit

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:01.899 
point we'll be able to do quite a bit

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:04.619 
point we'll be able to do quite a bit
more<00:06:02.050> functionality<00:06:02.969> all<00:06:03.969> right<00:06:04.089> so<00:06:04.300> that's

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:04.629 
more functionality all right so that's

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:06.179 
more functionality all right so that's
