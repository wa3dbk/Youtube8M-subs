00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.069
 letter sorbet - now I'm here to see how the insertion works 

00:00:16.069 --> 00:00:19.069
 of the week on an aifon 4 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:23.869
 move the two apple models as you can see an ipad and an aifon 4 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.390
 and why we took these models simply because in both 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:33.099
 we use the format si but also known as 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.780
 last op nitroxy ma 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.780
 we peel the ipad 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.960
 to the ipad and mount 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.010
 a cover 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.320
 you will then find yourself reviewed on the site 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.640
 really excellent cover 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.130
 therefore 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.020
 with the metal pin you find inside the package 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.860
 I remember that the slot is but 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.500
 located on the right side 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.300
 delay for 4 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.790
 therefore we proceed then to disassemble the sim from the ipad 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.960
 on the left side 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.040
 perfect 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.560
 at this point 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.560
 dismantled to the sim 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.180
 from the ipad we can proceed with the assembly 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.180
 only aifon 4 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.180
 we always gently press into the slot 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.349
 Pedigree initially here was slightly harsh 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:17.899
 position the pin 

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:21.849
 i with a slight pressure 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:27.340
 the slot if it comes out I recommend you don't bring it if you feel like a certain one 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.129
 resistance always check why 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:34.729
 obviously it can be broken with a certain ease 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:37.299
 at this point 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.269
 inserted the sim and checked 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.489
 i then the contacts are facing down 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.569
 we proceed to its reintegration 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:56.869
 at this point the sim floor with 4 is ready to be used 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:02.659
 the lamp slot can be safely put back in place e 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.589
 this can be done using the suspended on the 4 

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:10.799
 a greeting to play so I do not recommend sign up so you will see 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.799
 others but the video maybe useless why not 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:17.429
 also for the use of these technologies 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.339
 the 2010 a fruit of the open moment
