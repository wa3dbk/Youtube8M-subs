heard of the system requirement so this

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.840 
heard of the system requirement so this
is<00:02:54.530> quite<00:02:54.620> interesting<00:02:54.770> the<00:02:55.520> system

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
is quite interesting the system

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.700 
is quite interesting the system
requirements<00:02:56.360> right<00:02:56.600> are<00:02:57.190> 512<00:02:58.190> of<00:02:58.610> RAM<00:02:59.080> 512<00:03:00.080> of
