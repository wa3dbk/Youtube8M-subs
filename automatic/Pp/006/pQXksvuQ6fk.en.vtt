used to buy your time together tubes up

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.920 
used to buy your time together tubes up
to<00:04:03.690> support<00:04:03.959> as<00:04:04.079> well<00:04:05.480> another<00:04:06.480> thing<00:04:06.810> to

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
to support as well another thing to

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.780 
to support as well another thing to
command<00:04:07.320> all<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.530> react<00:04:07.860> on<00:04:07.980> troops<00:04:08.250> is<00:04:08.489> they

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
command all the react on troops is they

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.060 
command all the react on troops is they
actually<00:04:09.269> gain<00:04:09.450> more<00:04:09.480> combat<00:04:10.049> bonuses<00:04:10.590> as

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
actually gain more combat bonuses as

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.460 
actually gain more combat bonuses as
they<00:04:11.310> engineered<00:04:12.060> unitless<00:04:12.450> ice<00:04:12.959> assault

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
they engineered unitless ice assault

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.800 
they engineered unitless ice assault
well<00:04:13.680> then<00:04:14.220> other<00:04:14.459> infantry<00:04:14.910> units<00:04:15.329> they

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
well then other infantry units they

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.569 
well then other infantry units they
don't<00:04:16.019> have<00:04:16.200> any<00:04:16.320> mentions<00:04:16.739> of<00:04:16.859> busybox<00:04:17.340> arm

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
don't have any mentions of busybox arm

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.210 
don't have any mentions of busybox arm
so<00:04:17.729> first<00:04:17.970> off<00:04:18.150> date<00:04:18.359> to<00:04:18.479> get<00:04:18.600> more<00:04:18.810> accurate

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
so first off date to get more accurate

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.770 
so first off date to get more accurate
second<00:04:20.220> veteran<00:04:20.669> to<00:04:20.790> rank<00:04:21.000> though<00:04:21.180> gives<00:04:21.630> an

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
second veteran to rank though gives an

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.810 
second veteran to rank though gives an

extremely unique bonus which is they

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.130 
extremely unique bonus which is they
actually<00:04:24.060> get<00:04:24.210> them<00:04:24.300> increase<00:04:24.630> quartzite

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
actually get them increase quartzite

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.469 
actually get them increase quartzite
they<00:04:25.800> are<00:04:25.979> the<00:04:26.160> only<00:04:26.370> unit<00:04:26.940> in<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.120> game<00:04:27.150> that

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
they are the only unit in the game that

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.870 
they are the only unit in the game that
gets<00:04:27.660> a<00:04:27.750> larger<00:04:28.169> sward<00:04:28.470> size<00:04:28.710> as<00:04:28.979> say<00:04:29.490> veterans

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
gets a larger sward size as say veterans

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.340 
gets a larger sward size as say veterans
yup<00:04:30.120> so<00:04:30.240> they<00:04:30.360> had<00:04:30.450> to<00:04:30.510> become<00:04:30.720> a<00:04:30.750> five-man

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
yup so they had to become a five-man

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.640 
yup so they had to become a five-man
squad<00:04:31.740> as<00:04:32.010> they<00:04:32.580> hit<00:04:32.729> their<00:04:32.940> two<00:04:33.060> into<00:04:33.300> two

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
negative three act to gain further

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.740 
negative three act to gain further
combat<00:04:35.820> abilities<00:04:36.390> that<00:04:36.450> they're<00:04:36.600> not

exactly<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:38.220> worst<00:04:38.520> unit<00:04:38.880> in<00:04:38.940> the<00:04:39.060> long<00:04:39.270> run

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
exactly the worst unit in the long run

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:40.880 
exactly the worst unit in the long run
we<00:04:39.660> got<00:04:39.780> to<00:04:39.900> get<00:04:40.020> this<00:04:40.140> embittering<00:04:40.560> they<00:04:40.770> can

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
we got to get this embittering they can

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.750 
we got to get this embittering they can
be<00:04:41.010> used<00:04:41.220> sort<00:04:41.640> of<00:04:41.880> useful<00:04:43.310> of<00:04:44.310> course<00:04:44.400> again<00:04:44.729> I

probably the game's cheapest anti-tank
infantry<00:05:35.900> team<00:05:38.140> since<00:05:39.140> they're<00:05:39.320> pretty<00:05:39.890> cheap

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
infantry team since they're pretty cheap

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.350 
infantry team since they're pretty cheap
again<00:05:40.550> you<00:05:40.670> know<00:05:40.790> again<00:05:40.940> if<00:05:41.030> they<00:05:41.090> get<00:05:41.210> a<00:05:41.240> bit

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
again you know again if they get a bit

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.730 
again you know again if they get a bit
of<00:05:41.420> veterans<00:05:41.660> they<00:05:41.780> become<00:05:41.960> even<00:05:42.170> harder<00:05:42.620> to

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
of veterans they become even harder to

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.650 
of veterans they become even harder to
kill<00:05:42.950> because<00:05:43.100> again<00:05:43.490> make<00:05:44.000> it<00:05:44.030> a<00:05:44.210> larger

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
kill because again make it a larger

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.140 
kill because again make it a larger
score<00:05:44.960> site<00:05:45.260> so<00:05:45.980> in<00:05:46.190> that<00:05:46.370> regard<00:05:46.760> the<00:05:47.000> rear

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
score site so in that regard the rear

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.460 
score site so in that regard the rear
come<00:05:47.390> on<00:05:47.480> troops<00:05:47.690> also<00:05:47.990> compared<00:05:48.320> to<00:05:48.350> the

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
come on troops also compared to the

come on troops also compared to the
other<00:05:48.740> units<00:05:49.670> do<00:05:49.820> possess<00:05:50.120> a<00:05:50.180> lot<00:05:50.360> more<00:05:50.570> a<00:05:50.600> neat

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
other units do possess a lot more a neat

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.240 
other units do possess a lot more a neat
flexibility<00:05:51.500> and<00:05:51.560> can<00:05:51.740> sort<00:05:51.950> of<00:05:51.980> be<00:05:52.070> pulled

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
flexibility and can sort of be pulled

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.580 
flexibility and can sort of be pulled
off<00:05:52.430> into<00:05:53.060> a<00:05:53.090> lot<00:05:53.270> more<00:05:53.480> duties<00:05:54.170> than<00:05:54.410> other

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590 
off into a lot more duties than other

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.730 
off into a lot more duties than other
units<00:05:55.960> so<00:05:56.960> there<00:05:57.080> are<00:05:57.140> a<00:05:57.200> lot<00:05:57.290> of<00:05:57.320> things<00:05:57.620> there

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
units so there are a lot of things there

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.400 
units so there are a lot of things there

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:42.140 
weaknesses of the reaction on troops I'm

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.990 
weaknesses of the reaction on troops I'm
pretty<00:06:42.950> confident<00:06:43.400> that<00:06:43.520> you'll<00:06:43.730> find

out<00:06:51.140> of<00:06:51.290> them<00:06:51.380> on<00:06:51.560> the<00:06:51.710> field<00:06:51.980> of<00:06:52.220> battle<00:06:53.440> so<00:06:54.440> I

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:54.470 
out of them on the field of battle so I

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.100 
out of them on the field of battle so I
think<00:06:54.620> that<00:06:54.980> sort<00:06:55.220> of<00:06:55.310> largely<00:06:56.090> covers<00:06:56.720> well

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
think that sort of largely covers well

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.390 
think that sort of largely covers well
more<00:06:57.350> the<00:06:57.500> basic<00:06:57.830> stuff<00:06:58.010> with<00:06:58.190> the<00:06:58.250> rear

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 
more the basic stuff with the rear

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.550 
more the basic stuff with the rear

miserable of course initially again they
are<00:07:06.170> weak

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:07.900 
are weak
