00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.930
 and I imagine that everyone will have 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.189
 followed the brazil 2014 world cup and 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.510
 Ozawa drew attention in Walqa 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.759
 us that most of the 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.620
 elections had several players that 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.719
 in his socks were some dots 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.980
 of the color of the average 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.270
 we have investigated we have 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.250
 realized that it is one of the 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.930
 most important innovations this year 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.850
 in terms of sports equipment that I 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.680
 be boots or gloves and it's about 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.630
 special socks that allow us 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.699
 that when we have no boots on 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.289
 we suffer new major discomforts that 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.540
 may exist that is that our foot will 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.160
 move inside the boot so that a 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.300
 brand called truck shops has designed 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.070
 some special socks 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.489
 anti-skid that we're going to pass to 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.489
 detail below 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.260
 the sock of your socks is one of the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.180
 most technical socks on the market already 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.159
 not only for the gel pills 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.050
 Anti-slip they have in the plant 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:57.780
 of the foot but by the construction of the 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.940
 own sock is a studied sock 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.440
 to serve the needs of a 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.269
 soccer player so they have played 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.280
 a lot with the thicknesses and the level of 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.799
 fit both in the area of ​​the cane as 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.509
 especially in the area of ​​the plant 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.640
 foot that is to say we find ourselves with a 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.159
 cane with a quite pretty thickness 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.289
 important enough had at the foot and 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.729
 when we go to the foot zone of the 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:20.460
 area that is directly going to 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.289
 bring play sensations to the fabric 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.659
 decreases that is one third more 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.280
 fine especially in the bridge area 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.899
 of the foot in the instep area which is the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.580
 that is going to hit the ball and yes that 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:30.750
 get a little more thick both 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.610
 in the heel as in the area of ​​the 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.740
 finger tips now we do not have a 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.840
 sock that did not have these 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.060
 Anti-slip areas would already be a big 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.429
 casting for the footballer but what 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.110
 really makes the difference is all 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:44.789
 this anti-slip zone that we see so much 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.100
 in the heel area as in the plant 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.270
 of the foot and in the toe and that although we 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.860
 it seems that it is also in the area 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.300
 outer sock this 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.310
 It is a decorative area that will help us 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.680
 to give brand image and to be seen from 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.580
 outside we're using a true box 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.930
 sox these these anti-slip gels 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.250
 no matter how much we use the sock for more 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.750
 that we will do it in no time 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.970
 they come off in no time lose 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.580
 properties and adhere completely 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.770
 as if it were Velcro on the boot when 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.630
 we have the foot tucked inside any 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.940
 action we make change of address 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.459
 braking is very annoying to notice that 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.200
 move that little slip that 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.330
 there's the cafeteria especially with this 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.430
 new inside the boot minimizes 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.970
 our feelings with the cafeteria true 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.370
 shops and also this brand has thought very 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.110
 well the needs of the footballer and not 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.920
 has designed the sock only for 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.380
 train if we open the box we see some 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.180
 instructions on how to use this 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.130
 sock also for matches 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.989
 adapting the average of our team of 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.420
 football to the properties of the sock 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.070
 true shocks in the packaging itself 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.739
 three shocks give us five singles 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.430
 steps to be able to manufacture us a 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.699
 sock true party shops 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.699
 [Music] 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.230
 the first step is to put on the sock 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.330
 of true shop always has to go from 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.040
 First 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.330
 we would go to a second step where 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.280
 choose the size of our team and 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.380
 cut the excess element cut in 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.240
 the foot area the area that goes to 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.350
 replace the sock directly on 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.800
 sock true socks 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.840
 [Music] 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.090
 once done this we put the average 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.610
 above already covering the shin guard 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.580
 in the fourth step we have to put the 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.130
 average always above the sock 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.980
 that is, the average has to cover the 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.350
 part of union of the sock and finally 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.180
 with a tape or some tape that you 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.070
 put the tape is the most appropriate 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.570
 your point of activity we cover the 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.100
 union in such a way that aesthetically 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.350
 we have an average of a single piece 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.630
 but we are really using a 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.890
 sock true shock without losing to a 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.360
 informed that they will demand us in 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.640
 our team to carry the average then 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.880
 with the sponsor's logo or the shield 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.880
 of the club 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.640
 You already know the properties of the sock 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.410
 that is revolutionizing the world of 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.580
 football is no longer going to be necessary that you 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.230
 you look at the template you bring in 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.730
 your soccer boots or in buying us 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.019
 some templates apart because with this 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.300
 catering you will have a feeling 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.340
 perfect during the most actions 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.080
 aggressive of your game and remember 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.070
