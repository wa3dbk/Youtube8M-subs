00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.500
 and the need for an acoustic instrument 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.360
 it is increasingly important who lives in 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.310
 cities in front of busy roads 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.900
 or near airports can not 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.760
 do without windows with a high 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.070
 sound insulation to sleep with 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.350
 quiet noise pollution 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.390
 not only causes insomnia but also 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.550
 difficult concentration and in cases 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.410
 extremes can cause serious damage to 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.960
 heard care sheridan and scholar 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.360
 lion dishonor penetrating the finestre 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.550
 Hindu in the sound waves go through 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.190
 the windows by two ways through the 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.770
 glass phenomenon called resonance since 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.510
 through joints that do not seal well the 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.430
 tightness of a window is also 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.530
 fundamental to protect the housing of 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.260
 drafts and to prevent the 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.720
 water entry when it rains for that purpose 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.940
 the finestrat windows made with a 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.800
 Modern double seal system are 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.150
 equipped with a wide drain chamber 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.640
 that diverts the water to the outside 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.500
 hot dimension camera that allows 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.080
 stop flowing the water gives only this ardo 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.759
 and you are ico made to fight the 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.619
 propagation of sound through the 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.300
 glasses it is useful to use glasses of 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.580
 different thicknesses that prevent the 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.560
 harmonic vibration of the crystals in 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.780
 this case are particularly indicated 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.399
 the composite glasses two moons of 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.590
 glass joined by a sheet 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.450
 special that forms a heavy glass but 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.369
 at the same time very elastic able to absorb 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.580
 effectively the transmission of the waves 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.580
 sound 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.120
 to avoid the penetration of noise to 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.190
 through gums that I do not know well 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.380
 It is perfectly necessary to use 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.180
 high elasticity joints applied 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.950
 with a uniform pressure throughout 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.110
 all the perimeter of the profile of the sheet 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.090
 in the standard execution of windows 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.740
 let's foresee the use of double board that 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.110
 prevents the entry of water and air to the 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.880
 inside the house to increase 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.920
 the level of soundproofing of the window 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.320
 you can also place a third 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.030
 together in the window connection to the 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.070
 work the use of sealing tapes 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.450
 sheets and silicone guarantees the 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.450
 installation tightness 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.690
 in the standard of the finestra range he already 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.400
 offers adequate sound insulation 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.510
 for example the proximity to a 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.510
 highway with normal traffic 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.090
 but when we need windows for a 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.400
 building located in front of a road with 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.110
 a lot of traffic it is indispensable to opt for 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.510
 special soundproofing glasses 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.160
 that with 42 decibels allow to obtain 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.610
 double the isolation with respect to a 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.610
 good and pretty 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.080
 On the other hand, if the house is 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.720
 located near an airport or a 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.970
 central highway proposes the window with 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.130
 combined sheet copied 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.830
 that thanks to its acoustic attenuation of 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.650
 47 decibels ensures maximum 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:52.160
 tranquility at every hour of the day and 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.320
 night and night 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.060
 of all the important components of 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.250
 the window the hardware is fundamental 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.200
 has to guarantee that even in case 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.970
 of strong wind loads the blade does not 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.890
 move from the joints which 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.750
 would prevent effective sound insulation 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.650
 and also allow unpleasant 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.650
 air currents 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.790
 finestrat uses only hardware from 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.530
 first quality to perform 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.220
 enclosures with an internal skill 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.380
 to class 4 air according to n 12.207 is the 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.970
 more restrictive class as well 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.130
 to airtightness to the impact of rain 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.850
 the windows finestrat reach the class 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.420
 9 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.580
 according to n in 12.200 8 the highest class 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.260
 thanks to the central joint system by 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.510
 which the drain occurs on the side 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.830
 outside of this board in this way 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.570
 the hardware elements are 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.960
 protected both from humidity and from 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.960
 The dirt 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.940
 the tightness of the elements 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.560
 you are subject to revisions 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.540
 constants through tests of 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.370
 lab performed both by 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.530
 independent institutes like by the 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.530

 protection from the weather
