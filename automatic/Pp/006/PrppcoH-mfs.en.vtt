to make a few adjustments I have a few

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.100

think it's a pretty strong attempt for

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.219 
think it's a pretty strong attempt for
such<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> complicated<00:01:37.409> character<00:01:39.229> alright

pink stripes in her mane also I had to

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.760 
pink stripes in her mane also I had to
push<00:01:59.700> her<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.909> little<00:02:00.000> close<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.689> left<00:02:01.079> well

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
her main would have actually extended

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.479 
her main would have actually extended
out<00:02:05.009> really<00:02:05.430> far<00:02:06.290> some<00:02:07.290> they<00:02:08.039> didn't<00:02:08.340> really

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
made here is Applejack this one was

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.089 
made here is Applejack this one was
pretty<00:02:28.920> tough<00:02:29.370> but<00:02:30.590> it's<00:02:31.590> because<00:02:31.950> the

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
pretty tough but it's because the

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.750 
pretty tough but it's because the
layering<00:02:32.519> and<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.629> hair<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:34.829> it<00:02:35.459> took<00:02:35.700> a

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
layering and the hair that it took a

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.170 
layering and the hair that it took a
while<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.120> get<00:02:36.390> this<00:02:36.599> hair<00:02:36.840> just<00:02:37.230> right<00:02:37.500> but<00:02:37.799> I

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
while to get this hair just right but I

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.250 
while to get this hair just right but I
ended<00:02:39.180> up<00:02:39.299> using<00:02:39.599> Oh<00:02:40.549> an<00:02:41.549> entire<00:02:42.060> bird<00:02:42.480> which

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
ended up using Oh an entire bird which

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.899 
ended up using Oh an entire bird which
made<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.650> layering<00:02:43.950> pretty<00:02:44.310> complicated

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
made the layering pretty complicated

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.030 
made the layering pretty complicated
because<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.180> bird<00:02:45.840> had<00:02:46.019> to<00:02:46.140> layer<00:02:46.349> under<00:02:46.769> some

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
because the bird had to layer under some

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.599 
because the bird had to layer under some
of<00:02:47.159> the<00:02:47.310> neck<00:02:47.519> and<00:02:48.440> below<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.470> hat<00:02:49.859> but<00:02:50.310> also

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
of the neck and below the hat but also

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.809 
of the neck and below the hat but also
above<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.359> head<00:02:51.829> so<00:02:52.829> I<00:02:52.859> had<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.459> change

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
above the head so I had to change

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.210 
above the head so I had to change
layering<00:02:54.180> up<00:02:54.480> from<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.379> base<00:02:55.590> oh<00:02:55.829> and<00:02:56.069> by<00:02:56.190> the

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
layering up from the base oh and by the

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.379 
layering up from the base oh and by the
way<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.819> base<00:02:57.030> i've<00:02:57.269> been<00:02:57.450> using<00:02:57.659> it's<00:02:58.409> from

base<00:03:18.769> to<00:03:19.769> make<00:03:20.220> my<00:03:20.430> ponies<00:03:20.819> in<00:03:21.030> fact<00:03:21.239> when<00:03:21.810> I

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
base to make my ponies in fact when I

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.720 
base to make my ponies in fact when I
started<00:03:22.319> I<00:03:22.470> had<00:03:22.620> something<00:03:23.010> pretty<00:03:23.220> close<00:03:23.549> to

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
started I had something pretty close to

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.119 
started I had something pretty close to
what<00:03:23.849> he<00:03:24.030> was<00:03:24.180> using<00:03:24.419> but<00:03:25.169> the<00:03:25.560> nose<00:03:25.829> just

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
what he was using but the nose just

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.830 
what he was using but the nose just
wasn't<00:03:26.489> right<00:03:26.699> and<00:03:27.000> then<00:03:27.269> I<00:03:27.359> saw<00:03:27.569> this<00:03:27.660> video

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
wasn't right and then I saw this video

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.520 
wasn't right and then I saw this video
so<00:03:28.940> it<00:03:29.940> actually<00:03:30.269> made<00:03:30.629> the<00:03:30.750> nose<00:03:30.780> really<00:03:31.230> good

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
so it actually made the nose really good

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.890 
so it actually made the nose really good
with<00:03:31.859> the<00:03:31.889> sacrifice<00:03:32.519> of<00:03:32.549> one<00:03:32.940> layer<00:03:33.180> so<00:03:33.660> I<00:03:33.690> had

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
with the sacrifice of one layer so I had

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.330 
with the sacrifice of one layer so I had
to<00:03:33.930> sacrifice<00:03:34.470> a<00:03:34.829> few<00:03:34.980> details<00:03:35.579> on<00:03:36.000> some<00:03:36.750> of<00:03:36.870> my

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
to sacrifice a few details on some of my

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:43.990 
to sacrifice a few details on some of my
ponies<00:03:39.109> alright<00:03:40.109> so<00:03:40.379> anyways<00:03:41.190> with<00:03:42.060> Applejack

that<00:03:45.000> entire<00:03:45.389> bird<00:03:45.750> made<00:03:46.019> it<00:03:46.139> very

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
that entire bird made it very

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.589 
that entire bird made it very
complicated<00:03:47.099> for<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:47.639> layering<00:03:47.910> that<00:03:48.209> he<00:03:48.480> was

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
complicated for the layering that he was

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.699 
complicated for the layering that he was
using<00:03:49.099> so<00:03:50.099> I<00:03:50.129> had<00:03:50.549> to<00:03:50.579> change<00:03:50.879> it<00:03:51.000> up<00:03:51.090> a<00:03:51.180> bit

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
using so I had to change it up a bit

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.759

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319

coves<00:04:13.780> base<00:04:14.109> but<00:04:14.650> I<00:04:15.720> actually<00:04:16.720> had<00:04:17.079> to<00:04:17.199> make

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
coves base but I actually had to make

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.580 
coves base but I actually had to make
this<00:04:17.560> one<00:04:17.769> from<00:04:18.039> scratch<00:04:18.340> and<00:04:19.590> surprisingly

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
this one from scratch and surprisingly

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.080 
this one from scratch and surprisingly
this<00:04:20.709> one<00:04:20.979> came<00:04:21.190> out<00:04:21.310> easier<00:04:21.789> than<00:04:21.970> I<00:04:22.060> thought

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
this one came out easier than I thought

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.629 
this one came out easier than I thought
it<00:04:22.330> would<00:04:22.449> look<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:23.590> layering<00:04:24.070> is<00:04:24.340> a<00:04:24.370> little

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
it would look the layering is a little

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.400 
it would look the layering is a little
complicated<00:04:25.030> because<00:04:25.509> the<00:04:25.690> hair<00:04:26.020> was<00:04:26.169> pretty

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
complicated because the hair was pretty

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.680 
complicated because the hair was pretty
complex<00:04:26.830> as<00:04:27.039> well<00:04:27.250> but<00:04:27.520> I<00:04:27.729> mean<00:04:28.000> it<00:04:28.300> was<00:04:28.389> still

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
complex as well but I mean it was still

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.330 
complex as well but I mean it was still
easy<00:04:28.900> to<00:04:29.020> make<00:04:30.660> um<00:04:31.660> from<00:04:32.440> this<00:04:32.800> image<00:04:33.130> that<00:04:33.310> I

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
easy to make um from this image that I

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.159 
easy to make um from this image that I
have<00:04:33.610> I<00:04:33.880> know<00:04:34.000> it's<00:04:34.240> shitty<00:04:34.570> quality<00:04:34.780> I<00:04:35.080> took

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
have I know it's shitty quality I took

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.960 
have I know it's shitty quality I took
it<00:04:35.440> with<00:04:35.530> my<00:04:35.680> phone<00:04:37.080> she<00:04:38.080> does<00:04:38.289> have<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:38.620> crown

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
it with my phone she does have the crown

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.710 
it with my phone she does have the crown
but<00:04:39.970> it's<00:04:40.210> um<00:04:41.310> black<00:04:42.310> on<00:04:42.520> black<00:04:42.550> background<00:04:43.090> so

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.980 
but it's um black on black background so
it's<00:04:43.870> really<00:04:44.259> hard<00:04:44.500> to<00:04:44.650> see<00:04:45.120> i'm<00:04:46.120> still

experimenting with it though because i
just<00:04:48.639> can't<00:04:49.030> get<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.479> crown<00:04:49.810> to<00:04:49.840> look<00:04:50.139> right
