00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:10.380
 the old rose rose 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:14.940
 seeing his stage fulfilled decided to live 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.070
 life enjoying its fortune not 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.210
 they made no way of doing it 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:27.210
 reflect tired of working the day 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:31.529
 who turned 70 said I put everything on sale 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:36.180
 the longer I can last and there launched a 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.850
 challenge saying only I'm already enough 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.320
 silver I spend it because what is mine 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.859
 is mine without hearing the shouting of their children 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.010
 that at the same time they could not resign themselves 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:51.059
 the inheritance will be spent if he shouted 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.380
 in the face 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.310
 The longer I can last 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:01.910
 of bombachas and espadrille to the capital 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:04.670
 old and there a floor was bought with sight 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.360
 to the river of silver as it had come to 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:11.840
 Paw was an agency to look for a car 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:15.460
 to walk with tinted windows and 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.670
 telling employees how much more 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.490
 I can last 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.520
 yes 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.689
 I take the collection of your times 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.570
 rider and on top of a stool he had it 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:32.689
 accommodated when he was enthusiastic about 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.899
 he used to ride and the people of 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:41.630
 place that from below I saw it from the 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:45.770
 balcony told him how much longer I can last 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:49.850
 the years was spent in luxury and in 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:53.930
 festive I throw them both from the piolas that 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:57.700
 dry it was almost at 90 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.649
 when there was no more to spend 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:06.350
 happy he came to think that poverty 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:09.759
 does not kill old without field and without silver 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.420
 the longer it could last 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:17.230
 and in a little ranch he lived to the end of 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:20.650
 his days then the family offended without 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:24.310
 inheritance ignored his example to me 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.629
 already served you to you what 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.079
 I come to invite 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:34.120
 be encouraged to challenge the storm though 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:38.489
 Wet and do whatever you want 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.489
 The longer it can last
