for<00:00:17.360> speed<00:00:17.930> and<00:00:18.140> that's<00:00:18.619> going<00:00:18.800> to<00:00:18.860> supposed

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
for speed and that's going to supposed

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.100 
for speed and that's going to supposed
to<00:00:19.220> come<00:00:19.369> in<00:00:19.520> a<00:00:19.580> couple<00:00:19.610> ways<00:00:20.000> in<00:00:20.449> terms<00:00:20.780> of<00:00:21.020> the

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110 
to come in a couple ways in terms of the

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.109 
to come in a couple ways in terms of the
processor<00:00:21.500> I<00:00:21.530> did<00:00:21.830> notice<00:00:22.039> a<00:00:22.550> little<00:00:23.000> bit

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
processor I did notice a little bit

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.630 
processor I did notice a little bit
quicker<00:00:23.330> opening<00:00:24.320> certain<00:00:24.650> things<00:00:24.920> scrolling

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
quicker opening certain things scrolling

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.359 
quicker opening certain things scrolling
between<00:00:25.910> the<00:00:26.000> menu<00:00:26.240> pages<00:00:26.480> on<00:00:26.900> this<00:00:27.529> 3g<00:00:28.100> speed

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
between the menu pages on this 3g speed

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.070 
between the menu pages on this 3g speed
however<00:00:28.580> that<00:00:29.060> is<00:00:29.180> going<00:00:29.330> to<00:00:29.390> be<00:00:29.480> depend<00:00:29.810> on<00:00:29.990> a

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
however that is going to be depend on a

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.559 
however that is going to be depend on a
tease<00:00:30.529> network<00:00:30.920> what<00:00:31.580> ATT<00:00:32.029> is<00:00:32.119> doing<00:00:32.449> is

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:32.569 
tease network what ATT is doing is

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:34.840 
tease network what ATT is doing is
removing<00:00:32.689> to<00:00:33.019> which<00:00:33.140> hsdpa<00:00:34.129> network<00:00:34.640> which

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
removing to which hsdpa network which

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.059 
removing to which hsdpa network which
proves<00:00:35.120> supposed<00:00:35.479> to<00:00:35.569> provide<00:00:35.780> 7.2<00:00:36.589> megabytes

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:37.069 
proves supposed to provide 7.2 megabytes

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:40.419 
proves supposed to provide 7.2 megabytes
per<00:00:37.219> second<00:00:37.670> however<00:00:38.769> ATT<00:00:39.769> really<00:00:40.159> isn't

00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:40.429 
per second however ATT really isn't

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:41.799 
per second however ATT really isn't
going<00:00:40.550> to<00:00:40.609> get<00:00:40.760> there<00:00:40.940> until<00:00:41.149> later<00:00:41.539> this<00:00:41.749> year

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
going to get there until later this year

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.079 
going to get there until later this year
so<00:00:42.409> while<00:00:43.010> the<00:00:43.100> phone<00:00:43.399> may<00:00:43.729> be<00:00:43.789> able<00:00:43.940> to

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:44.089 
so while the phone may be able to

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:46.809 
so while the phone may be able to
support<00:00:44.239> faster<00:00:45.109> network<00:00:45.440> speeds<00:00:45.799> AT&amp;T<00:00:46.789> is

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:46.819 
support faster network speeds AT&amp;T is

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:49.180 
support faster network speeds AT&amp;T is
really<00:00:47.179> the<00:00:47.269> one<00:00:47.389> driving<00:00:47.780> that<00:00:47.809> so<00:00:48.170> just<00:00:49.039> an

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
really the one driving that so just an

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.579 
really the one driving that so just an
important<00:00:49.579> point<00:00:50.139> overall<00:00:51.139> the<00:00:51.229> phone<00:00:51.409> has

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:51.589 
important point overall the phone has

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:53.289 
important point overall the phone has
like<00:00:51.739> almost<00:00:52.129> exactly<00:00:52.519> the<00:00:52.639> same<00:00:52.729> design<00:00:53.149> is

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:53.299 
like almost exactly the same design is

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:55.719 
like almost exactly the same design is
the<00:00:53.389> iphone<00:00:53.510> 3g<00:00:54.139> it<00:00:54.799> does<00:00:55.039> come<00:00:55.219> in<00:00:55.339> black<00:00:55.370> and
