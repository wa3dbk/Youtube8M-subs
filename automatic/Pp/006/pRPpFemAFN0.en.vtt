00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:11.050
 let's see how to vacuum pack 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:14.570
 food inside a glass jar 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.850
 using the domestic packaging machine for 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.910
 we will need the packaging machine 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:23.170
 domestic 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.840
 couple to make the vacuum in boats the 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.270
 tube to connect the boat with the 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:32.050
 packaging machine and the food that we want 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:35.230
 packaging as we see at a glance is a 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:39.270
 jar with food although you what 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:42.810
 strong closures then normal opens 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.490
 for this we will see the packaging 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:49.730
 and we will take the food and put it 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:53.660
 inside the big boat 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:56.780
 the boat we see that the boat 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.400
 opens it closes without any problem and 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.340
 put it we will put in the option of emptying 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.560
 although although it is in this option we see 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.980
 that we open it and close it without any 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.260
 problem for it has the band that 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.300
 will help to make the void 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.460
 we take the coupling 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.580
 we will attach the smallest 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.740
 in the boat 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.740
 and then the biggest one for the packing machine 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.590
 and we give the option option to empty 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.590
 until we believe that it is at 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.670
 once we have observed the change of 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.670
 noise 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.890
 undock we have the boat we see that yes 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.400
 that was strongly that we can not 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.520
 remove and we will observe with the simple 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:03.400
 noise we will observe that the 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.400
 empty we will turn to the open position 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:12.400
 and now it is open and now 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.180
 we see that a vacuum has been made in the 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.870
 inner boat 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.849
 it is already seen in the lid that is more 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.700
 bulged inward from what was 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:26.680
 and now in the sound we will observe with the 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.680
 sound we will observe that it is empty 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.160
 and this is all
