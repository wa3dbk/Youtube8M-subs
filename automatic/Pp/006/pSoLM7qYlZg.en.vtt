today i'm bringing you a brand new video
that<00:00:04.080> is<00:00:04.170> going<00:00:04.350> to<00:00:04.410> be<00:00:04.680> the<00:00:05.190> exploit<00:00:05.879> to<00:00:06.330> the

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
that is going to be the exploit to the

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.040 
that is going to be the exploit to the
nuclear<00:00:07.410> eject<00:00:08.010> for<00:00:08.700> capture<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.510> flag<00:00:09.750> or

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
nuclear eject for capture the flag or

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.669 
nuclear eject for capture the flag or
any<00:00:10.200> game<00:00:10.530> mode<00:00:10.769> it's<00:00:11.250> basically<00:00:11.880> a

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:12.679 
any game mode it's basically a

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.709 
any game mode it's basically a
mechanical<00:00:13.679> glitch<00:00:14.309> with<00:00:14.700> getting<00:00:15.450> from

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
mechanical glitch with getting from

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.740 
mechanical glitch with getting from
point<00:00:16.049> A<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.230> point<00:00:16.410> B<00:00:16.740> from<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.640> ejection<00:00:18.270> in

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
point A to point B from a ejection in

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.200 
point A to point B from a ejection in
your<00:00:19.020> Titan<00:00:19.439> it's<00:00:20.130> really<00:00:20.520> unfair<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.090> you

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
your Titan it's really unfair and you

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.300 
your Titan it's really unfair and you
can<00:00:21.390> go<00:00:21.510> from<00:00:21.750> flag<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.199> flag<00:00:22.439> on<00:00:22.769> just<00:00:23.160> about

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
can go from flag to flag on just about

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.250 
can go from flag to flag on just about
any<00:00:23.609> map<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.210> capture<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.689> flag<00:00:24.869> with<00:00:25.080> it

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
any map and capture the flag with it

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.429 
any map and capture the flag with it
while<00:00:25.890> holding<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.279> flag<00:00:26.609> I'll<00:00:26.820> show<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.090> how

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
while holding the flag I'll show you how

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.900 
while holding the flag I'll show you how
also<00:00:28.439> just<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.599> expose<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.669> I'll<00:00:32.669> show<00:00:32.880> you

also just to expose it and I'll show you

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.080 
also just to expose it and I'll show you
the<00:00:33.120> pros<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.450> cons<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.440> i<00:00:34.940> will<00:00:35.940> show

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
the pros and cons to it so i will show

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.090 
the pros and cons to it so i will show
you<00:00:36.180> guys<00:00:36.239> first<00:00:36.660> very<00:00:36.989> very<00:00:37.260> quick<00:00:37.559> how<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.860> do

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
you guys first very very quick how to do

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.700 
you guys first very very quick how to do
it<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.610> will<00:00:38.730> need<00:00:38.910> stem<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:40.290> will<00:00:40.440> need

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
it you will need stem and you will need

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.459 
it you will need stem and you will need
nuclear<00:00:41.250> eject<00:00:42.000> for<00:00:42.360> your<00:00:42.480> Titan<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.200> your

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
nuclear eject for your Titan so your

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.529 
nuclear eject for your Titan so your
first<00:00:43.649> step<00:00:43.800> need<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.370> get<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.760> flag<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.360> you

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
first step need to get the flag and you

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.450 
first step need to get the flag and you
need<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.809> get<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.110> your<00:00:46.200> Titan<00:00:46.620> what<00:00:47.340> will

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
need to get in your Titan what will

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.369 
need to get in your Titan what will
happen<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.059> flag<00:00:48.300> will<00:00:48.480> drop<00:00:48.750> right<00:00:49.079> below

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
happen is the flag will drop right below

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.889 
happen is the flag will drop right below
your<00:00:49.500> Titan<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.239> right<00:00:51.239> when<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.539> happens

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
your Titan and right when that happens

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.430 
your Titan and right when that happens
you<00:00:52.079> want<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.320> face<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.949> opposite<00:00:53.579> direction

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
you want to face the opposite direction

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.799 
you want to face the opposite direction
from<00:00:55.440> where<00:00:55.649> your<00:00:55.829> flag<00:00:56.070> zone<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.850> you

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
from where your flag zone is and you

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.779 
from where your flag zone is and you
don't<00:00:58.050> want<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.410> move<00:00:58.590> from<00:00:58.949> where<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.520> flag

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
don't want to move from where the flag

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.189 
don't want to move from where the flag
dropped<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.300> want<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.510> be<00:01:00.600> right<00:01:00.780> on<00:01:00.840> top<00:01:01.170> of

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
dropped you want to be right on top of

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.920 
dropped you want to be right on top of
it<00:01:01.469> otherwise<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:02.070> will<00:01:02.309> not<00:01:02.489> work<00:01:02.930> next

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
it otherwise this will not work next

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.320 
it otherwise this will not work next
what<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.170> want<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.470> do<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.830> want<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.330> start

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
what you want to do is you want to start

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.609 
what you want to do is you want to start
ejecting<00:01:06.979> once<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.340> eject<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.080> second

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
ejecting once you eject this the second

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.170 
ejecting once you eject this the second
after<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.340> eject<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.780> need<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.380> press<00:01:13.560> stem

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
after you eject you need to press stem

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.090 
after you eject you need to press stem
that<00:01:15.180> split-second<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.650> important<00:01:17.040> you

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
that split-second is so important you

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.670 
that split-second is so important you
need<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.280> press<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.580> right<00:01:18.240> after<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.840> eject

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
need to press a right after you eject

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.270 
need to press a right after you eject
and<00:01:19.970> right<00:01:20.970> when<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.270> happens<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.960> do<00:01:22.680> 180

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
and right when this happens you do 180

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.370 
and right when this happens you do 180
that's<00:01:23.610> why<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:23.939> are<00:01:24.210> that's<00:01:24.869> why<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.110> face

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
that's why you are that's why you face

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.170 
that's why you are that's why you face
the<00:01:25.770> opposite<00:01:26.220> direction<00:01:26.340> with<00:01:26.729> your<00:01:26.880> Titan

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
the opposite direction with your Titan

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.060 
the opposite direction with your Titan
you<00:01:27.270> need<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.509> do<00:01:27.630> 180<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.500> what<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.009> does

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
you need to do 180 and what this does

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.780 
you need to do 180 and what this does
what<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.759> stem<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.540> creates<00:01:30.840> velocity

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
what the stem is it creates velocity

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
what the stem is it creates velocity
when<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.939> turn<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:34.020> go<00:01:34.259> forward<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:34.920> way

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
when you turn to go forward that way

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.969 
when you turn to go forward that way
once<00:01:36.810> you're<00:01:36.990> facing<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.470> opposite

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
once you're facing the opposite

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.190 
once you're facing the opposite
direction<00:01:38.040> from<00:01:38.610> where<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.970> were<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.869> you

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
direction from where you were and you

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.039 
direction from where you were and you
can<00:01:40.380> basically<00:01:40.560> be<00:01:41.280> running<00:01:41.790> an<00:01:41.939> error<00:01:42.270> with

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
can basically be running an error with

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.109 
can basically be running an error with
what's<00:01:43.619> Tim<00:01:43.920> pretty<00:01:44.250> much<00:01:44.490> that's<00:01:44.820> what<00:01:45.030> it

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
what's Tim pretty much that's what it

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.550 
what's Tim pretty much that's what it
looks<00:01:45.329> like<00:01:45.570> whenever<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.079> watch<00:01:46.320> somebody

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
looks like whenever you watch somebody

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.929 
looks like whenever you watch somebody
else<00:01:46.710> do<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.250> that's<00:01:47.340> pretty<00:01:47.640> much<00:01:47.759> the

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
else do it and that's pretty much the

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.420 
else do it and that's pretty much the
effects<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.689> it's<00:01:49.290> kind<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.220> like<00:01:50.369> a

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
effects of it it's kind of like a

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.370 
effects of it it's kind of like a
mechanical<00:01:51.119> glitch<00:01:51.479> I'm<00:01:51.689> not<00:01:51.810> sure<00:01:52.079> if<00:01:52.170> it's<00:01:52.229> a

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
mechanical glitch I'm not sure if it's a

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.770 
mechanical glitch I'm not sure if it's a
glitch<00:01:52.649> or<00:01:52.799> not<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.729> may<00:01:53.970> just<00:01:54.000> be<00:01:54.299> something

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
glitch or not it may just be something

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.539 
glitch or not it may just be something
in<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:54.960> engine<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.500> isn't<00:01:55.860> intended<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.430> be

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
in the engine that isn't intended to be

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.940 
in the engine that isn't intended to be
there<00:01:56.729> but<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.119> sure

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
there but I sure

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.459 
there but I sure
as<00:01:58.369> heck<00:01:58.729> know<00:01:59.030> that<00:01:59.270> respawn<00:01:59.780> didn't<00:02:00.110> want<00:02:00.289> us

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
as heck know that respawn didn't want us

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:02.469 
as heck know that respawn didn't want us
to<00:02:00.680> fly<00:02:00.890> across<00:02:01.039> the<00:02:01.250> map<00:02:01.579> with<00:02:01.820> our<00:02:02.000> ejects

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
to fly across the map with our ejects

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.139 
to fly across the map with our ejects
just<00:02:02.960> they<00:02:03.649> just<00:02:03.680> wanted<00:02:04.159> us<00:02:04.340> to<00:02:04.520> fly<00:02:04.729> a<00:02:04.759> little

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
just they just wanted us to fly a little

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.899 
just they just wanted us to fly a little
bit<00:02:05.360> so<00:02:05.869> we<00:02:06.079> can<00:02:06.110> get<00:02:06.409> away<00:02:06.549> alright<00:02:07.549> so<00:02:07.759> that's

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
bit so we can get away alright so that's

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.150 
bit so we can get away alright so that's
the<00:02:08.119> tutorial<00:02:08.720> of<00:02:08.810> it<00:02:08.989> I'm<00:02:09.170> going<00:02:09.349> to<00:02:09.410> tell<00:02:10.129> you

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
the tutorial of it I'm going to tell you

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.800 
the tutorial of it I'm going to tell you
really<00:02:10.489> quickly<00:02:10.849> what<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.390> pros<00:02:11.599> and<00:02:11.629> cons

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
really quickly what the pros and cons

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.360 
really quickly what the pros and cons
are<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:13.069> con<00:02:13.310> is<00:02:13.340> that<00:02:13.700> it's<00:02:14.380> barely<00:02:15.380> able<00:02:15.980> to

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
are the con is that it's barely able to

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.610 
are the con is that it's barely able to
be<00:02:16.819> shot<00:02:17.120> down<00:02:17.390> you're<00:02:17.900> barely<00:02:18.080> able<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.500> be

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
be shot down you're barely able to be

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.309 
be shot down you're barely able to be
shot<00:02:18.830> down<00:02:19.040> because<00:02:19.480> with<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.630> velocity<00:02:21.290> of

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
shot down because with the velocity of

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.780 
shot down because with the velocity of
the<00:02:21.470> character<00:02:21.980> when<00:02:22.130> they're<00:02:22.250> flying<00:02:22.459> in<00:02:22.670> the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
the character when they're flying in the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.360 
the character when they're flying in the
air<00:02:22.819> lots<00:02:23.690> of<00:02:23.900> bullets<00:02:24.049> do<00:02:24.470> not<00:02:24.650> register<00:02:24.860> on

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
air lots of bullets do not register on

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.270 
air lots of bullets do not register on
that<00:02:25.549> body<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.120> you<00:02:27.080> have<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.470> be<00:02:27.680> very<00:02:27.950> very

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
that body and you have to be very very

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.160 
that body and you have to be very very
experienced<00:02:29.030> or<00:02:29.180> shooting<00:02:29.540> it<00:02:29.690> or<00:02:29.900> have<00:02:30.140> a

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
experienced or shooting it or have a

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.559 
experienced or shooting it or have a
chain<00:02:30.470> gun<00:02:30.739> lots<00:02:31.549> of<00:02:31.670> times<00:02:31.880> people<00:02:32.150> are<00:02:32.330> too

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
chain gun lots of times people are too

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.150 
chain gun lots of times people are too
high<00:02:32.810> for<00:02:33.170> you<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.440> even<00:02:33.560> shoot<00:02:33.769> them<00:02:33.920> with<00:02:33.950> an

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
high for you to even shoot them with an

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.059 
high for you to even shoot them with an
arc<00:02:34.400> cannon<00:02:34.989> so<00:02:35.989> that's<00:02:36.200> why<00:02:36.470> it's<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:36.799> little

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
arc cannon so that's why it's a little

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.960 
arc cannon so that's why it's a little
bit<00:02:37.190> unfair<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:38.920> it<00:02:39.920> doesn't<00:02:40.310> take<00:02:40.340> a<00:02:40.700> lot<00:02:40.910> of

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
bit unfair and it doesn't take a lot of

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.330 
bit unfair and it doesn't take a lot of
skill<00:02:41.930> because<00:02:42.140> you<00:02:42.650> aren't<00:02:42.890> running<00:02:43.040> on<00:02:43.250> the

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
skill because you aren't running on the

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.130 
skill because you aren't running on the
ground<00:02:43.549> obviously<00:02:44.209> you're<00:02:44.480> not<00:02:44.569> doing<00:02:44.870> routes

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
ground obviously you're not doing routes

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.380 
ground obviously you're not doing routes
you're<00:02:45.829> not<00:02:45.980> going<00:02:46.250> on<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:46.400> titans<00:02:46.790> back<00:02:47.000> to<00:02:47.209> run

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
you're not going on a titans back to run

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.140 
you're not going on a titans back to run
it<00:02:47.540> so<00:02:48.380> that's<00:02:48.560> why<00:02:48.799> it's<00:02:48.829> unfair<00:02:49.700> in<00:02:49.970> my

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
it so that's why it's unfair in my

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.050 
it so that's why it's unfair in my
opinion<00:02:50.450> a<00:02:51.160> lot<00:02:52.160> of<00:02:52.310> people<00:02:52.549> do<00:02:52.730> is<00:02:52.880> in

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
opinion a lot of people do is in

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.229 
opinion a lot of people do is in
competitive<00:02:53.660> to<00:02:54.049> win<00:02:54.260> games<00:02:54.700> to<00:02:55.700> get<00:02:55.849> to<00:02:56.090> win

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
competitive to win games to get to win

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.509 
competitive to win games to get to win
clutch<00:02:56.599> games<00:02:56.930> that<00:02:57.290> they<00:02:57.440> don't<00:02:57.680> deserve<00:02:58.220> and

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
clutch games that they don't deserve and

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.050 
clutch games that they don't deserve and
it<00:02:59.390> is<00:02:59.660> really<00:03:00.140> upsetting<00:03:00.680> in<00:03:01.280> my<00:03:01.610> own<00:03:01.790> opinion

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
it is really upsetting in my own opinion

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.349 
it is really upsetting in my own opinion
as<00:03:02.359> a<00:03:02.389> competitive<00:03:02.840> player<00:03:03.079> the<00:03:03.799> pros<00:03:04.359> pros

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
as a competitive player the pros pros

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:07.690 
as a competitive player the pros pros
are<00:03:05.690> if<00:03:06.019> you're<00:03:06.680> really<00:03:06.829> desperate<00:03:07.130> to<00:03:07.519> get<00:03:07.639> a

are if you're really desperate to get a

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.640 
are if you're really desperate to get a
flag<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:08.239> you<00:03:08.299> can't<00:03:08.510> run<00:03:08.780> it<00:03:08.959> and<00:03:09.170> you<00:03:09.380> can't

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
flag and you can't run it and you can't

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:10.900 
flag and you can't run it and you can't
get<00:03:09.769> on<00:03:09.859> a<00:03:09.889> titans<00:03:10.250> back<00:03:10.489> and<00:03:10.730> you<00:03:10.790> have

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
get on a titans back and you have

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.390 
get on a titans back and you have
limited<00:03:11.239> time<00:03:11.420> you<00:03:12.380> basically<00:03:12.590> teleport<00:03:13.340> to

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
limited time you basically teleport to

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.940 
limited time you basically teleport to
your<00:03:13.519> flag<00:03:13.760> if<00:03:14.120> your<00:03:14.989> team<00:03:15.200> keeps<00:03:15.470> them<00:03:15.680> from

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
your flag if your team keeps them from

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.289 
your flag if your team keeps them from
shooting<00:03:16.280> you<00:03:16.310> down<00:03:16.400> with<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.850> chain<00:03:17.060> gun

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
shooting you down with the chain gun

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.800 
shooting you down with the chain gun
it's<00:03:18.049> basically<00:03:18.530> it<00:03:19.090> also<00:03:20.090> though<00:03:20.269> you<00:03:20.630> don't

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
it's basically it also though you don't

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.229 
it's basically it also though you don't
have<00:03:21.019> to<00:03:21.230> use<00:03:21.470> it<00:03:21.709> for<00:03:21.980> just<00:03:22.310> flags<00:03:22.639> you<00:03:22.970> can

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
have to use it for just flags you can

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:24.759 
have to use it for just flags you can
use<00:03:23.450> it<00:03:23.600> anytime<00:03:23.870> that<00:03:24.260> you're<00:03:24.350> tightened

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
use it anytime that you're tightened

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.780 
use it anytime that you're tightened
dies<00:03:24.950> as<00:03:25.340> long<00:03:25.519> as<00:03:25.609> you<00:03:25.790> have<00:03:26.660> nuclear<00:03:27.370> on<00:03:28.370> it

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
dies as long as you have nuclear on it

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.330 
dies as long as you have nuclear on it
the<00:03:29.389> only<00:03:29.660> reason<00:03:30.470> that<00:03:30.500> you<00:03:30.709> have<00:03:30.889> nuclear

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
the only reason that you have nuclear

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.860 
the only reason that you have nuclear
though<00:03:31.609> is<00:03:31.790> so<00:03:31.970> that<00:03:32.090> you<00:03:32.209> can<00:03:32.389> fly<00:03:32.630> even

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
though is so that you can fly even

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.800 
though is so that you can fly even
further<00:03:33.739> you<00:03:34.700> can<00:03:34.880> have<00:03:35.030> it<00:03:35.180> without<00:03:35.420> nuclear

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
further you can have it without nuclear

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.229 
further you can have it without nuclear
but<00:03:36.260> at<00:03:36.440> that<00:03:36.470> point<00:03:36.920> it's<00:03:37.220> not<00:03:37.340> really<00:03:37.819> a<00:03:37.850> flag

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
but at that point it's not really a flag

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.960 
but at that point it's not really a flag
to<00:03:38.450> flag<00:03:38.660> thing<00:03:39.049> it's<00:03:39.230> more<00:03:39.500> of<00:03:39.590> a<00:03:39.709> I<00:03:40.040> need<00:03:40.849> to

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
to flag thing it's more of a I need to

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.699 
to flag thing it's more of a I need to
get<00:03:41.150> the<00:03:41.329> heck<00:03:41.510> out<00:03:41.750> of<00:03:41.780> here<00:03:42.109> and<00:03:42.230> go<00:03:42.410> even

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
get the heck out of here and go even

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.129 
get the heck out of here and go even
farther<00:03:42.950> than<00:03:43.340> that<00:03:43.400> I<00:03:43.609> meant<00:03:44.180> to<00:03:44.359> UM<00:03:44.540> the

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
farther than that I meant to UM the

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.229 
farther than that I meant to UM the
nuclear<00:03:45.500> just<00:03:45.739> basically<00:03:46.190> allows<00:03:46.819> you<00:03:47.000> to<00:03:47.120> go

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
nuclear just basically allows you to go

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.390 
nuclear just basically allows you to go
higher<00:03:47.510> in<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:47.840> air<00:03:47.870> so<00:03:48.349> that's<00:03:48.590> why<00:03:48.829> that's

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
higher in the air so that's why that's

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.699 
higher in the air so that's why that's
basically<00:03:49.609> it<00:03:49.970> though<00:03:50.329> for<00:03:50.690> this<00:03:50.930> video<00:03:51.380> if

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709

you want to go back into this video look
at<00:03:54.139> the<00:03:54.290> steps<00:03:55.510> feel<00:03:56.510> free<00:03:56.690> to<00:03:56.780> do<00:03:57.109> that<00:03:57.139> also

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
at the steps feel free to do that also

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.740 
at the steps feel free to do that also

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
there will be some steps blown the

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.480 
there will be some steps blown the
scription<00:04:01.150> from<00:04:02.150> 12<00:04:02.810> whatever<00:04:03.200> goes<00:04:03.560> to<00:04:03.830> four
