00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.710
 hello friends today I bring you 2 cases of 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.050
 UFOs the first case is about a 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:11.800
 possible fall of a UFO on the lake 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:14.440
 winnipeg in canada where witnesses saw 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.930
 a luminous light in the sky 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.690
 all these commented by networks 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.980
 social issues that further fueled the 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:25.830
 speculation that it could be 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.199
 the rumor became even stronger when 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.330
 the images were published 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.780
 Canadian Forces vehicles are 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.460
 what many would begin to conspire 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.860
 saying that the military were in the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.100
 place to contain the possible device 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.800
 flying and hide the information even 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.980
 other channels on YouTube showed the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.530
 image of what would be the possible ship 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.949
 starry but that was really what 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.170
 it really happened well in the place it 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.399
 I was doing the polar exercise 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.739
 Arctic mink 2015 is why many 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.840
 people saw military in the area and 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.660
 even rows of passing vehicles 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.490
 in place the explanation in the light that 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.619
 they saw the witnesses was a light 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.500
 bright that came from an airplane that 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.320
 took off from the place very quickly already 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.140
 that according to Lieutenant Colonel Paul Davis 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.660
 he said that the soldiers trained for 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.479
 deal with a plane crash and 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.980
 provide search by land and support 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.800
 car rescue 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:32.130
 he also explained that by the distances 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.920
 of the witnesses made them believe that the 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.650
 light shines from his day by heaven said 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.440
 that they were just playing around with 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.130
 our games the other news that they 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.430
 I bring this a UFO captured on the 17th 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.830
 february at the beach debut in england 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.050
 this image showed a flying object 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.380
 triangular shape flying over the 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.150
 coast was so much the stir of the case in 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.970
 the place that the lack of information 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.070
 he made an omni research group 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.920
 I asked the public for help 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.310
 identify that object because in that 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.700
 moment everything was a real mystery 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:14.100
 the flying object had a triangular shape 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.700
 and the theories in that regard pointed to 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.510
 three the first the most fanciful of 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.520
 all that would be an extraterrestrial ship 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.640
 others identify it as a plane not 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.010
 manned a drone and even the most 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.189
 apocalyptic mentions who 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.880
 but ross and lately was approaching 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:37.430
 often to the fruit skies 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.710
 the messages sent by citizens 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.290
 they began to arrive with different 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.840
 opinions that could be some of 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.700
 they have had that on a plane not 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.700
 manned or a fighter plane 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.940
 but all this would have a sharp turn in 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.750
 the investigation when a neighbor 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.569
 online communicated with a local newspaper 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.569
 in guardian comics to explain what 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:06.000
 it happened he says that the UFO of the 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.640
 photography was a radio is radio 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.640
 controlled with a camera of his grandfather 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.970
 in summary the photographs were taken 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.010
 during the flight of the seagull radio 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.830
 controlled aesthetic is against the 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.720
 cliff during the landing so 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.400
 both in the two cases 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.280
 misinterpretation 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.799
 the event plus the excessive thirst of 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.160
 People believe more than they should 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:34.640
 in extraterrestrial beings makes believe that 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.290
 all these supposed events are from the 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.650
 aliens and who are here 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.730
 or does not mean you can not look in the 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.730
 extraterrestrial life 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:53.450
 but if you can question the phenomenon 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.270
 good friends we'll see you soon in others 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.270
 years
