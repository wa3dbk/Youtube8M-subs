speaker<00:00:13.420> system<00:00:13.809> and<00:00:13.930> this<00:00:14.650> is<00:00:15.330> unlike<00:00:16.330> any

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:16.540 
speaker system and this is unlike any

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.450 
speaker system and this is unlike any
other<00:00:16.630> like<00:00:17.080> subwoofer<00:00:17.650> you<00:00:18.070> actually

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:18.460 
other like subwoofer you actually

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.960 
other like subwoofer you actually
connect<00:00:18.939> it<00:00:19.150> with<00:00:19.420> any<00:00:20.050> receiver<00:00:20.910> right<00:00:21.910> here

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
connect it with any receiver right here

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.550 
connect it with any receiver right here
and<00:00:22.539> you'll<00:00:23.440> get<00:00:23.650> this<00:00:23.890> wire<00:00:24.250> kit<00:00:24.670> right<00:00:24.940> here

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
and you'll get this wire kit right here

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.000 
and you'll get this wire kit right here
and<00:00:26.560> you<00:00:26.740> plug<00:00:27.010> it<00:00:27.220> into<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:29.050> output<00:00:29.199> on<00:00:29.650> the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010 
and you plug it into the output on the

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.600 
and you plug it into the output on the
amplifier<00:00:30.310> receiver<00:00:30.820> this<00:00:31.180> is<00:00:31.240> a<00:00:31.359> pioneer<00:00:32.610> and

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
amplifier receiver this is a pioneer and

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.970 
amplifier receiver this is a pioneer and
then<00:00:33.820> it<00:00:34.059> goes<00:00:34.300> to<00:00:35.489> right<00:00:36.489> here<00:00:37.410> no<00:00:38.410> plugs<00:00:38.829> in

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
then it goes to right here no plugs in

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.010 
then it goes to right here no plugs in
right<00:00:39.010> here<00:00:40.079> see<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:42.430> I'll<00:00:42.730> say<00:00:42.940> L<00:00:43.149> if<00:00:43.540> you<00:00:43.809> look

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
right here see so I'll say L if you look

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.590 
right here see so I'll say L if you look
on<00:00:44.170> real<00:00:44.440> closely<00:00:44.710> ill<00:00:45.309> it's<00:00:45.730> all<00:00:45.969> labeled<00:00:46.390> on

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
on real closely ill it's all labeled on

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.069 
on real closely ill it's all labeled on
it<00:00:46.840> and<00:00:47.469> on<00:00:47.680> top<00:00:47.739> of<00:00:47.950> here<00:00:48.340> is<00:00:48.460> there's<00:00:48.790> a<00:00:48.879> L

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
it and on top of here is there's a L

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.110 
it and on top of here is there's a L
well<00:00:50.079> obviously<00:00:50.170> that's<00:00:50.530> the<00:00:50.739> left<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:52.030> you

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
well obviously that's the left so you

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.930 
well obviously that's the left so you
plug<00:00:52.300> it<00:00:52.450> in<00:00:52.539> right<00:00:52.570> there<00:00:52.930> and<00:00:53.730> then<00:00:54.730> the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
plug it in right there and then the

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.290 
plug it in right there and then the
center<00:00:55.300> there's<00:00:55.899> a<00:00:55.989> C<00:00:56.200> for<00:00:56.230> a<00:00:56.500> center<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.940> can

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
center there's a C for a center you can

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.420 
center there's a C for a center you can
see<00:00:58.360> that<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.829> then<00:01:00.430> R<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:03.160> is<00:01:03.280> all

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
see that and then R and this is all

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.160 
see that and then R and this is all
coming<00:01:03.670> from<00:01:03.820> the<00:01:03.969> amplifier<00:01:04.390> output<00:01:04.869> of<00:01:04.989> the

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
coming from the amplifier output of the

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:13.580 
coming from the amplifier output of the
amplifier<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:08.369> then<00:01:09.369> this<00:01:09.580> round<00:01:09.880> left<00:01:10.119> and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.990 

surround<00:01:14.590> right<00:01:14.799> so<00:01:15.280> these<00:01:15.460> are<00:01:15.520> the<00:01:15.700> back

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
surround right so these are the back

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.310 
surround right so these are the back
speakers<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:18.400> if<00:01:18.490> you're<00:01:18.580> facing<00:01:18.760> the<00:01:18.970> TV

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
speakers so if you're facing the TV

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.590 
speakers so if you're facing the TV
that's<00:01:20.320> a<00:01:20.590> left<00:01:21.070> back<00:01:21.520> speaker<00:01:21.939> that's<00:01:22.450> the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
that's a left back speaker that's the

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.580 
that's a left back speaker that's the
right<00:01:22.810> back<00:01:23.170> speaker<00:01:24.119> okay<00:01:25.119> and<00:01:25.390> then<00:01:26.259> these

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
right back speaker okay and then these

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.910 
right back speaker okay and then these
right<00:01:27.220> here<00:01:28.049> these<00:01:29.049> go<00:01:29.439> to<00:01:29.500> the<00:01:30.369> speaker's<00:01:31.920> you

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
right here these go to the speaker's you

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.649 
right here these go to the speaker's you
see<00:01:33.100> there<00:01:33.340> so<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:33.970> R<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:35.409> all<00:01:35.619> labeled<00:01:36.659> make

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
see there so the R is all labeled make

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.420 
see there so the R is all labeled make
sure<00:01:37.840> these<00:01:38.049> are<00:01:38.229> going<00:01:38.380> straight<00:01:38.860> to<00:01:39.009> the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
sure these are going straight to the

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.910 
sure these are going straight to the
speakers<00:01:39.880> and<00:01:42.090> then<00:01:43.090> this<00:01:43.450> one<00:01:43.780> plugs<00:01:44.680> into

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
speakers and then this one plugs into

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.760 
speakers and then this one plugs into
the<00:01:45.159> sea

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.940 

and<00:01:48.610> then<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.890> one<00:01:51.159> plugs<00:01:51.490> in<00:01:51.790> to<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.770> back

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
and then this one plugs in to the back

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.100 
and then this one plugs in to the back
left<00:01:54.280> and<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:56.500> is<00:01:56.799> the<00:01:56.979> back<00:01:57.189> right<00:01:58.110> they

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
left and this is the back right they

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.100 
left and this is the back right they
labeled<00:01:59.670> even<00:02:00.670> if<00:02:00.759> it's<00:02:00.909> not<00:02:01.090> labeled<00:02:01.360> you

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
labeled even if it's not labeled you

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.389 
labeled even if it's not labeled you
just<00:02:02.320> trace<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.590> wire<00:02:02.890> down<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:05.530> then<00:02:06.220> the

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
just trace the wire down and then the

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.550 
just trace the wire down and then the
left<00:02:06.640> speaker<00:02:06.880> bottom<00:02:07.659> row<00:02:07.899> that<00:02:08.289> you<00:02:08.380> see

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
left speaker bottom row that you see

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.070 
left speaker bottom row that you see
right<00:02:08.739> there<00:02:08.769> that<00:02:09.220> gets<00:02:09.819> plugged<00:02:10.149> into<00:02:10.569> the

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
right there that gets plugged into the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.400 
right there that gets plugged into the
output<00:02:11.260> of<00:02:11.530> any<00:02:11.860> amplifier<00:02:13.050> right<00:02:14.050> here<00:02:14.230> and

it's<00:02:14.530> all<00:02:14.620> labeled<00:02:15.069> if<00:02:15.190> you<00:02:15.310> look<00:02:15.489> at<00:02:15.640> it<00:02:15.790> it

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
it's all labeled if you look at it it

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.640 
it's all labeled if you look at it it
says<00:02:16.090> left<00:02:16.540> surround<00:02:17.310> well<00:02:18.310> left<00:02:18.790> surround

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
says left surround well left surround

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.320 
says left surround well left surround
left<00:02:20.650> surround<00:02:21.130> it's<00:02:21.430> labeled<00:02:21.970> right<00:02:22.120> here

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
left surround it's labeled right here

left surround and plug it in right here

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.360 
left surround and plug it in right here
that's<00:02:25.840> pretty<00:02:25.959> much<00:02:26.140> it<00:02:26.380> so<00:02:26.590> once<00:02:27.160> you<00:02:27.250> have

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
that's pretty much it so once you have

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.710 
that's pretty much it so once you have
this<00:02:27.489> done<00:02:27.760> you<00:02:28.030> can<00:02:28.150> just<00:02:28.330> turn<00:02:28.450> on<00:02:28.600> the

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
this done you can just turn on the

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.309 
this done you can just turn on the
amplifier<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:29.230> work<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:29.739> the<00:02:30.400> Bose<00:02:30.819> work<00:02:31.319> so

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
amplifier to work and the Bose work so

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.470 
amplifier to work and the Bose work so
you<00:02:32.950> just<00:02:33.160> follow<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.430> labels<00:02:33.880> right<00:02:34.180> here

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
you just follow the labels right here

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:43.470 
you just follow the labels right here
right<00:02:35.260> surround<00:02:36.930> up<00:02:37.930> dad<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:41.709> that<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:43.360> this

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
that tech-savvy just plug it into here

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.770 
that tech-savvy just plug it into here
the<00:04:44.390> TV<00:04:44.780> optical<00:04:45.680> audio<00:04:45.919> out<00:04:46.310> into<00:04:46.970> here<00:04:47.210> and

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.580 
the TV optical audio out into here and
then<00:04:48.200> it<00:04:48.830> should<00:04:48.979> work<00:04:49.040> fine<00:04:50.290> it<00:04:51.290> should

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
then it should work fine it should

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.590 
then it should work fine it should
pretty<00:04:51.979> much<00:04:52.070> unsquare<00:04:52.970> ahead<00:04:53.240> and<00:04:53.330> test<00:04:53.479> it

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
pretty much unsquare ahead and test it

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.750 
pretty much unsquare ahead and test it
now
