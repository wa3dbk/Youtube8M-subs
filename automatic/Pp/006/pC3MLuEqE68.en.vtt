00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.260

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.220
 to exotix because this server married 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.100
 really from home the roundup of 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.229

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.509

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.459
 you read sandy jets if it 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.450
 would interest you or not for good 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:17.019
 to live again to have masks the 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.670
 factions on on a locker simply 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.620

 French look like you want it 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.380
 I would not necessarily arrange because that 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.980
