00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
as you can see here as I do that you get

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.290 
as you can see here as I do that you get
the<00:04:07.760> slight<00:04:08.920> differentiating<00:04:09.920> color<00:04:10.160> on<00:04:10.460> the

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
the slight differentiating color on the

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.180 
the slight differentiating color on the
edges<00:04:13.960> which<00:04:14.960> will<00:04:15.140> actually<00:04:15.230> highlight<00:04:15.890> the

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
edges which will actually highlight the

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:23.800 
edges which will actually highlight the
actual<00:04:16.840> piece<00:04:17.840> itself<00:04:19.750> sometimes<00:04:22.540> the<00:04:23.540> paint

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
actual piece itself sometimes the paint

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.940 
actual piece itself sometimes the paint
needs<00:04:23.960> a<00:04:24.110> bit<00:04:24.290> more<00:04:24.320> stirring<00:04:26.590> so<00:04:27.590> I<00:04:27.620> think<00:04:27.770> I'm

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
needs a bit more stirring so I think I'm

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.460 
needs a bit more stirring so I think I'm
going<00:04:28.070> to<00:04:28.160> paint<00:04:28.580> on<00:04:28.730> that<00:04:28.880> this<00:04:29.000> time<00:04:32.470> little

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
going to paint on that this time little

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.130 
going to paint on that this time little

and<00:04:38.680> just<00:04:39.190> pay<00:04:39.460> as<00:04:40.180> much<00:04:40.390> off<00:04:40.600> as<00:04:40.780> you<00:04:40.870> can<00:04:40.900> onto

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320

and just pay as much off as you can onto
paper<00:04:41.890> tail<00:04:43.050> and

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:54.399 

take<00:04:47.820> kit

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:54.409 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:57.639 

just<00:04:55.009> with<00:04:55.159> a<00:04:55.189> little<00:04:55.639> bit<00:04:55.909> of<00:04:56.059> force<00:04:56.649> just

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:57.649 
just with a little bit of force just

00:04:57.649 --> 00:05:04.290 
just with a little bit of force just
around<00:04:58.449> the<00:04:59.449> edges

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.900 

just<00:05:05.300> paint<00:05:05.650> try<00:05:06.650> a<00:05:06.680> brush<00:05:06.980> with<00:05:07.220> football<00:05:07.670> so

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
just paint try a brush with football so

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.520 
just paint try a brush with football so
I'll<00:05:08.000> call<00:05:08.210> dry<00:05:08.480> brushing<00:05:08.870> just<00:05:09.080> dry<00:05:09.290> brush

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
I'll call dry brushing just dry brush

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.420 
I'll call dry brushing just dry brush
around<00:05:09.680> the<00:05:09.890> edges<00:05:10.310> and<00:05:12.010> you'll<00:05:13.010> see<00:05:13.220> there's

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
around the edges and you'll see there's

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.360 
around the edges and you'll see there's
a<00:05:13.490> difference<00:05:13.960> between<00:05:14.960> where<00:05:15.860> the<00:05:15.980> brush<00:05:16.190> is

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
a difference between where the brush is

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.990 
a difference between where the brush is
actually<00:05:16.490> been<00:05:16.820> painting<00:05:17.300> and<00:05:17.510> the<00:05:18.110> key<00:05:18.290> below

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.320 

we<00:05:23.000> do<00:05:23.180> it<00:05:23.300> on<00:05:23.390> actual<00:05:23.720> hand<00:05:25.120> that's<00:05:26.120> it's

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
we do it on actual hand that's it's

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:35.170 
we do it on actual hand that's it's
black<00:05:26.660> my<00:05:27.020> shop<00:05:27.290> a<00:05:27.320> bit<00:05:27.440> better

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:43.550 

yeah

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:50.219 

yeah<00:05:45.419> simple<00:05:46.419> as<00:05:46.539> that<00:05:46.689> now

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.040 

do<00:05:50.770> this<00:05:50.919> all<00:05:51.129> over<00:05:51.159> the<00:05:51.550> kit<00:05:51.789> and<00:05:52.029> we<00:05:52.900> look

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
do this all over the kit and we look

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.439 
do this all over the kit and we look
well<00:05:53.289> weathered<00:05:53.650> well<00:05:53.889> one<00:05:54.189> lakh<00:05:55.090> it's<00:05:55.300> been

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449 
well weathered well one lakh it's been

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:57.029 
well weathered well one lakh it's been
in<00:05:55.629> use<00:05:55.779> for<00:05:55.840> a<00:05:56.080> bit<00:05:56.229> and<00:05:56.409> the<00:05:56.680> paint's

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039 
in use for a bit and the paint's

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:00.510 
in use for a bit and the paint's
starting<00:05:57.460> to<00:05:57.669> come<00:05:58.569> off<00:05:59.069> around<00:06:00.069> the<00:06:00.219> edges

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
starting to come off around the edges

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.689 
starting to come off around the edges
and<00:06:00.610> stuff<00:06:01.080> and<00:06:02.080> what<00:06:02.620> you<00:06:02.770> do<00:06:02.919> after<00:06:03.400> doing

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:03.699 
and stuff and what you do after doing

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:07.679 
and stuff and what you do after doing
this<00:06:03.849> would<00:06:04.180> be<00:06:04.389> a<00:06:04.419> ploy<00:06:04.840> of<00:06:05.050> wash<00:06:06.419> to<00:06:07.419> all<00:06:07.569> the

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:07.689 
this would be a ploy of wash to all the

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:09.360 
this would be a ploy of wash to all the
panel<00:06:07.990> lines<00:06:08.169> and<00:06:08.499> stuff<00:06:08.680> to<00:06:09.009> add<00:06:09.129> more

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
panel lines and stuff to add more

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.820 
panel lines and stuff to add more
weathering<00:06:09.849> and<00:06:10.050> then<00:06:11.050> perhaps<00:06:11.229> add<00:06:11.620> some

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
weathering and then perhaps add some

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:17.429 
weathering and then perhaps add some
paint<00:06:12.129> chips<00:06:12.249> as<00:06:12.669> well<00:06:15.270> once<00:06:16.270> once<00:06:17.139> all<00:06:17.349> the

00:06:17.429 --> 00:06:17.439 
paint chips as well once once all the

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:19.110 
paint chips as well once once all the
weathering<00:06:17.770> is<00:06:17.830> done<00:06:18.009> just<00:06:18.460> to<00:06:18.639> clear<00:06:18.879> coat

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 
weathering is done just to clear coat

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.209 
weathering is done just to clear coat
again<00:06:19.240> and<00:06:20.759> finish<00:06:21.759> off<00:06:21.909> with<00:06:21.939> your<00:06:22.180> top<00:06:22.330> coat

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:23.219 
again and finish off with your top coat

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:34.810 
again and finish off with your top coat
until<00:06:24.219> next<00:06:24.460> time
