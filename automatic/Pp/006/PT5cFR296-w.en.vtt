the<00:00:24.429> pancreas<00:00:24.880> transplant<00:00:25.329> operation<00:00:25.869> is

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:26.019 
the pancreas transplant operation is

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.819 
the pancreas transplant operation is
done<00:00:26.829> through<00:00:27.279> an<00:00:28.210> abdominal<00:00:28.829> midline

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:29.829 
done through an abdominal midline

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.859 
done through an abdominal midline
incision<00:00:30.069> and<00:00:30.640> that<00:00:31.029> is<00:00:31.179> an<00:00:31.300> up<00:00:31.599> and<00:00:31.749> down

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
incision and that is an up and down

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.130 
incision and that is an up and down
incision<00:00:32.619> on<00:00:32.829> the<00:00:33.190> abdomen<00:00:33.519> we<00:00:34.420> connect<00:00:34.809> the

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
incision on the abdomen we connect the

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.189 
incision on the abdomen we connect the
artery<00:00:35.620> and<00:00:35.800> the<00:00:35.920> vein<00:00:36.070> that<00:00:36.640> both<00:00:37.300> supply<00:00:38.140> the

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 
artery and the vein that both supply the

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:40.319 
artery and the vein that both supply the
blood<00:00:38.590> to<00:00:38.739> the<00:00:38.859> pancreas<00:00:39.100> and<00:00:39.550> return<00:00:40.120> the

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
blood to the pancreas and return the

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.259 
blood to the pancreas and return the
blood<00:00:40.510> back<00:00:40.719> to<00:00:40.750> the<00:00:40.929> body<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:42.280> then<00:00:42.579> once<00:00:42.940> we

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:43.269 
blood back to the body and then once we

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:45.360 
blood back to the body and then once we
allow<00:00:43.960> the<00:00:44.019> blood<00:00:44.289> flow<00:00:44.530> into<00:00:44.710> the<00:00:44.890> pancreas

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
allow the blood flow into the pancreas

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.849 
allow the blood flow into the pancreas
we<00:00:45.850> have<00:00:46.059> to<00:00:46.269> connect<00:00:46.690> a<00:00:46.929> small<00:00:47.379> piece<00:00:47.829> of

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:47.859 
we have to connect a small piece of

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:49.950 
we have to connect a small piece of
intestine<00:00:48.640> that<00:00:48.760> comes<00:00:49.030> with<00:00:49.329> the<00:00:49.570> pancreas

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
intestine that comes with the pancreas

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.759 
intestine that comes with the pancreas
organ<00:00:50.949> to<00:00:51.640> the<00:00:52.079> patient's<00:00:53.079> intestine<00:00:53.589> to

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
organ to the patient's intestine to

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.079 
organ to the patient's intestine to
allow<00:00:54.719> drainage<00:00:55.719> of<00:00:55.929> the<00:00:56.829> exocrine<00:00:57.429> material

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
allow drainage of the exocrine material

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.139 
allow drainage of the exocrine material
into<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:58.899> patient's<00:00:59.320> body<00:01:00.149> previously

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
into the patient's body previously

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.899 
into the patient's body previously
people<00:01:01.749> would<00:01:02.140> connect<00:01:02.920> that<00:01:03.129> to<00:01:03.429> the<00:01:03.579> bladder

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
people would connect that to the bladder

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:05.880 
people would connect that to the bladder
but<00:01:04.570> we<00:01:04.720> really<00:01:04.960> don't<00:01:05.080> do<00:01:05.350> that<00:01:05.530> procedure

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
but we really don't do that procedure

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.070 
but we really don't do that procedure
anymore<00:01:06.460> because<00:01:06.730> the<00:01:07.120> patient's<00:01:07.540> tolerate

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
anymore because the patient's tolerate

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.960 
anymore because the patient's tolerate
it<00:01:08.350> being<00:01:08.620> connected<00:01:09.130> to<00:01:09.250> the<00:01:09.370> intestines

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
it being connected to the intestines

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.890 
it being connected to the intestines
much<00:01:10.330> better<00:01:10.660> it's<00:01:11.650> not<00:01:11.800> associated<00:01:12.460> with

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
much better it's not associated with

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.230 
much better it's not associated with
long<00:01:13.900> term<00:01:14.170> complications<00:01:14.670> like<00:01:15.670> connecting

we place the kidney and the pancreas in

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.780 
we place the kidney and the pancreas in
almost<00:01:35.260> like<00:01:35.380> two<00:01:35.710> different<00:01:35.890> operations<00:01:36.670> in

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
almost like two different operations in

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.120 
almost like two different operations in
the<00:01:36.880> abdomen<00:01:37.410> typically<00:01:38.410> we'll<00:01:38.770> put<00:01:38.980> the

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
the abdomen typically we'll put the

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.640 
the abdomen typically we'll put the
kidney<00:01:39.580> in<00:01:39.700> first<00:01:40.120> allow<00:01:40.960> the<00:01:41.020> blood<00:01:41.380> flow

back<00:01:41.830> into<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.340> kidney<00:01:42.700> and<00:01:42.880> let<00:01:43.360> it<00:01:43.480> start

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
back into the kidney and let it start

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.500 
back into the kidney and let it start
working<00:01:44.200> and<00:01:44.350> then<00:01:45.100> in<00:01:45.520> a<00:01:45.730> separate<00:01:46.330> location

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
working and then in a separate location

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.290 
working and then in a separate location
but<00:01:47.440> through<00:01:47.710> the<00:01:47.860> same<00:01:48.100> incision<00:01:48.310> put<00:01:49.180> the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
but through the same incision put the

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.450 
but through the same incision put the
pancreas<00:01:49.810> in<00:01:50.020> so<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.680> patient<00:01:51.040> wakes<00:01:51.190> up

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
pancreas in so the patient wakes up

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.240 
pancreas in so the patient wakes up
having<00:01:52.180> had<00:01:52.390> two<00:01:53.170> operations<00:01:53.860> done<00:01:54.040> on<00:01:54.130> the

problems<00:04:59.640> related<00:05:00.120> to<00:05:00.150> rejection<00:05:00.980> it's<00:05:01.980> hard

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
problems related to rejection it's hard

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.310 
problems related to rejection it's hard
to<00:05:02.700> track<00:05:03.120> rejection<00:05:03.750> of<00:05:03.810> the<00:05:03.870> pancreas

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
to track rejection of the pancreas

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.990 
to track rejection of the pancreas
whereas<00:05:04.740> it's<00:05:04.890> easy<00:05:05.220> to<00:05:05.340> track<00:05:05.580> rejection<00:05:05.880> of

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
whereas it's easy to track rejection of

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.030 
whereas it's easy to track rejection of
the<00:05:06.090> kidney<00:05:06.390> so<00:05:06.930> if<00:05:07.020> you<00:05:07.110> have<00:05:07.290> both<00:05:07.470> organs

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
the kidney so if you have both organs

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.010 
the kidney so if you have both organs
and<00:05:08.250> you<00:05:08.760> can<00:05:08.940> follow<00:05:09.180> the<00:05:09.390> kidney<00:05:09.750> quite

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
and you can follow the kidney quite

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.620 
and you can follow the kidney quite
easily<00:05:10.500> and<00:05:11.010> know<00:05:11.670> that<00:05:11.880> there's<00:05:12.060> trouble<00:05:12.450> and

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
easily and know that there's trouble and

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.240 
easily and know that there's trouble and
increase<00:05:13.410> the<00:05:13.500> amount<00:05:13.710> of<00:05:13.740> suppression<00:05:14.040> if

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
increase the amount of suppression if

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.070 
increase the amount of suppression if
there's<00:05:14.400> rejection<00:05:14.790> and<00:05:15.030> treat<00:05:15.240> both<00:05:15.450> in<00:05:15.750> both

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
there's rejection and treat both in both

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.990 
there's rejection and treat both in both
organs<00:05:16.470> it<00:05:16.950> tends<00:05:17.280> to<00:05:17.430> correlate<00:05:17.640> so<00:05:17.940> if

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
organs it tends to correlate so if

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.370 
organs it tends to correlate so if
you're<00:05:18.120> having<00:05:18.270> rejection<00:05:18.990> the<00:05:19.080> kidney

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
you're having rejection the kidney

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.020 
you're having rejection the kidney
you're<00:05:19.860> typically<00:05:20.280> having<00:05:20.520> rejection<00:05:20.910> of<00:05:20.970> the

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
you're typically having rejection of the

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.620 
you're typically having rejection of the
pancreas<00:05:21.450> and<00:05:21.630> that's<00:05:22.320> at<00:05:22.530> least<00:05:22.560> an<00:05:23.040> 80%

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
pancreas and that's at least an 80%

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:29.340 
pancreas and that's at least an 80%
correlation<00:05:24.630> for<00:05:24.930> those<00:05:25.110> two

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.840 

so<00:05:30.350> initially<00:05:30.710> after<00:05:31.010> the<00:05:31.160> operation<00:05:31.610> is<00:05:31.700> done

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
so initially after the operation is done

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.970 
so initially after the operation is done
patients<00:05:32.360> spend<00:05:32.540> at<00:05:33.050> least<00:05:33.320> a<00:05:33.530> week<00:05:33.710> in<00:05:33.830> the

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
patients spend at least a week in the

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.890 
patients spend at least a week in the
hospital<00:05:34.490> and<00:05:34.610> often<00:05:34.970> a<00:05:35.060> couple<00:05:35.270> of<00:05:35.510> weeks<00:05:35.690> in

the hospital once someone goes home they

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.620 
the hospital once someone goes home they
are<00:05:39.740> getting<00:05:40.010> labs<00:05:40.430> drawn<00:05:40.880> twice<00:05:41.270> a<00:05:41.300> week

other week and then monthly so long-term

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.310 
other week and then monthly so long-term
follow-up<00:06:13.790> which<00:06:14.060> I<00:06:14.180> would<00:06:14.300> say<00:06:14.480> is<00:06:14.510> after<00:06:15.140> the

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
follow-up which I would say is after the
