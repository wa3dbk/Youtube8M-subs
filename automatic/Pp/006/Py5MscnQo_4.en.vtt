00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:08.820
 but speaking to the dragon of business yes without 

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:11.250
 heights the situation is clearly just hello everyone 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.430
 with you sky dock crazy but damn 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.110
 charming guide the world of video game features 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.980
 work + study 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:23.070
 yes even this cold is unreal necessary 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.770
 eight hours of sleep a day another 10 nights 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.080
 for your sake i am preparing the next issue bye 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.880
 a mixture of insanity grease hid please 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.890
 goals of interesting thoughts are in 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.960
 the cooking process I decided to treat you 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.149
 we all had a little teaser 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.980
 think about how ours would look 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.200
 favorite games if they were transferred to 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.579
 Another engine is perhaps skyrim 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.110
 better suited for visual 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.899
 demonstrations why 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.260
 judge for yourself a bunch of fans on one side 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.050
 a bunch of haters on the other and we're in the middle 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.210
 the wagon is not that picture 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.100
 so here's skyrim is a role-playing game with 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.329
 big open world which is filled 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.969
 beautiful scenery 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.829
 awesome npc monsters diligently 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.140
 depicting lifeless mannequins 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.729
 the game is in its own way beautiful but having spent in not 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.280
 some time technical flaws 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.690
 begin to catch your eye there 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.430
 lots of fan mods that 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.759
 try to improve the visual quality 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.950
 games 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.840
 however it is interesting to dream how she would 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.970
 looked at the two most famous and 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.300
 popular engines at the moment edge 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.340
 endzhin 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.210
 from the company the edge and found the engine about 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.750
 epic games as this shows 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.369
 video 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.490
 when all possibilities are involved 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.690
 cryengine engine is impressive 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.250
 developed by Zion and kraytek company 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.440
 the engine baffled its time 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.820
 the most powerful home computers he has 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.410
 really provided for herself 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.479
 realistic graphics on the market but 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.479
 system requirements were den what 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.540
 submit 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.540
 my 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.510
 ny 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.330
 12 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.580
 platoon from not fit no to a whole 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:30.780
 audio team 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:37.430
 here it is here it is the fish of my dream 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:48.600
 she here she she I guys I'm hefty 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:50.070
 a hefty 3 is the first walk from 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.230
 edge so originally oriented 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.920
 gaming consoles xbox 360 and playstation 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.230
 3 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.940
 and not only on until it came intended 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.950
 to create three-dimensional locations any 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.470
 magnitude but especially well they manage 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.210
 large open spaces here for you 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.709
 not advanced physics which allows 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.990
 interact on any arbitrarily 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.000
 surrounding object or form is present 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.350
 selective destruction of tree structures 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.060
 and other objects on the map 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.160
 as well as its own animation system 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.390
 characters and even limbs of various 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.460
 creatures 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.720
 imagine what could have happened if 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.490
 would when creating focused on 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.460
 console and did skyrim on cryengine 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:27.450
 3 You are in it all the juice to help 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:29.250
 oh dream no harm she tasty i'm 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.500
 reserve another video but already on the engine 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.610
 unreal engine 3 card maker with 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.890
 hard-to-pronounce nickname miss emma 3d on 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.810
 During 6 months of doing amazing 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.580
 elaboration map of one of the bays 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.890
 sweden using all possibilities for 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.750
 children in front of you typical fishing 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.460
 Midgard village located next to 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.740
 one of the sweden lakes and not much 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.810
 all that has changed since the time of the Vikings 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.940
 beauty created using unreal engine 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.470
 3 let me remind you that it was designed taking into account 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.660
 personal computers and consoles 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.010
 current generation updated 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.510
 graphics engine supports 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.660
 most modern technologies 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.740
 including hdr dynamic shadows 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.890
 geometric shaders and many others 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.240
 scary words yes in such a measure even I 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.080
 would not refuse to live and win 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.360
 dragons 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.280
 speaking of dragons with them the hopeless 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.290
 there are no situations even if you 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.830
 swallowed dragon there are always two ways out 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.900
 so really epic games know me 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.850
 Anilil engine has been developed 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.560
 several dozen if not hundreds of games 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.020
 found popularity among players with 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.700
 of the whole world by the way it's worth mentioning that 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.530
 each angel angel license includes 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.570
 rights to public distribution andrea 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.860
 engine tools that allow developers 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.270
 distribute along with the game 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.820
 own tools to create 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.650
 content mod support created 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.870
 fans is an important success factor 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.880
 many for pisi and the creator Andrei Land 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.650
 same 3 understand this they believe that 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.330
 support letter can also play 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.370
 important role for future console type 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.930
 of see how they stay 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.470
 true to my words next version 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.720
 engine 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.640
 looks pretty but now with this 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.900
 surprise no one and it is not clear that 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.240
 new can offer 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.250
 the next version is angel anjo but that 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.080
 there is no nakutyli and Beijing players from all over 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.640
 the world will eagerly lick each 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.680
 a bit of new information and complaints 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.810
 write require supplements like a flock 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.030
 hungry kittens what's on it perhaps 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.840
 all this is just a little teaser for the next 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.940
 release 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.200
 which we cover a lot of games on 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.930
 a variety of engines 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:23.270
 but for now we are watching and comparing kids on 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.270
 what engine would skyrim play for now
