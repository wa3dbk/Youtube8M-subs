 the forces were later out 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.279

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.260
 These shots of a security camera 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.669
 in a building near show how 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.860
 a man from the shockwave and 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.840
 glass doors is overturned the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.910
 explosions were allegedly due 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.660
 explosive materials in a warehouse 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.660
 triggered 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.969
 The local hospitals are with the 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.410
 many patients are overwhelmed by that 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:05.049
 explosion still in several kilometers 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.580
 Removal of windows destroys the 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.259
 people stand in line for the 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.390
 donate wounded blood 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:13.500
 Witnesses say nobody has a tragedy 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.119
 can predict this extent 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.369
 i worked at the safety cabin 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.720
 when the explosion stopped, I stopped 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.759
 but I was immediately 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.790
 hurt the cabin was completely 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.790
 destroyed 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.000
 Report a yellow substance 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.250
 after the explosions in the air 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.640
 she was afraid she might be toxic 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.190

 Pedro Rodrigues percent of the audi video

 agency rugby is for us in china 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.610
 I am now in high district in Tianjin 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.479
 only a few kilometers from the explosion 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.759
 away 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.560
 the situation can be like the residents 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.270
 with whom I spoke the best 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.270
 Describe complete disaster 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.899
 there is still smoke in the sky, the 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.060
 Containers in the dock were complete 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.290
 destroyed and overturned at all cars 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.890
 in the area were the slices 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.930
 destroyed 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.119
 the buildings of a nearby factory 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.750
 have collapsed the situation is here 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.750
 really bad 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.150
 we talked to brand expert john 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.750
 williams he says such situations are 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.489
 a nightmare for rescue teams 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.019
 if you see this art explosion then 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.760
 one wonders how many injured and 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.739
 possible dead it through the shockwave 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.420
 I envy the firefighters 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.739
 not only not such places 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.810
 there is the risk of another 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.940
 explosion if you do not know what the 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.890
 whoever caused the first one there 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:38.019
 Saying that would be the first thing 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:39.459
 i would think that chemicals then 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.930
 you must wear appropriate suits 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.480
 because the skin can be chemicals 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.500
 absorb the potential for something like that 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.500
 is really scary 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.000
 there are all sorts of things one 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.329
 Never can cause such inflammation 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.350
 you're 100 to sure though 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.880
 Security systems minimize the risk 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.829
 and make sure that the 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.829
 probability to a minimum field
