00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
that it will not go down that path so

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.309 
that it will not go down that path so
here's<00:01:49.670> a<00:01:49.819> graph<00:01:50.300> to<00:01:50.630> show<00:01:50.660> you<00:01:50.929> how<00:01:51.289> much

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.240 
gained 25 pounds in first year so that
will<00:02:17.630> be<00:02:17.840> over<00:02:18.080> here<00:02:19.010> somewhere<00:02:19.069> and<00:02:21.250> the

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
will be over here somewhere and the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.730 
will be over here somewhere and the
second<00:02:22.670> year<00:02:22.819> you<00:02:23.120> will<00:02:23.330> gain<00:02:23.690> only<00:02:24.020> 50<00:02:24.620> pounds

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
second year you will gain only 50 pounds

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.010 
second year you will gain only 50 pounds
so<00:02:27.740> those<00:02:28.010> first<00:02:28.340> two<00:02:28.880> years<00:02:29.180> were<00:02:29.599> pretty

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
so those first two years were pretty

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.140 
so those first two years were pretty
good<00:02:30.319> and<00:02:31.870> after<00:02:32.870> those<00:02:33.080> two<00:02:33.650> years<00:02:34.040> you<00:02:34.940> will

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
good and after those two years you will

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.940 
good and after those two years you will
notice<00:02:35.420> that<00:02:35.599> you<00:02:35.810> won't<00:02:36.230> gain<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:36.560> lot<00:02:36.800> of

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
notice that you won't gain a lot of

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.280 
notice that you won't gain a lot of
muscle<00:02:37.370> anymore<00:02:37.790> so<00:02:38.420> then<00:02:38.840> you<00:02:38.990> will<00:02:39.110> get

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
muscle anymore so then you will get

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:46.130 
muscle anymore so then you will get
something<00:02:39.590> like<00:02:39.860> this<00:02:40.310> or<00:02:40.640> this<00:02:41.239> or<00:02:41.300> this<00:02:43.150> so

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
something like this or this or this so

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:57.500 
something like this or this or this so
don't<00:02:47.140> expect<00:02:47.710> to<00:02:48.330> gain<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.540> same<00:02:49.840> amount<00:02:50.080> off

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.589 

so<00:02:58.080> with<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.530> have<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:59.010> say<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.420> you<00:03:00.420> have

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
so with that I have to say that you have

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.170 
so with that I have to say that you have
to<00:03:00.810> be<00:03:00.959> lucky<00:03:01.409> with<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.739> kind<00:03:01.980> of<00:03:02.159> bill<00:03:02.849> that

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
to be lucky with the kind of bill that

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.270 
to be lucky with the kind of bill that
your<00:03:03.360> body<00:03:03.569> had<00:03:03.870> because<00:03:04.379> some<00:03:04.709> people<00:03:05.099> can

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
your body had because some people can

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.660 
your body had because some people can
gain<00:03:05.519> reasoning<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.349> others<00:03:07.349> will<00:03:07.739> have<00:03:08.459> to

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
gain reasoning and others will have to

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.899 
gain reasoning and others will have to
take<00:03:08.849> a<00:03:08.909> long<00:03:09.239> time<00:03:09.269> for<00:03:09.599> it<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:10.280> there's<00:03:11.280> 25

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
take a long time for it and there's 25

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.830 
take a long time for it and there's 25
pounds<00:03:12.540> can<00:03:12.900> only<00:03:13.079> be<00:03:13.379> achieved<00:03:13.530> by<00:03:14.720> having<00:03:15.720> a

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
pounds can only be achieved by having a

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.800 
pounds can only be achieved by having a
very<00:03:16.079> good<00:03:16.200> workout<00:03:16.890> routine<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:17.810> also

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
very good workout routine and also

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.890 
very good workout routine and also
keeping<00:03:19.680> keeping<00:03:20.340> yourself<00:03:20.940> in<00:03:21.209> strict<00:03:21.659> diet

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
keeping keeping yourself in strict diet

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.280 
keeping keeping yourself in strict diet
and<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.890> chance<00:03:23.220> that<00:03:23.489> you<00:03:23.760> are<00:03:24.290> gaining

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
and the chance that you are gaining

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.069 
and the chance that you are gaining
muscle<00:03:25.890> only<00:03:26.340> is<00:03:26.459> also<00:03:26.819> pretty<00:03:27.090> slim<00:03:27.569> because

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
muscle only is also pretty slim because

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.710 
muscle only is also pretty slim because
the<00:03:29.040> chance<00:03:29.340> that<00:03:29.549> you<00:03:29.700> gain<00:03:29.940> self<00:03:30.269> bad<00:03:30.540> as

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
the chance that you gain self bad as

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.080 
the chance that you gain self bad as
well<00:03:31.019> is<00:03:31.260> pretty<00:03:31.680> big<00:03:31.950> if<00:03:32.340> you're<00:03:32.640> trying<00:03:32.940> to

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
well is pretty big if you're trying to

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.690 
well is pretty big if you're trying to
gain<00:03:33.359> weight<00:03:33.390> since<00:03:33.959> you're<00:03:34.310> eating<00:03:35.310> more

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
understand now that is a very hard to

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.309 
understand now that is a very hard to
gain<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.459> lot<00:03:41.670> of<00:03:41.849> muscle<00:03:42.299> and<00:03:42.420> short<00:03:42.900> amount<00:03:43.200> of

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
have to have a lot of patience to

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.420 
have to have a lot of patience to
achieve<00:03:49.349> the<00:03:49.500> goals<00:03:49.739> that<00:03:49.859> you<00:03:50.099> want<00:03:50.129> to

achieve the goals that you want to

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.270 
achieve the goals that you want to
achieve<00:03:50.959> but<00:03:51.959> keep<00:03:52.290> in<00:03:52.409> mind<00:03:52.470> that<00:03:52.799> if<00:03:53.220> you

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
achieve but keep in mind that if you

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.610 
achieve but keep in mind that if you
must<00:03:53.639> start<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.150> work<00:03:54.329> out<00:03:54.599> the<00:03:55.139> chance<00:03:55.470> of

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
must start to work out the chance of

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.259 
must start to work out the chance of
getting<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.220> goals<00:03:56.489> that<00:03:56.639> you<00:03:56.940> want<00:03:56.970> to

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
achieve our pretty far away so it's

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.930 
achieve our pretty far away so it's
better<00:04:01.109> to<00:04:01.349> start<00:04:01.680> now<00:04:01.949> than<00:04:02.280> to<00:04:02.549> wait<00:04:02.790> a<00:04:02.819> year

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
better to start now than to wait a year

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.559
