00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.139
 derby time in the kasseler eissporthalle 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.250
 the kassel huskies are happy with theirs 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.420
 fans on the lions from frankfurt and for 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.039
 the huskies money now 60 again 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.830
 minutes full throttle and then one is 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.779
 spectacular a vga 2014 to the end and 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.449
 We'll look at each other for three points 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.710
 today on one as if you have one 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.710
 Derby lose very annoying 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.320
 Unfortunately and in the end , the force 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.320
 then the topic is missing 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.079
 it distinguishes us where they are 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.820
 Then hang up on it 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.820
 continue working and then it goes on 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.120
 you noticed captain 225 at the end you yourself 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.530
 a little bit weaker with the flu 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.159
 obviously why has become derby 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.260
 victory was enough 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.960
 we do not need it today 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.040
 We do not have excuses today 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.690
 the game we played 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.180
 have always been one step too late 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.160
 have so fought what the last games 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.080
 and therefore was today 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.940
 for the lost and gives but no 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.680
 reason to say now is okay we have 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.509
 the last games played well so we did 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.310
 have to re-enter ourselves now 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.729
 a bit after arguing and again harder 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.729
 work 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.269
 Unfortunately today we have in the 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.129
 second third everything in frankfurt am 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.610
 gotten the wrong foot and that has us 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:23.170
 then the two days tasted and was 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.390
 in the end no longer enough that we as 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.739
 it was still working on it 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.110
 little bit as if frankfurt in total 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:32.230
 tangy does this affect the ice so well 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.940
 So disappointed there with our security 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.790
 in the second third was field superior 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.319
 just had more chances were there 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.319
 also dangerous but we 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.720
 we know the role we have 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.820
 can all play well and have the 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.210
 Last game proved where injured too 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.130
 it was therefore as I said 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.140
 a bad game we played 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.660
 have and chop off eggs and on and on 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.060
 it's off if you take the 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.230
 hockey year 2014 looks back then but 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.960
 actually a huge success for the 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.150
 kassel huskies of course the end of the 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.130
 Year was not so good but that 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.170
 of course you can see all year 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.250
 already say that was very positive for 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:28.610
 Everything here before thinking of location 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.890
 That's why on the weekend is very positive 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.420
 actually conciliatory mood too 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.770
 if we did not win today yes 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.130
 of course there listening outside the fans 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.510
 still call 25 subject to the 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.370
 kassel huskies at the end 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.590
 Ultimately better frankfurtern 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.140
 this is a spectacular ice hockey 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.150
 year 2014 not so nice 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.360
 as we all would have liked 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.220
 Nevertheless, we say goodbye one by one 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.490
 happy and as always at itself 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.490
 literally
