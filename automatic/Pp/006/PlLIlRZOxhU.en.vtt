in<00:00:12.840> right<00:00:13.019> now<00:00:13.259> live<00:00:14.030> here<00:00:15.030> in<00:00:15.389> my<00:00:15.540> camera<00:00:15.929> okay

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
in right now live here in my camera okay

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.650 
in right now live here in my camera okay
so<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.619> first<00:00:16.650> question<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:17.340> why<00:00:18.180> do<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.449> like

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
so the first question is why do you like

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.250 
so the first question is why do you like
living<00:00:18.930> in<00:00:19.199> LA<00:00:19.529> better<00:00:19.890> than<00:00:20.100> oregon<00:00:20.600> well<00:00:21.600> i

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
living in LA better than oregon well i

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.900 
living in LA better than oregon well i
think<00:00:22.710> this<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.250> kind<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.490> hard<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.699> answer

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
think this is kind of hard to answer

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.150 
think this is kind of hard to answer
just<00:00:24.150> because<00:00:24.359> they're<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:24.630> different<00:00:24.840> um<00:00:25.320> i

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
just because they're so different um i

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.820 
just because they're so different um i
guess<00:00:26.430> maybe<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.910> makes<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.090> easier<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.420> but

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
guess maybe that makes it easier to but

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.109 
guess maybe that makes it easier to but
well<00:00:28.830> first<00:00:29.070> water<00:00:29.310> really<00:00:29.519> live<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:29.789> LA<00:00:29.970> I

start writing in it as a journal and

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.830 
start writing in it as a journal and
then<00:01:49.649> like<00:01:49.829> there'd<00:01:50.220> be<00:01:50.369> maybe<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:51.060> quarter<00:01:51.720> of

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
then like there'd be maybe a quarter of

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.560 
then like there'd be maybe a quarter of
it<00:01:52.049> filled<00:01:52.290> before<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.710> go<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> new<00:01:53.399> one<00:01:53.700> um

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570
