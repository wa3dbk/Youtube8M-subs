00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.039 
didn't come out on her hand and stuff
like<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.439> and<00:02:01.439> then<00:02:01.770> just<00:02:01.979> friends<00:02:02.460> just

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
like that and then just friends just

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.539 
like that and then just friends just
notice<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.380> which<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.860> always<00:02:05.009> good<00:02:05.310> I

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
notice in it which is always good I

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.809 
notice in it which is always good I
guess<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.090> means<00:02:06.210> it's<00:02:06.420> doing<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.750> job<00:02:06.780> and

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
guess that means it's doing the job and

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.089 
guess that means it's doing the job and
I<00:02:08.819> was<00:02:09.270> impressed<00:02:10.170> with<00:02:10.289> this<00:02:10.470> because<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.950> was

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
I was impressed with this because it was

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.710 
I was impressed with this because it was
a<00:02:11.310> good<00:02:11.730> price<00:02:12.030> as<00:02:12.330> well<00:02:12.510> for<00:02:12.930> testing

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
a good price as well for testing

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.530 
a good price as well for testing
now<00:02:14.460> musing<00:02:15.460> and<00:02:15.730> I<00:02:15.970> guess<00:02:16.180> you<00:02:16.330> could<00:02:16.510> use

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
now musing and I guess you could use

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.560 
now musing and I guess you could use
this<00:02:16.870> if<00:02:17.080> you<00:02:17.110> really<00:02:17.380> wanted<00:02:17.800> on<00:02:18.310> a<00:02:18.460> daily<00:02:19.000> you

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
this if you really wanted on a daily you

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.330 
this if you really wanted on a daily you
know<00:02:19.600> not<00:02:19.990> just<00:02:20.140> for<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.440> special<00:02:20.770> occasion

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
know not just for the special occasion

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
I was I'm going to demonstrate how

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.460 
I was I'm going to demonstrate how
simple<00:02:41.440> this<00:02:41.590> is<00:02:41.650> to<00:02:41.830> use<00:02:43.080> let<00:02:44.080> me<00:02:44.170> just<00:02:44.350> show

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
simple this is to use let me just show

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:51.840 
simple this is to use let me just show
you<00:02:44.500> once<00:02:44.800> again<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:46.209> before<00:02:50.640> obviously<00:02:51.640> I

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
you once again the before obviously I

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.820 
you once again the before obviously I
would<00:02:52.180> spend<00:02:52.420> more<00:02:52.570> time<00:02:52.870> in<00:02:53.230> front<00:02:53.620> of<00:02:53.770> the

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
would spend more time in front of the

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.030 
would spend more time in front of the
mirror<00:02:54.070> normally<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.300> this<00:02:56.230> might<00:02:56.470> take<00:02:56.680> I

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
mirror normally and this might take I

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.280 
mirror normally and this might take I
don't<00:02:57.370> know<00:02:57.580> five<00:02:57.910> minutes<00:02:58.270> just<00:02:58.600> to<00:02:59.110> make

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
don't know five minutes just to make

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.710 
don't know five minutes just to make
sure<00:02:59.470> that<00:02:59.680> you've<00:02:59.830> got<00:02:59.860> the<00:03:00.070> finished<00:03:00.720> effect

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
sure that you've got the finished effect

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.760 
sure that you've got the finished effect
that<00:03:02.200> you<00:03:02.320> want<00:03:02.560> but<00:03:03.250> I<00:03:03.310> will<00:03:03.550> demonstrate<00:03:04.150> now

that you want but I will demonstrate now
what<00:03:05.770> kind<00:03:06.040> of<00:03:06.130> effect<00:03:06.520> I<00:03:06.760> get<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:13.810> as<00:03:14.260> you<00:03:14.380> can

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
what kind of effect I get and as you can

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:22.680 
what kind of effect I get and as you can
see<00:03:16.769> it<00:03:17.769> is<00:03:20.370> not<00:03:21.370> hard<00:03:21.610> to<00:03:21.700> cut<00:03:22.060> it<00:03:22.300> slightly

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
see it is not hard to cut it slightly

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:43.120 
see it is not hard to cut it slightly
don't<00:03:23.620> put<00:03:23.739> it<00:03:24.239> in<00:03:25.239> too<00:03:25.600> much

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.780 

and<00:03:44.130> that's<00:03:44.370> you<00:03:45.030> know<00:03:45.150> a<00:03:45.360> fuller<00:03:45.810> effect<00:03:46.260> and

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
with a bit of hair wax a bit more time

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.460 
with a bit of hair wax a bit more time
as<00:03:49.860> well<00:03:50.040> with<00:03:50.310> a<00:03:50.340> mirror<00:03:50.610> in<00:03:50.760> front<00:03:51.030> of<00:03:51.180> you

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
I'm sure you'll get the effect that you

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.920

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
that this gives and as you can see as

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.880 
that this gives and as you can see as
well<00:04:00.600> it<00:04:01.020> doesn't<00:04:01.260> go<00:04:01.709> all<00:04:01.860> over<00:04:01.890> my<00:04:02.310> hands<00:04:03.890> and
