00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
create a custom stack when I

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.679

oh<00:02:13.709> that's<00:02:14.310> going<00:02:14.489> to<00:02:14.549> give<00:02:14.700> me<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:14.879> same<00:02:15.420> if

that's perfectly acceptable I could do

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.709 
that's perfectly acceptable I could do

caffeinated product if I wanted a little

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
the energy from something you know you

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.819 
the energy from something you know you
could<00:02:47.519> simply<00:02:47.879> take<00:02:47.909> a<00:02:48.120> small<00:02:48.900> caffeine<00:02:49.560> pill

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
could simply take a small caffeine pill

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.399 
could simply take a small caffeine pill
and<00:02:50.010> probably<00:02:50.760> get<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.120> same<00:02:51.150> results<00:02:51.810> if<00:02:51.989> not

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
and probably get the same results if not

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.050 
and probably get the same results if not
better<00:02:52.709> like<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.099> said<00:02:53.310> by<00:02:53.430> stacking<00:02:53.819> the

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.750 
better like I said by stacking the
product<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.689> getting<00:02:55.349> at<00:02:55.560> minimum<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.280> more

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
product and getting at minimum a more

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.759 
product and getting at minimum a more
consistent<00:02:57.379> reaction<00:02:58.379> because<00:02:58.620> you're

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
consistent reaction because you're

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.569 
consistent reaction because you're
judging<00:02:59.069> by<00:02:59.310> what<00:02:59.849> your<00:03:00.090> body<00:03:00.450> reacts<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.579> so

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
judging by what your body reacts to so

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.520 
judging by what your body reacts to so
again<00:03:03.329> I'm<00:03:03.450> hesitant<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:03.959> recommend<00:03:04.439> a

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
again I'm hesitant to recommend a

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.170 
again I'm hesitant to recommend a
product<00:03:04.919> like<00:03:05.010> this<00:03:05.069> because<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:05.639> really<00:03:05.939> don't

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
product like this because I really don't

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.179 
product like this because I really don't
know<00:03:06.269> who<00:03:06.750> it's<00:03:06.959> geared<00:03:07.319> towards<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:07.950> why<00:03:08.129> you

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:08.189 
know who it's geared towards and why you

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:10.339 
know who it's geared towards and why you
couldn't<00:03:08.730> just<00:03:08.790> do<00:03:09.060> it<00:03:09.209> better<00:03:09.389> on<00:03:09.599> your<00:03:10.200> own

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
couldn't just do it better on your own

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.530 
couldn't just do it better on your own
in<00:03:10.560> terms<00:03:10.620> of<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.129> product<00:03:11.489> though<00:03:11.639> it<00:03:11.849> tasted

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
in terms of the product though it tasted

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.750 
in terms of the product though it tasted
fine<00:03:12.719> OBS<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.439> products<00:03:13.829> taste<00:03:14.010> fine<00:03:14.219> these

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
fine OBS and products taste fine these

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.459 
fine OBS and products taste fine these
were<00:03:14.939> the<00:03:15.060> chocolate<00:03:15.450> milkshake<00:03:15.870> varieties<00:03:16.319> I

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:16.469 
were the chocolate milkshake varieties I

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:18.619 
were the chocolate milkshake varieties I
mix<00:03:16.650> them<00:03:16.799> both<00:03:16.859> with<00:03:17.159> water<00:03:17.489> as<00:03:17.760> well<00:03:18.239> as<00:03:18.479> with

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
mix them both with water as well as with

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:20.360 
mix them both with water as well as with
almond<00:03:19.079> milk<00:03:19.229> it<00:03:19.379> had<00:03:19.530> zero<00:03:19.799> issues<00:03:20.010> with

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
almond milk it had zero issues with

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.330 
almond milk it had zero issues with
consistency<00:03:20.970> I<00:03:21.780> would<00:03:22.139> probably<00:03:22.739> not<00:03:22.949> buy<00:03:23.280> it

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
consistency I would probably not buy it

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.369 
consistency I would probably not buy it
again<00:03:23.579> I<00:03:23.970> do<00:03:24.090> have<00:03:24.419> an<00:03:24.540> open<00:03:24.780> pack<00:03:24.959> on<00:03:25.169> an<00:03:25.260> empty

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
again I do have an open pack on an empty

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:27.110 
again I do have an open pack on an empty
packet<00:03:25.829> there<00:03:26.010> as<00:03:26.190> well<00:03:26.370> as<00:03:26.489> an<00:03:26.579> unopened<00:03:26.849> one

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
packet there as well as an unopened one

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.909 
packet there as well as an unopened one
so<00:03:27.239> i<00:03:27.269> will<00:03:27.510> continue<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:27.989> use<00:03:28.169> it<00:03:28.319> but<00:03:28.349> it's
