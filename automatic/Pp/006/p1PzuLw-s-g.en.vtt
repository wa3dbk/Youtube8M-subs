00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
necessarily the chocolate we know that

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.700 
necessarily the chocolate we know that
high<00:01:08.220> glycemic<00:01:08.760> foods<00:01:09.540> foods<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.500> have<00:01:10.650> a

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
high glycemic foods foods that have a

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.179 
high glycemic foods foods that have a
lot<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:10.920> sugar<00:01:11.189> or<00:01:11.720> a<00:01:12.720> lot<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.380> whites<00:01:13.590> or<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> lot

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
lot of sugar or a lot of whites or a lot

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.030 
lot of sugar or a lot of whites or a lot
of<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.490> high<00:01:14.670> glycemic<00:01:14.880> stuff<00:01:15.799> causes<00:01:16.799> our

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
of that high glycemic stuff causes our

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.399 
of that high glycemic stuff causes our
insulin<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.640> go<00:01:17.790> up<00:01:17.939> diabetics<00:01:18.900> can't<00:01:19.229> have

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
insulin to go up diabetics can't have

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.960 
insulin to go up diabetics can't have
sugary<00:01:19.860> things<00:01:20.130> reason<00:01:20.729> why<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:20.880> because

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
sugary things reason why is because

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.300 
sugary things reason why is because
their<00:01:21.330> body<00:01:21.509> can't<00:01:21.780> produce<00:01:21.930> insulin<00:01:22.409> when

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
their body can't produce insulin when

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.999 
their body can't produce insulin when
your<00:01:23.460> body<00:01:23.670> eats<00:01:23.909> sugar<00:01:24.290> insulin<00:01:25.290> fights<00:01:25.830> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
your body eats sugar insulin fights the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.280 
your body eats sugar insulin fights the
sugar<00:01:26.280> insulin<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.180> like<00:01:27.299> okay<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.110> we

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
sugar insulin is like okay this is we

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.010 
sugar insulin is like okay this is we
can<00:01:28.470> use<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.710> with<00:01:28.860> energy<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:30.210> when<00:01:30.570> insulin

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
can use this with energy so when insulin

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.020 
can use this with energy so when insulin
levels<00:01:31.290> go<00:01:31.409> up<00:01:31.680> when<00:01:31.979> we<00:01:32.100> eat<00:01:32.280> sugary<00:01:32.700> stuff

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
levels go up when we eat sugary stuff

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.030 
levels go up when we eat sugary stuff
that's<00:01:33.840> what<00:01:34.020> makes<00:01:34.229> our<00:01:34.380> insulin<00:01:34.710> levels<00:01:34.979> go

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
that's what makes our insulin levels go

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.219 
that's what makes our insulin levels go
up<00:01:35.189> when<00:01:35.939> these<00:01:36.060> insulin<00:01:36.570> levels<00:01:36.869> goes<00:01:37.020> up

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
up when these insulin levels goes up

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.289 
up when these insulin levels goes up
insulin<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.009> hormone<00:01:38.090> when<00:01:39.090> that's

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
insulin is a hormone when that's

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.030 
insulin is a hormone when that's

your<00:02:26.780> question<00:02:27.200> yes<00:02:28.159> chocolate<00:02:28.700> can<00:02:29.269> cause

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
your question yes chocolate can cause

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.949 
your question yes chocolate can cause
acne<00:02:29.989> but<00:02:30.739> it's<00:02:30.859> not<00:02:31.099> necessarily<00:02:31.849> chocolate

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
acne but it's not necessarily chocolate

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.500 
acne but it's not necessarily chocolate
it's<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.409> sugars<00:02:33.829> in<00:02:34.159> the<00:02:34.459> chocolate<00:02:34.939> if<00:02:35.389> you

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
it's the sugars in the chocolate if you

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.940 
it's the sugars in the chocolate if you
guys<00:02:35.629> were<00:02:35.840> gonna<00:02:35.930> say<00:02:36.170> have<00:02:36.349> a<00:02:36.379> chocolate<00:02:36.650> or

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
a piece of cheesecake if they have the

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.240 
a piece of cheesecake if they have the
same<00:02:38.780> amount<00:02:38.930> of<00:02:39.109> carbs<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.739> same<00:02:39.919> amount<00:02:40.159> of

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
same amount of carbs the same amount of

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.970 
same amount of carbs the same amount of
sugars<00:02:40.629> they're<00:02:41.629> gonna<00:02:41.749> go<00:02:42.049> cause<00:02:42.379> your<00:02:42.620> acne

sugars they're gonna go cause your acne
just<00:02:43.280> as<00:02:43.430> much<00:02:43.639> so<00:02:44.629> chocolate<00:02:45.079> especially

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:45.439 
just as much so chocolate especially

just as much so chocolate especially
dark<00:02:45.769> chocolate<00:02:46.189> is<00:02:46.340> a<00:02:46.639> healthier<00:02:47.419> dessert

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
dark chocolate is a healthier dessert

dark chocolate is a healthier dessert
choice<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:49.900> technically<00:02:50.900> chocolate<00:02:51.469> can

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
choice and technically chocolate can

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.159 
choice and technically chocolate can
cause<00:02:51.769> acne<00:02:52.010> but<00:02:52.639> it's<00:02:52.760> not<00:02:52.969> just<00:02:53.510> chocolates

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:54.169 
cause acne but it's not just chocolates

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:56.619 
cause acne but it's not just chocolates
so<00:02:54.560> just<00:02:54.769> chocolate<00:02:55.010> cause<00:02:55.280> acne<00:02:55.629> technically

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
so just chocolate cause acne technically

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.689 
so just chocolate cause acne technically
yes<00:02:56.810> but<00:02:57.079> technically<00:02:57.769> any<00:02:58.069> sugary<00:02:58.489> food
