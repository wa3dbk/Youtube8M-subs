the push out and Rogers instead smartly

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.670 
the push out and Rogers instead smartly
spun<00:06:07.700> behind<00:06:08.060> because<00:06:09.020> what<00:06:09.230> they<00:06:09.350> could<00:06:09.560> have

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
spun behind because what they could have

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.310 
spun behind because what they could have
called<00:06:09.950> there<00:06:10.340> is<00:06:10.550> just<00:06:10.970> a<00:06:11.060> continuation<00:06:11.360> and

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.320 
called there is just a continuation and

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.010
