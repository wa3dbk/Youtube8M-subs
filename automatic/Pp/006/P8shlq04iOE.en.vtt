properly<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.390> for<00:01:39.750> him<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.320> could<00:01:40.470> be<00:01:40.500> a

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
properly in for him so it could be a

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.560 
properly in for him so it could be a
Manchester<00:01:41.130> City<00:01:41.340> player<00:01:41.579> by<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.119> time<00:01:42.390> this

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
Manchester City player by the time this

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.679

video<00:01:42.720> goes<00:01:42.930> live<00:01:43.380> if<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.460> definitely<00:01:45.000> would

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
video goes live if so I definitely would

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.120 
video goes live if so I definitely would
imagine<00:01:45.990> we're<00:01:46.290> going<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.500> see<00:01:46.619> an<00:01:46.740> upgrade

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
imagine we're going to see an upgrade

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.950 
imagine we're going to see an upgrade
just<00:01:47.399> because<00:01:47.670> big<00:01:47.880> signings<00:01:48.360> for<00:01:48.540> big<00:01:48.689> clubs

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
just because big signings for big clubs

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.210 
just because big signings for big clubs

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
player ratings on the game and but he's

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.490 
player ratings on the game and but he's
got<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.430> good<00:01:56.759> card<00:01:57.090> on<00:01:57.299> FIFA<00:01:57.630> 15<00:01:57.780> currently

got a good card on FIFA 15 currently
again<00:01:58.829> it's<00:01:58.979> like<00:01:59.130> an<00:01:59.250> upgrade<00:01:59.610> 71<00:02:00.270> pays<00:02:00.540> 85

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
again it's like an upgrade 71 pays 85

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.069 
again it's like an upgrade 71 pays 85
defending<00:02:02.040> 81<00:02:02.579> physical<00:02:03.119> but<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.719> think<00:02:03.960> we're

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
defending 81 physical but I think we're

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.709 
defending 81 physical but I think we're
gonna<00:02:04.170> get<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.439> lot<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.950> lot<00:02:05.909> better<00:02:06.060> stats<00:02:06.450> on

gonna get a lot of a lot better stats on

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
p4 1683 rated card straight off the bat

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.590 
p4 1683 rated card straight off the bat
I<00:02:09.989> think<00:02:10.289> that's<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.530> good<00:02:10.649> rating<00:02:10.890> for<00:02:11.160> him

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
I think that's a good rating for him

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.500 
I think that's a good rating for him
and<00:02:12.020> in<00:02:12.140> terms<00:02:12.440> of<00:02:12.590> pace<00:02:12.940> defending<00:02:13.940> physical

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
and in terms of pace defending physical

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.550 
and in terms of pace defending physical
I<00:02:14.630> think<00:02:15.020> we're<00:02:15.170> going<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.380> see<00:02:15.410> some

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
I think we're going to see some

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.680 
I think we're going to see some
increases<00:02:16.130> in<00:02:16.460> those<00:02:16.670> we're<00:02:17.210> actually<00:02:17.300> in

increases in those we're actually in

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.530 
increases in those we're actually in

what he is right now on FIFA on FIFA 15
on<00:03:56.180> the<00:03:56.330> team<00:03:56.540> but<00:03:57.230> of<00:03:57.560> course<00:03:57.740> I<00:03:58.220> as<00:03:58.580> I<00:03:58.700> said<00:03:58.910> in

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
on the team but of course I as I said in

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.850 
on the team but of course I as I said in
a<00:03:59.120> previous<00:03:59.300> video<00:03:59.660> I<00:03:59.870> don't<00:04:00.020> feel<00:04:00.440> like<00:04:00.650> EA

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
a previous video I don't feel like EA

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.590 
a previous video I don't feel like EA
would<00:04:01.130> ever<00:04:01.310> give<00:04:01.550> a<00:04:01.580> player<00:04:01.850> exactly<00:04:02.450> the

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
would ever give a player exactly the

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.200 
would ever give a player exactly the
same<00:04:02.780> stats<00:04:03.110> in<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.800> next<00:04:04.100> generation<00:04:04.970> of<00:04:05.060> the

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.210 
same stats in the next generation of the

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.270 
same stats in the next generation of the
game<00:04:05.420> so<00:04:05.960> how<00:04:06.110> much<00:04:06.230> Rodriguez<00:04:06.800> I<00:04:06.830> think<00:04:07.160> we'll

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
game so how much Rodriguez I think we'll

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.100 
game so how much Rodriguez I think we'll
probably<00:04:07.490> still<00:04:07.760> be<00:04:07.820> an<00:04:08.000> 86<00:04:08.360> rated<00:04:08.660> card<00:04:08.870> you

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
probably still be an 86 rated card you

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.090 
probably still be an 86 rated card you
know<00:04:09.230> still<00:04:09.290> a<00:04:09.500> central<00:04:09.920> attacking

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
know still a central attacking

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.910 
know still a central attacking
midfielder<00:04:10.760> but<00:04:11.210> in<00:04:11.300> terms<00:04:11.480> of<00:04:11.660> stats<00:04:11.990> maybe<00:04:12.800> a

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
midfielder but in terms of stats maybe a

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.110 
midfielder but in terms of stats maybe a
slight<00:04:13.190> increase<00:04:13.610> in<00:04:13.640> like<00:04:13.910> dribbling

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
slight increase in like dribbling

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.479 
slight increase in like dribbling
shooting<00:04:14.720> passing<00:04:14.990> maybe<00:04:15.470> to<00:04:16.010> warrant<00:04:16.370> that

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
shooting passing maybe to warrant that

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.150 
shooting passing maybe to warrant that

pace 88 dribbling and 86 shooting for a
tall<00:04:51.690> guy<00:04:51.960> this<00:04:52.590> guy<00:04:52.860> has<00:04:53.100> got<00:04:53.160> one<00:04:53.520> of<00:04:53.639> the

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
tall guy this guy has got one of the

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.960 
tall guy this guy has got one of the
best<00:04:53.850> and<00:04:54.389> most<00:04:54.419> sort<00:04:54.900> of<00:04:55.020> I<00:04:55.230> don't<00:04:55.889> know<00:04:56.250> it's

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
best and most sort of I don't know it's

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.520 
best and most sort of I don't know it's
like<00:04:57.120> a<00:04:57.150> twinkle<00:04:57.720> toes<00:04:57.900> if<00:04:58.169> you're<00:04:58.290> not<00:04:58.380> I<00:04:58.440> mean

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
like a twinkle toes if you're not I mean

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.560

he's<00:04:58.830> so<00:04:59.250> good<00:04:59.490> on<00:04:59.610> the<00:04:59.729> ball<00:04:59.880> and<00:05:00.150> therefore<00:05:00.540> I

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
he's so good on the ball and therefore I

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.140 
he's so good on the ball and therefore I
think<00:05:00.870> he<00:05:00.960> deserves<00:05:01.350> 88<00:05:01.919> dribbling<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:02.490> that

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
think he deserves 88 dribbling and that

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.969 
think he deserves 88 dribbling and that
would<00:05:03.450> be<00:05:03.600> such<00:05:03.930> a<00:05:03.960> big<00:05:04.229> thing<00:05:04.260> for<00:05:04.470> feet<00:05:04.770> for

would be such a big thing for feet for

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.700 
would be such a big thing for feet for
16<00:05:05.400> where<00:05:05.639> dribbling<00:05:06.000> is<00:05:06.210> so<00:05:06.479> key<00:05:06.780> and

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
16 where dribbling is so key and

Bayern Munich these days as well and

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
especially if Thomas Muller does get a

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.860 
especially if Thomas Muller does get a
centre-forward<00:05:23.070> card<00:05:23.639> I<00:05:23.880> can<00:05:24.270> imagine<00:05:24.360> a<00:05:24.690> nice

centre-forward card I can imagine a nice

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.570 
centre-forward card I can imagine a nice
little<00:05:25.080> buyin<00:05:25.470> trio<00:05:25.740> up<00:05:25.979> front<00:05:26.280> would<00:05:26.430> be

little buyin trio up front would be

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.730

pretty<00:05:26.910> exciting<00:05:27.540> and<00:05:27.660> pretty<00:05:27.900> fun<00:05:28.080> to<00:05:28.260> you<00:05:28.410> so

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
pretty exciting and pretty fun to you so

those<00:05:28.890> are<00:05:29.100> my<00:05:29.130> five<00:05:29.520> players<00:05:29.880> for<00:05:30.180> today<00:05:30.419> I

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
those are my five players for today I

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.180 
those are my five players for today I
think<00:05:31.169> this<00:05:31.260> is<00:05:31.320> probably<00:05:31.440> going<00:05:31.979> to<00:05:32.039> be<00:05:32.160> the

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
think this is probably going to be the

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.550 
think this is probably going to be the
last<00:05:32.490> player<00:05:32.940> predictions<00:05:33.510> video<00:05:33.720> I<00:05:33.930> do<00:05:34.110> just

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
last player predictions video I do just

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.529 
last player predictions video I do just
because<00:05:34.680> I<00:05:34.800> think<00:05:34.950> just<00:05:35.760> around<00:05:36.030> the<00:05:36.150> corner

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
because I think just around the corner

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.060 
because I think just around the corner
we're<00:05:36.900> probably<00:05:37.110> going<00:05:37.350> to<00:05:37.410> start<00:05:37.680> seeing<00:05:37.860> the

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
we're probably going to start seeing the

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.740 
we're probably going to start seeing the
actual<00:05:38.280> ratings<00:05:38.850> for<00:05:39.030> these<00:05:39.150> players<00:05:39.419> and

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
actual ratings for these players and

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.180 
actual ratings for these players and
it'll<00:05:40.080> be<00:05:40.140> interesting<00:05:40.410> to<00:05:40.620> come<00:05:40.860> back<00:05:41.039> to

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
it'll be interesting to come back to

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.680 
it'll be interesting to come back to
these<00:05:41.280> videos<00:05:41.640> to<00:05:41.820> see<00:05:41.970> how<00:05:42.120> right<00:05:42.419> or<00:05:42.600> how

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
these videos to see how right or how

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.050 
these videos to see how right or how
wrong<00:05:42.960> I<00:05:42.990> was<00:05:43.140> on<00:05:43.530> some<00:05:44.010> of<00:05:44.130> these<00:05:44.190> ratings<00:05:44.789> now

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
wrong I was on some of these ratings now

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.730 
wrong I was on some of these ratings now
we've<00:05:45.539> talked<00:05:45.810> like<00:05:45.960> is<00:05:46.140> that<00:05:46.169> who's<00:05:46.440> a<00:05:46.470> nice

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
we've talked like is that who's a nice

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.010 
we've talked like is that who's a nice
big<00:05:47.010> upgrade<00:05:47.220> or<00:05:47.640> talk<00:05:47.820> Diego<00:05:48.240> Costa<00:05:48.630> I<00:05:48.660> think

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
big upgrade or talk Diego Costa I think

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.750 
big upgrade or talk Diego Costa I think
we'll<00:05:49.140> keep<00:05:49.320> that<00:05:49.470> same<00:05:49.770> rating<00:05:50.070> but<00:05:50.520> be<00:05:50.669> an

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
we'll keep that same rating but be an

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.360 
we'll keep that same rating but be an
absolute<00:05:51.180> God<00:05:51.419> in<00:05:51.539> FIFA<00:05:51.870> 16<00:05:52.020> low<00:05:52.830> and<00:05:53.010> das<00:05:53.190> key

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
absolute God in FIFA 16 low and das key

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:54.560 
absolute God in FIFA 16 low and das key
with<00:05:53.550> the<00:05:53.639> upgrade<00:05:54.060> and<00:05:54.180> I<00:05:54.240> think<00:05:54.450> he's

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
with the upgrade and I think he's

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:55.640 
with the upgrade and I think he's
probably<00:05:54.720> going<00:05:54.990> to<00:05:55.080> be<00:05:55.169> one<00:05:55.289> of<00:05:55.350> the<00:05:55.440> best

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
probably going to be one of the best

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.010 
probably going to be one of the best
strikers<00:05:56.039> in<00:05:56.070> the<00:05:56.280> game<00:05:56.460> for<00:05:56.700> sure<00:05:57.020> hammers

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
strikers in the game for sure hammers

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.870 
strikers in the game for sure hammers
Rodriguez<00:05:58.530> I<00:05:58.740> reckon<00:05:59.370> it's<00:05:59.520> pretty<00:05:59.760> much

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
Rodriguez I reckon it's pretty much

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.610 
Rodriguez I reckon it's pretty much
going<00:06:00.060> to<00:06:00.120> be<00:06:00.180> a<00:06:00.270> port<00:06:00.570> from<00:06:00.690> FIFA<00:06:01.050> sick<00:06:01.229> from

because I think pace is going to be a

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.020 
because I think pace is going to be a
massive<00:06:16.710> one<00:06:16.860> for<00:06:17.039> him<00:06:17.190> if<00:06:17.550> you<00:06:17.700> wouldn't<00:06:17.940> mind

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.030 
massive one for him if you wouldn't mind
