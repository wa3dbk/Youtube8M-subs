 hi guys here again with one more video 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.320
 For you that today's video is about 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.490
 this app here 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.010
 the pro scanner as well as the name itself 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.380
 say no 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.570
 it imitates a scanner and this application 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.180
 here is very useful 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.460
 So let's get to know him a little more. 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.429
 Good to start, you can take a picture. 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.309
 of a document or choose an image 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.370
 that you already have here in your role of 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:40.370
 camera as I have this paper here by 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:44.969
 Am I going to make an image of him here? 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.610
 I took the photo and then he has recognized and has 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.219
 it's scanned right by chance 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.719
 You do not get a right back here and 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:57.469
 you can adjust the edges of your 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.469
 document 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.170
 here you can also choose if you 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.650
 either colored in black and white with a 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.840
 strong or grayscale contrast 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.409
 I like this style here that I think 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.549
 that looks really good as a document 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.970
 of walking, right? 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.920
 here you can still tweak the brightness in the 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.240
 image contagion 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.720
 here you choose the paper size 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.659
 and here you can turn if your photo 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.100
 head up skirt has come 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.360
 on here 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.630
 Good, you saved saved the document. 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.100
 here you can edit the name of it that I 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.340
 I will not do it now 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.490
 here you can send by email you can 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.490
 add more photo take more photos 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.430
 you can also put more pictures of your 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.950
 camera roll and here do not share 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.890
 You can print it by fax 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.860
 to add without is that it is a very 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.320
 interesting you can open another 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.240
 application will depend on the 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.530
 applications that you have installed on your 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.440
 your device 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:15.600
 and you can also upload to the 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:19.020
 dropbox evernote google drive and etc 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.690

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.959
 free apple store because it is the ep 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.060
 of the week exactly the first 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.270
 application of the week of the time is the 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.569
 scanner ready the one that was more or 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.150
 less what he does and I recommend 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.680

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.959
