to keep you guys running this power
supply<00:00:27.420> has<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.050> same<00:00:28.380> connectors<00:00:29.039> as<00:00:29.250> your

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
supply has the same connectors as your

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.240 
supply has the same connectors as your
old<00:00:29.609> power<00:00:29.910> supply<00:00:30.710> except<00:00:31.710> it's<00:00:31.890> got<00:00:32.040> some

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
old power supply except it's got some

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.110 
old power supply except it's got some
extra<00:00:32.640> stuff<00:00:32.850> on<00:00:33.090> -<00:00:33.680> this<00:00:34.680> has<00:00:34.829> got<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> 22<00:00:35.610> 24

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120

pin ATX connector on it a p4 connector

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.440 
pin ATX connector on it a p4 connector
we've<00:00:44.070> got<00:00:44.510> looks<00:00:45.510> like<00:00:45.770> three<00:00:46.879> three<00:00:47.879> molex

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
we've got looks like three three molex

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.850 
we've got looks like three three molex
connectors<00:00:50.840> of<00:00:51.840> course<00:00:52.170> there's<00:00:52.410> your<00:00:52.559> floppy

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
connectors of course there's your floppy

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.900 
connectors of course there's your floppy
drive<00:00:53.250> connector<00:00:54.649> and<00:00:55.649> we've<00:00:56.039> added<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.520> SATA

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
drive connector and we've added a SATA

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.590 
drive connector and we've added a SATA
connector<00:00:57.840> as<00:00:57.930> well<00:00:58.789> the<00:00:59.789> old<00:00:59.940> power<00:01:00.180> supply

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
connector as well the old power supply

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.720 
connector as well the old power supply
did<00:01:00.870> not<00:01:01.020> have<00:01:01.230> SATA<00:01:01.590> on<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.039> or<00:01:02.190> maybe<00:01:02.399> some<00:01:02.699> of

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
did not have SATA on it or maybe some of

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.490 
did not have SATA on it or maybe some of
you<00:01:02.940> did<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.359> SATA<00:01:03.660> I've<00:01:03.809> seen<00:01:04.080> several

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
you did have SATA I've seen several

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.359 
you did have SATA I've seen several
different<00:01:04.860> both<00:01:05.040> versions<00:01:05.970> but<00:01:06.750> nevertheless

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
different both versions but nevertheless

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.740 
different both versions but nevertheless
the<00:01:08.369> devices<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:08.939> are<00:01:09.090> coming<00:01:09.299> out<00:01:09.570> today

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
the devices that are coming out today

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.350 
the devices that are coming out today
are<00:01:10.080> powered<00:01:10.350> by<00:01:10.380> SATA<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.130> we<00:01:11.909> figured<00:01:12.210> that

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
are powered by SATA and we figured that

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.530 
are powered by SATA and we figured that
you<00:01:12.479> would<00:01:12.630> need<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.869> SATA<00:01:13.260> on<00:01:13.860> whatever

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
you would need to SATA on whatever

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.420 
you would need to SATA on whatever
replacement<00:01:15.540> power<00:01:15.689> supply<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.130> got

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
replacement power supply that you got

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.210 
replacement power supply that you got
for<00:01:17.640> your<00:01:17.729> system<00:01:18.470> no<00:01:19.470> need<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.799> have<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.070> buy

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
for your system no need to have to buy

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.859 
for your system no need to have to buy
another<00:01:20.460> power<00:01:20.790> supply<00:01:21.150> just<00:01:21.180> because<00:01:21.720> you

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
another power supply just because you

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.590 
another power supply just because you
need<00:01:22.080> SATA<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.549> power<00:01:23.820> supply<00:01:24.150> can<00:01:24.210> do<00:01:24.479> it

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600

here<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.729> where<00:01:39.450> your<00:01:39.630> power<00:01:39.780> supply<00:01:40.049> slides

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
here is where your power supply slides

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.300 
here is where your power supply slides
up<00:01:41.310> under<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.850> floppy<00:01:42.090> drive<00:01:42.360> or<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.770> CD<00:01:43.799> ROM

some of you said you have a cd-rom that

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.090 
some of you said you have a cd-rom that
it's<00:01:46.320> got<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> slide<00:01:46.799> under<00:01:47.360> we<00:01:48.360> carefully

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
it's got a slide under we carefully

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.520 
it's got a slide under we carefully
selected<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.189> power<00:01:50.430> supply<00:01:50.990> because<00:01:51.990> it

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
selected this power supply because it

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.690 
selected this power supply because it
does<00:01:52.860> slide<00:01:53.369> up<00:01:53.579> under<00:01:54.229> your<00:01:55.460> your<00:01:56.460> floppy

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
does slide up under your your floppy

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.969 
does slide up under your your floppy
drives<00:01:57.090> or<00:01:57.390> whatever<00:01:57.930> devices<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.560> got<00:01:58.740> there

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
drives or whatever devices you got there

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.910 
drives or whatever devices you got there
it's<00:01:59.610> actually<00:01:59.850> a<00:02:00.119> tad<00:02:00.479> bit<00:02:00.780> shallower<00:02:01.320> than

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
it's actually a tad bit shallower than

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:10.130 
it's actually a tad bit shallower than
your<00:02:02.100> old<00:02:02.280> one

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.559 

so<00:02:11.140> what<00:02:11.260> we<00:02:11.380> have<00:02:11.560> here<00:02:11.860> is<00:02:12.010> a<00:02:12.360> 240<00:02:13.360> watt

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
so what we have here is a 240 watt

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.790 
so what we have here is a 240 watt
