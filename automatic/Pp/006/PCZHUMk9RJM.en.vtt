buttons you can use stone however the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.929 
buttons you can use stone however the
pulse<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> lot<00:01:28.500> faster<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.430> it's<00:01:29.549> harder<00:01:29.850> to

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
pulse is a lot faster so it's harder to

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.249 
pulse is a lot faster so it's harder to
get<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.329> door<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.720> highly<00:01:31.229> highly

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
get to the door so I highly highly

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.440 
get to the door so I highly highly

here and connect them together then
going<00:03:09.930> into<00:03:10.080> these<00:03:10.350> pistons<00:03:10.770> right<00:03:10.920> here

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
going into these pistons right here

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.290 
going into these pistons right here
we're<00:03:11.160> going<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.310> come<00:03:11.490> out<00:03:11.610> two<00:03:11.820> more<00:03:11.970> blocks

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
we're going to come out two more blocks

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.930 
we're going to come out two more blocks
and<00:03:12.570> put<00:03:13.410> two<00:03:13.560> repeaters<00:03:13.890> going<00:03:14.190> this<00:03:14.430> way<00:03:14.640> on

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
and put two repeaters going this way on

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.720 
and put two repeaters going this way on
two<00:03:15.720> ticks<00:03:16.050> delay<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:16.740> that<00:03:16.770> should<00:03:17.580> be<00:03:17.700> our

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
two ticks delay and that should be our

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.580 
two ticks delay and that should be our
hole<00:03:18.120> double<00:03:18.480> piston<00:03:18.750> extension<00:03:19.050> so<00:03:19.260> if<00:03:19.350> I<00:03:19.410> put

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
hole double piston extension so if I put

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.860 
hole double piston extension so if I put
a<00:03:19.620> torch<00:03:20.070> to<00:03:20.130> any<00:03:20.460> one<00:03:20.730> of<00:03:20.760> these<00:03:20.910> any<00:03:21.570> one<00:03:21.810> of

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
a torch to any one of these any one of

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.630 
a torch to any one of these any one of
this<00:03:22.020> dust<00:03:22.290> right<00:03:22.440> here<00:03:22.620> it<00:03:22.980> will<00:03:23.130> activate<00:03:23.520> it

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
this dust right here it will activate it

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.410 
this dust right here it will activate it
so<00:03:23.670> Boop

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
so Boop

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.120 
so Boop
see<00:03:24.630> how<00:03:24.690> a<00:03:24.750> double<00:03:25.020> piston<00:03:25.170> extends<00:03:25.740> up<00:03:25.860> and

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
see how a double piston extends up and

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.800 
see how a double piston extends up and
then<00:03:26.430> if<00:03:26.550> I<00:03:26.610> delete<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:26.970> torches<00:03:27.330> it<00:03:27.660> goes

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
then if I delete the torches it goes

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.480 
then if I delete the torches it goes
back<00:03:28.050> down<00:03:28.080> so<00:03:28.500> your<00:03:28.650> should<00:03:28.890> be<00:03:28.950> doing<00:03:29.190> this

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
back down so your should be doing this

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.690 
back down so your should be doing this
up<00:03:31.220> up<00:03:32.690> okay<00:03:33.690> let's<00:03:34.440> move<00:03:34.590> on<00:03:34.770> now<00:03:34.980> now<00:03:35.460> coming

torch any part of this dust a torch has
to<00:05:07.940> go<00:05:08.030> to<00:05:08.090> it<00:05:08.270> because<00:05:08.630> you<00:05:08.900> want<00:05:09.050> to<00:05:09.080> be

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
a block right above it with our button

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.060 
a block right above it with our button
like<00:05:36.710> this<00:05:36.889> and<00:05:37.159> it<00:05:37.340> will<00:05:37.400> activate<00:05:37.909> it<00:05:38.090> see

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
like this and it will activate it see

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.200 
like this and it will activate it see
the<00:05:40.070> hardest<00:05:40.370> one<00:05:40.520> is<00:05:40.639> the<00:05:40.760> top<00:05:40.970> one<00:05:41.150> now

then of course you got to figure out a

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:45.580 
then of course you got to figure out a
way<00:05:43.880> well<00:05:44.449> a<00:05:44.479> spot<00:05:44.840> where<00:05:44.990> you're<00:05:45.139> gonna<00:05:45.259> hide

we want to do is come two blocks down

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.170 
we want to do is come two blocks down
from<00:05:59.479> here<00:05:59.720> one<00:05:59.960> two<00:06:00.370> put<00:06:01.370> the<00:06:01.610> stright<00:06:01.909> here

block right here and put a repeater

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:06.909 
block right here and put a repeater
going<00:06:05.690> this<00:06:05.840> way<00:06:05.960> on<00:06:06.139> one<00:06:06.380> tick<00:06:06.530> delay<00:06:06.650> of

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 
going this way on one tick delay of

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:08.170 
going this way on one tick delay of
course<00:06:07.310> we're<00:06:07.430> gonna<00:06:07.520> to<00:06:07.669> dig<00:06:07.849> out<00:06:07.970> a<00:06:08.000> little

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
course we're gonna to dig out a little

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.490 
course we're gonna to dig out a little
bit<00:06:08.360> more<00:06:08.479> but<00:06:08.599> like<00:06:08.720> I<00:06:08.750> said<00:06:08.960> as<00:06:09.080> long<00:06:09.229> as<00:06:09.289> the

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
bit more but like I said as long as the

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.529 
bit more but like I said as long as the
power<00:06:09.710> is<00:06:09.949> going<00:06:10.099> down<00:06:10.370> here<00:06:10.669> to<00:06:10.789> this<00:06:11.210> torch

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:11.539 
power is going down here to this torch

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:13.390 
power is going down here to this torch
always<00:06:11.960> to<00:06:12.229> do<00:06:12.320> is<00:06:12.380> get<00:06:12.500> the<00:06:12.620> power<00:06:12.800> to<00:06:13.009> that<00:06:13.130> so

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
always to do is get the power to that so
