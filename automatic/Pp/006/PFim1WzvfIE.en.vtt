00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:14.650 
because you don't want to be in a

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:17.400 
because you don't want to be in a
picture<00:07:15.070> with<00:07:15.340> this<00:07:15.640> big<00:07:16.330> white<00:07:16.720> square<00:07:17.080> your

it's stage sport for stage sport and
Cydia<00:07:23.590> so<00:07:23.950> I<00:07:24.220> think<00:07:24.400> it's<00:07:24.970> a<00:07:25.240> must-have<00:07:25.540> for
