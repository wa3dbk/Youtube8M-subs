00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.330
 the love of God with a little egg like 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.330
 you can see bad 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:18.940
 and says I'm going to give an easy solution 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.610
 in a little cup you can drink whatever you want 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:25.350
 You put a profile inside but with a 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.350
 little oil down there 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.250
 so if you grant that you had 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.200
 said that I'm going to disarm one of the 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.809
 packets and I'm going to dump this nice one is 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.320
 just a fresh little egg in there 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.320
 in 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.760
 then I always want to put iron 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.100
 here I do for crime 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.870
 what 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.920
 too much air and oil to make it 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.769
 easier to take off 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.930
 but here if I go on a date with water 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.990
 hot iron chair 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.460
 and what we are ending today if we go to 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.920
 exercise is cooking on when 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.230
 some I show my children I can see 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.880
 so that you do not exploit the part of 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:17.190
 sheen inside if it was paid 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.780
 I have more or less how much three or three 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.270
 four minutes of cooking what is the 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.310
 idea that you cook the clear but that the 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.650
 buds is well piernita and that after 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.590
 that to mix with the district and 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.510
 to start your visit is your visit 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.210
 it is good for those who are 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.760
 taking care of 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.049
 vegetarians well if you want him with 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.630
 the change to put but this is 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.090
 simply with vegetables on the bag 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.909
 from there it was simply reheating or 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.460
 if it's going with oil and we're going with 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.840
 vegetables of many colors because how much 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.360
 more colors more nutritious mites 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:57.410
 abode we have morro 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.410
 of burgos horizon in 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.410
 but 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.719
 exists 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.860
 the last paper 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.340
 I like them by color as we do 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.709
 one by one 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.069
 thing that everything in the bracelet and that 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.859
 view all of color 9 of the town 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.030
 red yellow I also have green 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:30.500
 purple Onion 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.060
 and there always has to be a little bit of 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.450
 action in this type of prepares by 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.450
 Energy 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.459
 this leg 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:49.340
 from obama 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:52.599
 but to walk very well we are going on a trip 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.599
 as always 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.930
 up in and the colors 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.350
 these ads was about life paquito 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.329
 I minced 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.329
 and here we mix a little 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:20.260
 and now let's put water 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.019
 another to avoid we use caldito 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.109
 purchased from pure water fund all this 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.450
 do please if what is vital 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:30.760
 because it 's in our broth relationship 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.510
 with the water after the goal exactly 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.670
 because the water is cold 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.659
 then it will grab all the flavor of 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.340
 All if you want to be a bolide of 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:42.079
 change you put hidden when to 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.900
 lift the favor but the idea is that no 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:47.060
 there need to let it cook 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:52.040
 break tree when they subtracted I will look for you 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.450
 Latin to whom and do not do the one that goes 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.700
 year 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.370
 if I'm naked but it's super old 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.500
 It is super nutritious and if it is fashionable it is 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.750
 because it is good and because there is consumed 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.450
 that water that will last well with 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.390
 you here is the little quinoa 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.769
 would be the little one is considered as 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.720
 cook making rice a little less than 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.489
 time but most importantly when 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.500
 buy kilo in a diet or in the 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.269
 supermarket is that you have to wash it 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.850
 unless it comes as it is praised 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.639
 hill tape well next wash it 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.979
 because you have to take out the saponin that 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.690
 it is a toxic substance that sent it to 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.810
 out not even out a big cone 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.130
 exactly if you are putting water and 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.770
 low quoting will know what to do 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.120
 espumita so still harder but 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.660
 nava you can actually make soap 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.660
 with that 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.930
 17 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.080
 of 7 help 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.789
 when the fan is 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.150
 what nice numbers of January good lava 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:52.639
 until more foam comes out cove and a 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.530
 Once you have all the bandit and that 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.750
 the ideal is that rum but now I'm just going 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.680
 to do now but nothing happens we're going 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.680
 to put here 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.710
 what schedule do you love 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.750
 so then we mix this well 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.409
 here is not going to cook is going to go to 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.239
 big 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:19.550
 how rice is cooked that is also 

00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:21.559
 enlarges metals also when 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.809
 cooking with your 15 minutes nothing more 

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:25.879
 breaker because the store is cooking well 

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:28.519
 of fast and the vegetables too and 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:30.649
 apart the idea is not that they are about 

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:33.219
 waste but find the texture 

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:33.219
 each 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.639
 As I did not put meat on him he says we will open 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:45.940
 of the part but take a through a 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:45.940
 huevito
