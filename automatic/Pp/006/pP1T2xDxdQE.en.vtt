00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
right out I can't do it with one hand

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.969 
right out I can't do it with one hand
and<00:02:01.810> then<00:02:02.810> you<00:02:03.020> can<00:02:03.229> get<00:02:03.409> to<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:03.770> blower<00:02:04.489> motor

and then you can get to the blower motor

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.859 
and then you can get to the blower motor
which<00:02:06.979> bolts<00:02:07.640> on<00:02:07.789> around<00:02:08.149> here

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
which bolts on around here

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:16.510

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.490 
truck I have one and I I did the
evaporator<00:02:37.580> coil<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.300> ended<00:02:38.930> up<00:02:39.050> doing<00:02:39.410> the

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
evaporator coil and ended up doing the

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.830 
evaporator coil and ended up doing the
blower<00:02:39.740> motor<00:02:40.130> three<00:02:40.550> months<00:02:40.820> later<00:02:41.030> so<00:02:41.810> I

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
blower motor three months later so I

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.860 
blower motor three months later so I
learned<00:02:42.140> hard<00:02:42.440> way

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
learned hard way

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.110 
learned hard way
who<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:45.080> day<00:02:45.290> under<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:45.920> hood<00:02:49.120> essentially

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
who the day under the hood essentially

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.620 
who the day under the hood essentially
you<00:02:50.360> need<00:02:50.540> to

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
you need to

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:59.990 
you need to
remove<00:02:53.380> this<00:02:53.620> bottle<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:57.670> this<00:02:58.600> line<00:02:58.960> here

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
remove this bottle and this line here

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.660 
remove this bottle and this line here
right<00:03:01.000> there

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
right there

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.140 
right there
this<00:03:03.240> connector<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:04.340> what<00:03:05.340> I<00:03:05.370> use<00:03:05.670> were<00:03:05.970> these

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
this connector and what I use were these

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.850 
this connector and what I use were these
out<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.540> these<00:03:06.780> plastic<00:03:07.020> tools<00:03:07.500> weren't<00:03:07.709> the

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
out of these plastic tools weren't the

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.270 
out of these plastic tools weren't the
greatest<00:03:08.330> they're<00:03:09.349> spring<00:03:10.349> clip<00:03:10.680> disconnect

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
greatest they're spring clip disconnect

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.479 
greatest they're spring clip disconnect
tools<00:03:11.540> and<00:03:12.540> there's<00:03:12.810> another<00:03:13.080> AC<00:03:13.380> line<00:03:13.860> here<00:03:14.310> I

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
tools and there's another AC line here I

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.570 
tools and there's another AC line here I
take<00:03:15.000> I<00:03:15.680> sealed<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:16.860> off<00:03:16.980> there

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
take I sealed it off there

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.030 
take I sealed it off there
I<00:03:17.610> guess<00:03:18.270> doesn't<00:03:18.870> matter<00:03:19.200> now<00:03:19.470> I<00:03:19.500> just<00:03:19.680> pop

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
I guess doesn't matter now I just pop

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.680 
I guess doesn't matter now I just pop
that<00:03:20.100> one<00:03:20.489> loose<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:21.000> was<00:03:21.090> trying<00:03:21.300> to<00:03:21.330> keep<00:03:21.510> here

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
that one loose I was trying to keep here

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.910 
that one loose I was trying to keep here
out<00:03:21.930> of<00:03:22.020> the<00:03:22.080> system<00:03:23.209> so<00:03:24.319> then<00:03:25.319> there's<00:03:25.620> about

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
out of the system so then there's about

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.600 
out of the system so then there's about
five<00:03:26.340> bolts<00:03:26.910> on<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.180> back<00:03:27.390> of<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.800> firewall

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
five bolts on the back of the firewall

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.480 
five bolts on the back of the firewall
so<00:03:31.140> that's<00:03:32.140> how<00:03:32.320> you<00:03:32.380> get<00:03:32.530> it<00:03:32.620> all<00:03:32.740> apart<00:03:33.280> wish

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
so that's how you get it all apart wish

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.360 
so that's how you get it all apart wish
me<00:03:33.670> luck<00:03:33.700> getting<00:03:34.000> it<00:03:34.060> back<00:03:34.180> together
