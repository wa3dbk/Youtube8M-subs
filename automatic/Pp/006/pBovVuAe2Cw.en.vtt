00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
the ground and you can put a trip wire

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.219 
the ground and you can put a trip wire
and<00:01:57.060> when<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.210> see<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.509> trip<00:01:57.689> wire<00:01:57.840> thing<00:01:58.110> go

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
and when you see the trip wire thing go

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.310 
and when you see the trip wire thing go
down<00:01:58.409> like<00:01:58.770> right<00:01:59.040> there<00:01:59.630> it<00:02:00.630> basically<00:02:00.840> acts

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
down like right there it basically acts

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.039 
down like right there it basically acts
as<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.560> redstone<00:02:01.950> switch<00:02:02.310> like<00:02:02.579> up<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.969> button<00:02:03.869> or

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
as a redstone switch like up a button or

as a redstone switch like up a button or
a<00:02:04.200> pressure<00:02:04.469> plate<00:02:04.680> or<00:02:04.920> lever<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.420> you<00:02:06.420> can

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
a pressure plate or lever and you can

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.479 
a pressure plate or lever and you can
use<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.869> trigger<00:02:07.170> redstone<00:02:07.649> so<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.369> can

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
use this to trigger redstone so you can

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.729 
use this to trigger redstone so you can
set<00:02:08.670> traps<00:02:08.940> with<00:02:09.179> T&amp;T<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.929> settee<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.349> CNR<00:02:10.590> it

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
set traps with T&amp;T and settee and CNR it

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.110 
set traps with T&amp;T and settee and CNR it
make<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:10.979> blow<00:02:11.220> up<00:02:11.250> when<00:02:11.459> someone<00:02:11.730> comes<00:02:11.910> in

in<00:03:16.640> Big<00:03:17.640> Mountain<00:03:17.880> biomes<00:03:18.390> which<00:03:18.630> are<00:03:18.840> like

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
in Big Mountain biomes which are like

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.539 
in Big Mountain biomes which are like
big<00:03:19.170> mountains<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:19.739> they've<00:03:20.130> also<00:03:20.310> made<00:03:20.430> the

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
big mountains and they've also made the

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.250 
big mountains and they've also made the
terrains<00:03:21.000> bigger<00:03:21.269> so<00:03:21.540> each<00:03:21.660> terrain<00:03:22.049> is<00:03:22.230> a

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
terrains bigger so each terrain is a

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.650 
terrains bigger so each terrain is a
little<00:03:22.440> bit<00:03:22.530> bigger<00:03:22.790> alright<00:03:24.019> next<00:03:25.019> feature

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
little bit bigger alright next feature

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.530
