00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 and that man does not like 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.280
 Well defined woman legs in 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.710
 Combat several girls who have some 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:20.580
 legs and we raise legs 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:23.400
 short and thin long or 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.990
 toned in any way 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.570
 legs will always be the main 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.060
 attributes of a woman and attention 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.960
 gentlemen since the combat girls 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:42.060
 they have what to defend themselves with 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:42.060
 [Music] 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:02.989
 they told us raise that part of their 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.659
 body and what they do to keep them well 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.340
 tonified I would say that the first 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.580
 genetic because exercise the truth not 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:14.270
 I do nothing, I only do a fight 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.310
 he does without a lot of football I love the 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.909
 soccer play ball cheek anything 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.909
 I hope so 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.240
 what pleases her legs and 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.119
 legs and I have families with good 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.530
 front and with good legs is 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.909
 studied and so it was so we decided 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.560
 because we have abandoned them the truth 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.149
 but yes from genetics more than anything but 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.850
 does not use as exercises for 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.380
 tone up the shoah yes yes so speak 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.580
 I study like a year being but right now 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.220
 As I tell you, I have it a little bit 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.220
 abandoned some of that carl but a 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.500
 aspect of that is that the legs are of 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.869
 the greatest attributes I was a woman 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.280
 Of course yes, because a woman is very 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.330
 female always likes to walk in 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.190
 petticoats and shorts and that's what she does 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.979
 a lot of exercise if I go running in 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.950
 bicycle a lot of gym followed what 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.080
 more the pilot follows the legs in the 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.580
 buttocks 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.830
 I would say genetics because I do not even 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.210
 exercise to favorite about what what 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.310
 I'm doing in combat but 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.430
 and put it so to take out they want 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.110
 this that the truth of the I have losses 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.740
 we have very toned legs 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:30.040
 thank you very much I believe that genetics 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.390
 European, what I would normally say is 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.120
 the parts of your body that most 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.430
 they like which yes the truth that exists 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.040
 when I came in as they stopped very 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.700
 skinny and was very skinny I had some 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.370
 little stones that walk I break but 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.470
 I am so old and in combat 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.960
 then of so much exercise that is done 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.150
 here one toned and with the same 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.500
 exercise here and it 's say that those 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.750
 little bit a little bit there 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.160
 bolton more and more right now not now 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.820
