00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.880 
difficulty cast a little bit longer than
a<00:01:30.509> normal<00:01:30.540> car<00:01:31.079> but<00:01:31.259> i<00:01:31.290> mean<00:01:31.439> if<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.680> have<00:01:31.860> a

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
a normal car but i mean if you have a

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.710 
a normal car but i mean if you have a
large<00:01:32.159> mercedes<00:01:32.820> i<00:01:33.030> suppose<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.420> would<00:01:33.509> be<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
large mercedes i suppose it would be the

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.780 
large mercedes i suppose it would be the
same<00:01:33.750> as<00:01:33.930> parking<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.530> really<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.460> how

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
same as parking that really so how

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.490 
same as parking that really so how
reliable<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.810> because<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.110> kind<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.380> think

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
reliable is it because I kind of think

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.640 
reliable is it because I kind of think
you<00:01:37.619> know<00:01:37.740> 84<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.939> long<00:01:39.329> old<00:01:39.540> time<00:01:39.869> ago<00:01:40.259> I

one of the problems with roses a lot of
the<00:03:14.569> parts<00:03:14.780> on<00:03:15.049> the<00:03:15.140> rolls<00:03:15.350> are<00:03:15.500> actually

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
the parts on the rolls are actually

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.110 
the parts on the rolls are actually
aluminium<00:03:16.160> but<00:03:16.459> they<00:03:16.579> do<00:03:16.640> so<00:03:16.940> they've<00:03:17.090> got

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
aluminium but they do so they've got

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.120 
aluminium but they do so they've got
metal<00:03:17.569> wings<00:03:18.049> on<00:03:18.290> them<00:03:18.380> and<00:03:18.470> they<00:03:18.560> do<00:03:18.620> suffer

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
metal wings on them and they do suffer

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.309 
metal wings on them and they do suffer
rolls<00:03:19.790> and<00:03:20.150> stuff<00:03:20.359> around<00:03:20.600> the<00:03:20.780> wheel<00:03:21.079> arches

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
rolls and stuff around the wheel arches

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:22.750 
rolls and stuff around the wheel arches
at<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.620> bottom<00:03:21.889> of<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.010> front<00:03:22.190> wheel<00:03:22.430> arches

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
at the bottom of the front wheel arches

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.050 
at the bottom of the front wheel arches
and<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.750> Front's<00:03:24.079> of<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.260> back<00:03:24.440> wheel<00:03:24.650> arches

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
and the Front's of the back wheel arches

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.490 
and the Front's of the back wheel arches
but<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.120> rest<00:03:26.329> of<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.540> car<00:03:26.720> lots<00:03:27.139> of<00:03:27.290> it<00:03:27.410> is

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
but the rest of the car lots of it is

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.530 
but the rest of the car lots of it is
aluminium<00:03:27.739> so<00:03:28.220> a<00:03:28.430> part<00:03:28.819> of<00:03:28.970> a<00:03:29.090> small<00:03:29.359> bit<00:03:29.510> of

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
aluminium so a part of a small bit of

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.819 
aluminium so a part of a small bit of
festering<00:03:30.019> you<00:03:30.200> might<00:03:30.380> get<00:03:30.560> from<00:03:30.620> aluminium

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
festering you might get from aluminium

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.069 
festering you might get from aluminium
you<00:03:31.760> don't<00:03:31.970> suffer<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.359> rest<00:03:32.569> so<00:03:32.690> much<00:03:32.840> but

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
you don't suffer the rest so much but

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.390 
you don't suffer the rest so much but
they<00:03:33.380> do<00:03:33.440> suffer<00:03:33.799> on<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:34.040> wings<00:03:34.250> and

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
they do suffer on the wings and

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.800 
they do suffer on the wings and
obviously<00:03:34.880> you've<00:03:35.030> gotta<00:03:35.209> keep<00:03:35.480> your<00:03:35.660> own

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
machetes why because they're likely to

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.330 
machetes why because they're likely to
go<00:03:38.660> yeah<00:03:39.079> I<00:03:39.109> mean<00:03:39.380> there<00:03:39.859> they<00:03:40.010> were<00:03:40.160> there
