they're working on their environment
like<00:03:42.000> environmental<00:03:43.050> like<00:03:44.050> focusing<00:03:44.830> on

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
like environmental like focusing on

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.160 
like environmental like focusing on
environmental<00:03:45.700> stuff<00:03:46.090> so<00:03:46.720> they're<00:03:46.989> making

environmental stuff so they're making

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.979 
environmental stuff so they're making
the<00:03:47.410> boxes<00:03:47.800> smaller<00:03:47.890> so<00:03:48.790> they<00:03:48.910> can<00:03:49.090> take<00:03:49.810> up

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
the boxes smaller so they can take up

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.780 
the boxes smaller so they can take up
less<00:03:50.760> then<00:03:51.760> have<00:03:51.970> more<00:03:52.630> boxes<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:54.070> they<00:03:54.520> take
