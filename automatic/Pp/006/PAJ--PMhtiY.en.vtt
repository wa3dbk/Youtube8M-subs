from<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.280> rock<00:00:14.549> Mike<00:00:15.120> what<00:00:15.750> is<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.109> story<00:00:16.410> with

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
from to rock Mike what is the story with

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.980 
from to rock Mike what is the story with
the<00:00:16.800> bionics<00:00:17.400> what<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.390> like<00:00:18.630> about<00:00:18.750> this

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
the bionics what I like about this

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.080 
the bionics what I like about this
amplifier<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.650> layout<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.310> very<00:00:20.369> simple

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
amplifier is the layout is very simple

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.150 
amplifier is the layout is very simple
it<00:00:21.300> doesn't<00:00:21.570> have<00:00:21.810> cascading<00:00:22.410> gain<00:00:22.619> controls

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
it doesn't have cascading gain controls

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.340 
it doesn't have cascading gain controls
but<00:00:24.000> really<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.449> best<00:00:24.660> thing<00:00:24.840> we<00:00:24.990> can<00:00:25.109> do<00:00:25.230> is

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
but really the best thing we can do is

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.439 
but really the best thing we can do is
just<00:00:25.380> play<00:00:25.769> this<00:00:25.980> amplifier<00:00:26.550> for<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.150> the

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
just play this amplifier for you the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.599 
just play this amplifier for you the
versatility<00:00:28.109> on<00:00:28.349> it's<00:00:28.619> pretty<00:00:28.769> amazing<00:00:29.130> so

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
versatility on it's pretty amazing so

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.160 
versatility on it's pretty amazing so
Bob<00:00:30.240> once<00:00:30.480> you're<00:00:30.630> planning<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.960> clean

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
Bob once you're planning the clean

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.930 
Bob once you're planning the clean
channel<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.650> little<00:00:31.830> bit<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.640> do<00:00:32.730> have<00:00:32.850> an

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
channel a little bit and you do have an

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.220 
channel a little bit and you do have an
effects<00:00:33.239> loop<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.719> back<00:00:33.750> it's<00:00:34.170> got

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
effects loop in the back it's got

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:53.450 
effects loop in the back it's got
everything<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.829> need<00:00:52.039> you'll<00:00:53.039> notice<00:00:53.309> that

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
everything you need you'll notice that

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.880 
everything you need you'll notice that
that<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.360> harder<00:00:54.660> he<00:00:54.809> plays<00:00:55.079> he<00:00:55.320> can<00:00:55.469> actually

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
that the harder he plays he can actually

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.490 
that the harder he plays he can actually
get<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.579> break<00:00:56.820> up<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.239> little<00:00:57.390> bit<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.350> I

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
get it to break up a little bit and I

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.750 
get it to break up a little bit and I
think<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.739> problem<00:00:59.100> with<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.250> lot<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.520> two

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
think the problem with a lot of two

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.520 
think the problem with a lot of two
channel<00:01:00.149> amplifiers<00:01:00.629> clean<00:01:01.020> channel<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.500> that

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
channel amplifiers clean channel is that

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.990 
channel amplifiers clean channel is that
they<00:01:01.710> don't<00:01:01.800> have<00:01:01.949> enough<00:01:02.129> harmonic<00:01:02.579> content

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
they don't have enough harmonic content

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.380 
they don't have enough harmonic content
they're<00:01:03.210> too<00:01:03.390> clean<00:01:03.750> they're<00:01:04.379> sterile<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.580> by

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
they're too clean they're sterile so by

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.080 
they're too clean they're sterile so by
this<00:01:06.860> by<00:01:07.860> playing<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.310> little<00:01:08.430> bit<00:01:08.640> harder<00:01:08.939> he

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
this by playing a little bit harder he

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.850 
this by playing a little bit harder he
can<00:01:09.210> get<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.990> channel<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.380> break<00:01:10.560> up<00:01:10.740> a

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
can get the the channel to break up a

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.469 
can get the the channel to break up a
little<00:01:11.070> bit<00:01:11.280> back<00:01:11.640> off<00:01:11.880> your<00:01:12.060> tongue<00:01:12.240> could

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
little bit back off your tongue could

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.249 
little bit back off your tongue could
volume<00:01:13.140> control<00:01:13.560> clean<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.430> up<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.110> get<00:01:16.110> it

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
volume control clean it up and get it

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.810 
volume control clean it up and get it
clean<00:01:16.500> as<00:01:16.740> clean<00:01:16.950> as<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.100> want<00:01:17.189> or<00:01:17.490> just<00:01:17.670> run

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
clean as clean as you want or just run

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.330 
clean as clean as you want or just run
the<00:01:17.909> master<00:01:18.299> up<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.810> game<00:01:18.990> back<00:01:19.340> but

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
the master up and the game back but

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.609 
the master up and the game back but
let's<00:01:20.850> go<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.900> lead<00:01:22.110> channel<00:01:22.350> this

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
let's go to the to the lead channel this

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:47.560 
let's go to the to the lead channel this
is<00:01:22.740> where<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.040> amplifier<00:01:23.460> really<00:01:23.880> excels

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.150 

you<00:01:48.570> notice<00:01:48.870> that<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.110> doesn't<00:01:49.290> compress<00:01:49.920> too

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
you notice that it doesn't compress too

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.650 
you notice that it doesn't compress too
much<00:01:50.370> like<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.670> lot<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.120> tea<00:01:51.270> channel

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
much like a lot of tea channel

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.600 
much like a lot of tea channel
amplifiers<00:01:52.110> I'm<00:01:52.260> gonna<00:01:52.440> play<00:01:53.040> again<00:01:53.370> and<00:01:53.550> I'm

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
amplifiers I'm gonna play again and I'm

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:20.660 
amplifiers I'm gonna play again and I'm
gonna<00:01:53.730> hit<00:01:53.940> that<00:01:54.150> boost<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.660> it

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.600 

pretty<00:02:21.270> you<00:02:21.810> know<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.830> thing<00:02:23.069> about<00:02:23.100> it<00:02:23.490> is

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
pretty you know the thing about it is

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.840 
pretty you know the thing about it is
that<00:02:23.780> with<00:02:24.780> this<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.140> rock<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:26.100> 12<00:02:26.370> open<00:02:26.700> back

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
that with this to rock to 12 open back

now what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.839 
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
bring<00:02:59.709> the<00:02:59.890> output<00:03:00.280> section<00:03:00.519> of<00:03:00.760> the

bring the output section of the

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:33.210 
bring the output section of the
amplifier<00:03:01.330> up<00:03:01.510> a<00:03:01.629> little<00:03:01.810> bit

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.550 

there<00:03:34.060> you<00:03:34.150> hear<00:03:34.270> the<00:03:34.330> output<00:03:34.810> section<00:03:35.230> of<00:03:35.500> the

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.080 
amplifier starting to take over a little
bit<00:03:37.570> and<00:03:38.500> you<00:03:38.740> still<00:03:38.980> get<00:03:39.070> plenty<00:03:39.340> of<00:03:39.460> gain<00:03:39.760> you

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
bit and you still get plenty of gain you

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.180 
bit and you still get plenty of gain you
just<00:03:40.270> get<00:03:40.420> a<00:03:40.450> little<00:03:40.630> bit<00:03:40.720> more<00:03:41.020> definition<00:03:41.200> so

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
just get a little bit more definition so

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.880 
just get a little bit more definition so
you<00:03:42.810> can<00:03:43.810> run<00:03:44.020> this<00:03:44.110> amplifier<00:03:44.590> with<00:03:44.800> the

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
you can run this amplifier with the

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.220 
you can run this amplifier with the
preamp<00:03:45.280> all<00:03:45.490> the<00:03:45.640> way<00:03:45.760> up<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.180> get<00:03:46.360> really

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
preamp all the way up and get really

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.440 
preamp all the way up and get really
nice<00:03:47.440> preamp<00:03:47.980> distortion<00:03:48.580> without<00:03:48.670> too<00:03:49.270> much

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
nice preamp distortion without too much

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.260 
nice preamp distortion without too much
compression<00:03:49.990> or<00:03:50.590> you<00:03:51.160> can<00:03:51.340> run<00:03:51.550> the<00:03:51.670> master<00:03:52.120> up

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
compression or you can run the master up

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.740 
compression or you can run the master up
in<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.570> game<00:03:52.780> back<00:03:53.110> and<00:03:53.470> get<00:03:53.770> really<00:03:54.070> nice

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
in the game back and get really nice

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.390 
in the game back and get really nice
combination<00:03:55.750> of<00:03:55.840> both<00:03:56.020> so<00:03:56.500> this<00:03:57.100> is<00:03:57.280> the

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
combination of both so this is the

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.080 
combination of both so this is the
biotics<00:03:58.000> it's<00:03:58.210> it's<00:03:58.750> really<00:03:59.560> affordable

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
biotics it's it's really affordable

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.940 
biotics it's it's really affordable
