showing<00:03:14.500> you<00:03:14.710> how<00:03:15.220> much<00:03:15.490> of<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.760> disk<00:03:16.710> writing

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
showing you how much of the disk writing

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:23.850 
showing you how much of the disk writing
process<00:03:18.130> has<00:03:18.310> been<00:03:18.520> completed<00:03:22.680> once<00:03:23.680> it's

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.940 

after<00:03:35.040> writing<00:03:35.220> then<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:35.970> disc<00:03:36.150> is<00:03:36.330> finalized

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
after writing then the disc is finalized

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.410 
after writing then the disc is finalized
which<00:03:37.950> basically<00:03:38.160> means<00:03:38.580> it's<00:03:38.819> being<00:03:39.090> made

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
which basically means it's being made
