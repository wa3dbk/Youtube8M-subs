00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:18.110
 for all social networks but then 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.110
 the most extensive in this class 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.519
 has advanced that I sent you previously 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.019
 that it was a Cuban comparsa here what 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.090
 let's make a variation towards 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:34.290
 Monte and explained the same key to 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:39.899
 left foot and the same left band 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:42.940
 than the previous one and we're going to mix it with 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.850
 rhythms and more progressive 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.350
 to inspire you to create something new 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.600
 that is always in the market what is 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:54.539
 is looking for then let's see how 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.539
 the other one would remain 1 2 3 4 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:07.490
 I'm assigning the rebars is called 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.619
 progressive metal and in this case 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.550
 following more coming all the base of 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.550
 what is now 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.330
 the only one based on the Cuban comparsa 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.080
 is touching with the right hand a third 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.360
 complete as follows she 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.830
 they fit with the drum in the bid and the 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.780
 tresillo with the establishing comparsa 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.340
 cuban space I'm going to say the 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.030
 variation that says in this rhythm that is 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.690
 more fateful to me let's see 123 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.690
 spaces 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.370
 now with him is the last rhythm 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.490
 right hand would not tica that 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.330
 also as follows one two 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.330
 three four 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.870
