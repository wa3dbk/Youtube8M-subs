 different and I know how to kill the league with 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.109
 God, I told my brothers and sisters who 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.609
 it seems good to you I was there 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.470
 I must thank for the guest always 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.329
 I do it every year even though I do not 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.190
 I had a nomination this year they had the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.020
 courtesy of inviting me and that I can 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.570
 say I see some awards that are 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.690
 evolving I have already been in several in 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.000
 several years in the award and I see that they go 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.610
 improving as everything also mistakes me 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.620
 understand there are things mistakes of the three and 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.570
 eye part tips for you good 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.100
 instead of really you know me I do not 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.899
 like to criticize the work of others 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.270
 but there was only one thing there 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.010
 in particular, how can I tell you 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.950
 I found him out of the place he understands me 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.010
 a male with little which it was 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:08.310
 a new bread with a boric theme without 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.930
 boricuas brothers criticize you 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.930
 you know they do their job very well but I 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.110
 I understand I understand that some awards 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.090
 of Dominican urban music where in a 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.370
 country where there is so much music with quality 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.440
 how is this should have done the 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.660
 opening with a Dominican song like 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.640
 send the rule you felt offended you 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.290
 as a Dominican urban artist to me 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.710
 little hurt this genre in axel me 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.960
 understand I have more than 10 years of career 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.670
 professional and at street level and trot 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.110
 I'm over 15 years old in this, I 'm a 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.080
 gender to me anything that you 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.090
 happens to me it hurts but that does not take away the 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.350
 positive things that happened there you know 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.300
 you can not say that everything was negative 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.369
 on the contrary there were many many 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.660
 positive but I understand that it is one of 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.360
 the little things that should be 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.770
 take into account not not so very out 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.200
 of place 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.240
 like I give you a whole red pint 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.300
 red everywhere but I put the 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.130
 rebel blue light cap or something like that 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.899
 I took everything was very good for that 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.670
 little part of the truth that was the fly in 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.039
 I think milk should be made 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.940
 a car or a Dominican song 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.470
 take advantage to congratulate 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.790
 to all the work team that I work 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.340
 there because out of that little mistake 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.380
 all was fine azcona stole the 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.690
 show and the people of telemicro always 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.100
 breaking but for the next but 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:25.230
 listen better to don miguelo 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:28.890
 killing me but fine but of course yes 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.990
 but it is very very very successful and its 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.580
 answer or be your point of view since 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.990
 many criticized on the good side I did not 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.760
 I had realized that, you understand me 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.870
 I particularly realized since I 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.790
 I listened 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.240
 the opening everyone knows how we 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.980
 awarded the opening as the maximum 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.720
 devotion what everyone expects what 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.060
 I thought the first impression what's going on 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.430
 exactly then it is about the 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.320
 awards of Dominican music or of 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.090
 these new artists that come 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:04.050
 going up as they are typical we have here 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.910
 in my mega culture we have bulova wolf 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.510
 among other boys who come 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.160
 climbing which of these artists do you think 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.490
 that which you see more as more 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.490
 international projection good 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.050
 I can tell you another you know that 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.760
 the boys how are they telling me 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.800
 manipulated that my favorites are what 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.750
 I said in several interviews and both 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.090
 they're going over the line more rap in 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.670
 store just as I have done since 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.110
 my beginnings as and many artists I 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.150
 I understand that it is true in moments 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.360
 when the boys mature 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.580
 artistically and and understand the business 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.960
 they are among those who are going to have the most potential 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.640
 perhaps internationally because 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.740
 unquestionably they have a very pretty parrot 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.390
 strong and have what the slight brightness or 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:50.150
 the brightness I see the TV I see the 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.150
 hungry I see you as I tell you the neighborhood 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.800
 I had the bed
