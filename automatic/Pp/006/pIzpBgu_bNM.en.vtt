nick labs and look at that I didn't have

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.720 
nick labs and look at that I didn't have
to<00:00:21.630> finish<00:00:21.779> several<00:00:22.500> people<00:00:22.550> resilient<00:00:23.550> lot

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
to finish several people resilient lot

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.910 
to finish several people resilient lot
of<00:00:23.820> people<00:00:24.029> forget<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:24.990> if<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.470> remember<00:00:25.769> one

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
of people forget so if you remember one

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.170 
of people forget so if you remember one
of<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.070> things<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.550> couple<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.910> things<00:00:27.060> that

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
of the things a couple of things that

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.240 
of the things a couple of things that
she<00:00:27.330> said<00:00:27.480> was<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.660> problem<00:00:27.869> was<00:00:28.199> working<00:00:29.099> in

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
she said was a problem was working in

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.609 
she said was a problem was working in
teams<00:00:29.490> was<00:00:29.849> an<00:00:29.939> issue<00:00:30.060> because<00:00:30.869> there<00:00:31.230> was<00:00:31.380> no

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
teams was an issue because there was no

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.110 
teams was an issue because there was no
easy<00:00:31.830> way<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.070> really<00:00:32.489> share<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.790> changes

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
easy way to really share the changes

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.190 
easy way to really share the changes
between<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.450> two<00:00:33.570> unless<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.960> would<00:00:34.079> they

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
between the two unless you would they

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.100 
between the two unless you would they
were<00:00:34.290> actually<00:00:34.469> working<00:00:34.800> on<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.160> live<00:00:35.520> system

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
were actually working on a live system

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.090 
were actually working on a live system
also<00:00:37.110> one<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.559> problems<00:00:37.829> we<00:00:37.950> had<00:00:38.070> with

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
also one of the problems we had with

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.770 
also one of the problems we had with
that<00:00:38.250> system<00:00:38.579> was<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.570> couldn't

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
that system was that you couldn't

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.750 
that system was that you couldn't
actually<00:00:40.079> preview<00:00:41.010> what<00:00:41.340> something<00:00:41.670> would

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
actually preview what something would

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.959 
actually preview what something would
look<00:00:41.910> like<00:00:42.030> until<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.719> published<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.440> live

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
look like until you published it live

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.850 
look like until you published it live
that<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.239> if<00:00:45.570> there<00:00:45.780> was<00:00:45.899> no<00:00:46.410> good<00:00:46.680> way<00:00:46.829> to

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
that and if there was no good way to

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.979 
that and if there was no good way to
actually<00:00:47.280> try<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.090> change<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.570> whole<00:00:48.660> bunch<00:00:48.899> of

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
actually try to change a whole bunch of

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.600 
actually try to change a whole bunch of
pages<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.590> see<00:00:49.829> what<00:00:49.950> they<00:00:50.039> all<00:00:50.190> look<00:00:50.579> like

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
pages and see what they all look like

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.910 
pages and see what they all look like
before<00:00:51.510> deciding<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.930> publish<00:00:52.289> them<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.710> I

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
before deciding to publish them so I

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.380 
before deciding to publish them so I
want<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.640> talk<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:53.940> about<00:00:54.030> what<00:00:54.270> we've

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
want to talk to you about what we've

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.130 
want to talk to you about what we've
replaced<00:00:54.690> all<00:00:54.989> those<00:00:55.320> sites<00:00:55.559> with<00:00:55.800> since<00:00:56.550> then

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
replaced all those sites with since then

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.860 
replaced all those sites with since then
radiant<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.230> gone<00:00:58.760> and<00:00:59.760> that<00:01:00.210> was<00:01:00.359> sort<00:01:00.780> of

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
radiant is gone and that was sort of

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.070 
radiant is gone and that was sort of
going<00:01:01.050> really<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:02.100> guess<00:01:03.090> simplistic<00:01:03.870> and

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
going really I guess simplistic and

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.870 
going really I guess simplistic and
doing<00:01:04.409> just<00:01:04.439> static<00:01:05.040> websites<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.519> all<00:01:05.670> those

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
doing just static websites so all those

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.280 
doing just static websites so all those
websites<00:01:06.090> now<00:01:06.390> are<00:01:06.479> just<00:01:06.659> static<00:01:06.900> websites

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
websites now are just static websites

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.950 
websites now are just static websites
but<00:01:07.470> using<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.280> tool<00:01:08.460> called<00:01:08.520> Nanak<00:01:09.060> which<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.930> a

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
but using a tool called Nanak which is a

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.390 
but using a tool called Nanak which is a
ruby<00:01:10.170> tool<00:01:10.409> for<00:01:10.619> doing<00:01:10.680> static<00:01:11.070> website

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
ruby tool for doing static website

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.700 
ruby tool for doing static website
generation<00:01:12.150> which<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.420> pretty<00:01:12.540> cool<00:01:12.720> just

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
generation which is pretty cool just

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.109 
generation which is pretty cool just
jump<00:01:13.830> right<00:01:13.920> into<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.310> project<00:01:15.380> so<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:17.189> nanak

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
jump right into this project so in nanak

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.219 
jump right into this project so in nanak
you<00:01:18.240> have<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> couple<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.750> things<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:19.080> have

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
you have a couple of things you have

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.810 
you have a couple of things you have
resources<00:01:19.770> which<00:01:20.040> live<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.460> content

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
resources which live in this content

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.789 
resources which live in this content
directory<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.600> these<00:01:22.049> are<00:01:22.170> all<00:01:22.200> called<00:01:22.470> items

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
directory and these are all called items

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.830 
directory and these are all called items
and<00:01:23.040> essentially<00:01:23.880> all<00:01:24.000> nanak<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.420> doing<00:01:24.659> is

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
and essentially all nanak is doing is

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.320 
and essentially all nanak is doing is
taking<00:01:25.320> all<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.619> those<00:01:25.770> items<00:01:26.330> transforming

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
taking all of those items transforming

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.090 
taking all of those items transforming
them<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:27.540> some<00:01:27.720> way<00:01:27.869> perhaps<00:01:28.500> laying<00:01:28.829> them<00:01:29.009> out

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
them in some way perhaps laying them out

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.190 
them in some way perhaps laying them out
and<00:01:29.280> nested<00:01:29.729> structures<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.390> then<00:01:30.990> putting

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
and nested structures and then putting

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.480 
and nested structures and then putting
them<00:01:31.350> into<00:01:31.560> some<00:01:31.829> kind<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.070> directory

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
them into some kind of directory

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.149 
them into some kind of directory
structure<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.030> along<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.259> along<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.920> path

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
structure and along the along that path

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.280 
structure and along the along that path
you<00:01:35.460> can<00:01:35.490> pretty<00:01:35.790> much<00:01:35.880> do<00:01:36.540> anything<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:37.079> want

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
you can pretty much do anything you want

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.340 
you can pretty much do anything you want
so<00:01:38.180> everything<00:01:39.180> happens<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.780> rules<00:01:40.079> file

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
so everything happens in this rules file

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.649 
so everything happens in this rules file
that's<00:01:40.770> right<00:01:40.890> here<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.939> there's<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.540> couple

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
that's right here and there's a couple

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.090 
that's right here and there's a couple
of<00:01:42.810> steps<00:01:42.930> there's<00:01:43.200> compile<00:01:43.530> steps<00:01:43.860> and

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
of steps there's compile steps and

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.280 
of steps there's compile steps and
there's<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.700> routing<00:01:44.970> steps<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:46.110> in<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
there's a routing steps so in the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.840 
there's a routing steps so in the
compile<00:01:46.590> steps<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.070> where<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.310> basically<00:01:47.520> what

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
compile steps is where it basically what

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.039 
compile steps is where it basically what
you're<00:01:47.939> saying<00:01:48.000> what<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.659> want<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.840> do<00:01:48.930> with

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
you're saying what you want to do with

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.380 
you're saying what you want to do with
your<00:01:49.079> input<00:01:49.500> files<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.430> initially<00:01:50.909> at<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.180> top

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
your input files so initially at the top

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.420 
your input files so initially at the top
where<00:01:51.960> all<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.259> static<00:01:52.500> files<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:52.979> CSS

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
where all the static files so CSS

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.580 
where all the static files so CSS
JavaScript<00:01:54.090> images<00:01:54.479> you're<00:01:55.350> not<00:01:55.470> doing

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
JavaScript images you're not doing

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.899 
JavaScript images you're not doing
anything<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.130> you're<00:01:56.219> just<00:01:56.310> directly

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
anything so you're just directly

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.340 
anything so you're just directly
translating<00:01:57.420> them<00:01:57.540> right<00:01:57.719> through<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.290> you

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
translating them right through so you

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.200 
translating them right through so you
don't<00:01:58.469> want<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.649> process<00:01:58.799> them<00:01:59.070> at<00:01:59.189> all<00:01:59.280> I'll

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
don't want to process them at all I'll

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.520 
don't want to process them at all I'll
skip<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.600> blog<00:02:00.810> feed<00:02:01.049> because<00:02:01.200> that's<00:02:01.439> a

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
skip the blog feed because that's a

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.410 
skip the blog feed because that's a
special<00:02:01.890> case<00:02:02.040> but<00:02:02.280> down<00:02:02.790> here<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.119> go<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.299> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
special case but down here you go to the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.510 
special case but down here you go to the
ball<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.840> blog<00:02:04.049> entries<00:02:04.500> it's<00:02:04.979> doing<00:02:05.310> some

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
ball the blog entries it's doing some

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.039 
ball the blog entries it's doing some
fancy<00:02:05.820> coding<00:02:06.119> in<00:02:06.210> here<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:06.630> all<00:02:06.659> it's

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
fancy coding in here and so all it's

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.330 
fancy coding in here and so all it's
really<00:02:07.259> doing<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.560> going<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.829> take<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.039> look<00:02:08.190> at

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
really doing is going to take a look at

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.400 
really doing is going to take a look at
the<00:02:08.429> extension<00:02:08.789> on<00:02:09.420> any<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.840> files<00:02:10.020> in<00:02:10.319> the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
the extension on any of the files in the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.199 
the extension on any of the files in the
blog<00:02:10.590> folder<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.039> based<00:02:11.640> on<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.910> extension

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
blog folder and based on the extension

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.340 
blog folder and based on the extension
it's<00:02:12.450> going<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.629> run<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:12.930> through

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
it's going to run it through

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.410 
it's going to run it through
different<00:02:13.740> kinds<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.130> filters<00:02:14.430> so<00:02:15.090> you'll<00:02:15.240> see

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
different kinds of filters so you'll see

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.810 
different kinds of filters so you'll see
here<00:02:15.450> is<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.750> filter<00:02:15.990> er<00:02:16.740> be<00:02:16.920> filter<00:02:17.280> for

markdown<00:02:32.010> processing<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:33.600> can<00:02:33.750> pretty

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
markdown processing so you can pretty

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.090 
markdown processing so you can pretty
much<00:02:33.960> put<00:02:34.170> any<00:02:34.320> format<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:34.770> want<00:02:34.860> in<00:02:34.980> there

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
much put any format you want in there

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.350 
much put any format you want in there
and<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.310> just<00:02:35.340> write<00:02:35.640> rules<00:02:35.880> for<00:02:36.240> how<00:02:36.300> you

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
and you just write rules for how you

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.200 
and you just write rules for how you
want<00:02:36.570> to<00:02:36.600> process<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.320> then<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.550> will<00:02:38.970> skip

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
want to process it and then I will skip

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.920 
want to process it and then I will skip
down<00:02:40.250> if<00:02:41.250> you<00:02:41.490> also<00:02:41.640> have<00:02:41.850> layout<00:02:42.180> things<00:02:42.480> so

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
down if you also have layout things so

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.390 
down if you also have layout things so
you<00:02:42.960> process<00:02:43.410> all<00:02:43.530> these<00:02:43.710> all<00:02:44.010> these<00:02:44.040> files

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
you process all these all these files

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.560 
you process all these all these files
and<00:02:44.670> then<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:44.880> can<00:02:44.970> put<00:02:45.150> them<00:02:45.240> in<00:02:45.330> a<00:02:45.390> layout

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
and then you can put them in a layout

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.630 
and then you can put them in a layout
which<00:02:45.930> is<00:02:46.050> much<00:02:46.290> like<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.470> template<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.010> in<00:02:47.460> any

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
which is much like a template and in any

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.540 
which is much like a template and in any
kind<00:02:47.880> of<00:02:47.990> web<00:02:48.990> development<00:02:49.350> framework<00:02:49.710> and

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
kind of web development framework and

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.060 
kind of web development framework and
then<00:02:50.670> when<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:50.820> get<00:02:50.910> down<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.180> routing

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
then when you get down to the routing

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.990 
then when you get down to the routing
essentially<00:02:53.070> those<00:02:53.220> files<00:02:53.490> in<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.910> directory

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
essentially those files in the directory

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.200 
essentially those files in the directory
structure<00:02:54.540> that<00:02:54.660> you<00:02:54.810> have<00:02:55.020> up<00:02:55.350> here<00:02:56.000> in<00:02:57.000> the

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
structure that you have up here in the

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.550 
structure that you have up here in the
content<00:02:57.600> does<00:02:57.720> not<00:02:57.930> have<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.290> be<00:02:58.350> the

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
content does not have to be the

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.870 
content does not have to be the
directory<00:02:58.890> structure<00:02:59.190> that<00:02:59.310> they<00:02:59.460> end<00:02:59.640> up<00:02:59.790> in

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
directory structure that they end up in

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.150 
directory structure that they end up in
so<00:03:00.600> that's<00:03:00.990> what<00:03:01.200> all<00:03:01.380> of<00:03:01.410> these<00:03:01.590> route<00:03:01.830> things

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
so that's what all of these route things

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.270 
so that's what all of these route things
do<00:03:02.370> is<00:03:02.610> essentially<00:03:03.620> construct<00:03:04.620> some<00:03:04.950> string

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
do is essentially construct some string

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.430 
do is essentially construct some string
that<00:03:05.490> you<00:03:05.610> want<00:03:05.850> that<00:03:06.150> processed<00:03:06.900> entity<00:03:07.290> to

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
that you want that processed entity to

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.770 
that you want that processed entity to
live<00:03:07.620> at<00:03:07.770> when<00:03:08.160> you're<00:03:08.280> done<00:03:08.310> so<00:03:09.030> up<00:03:09.720> here

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
live at when you're done so up here

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.360 
live at when you're done so up here
you'll<00:03:10.080> see<00:03:10.110> we<00:03:10.620> have<00:03:10.740> content<00:03:11.130> folder

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
you'll see we have content folder

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.220 
you'll see we have content folder
there's<00:03:11.640> a<00:03:11.700> blog<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.150> then<00:03:12.300> there's<00:03:12.450> five<00:03:13.080> or

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
okay and then we have some other static

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.130 
okay and then we have some other static
pages<00:03:22.230> here<00:03:22.670> and<00:03:23.670> I<00:03:23.850> will<00:03:23.970> flip<00:03:24.390> over<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.690> nanak

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
pages here and I will flip over to nanak

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.380 
pages here and I will flip over to nanak
here<00:03:25.350> and<00:03:25.730> there's<00:03:26.730> nothing<00:03:26.850> in<00:03:27.060> my<00:03:27.090> output

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
here and there's nothing in my output

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.580 
here and there's nothing in my output
directory<00:03:27.660> now<00:03:27.870> okay<00:03:28.790> just<00:03:29.790> run<00:03:30.590> Nanak

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
directory now okay just run Nanak

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.040 
directory now okay just run Nanak
compile<00:03:32.210> it's<00:03:33.210> going<00:03:33.390> to<00:03:33.420> basically<00:03:33.570> run<00:03:33.930> all

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
compile it's going to basically run all

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.300 
compile it's going to basically run all
those<00:03:34.200> compilation<00:03:34.710> rules<00:03:34.920> run<00:03:35.130> all<00:03:35.220> those

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
those compilation rules run all those

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.800 
those compilation rules run all those
the<00:03:35.430> layout<00:03:35.670> rules<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:36.120> generate<00:03:36.420> a<00:03:36.510> site<00:03:36.720> in

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
the layout rules and generate a site in

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.900 
the layout rules and generate a site in
the<00:03:36.870> end<00:03:37.050> so<00:03:37.920> now<00:03:38.070> if<00:03:38.160> we<00:03:38.220> look<00:03:38.280> it<00:03:38.490> out<00:03:38.610> but<00:03:38.820> we

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
the end so now if we look it out but we

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.480 
the end so now if we look it out but we
have<00:03:39.030> lots<00:03:39.300> of<00:03:39.450> stuff<00:03:39.570> and<00:03:40.500> if<00:03:40.770> we<00:03:40.800> actually

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
have lots of stuff and if we actually

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:47.000 
have lots of stuff and if we actually
just<00:03:41.520> come<00:03:41.820> over<00:03:41.910> here<00:03:45.230> do<00:03:46.230> auto<00:03:46.410> compile<00:03:46.830> so

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
just come over here do auto compile so

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.990 
just come over here do auto compile so
if<00:03:47.100> we<00:03:47.160> want<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:47.340> change<00:03:47.520> something<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:47.970> just

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
if we want to change something it just

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.510 
if we want to change something it just
automatically<00:03:48.540> picks<00:03:48.810> it<00:03:48.930> up<00:03:48.990> and<00:03:49.200> if<00:03:50.040> we<00:03:50.220> flip

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
automatically picks it up and if we flip

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.510 
automatically picks it up and if we flip
over<00:03:50.820> here<00:03:55.100> essentially<00:03:56.100> this<00:03:56.160> is<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.340> same

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
over here essentially this is the same

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.100 
over here essentially this is the same
site<00:03:56.760> that<00:03:56.940> we<00:03:57.000> used<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.210> have<00:03:57.360> only<00:03:57.870> it's<00:03:58.020> all

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
site that we used to have only it's all

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.690 
site that we used to have only it's all
static<00:03:58.470> content<00:03:58.650> generation<00:03:59.130> and<00:03:59.430> I<00:03:59.490> want<00:03:59.640> to

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
static content generation and I want to

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.160 
static content generation and I want to
show<00:03:59.790> you<00:03:59.850> a<00:03:59.910> couple<00:04:00.030> of<00:04:00.210> things<00:04:00.240> that<00:04:00.600> you

might<00:04:01.290> be<00:04:01.350> wondering<00:04:01.560> about<00:04:01.740> features<00:04:02.180> okay

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
might be wondering about features okay

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.720 
might be wondering about features okay
there's<00:04:03.420> no<00:04:03.830> if<00:04:04.830> you<00:04:04.920> look<00:04:05.070> at<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.220> URL<00:04:05.340> it's

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
there's no if you look at the URL it's

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.160 
there's no if you look at the URL it's
got<00:04:05.880> this<00:04:06.000> nice<00:04:06.180> you<00:04:06.360> roll<00:04:06.510> of<00:04:06.570> just<00:04:06.810> plain<00:04:06.990> old

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
features so how did it actually do that

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.940 
features so how did it actually do that
because<00:04:09.680> in<00:04:10.680> here<00:04:11.130> we<00:04:11.250> have<00:04:11.460> a<00:04:11.490> features<00:04:12.120> HTML

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
because in here we have a features HTML

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.110 
because in here we have a features HTML
what<00:04:13.950> kind<00:04:14.130> of<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:14.250> cool<00:04:14.430> thing<00:04:14.640> in<00:04:14.850> the<00:04:15.000> way

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
what kind of the cool thing in the way

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.310 
what kind of the cool thing in the way
it<00:04:15.210> processes<00:04:15.750> these<00:04:15.900> files<00:04:16.170> is<00:04:17.450> down

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
it processes these files is down

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.070 
it processes these files is down
we<00:04:19.560> have<00:04:19.740> a<00:04:19.770> folder<00:04:20.190> called<00:04:20.430> features<00:04:21.120> and<00:04:21.840> who

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
we have a folder called features and who

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.420 
we have a folder called features and who
wants<00:04:22.230> to<00:04:22.290> guess<00:04:22.440> what<00:04:22.680> file<00:04:23.010> is<00:04:23.160> in<00:04:23.310> that

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
wants to guess what file is in that

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.500 
wants to guess what file is in that
features<00:04:24.120> folder<00:04:25.160> indexed<00:04:26.160> I've<00:04:26.250> HTML<00:04:26.760> so

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
features folder indexed I've HTML so

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.540 
features folder indexed I've HTML so
it's<00:04:28.260> pretty<00:04:28.440> neat<00:04:28.680> way<00:04:28.800> you<00:04:28.860> can<00:04:29.160> keep<00:04:29.340> these

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
it's pretty neat way you can keep these

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.100 
it's pretty neat way you can keep these
really<00:04:29.820> clean<00:04:30.030> nice<00:04:30.270> URLs<00:04:30.690> which<00:04:30.900> actually

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
really clean nice URLs which actually

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.590 
really clean nice URLs which actually
are<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:31.410> exact<00:04:31.770> same<00:04:31.950> URLs<00:04:32.370> we<00:04:32.520> had<00:04:32.670> before<00:04:32.850> so

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
are the exact same URLs we had before so

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.760 
are the exact same URLs we had before so
if<00:04:33.720> there<00:04:33.870> are<00:04:33.930> any<00:04:34.020> links<00:04:34.350> to<00:04:34.440> these<00:04:34.560> pages

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
if there are any links to these pages

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.640 
if there are any links to these pages
they've<00:04:35.490> been<00:04:35.610> maintained<00:04:36.120> and<00:04:36.380> then<00:04:37.380> all<00:04:37.620> of

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
they've been maintained and then all of

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.020 
they've been maintained and then all of
the<00:04:37.980> blog<00:04:38.400> output<00:04:38.990> you'll<00:04:39.990> see<00:04:40.170> before<00:04:40.530> it<00:04:40.680> had

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
the blog output you'll see before it had

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.980 
the blog output you'll see before it had
up<00:04:42.030> here<00:04:42.240> you<00:04:42.330> see<00:04:42.480> them<00:04:42.600> you<00:04:42.660> know<00:04:42.750> they<00:04:42.780> were

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
up here you see them you know they were

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.290 
up here you see them you know they were
just<00:04:43.170> essentially<00:04:43.770> in<00:04:43.950> one<00:04:44.640> directory<00:04:44.760> with

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
just essentially in one directory with

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.060 
just essentially in one directory with
date<00:04:45.540> strings<00:04:45.870> and<00:04:46.140> now<00:04:46.350> we've<00:04:46.500> got<00:04:46.680> this<00:04:46.830> nice

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
date strings and now we've got this nice

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.380 
date strings and now we've got this nice
sort<00:04:47.430> of<00:04:47.490> directory<00:04:47.940> hierarchy<00:04:50.000> here<00:04:51.000> these

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
sort of directory hierarchy here these

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.260 
sort of directory hierarchy here these
output<00:04:51.750> files<00:04:51.960> and<00:04:52.650> eventually<00:04:53.550> we<00:04:53.580> yanked

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
output files and eventually we yanked

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
output files and eventually we yanked
off<00:04:54.390> the<00:04:55.020> string<00:04:55.320> for<00:04:55.560> the<00:04:55.680> folder<00:04:56.430> name<00:04:56.460> and

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
off the string for the folder name and

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.250 
off the string for the folder name and
then<00:04:58.290> there's<00:04:58.500> also<00:04:58.560> some<00:04:59.130> nice<00:04:59.970> some<00:05:00.330> helpers

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
then there's also some nice some helpers

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.090 
then there's also some nice some helpers
that<00:05:01.290> also<00:05:01.950> exists<00:05:02.310> in<00:05:02.640> Nanak<00:05:03.270> and<00:05:04.100> that's
