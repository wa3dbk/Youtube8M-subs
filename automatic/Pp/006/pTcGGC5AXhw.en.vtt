00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:18.460
 Thank you. 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:37.360
 First, let's observe the animal cells 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.360
 Name September movie Scrape the epithelium product this time 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.080
 That's the epithelial cells on a glass slide shows a well cover road Vallarta 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.220
 Because it is animal cell, please drop methylene blue solution to dye 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.920
 Cover glass at 45 degrees and mix well. 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.920
 Do not be happy. 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:36.579
 I made the preprites, so let's take a look at the microscope. 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:40.680
 First , let's center it through the lowest magnification 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:40.680
 Brighten the field of view with a reflector 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:53.240
 When children sleep next to him and then raise the intensity Lazarus seedling 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.240
 Place the dyed animal cells. 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:03.979
 Next time, you can not do it. 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.979
 It shows off the barrel 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.929
 Then I looked up at ng twice and hit the prizes 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.710
 If you see it in between, it will focus on the correct screw 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.650
 I did this. I was able to observe animal cells . 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.150
 Another strength 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:09.480
 So far I have observed animal cells. 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:12.030
 When the epithelial cells were observed, the epithelial cells had rounded nuclei without original shape 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.120
 Dyed and dyed. 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:19.310
 In the event of some erroneous eradication 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.310
 May be observed in fragmented form 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:29.599
 The largest of the cells that can be seen in the urine is the yolk of the ostrich. 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:34.390
 Animal cells are not new, and their shape is not constant. 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.390
 The color-dyed part is the nucleus of animal cells.
