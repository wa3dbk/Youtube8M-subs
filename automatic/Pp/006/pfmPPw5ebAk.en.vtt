00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.909
 but a separate Volkswagen environment life 

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:15.789
 it's called BlueMotion and with it the models of their respective class

 drives 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.890
 they do the same 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.890
 but consume less 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.829

 even if that is not achieved in practice 111 points only 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.300
 Rare 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.090

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.670
 and also the Passat becomes mobile as bluemotion models 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.890
 Considerable 1 4 times 1 liter per 100 kilometers should be saved 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.100
 the Passat is available as a BlueMotion both as a sedan and as a station wagon for 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.270
 both pay in Germany 1000 375 euros more compared to the 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.090
 Normal version without consumption optimization 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.810
 but not everyone likes to drive a diesel and many want more leeway in the 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.390

 bluemotion models with a significant difference they feature 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.810
 not about the newly developed especially fuel efficient engines but for 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.690

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.450
 Additional package a good alternative 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.689
 for the Sharan the technology package costs only 150 euros extra for this one can 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.570
