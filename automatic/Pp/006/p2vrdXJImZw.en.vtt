respective<00:02:03.000> lease<00:02:04.000> holders<00:02:04.899> I<00:02:05.049> guess

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
respective lease holders I guess

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.330

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
and it gives a certain feel to which I

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.850 
and it gives a certain feel to which I
think<00:02:09.970> it<00:02:10.210> looks<00:02:10.450> it<00:02:11.140> makes<00:02:11.560> it<00:02:11.710> look<00:02:11.830> pretty
