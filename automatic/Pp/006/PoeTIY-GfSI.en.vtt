the parchment paper that I have is that

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.610 
the parchment paper that I have is that
kind<00:02:10.180> that's<00:02:10.390> got<00:02:10.570> aluminum<00:02:11.020> foil<00:02:11.320> on<00:02:11.470> the

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.940 
kind that's got aluminum foil on the
back<00:02:11.800> and<00:02:12.610> I'm<00:02:13.540> not<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.810> real<00:02:14.020> fan<00:02:14.380> of<00:02:14.710> that

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
back and I'm not a real fan of that

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.920 
back and I'm not a real fan of that
unless<00:02:15.370> I<00:02:15.670> just<00:02:16.180> didn't<00:02:16.360> even<00:02:16.450> think<00:02:16.570> about<00:02:16.720> it

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
unless I just didn't even think about it

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.270 
unless I just didn't even think about it
I<00:02:16.990> should<00:02:17.140> have<00:02:17.200> just<00:02:17.350> cut<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.680> square<00:02:18.250> with

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
I should have just cut it square with

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.080 
I should have just cut it square with
the<00:02:18.520> bottom<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:18.940> pan<00:02:19.210> so<00:02:20.020> if<00:02:20.410> you<00:02:21.060> use<00:02:22.060> that

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
the bottom of the pan so if you use that

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.390 
the bottom of the pan so if you use that
kind<00:02:22.660> don't<00:02:23.230> make<00:02:23.410> it<00:02:23.530> go<00:02:23.650> up<00:02:23.740> over<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:23.980> edges

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
kind don't make it go up over the edges

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.190 
kind don't make it go up over the edges
because<00:02:24.700> it<00:02:24.820> tends<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.180> curl<00:02:25.570> and<00:02:25.810> you<00:02:25.900> can<00:02:26.050> see

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
because it tends to curl and you can see

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.810 
because it tends to curl and you can see
it<00:02:26.290> curled<00:02:26.530> in<00:02:26.710> on<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:27.010> one<00:02:27.160> but<00:02:27.310> that's<00:02:27.430> okay

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
it curled in on that one but that's okay

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.340 
it curled in on that one but that's okay
if<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.180> doesn't<00:02:28.240> look<00:02:28.540> good<00:02:28.660> I'll<00:02:28.840> just<00:02:29.050> eat<00:02:29.230> it

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
if it doesn't look good I'll just eat it

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.190 
if it doesn't look good I'll just eat it
with<00:02:29.440> a<00:02:29.470> cup<00:02:29.650> of<00:02:29.770> tea<00:02:29.860> when<00:02:30.040> I'm<00:02:30.190> done<00:02:30.310> so<00:02:31.200> these
