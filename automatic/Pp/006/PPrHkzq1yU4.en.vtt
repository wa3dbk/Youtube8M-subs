00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.319
 hello I am Vicente in a park artist 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.700
 conceptual equal with influence on this 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.620
 series of videos I will explain from 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.469
 different tips to be able to take advantage of your 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.570
 tablet intuos this tablet is the line 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.460
 basic of wacom and the idea is to be able 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.919
 make the most of this tutorial 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.679
 we are going to dedicate to the design of heads 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:24.300
 let's go through basic structure and 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:27.140
 then we will enter the part of 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.000
 welcome design 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.329
 let's start this exercise 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.150
 defining basic proportions and 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:38.180
 obviously I recommend you look at books 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:41.000
 specialized anatomy to see 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.670
 what are they like the true structure 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.280
 anatomical head that has a head 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.010
 real to what he mentioned obviously 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.079
 because these are some tests 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.480
 simply designed for you to have 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.909
 a guide when you want to explore the 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.300
 design of a character's head already 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.829
 be cartoon or be real so with these 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.009
 first you want me to be establishing 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:07.490
 here that are the front and the part 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:09.500
 lateral and then jumped into view three 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.080
 rooms where he defines that same line of 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.509
 center and two other sidelines that 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.390
 they will help me to mark those that 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.539
 can be the cheekbones and tried to define 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.789
 to geometries that are part of the 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:25.160
 nose the ears where they will be 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.649
 located and these guides are also going to 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.840
 turn into a very good help when 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.650
 you want to place the hair when you want and 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.110
 all 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.140
 it's also a way I can 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.240
 contemplate exaggerating these proportions 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.680
 another thing that I like to keep in mind 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.760
 when I'm doing these exercises 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:48.760
 and how can you find out I start with 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:51.340
 some heads that are designed from my 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.170
 but obviously imagination is always 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.910
 the study of real life really one 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.190
 of the exercises that I recommend too 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.320
 is the observation exercise if you can 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.810
 say a few sessions as a model 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.820
 perfect if you can go to a cafe and 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.460
 draw people and understand their 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.340
 Anatomical structure is pretty good 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.170
 although maybe for time if the person 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.520
 is moving too much be a little 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.680
 complicated to grasp its essence 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.860
 then we have the resource of the photos 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.740
 where you can take some time to 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.500
 analyze what the expressions are 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.320
 facial expression its proportions in 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.830
 this case then I tried to take a model 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.930
 male and a female model 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.730
 the face also in this case for me 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.460
 be a bit more complicated tone and 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.890
 obviously more cattleman fighting a little 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.320
 with this drawing trying to change 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.020
 the proportions trying to define the 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.210
 planes but what I want us to observe 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.450
 right now I'm trying 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.310
 always use these basic guides that 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.100
 can you help me establish the 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.130
 proportions and after that I start to 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.760
 clean I start to correct so it's a 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.650
 good method to start freely 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.010
 this obviously I would recommend you 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.049
 you made about 50 to 100 studies and 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.750
 obviously it can seem like a very 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:14.480
 great but not what he always stressed in 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:17.150
 the other videos of this was about 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.560
 in which the process does not take you long 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.390
 doing so if you can put a 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.630
 limit 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.480
 at 20 minutes that's why he's doing the 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.700
 100 heads in the period of a week 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.530
 or a week and a half the good thing about 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.400
 perform these types of exercises is that 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.650
 really your mind starts to take a 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.990
 muscle memory and that muscle memory 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.540
 is what makes you work later 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.850
 your characters and your creations from the 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.860
 imagination and be able to combine the 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.040
 reference with what comes from you 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.990
 head that is the most important thing you 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:55.110
 perspective and your point of creation 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:57.960
 which is unique to the audience so 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.030
 I invite you to do more tests and 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.040
 try to use celebrities that are 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.260
 great to recognize expressions 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.090
 that can become memorable and that 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.360
 they can become a method of 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.360
 recognition 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.520
 you keep exploring and keep playing with 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.540
 this type of exercises we see ourselves in the 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.540
 next chao
