my pocket except you can also use the
thumb<00:01:00.179> stud<00:01:00.420> now<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.649> could<00:01:01.829> be<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.949> problem

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
thumb stud now this could be a problem

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.490 
thumb stud now this could be a problem
if<00:01:02.399> you're<00:01:02.550> left-handed<00:01:02.879> because<00:01:03.420> it's<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
if you're left-handed because it's the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.190 
if you're left-handed because it's the
right<00:01:04.680> hand<00:01:04.860> at<00:01:04.949> night<00:01:05.100> there's<00:01:05.460> no<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:06.200> mean

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
right hand at night there's no I mean

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.420 
right hand at night there's no I mean
you<00:01:07.290> probably<00:01:07.440> could<00:01:07.710> switch<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.040> thumb<00:01:08.190> set

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
you probably could switch the thumb set

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.630 
you probably could switch the thumb set
actually<00:01:08.870> but<00:01:09.870> the<00:01:10.260> belt<00:01:10.500> clip<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:11.250> only<00:01:11.490> on

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
actually but the belt clip is only on

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.370 
actually but the belt clip is only on
that<00:01:11.760> one<00:01:11.910> side<00:01:12.120> so<00:01:12.810> if<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:12.930> are<00:01:13.110> left-handed

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380

work too the knife is made out of a USAA

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.420 
work too the knife is made out of a USAA
steel<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.530> it's<00:01:52.530> very<00:01:52.710> good<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.100> not<00:01:53.220> one<00:01:53.400> of

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
steel and it's very good it's not one of

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.860 
steel and it's very good it's not one of
the<00:01:53.580> Steel's<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.180> really<00:01:54.570> easy<00:01:54.690> to

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
the Steel's that is really easy to

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.890 
the Steel's that is really easy to
resharpen<00:01:55.170> but<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.220> comes<00:01:56.730> razor-sharp<00:01:57.330> so

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
resharpen but it comes razor-sharp so

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.150 
resharpen but it comes razor-sharp so
this<00:01:58.260> is<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.410> kind<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.590> thing<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.920> want<00:01:59.010> to

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
this is the kind of thing you want to

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.420 
this is the kind of thing you want to
keep<00:01:59.310> you<00:02:00.150> know<00:02:00.240> razor<00:02:00.480> sharp<00:02:00.870> and
