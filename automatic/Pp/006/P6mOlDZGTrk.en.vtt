Hi! My name is Aino Nano. Welcome to ALASAN.

00:00:10.875 --> 00:00:13.775
This week, we would like to explore a bit about games.

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:15.316
Let's check it out.

00:00:25.416 --> 00:00:29.209
Hi! (Malay poetic form)

00:00:29.209 --> 00:00:31.111
Together with me is Hakim.

00:00:31.378 --> 00:00:33.204
What are you guys doing right now?

00:00:33.204 --> 00:00:35.765
We're just testing a new application.

00:00:35.765 --> 00:00:38.306
Augmented Reality!

00:00:38.306 --> 00:00:40.369
Augmented Reality?

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:42.426
What's that? What's that? What's that?

00:00:42.426 --> 00:00:46.822
Augmented reality is where our physical view,

00:00:46.822 --> 00:00:52.548
combined with a few computer-generated sounds, pictures and information.

00:00:52.548 --> 00:00:59.084
For this application to work we just scan a picture

00:00:59.084 --> 00:01:02.912
and we can see a 3D visual on this page of the magazine.

00:01:02.912 --> 00:01:09.696
Oh, so when we scan here with the phone, we can see AR.

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:10.542
Did I say it right?

00:01:10.542 --> 00:01:11.527
Yes, that's right!

00:01:11.527 --> 00:01:14.691
First, download the application.

00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:16.717
Second, search for this logo.

00:01:16.717 --> 00:01:19.276
Third, scan this logo.

00:01:19.276 --> 00:01:23.613
Fourth, watch Upin and Ipin come to life in 3D!

00:01:38.091 --> 00:01:40.523
So Hakim, where can we get this application?

00:01:40.523 --> 00:01:45.532
You can get it at upindanipin.com.my.

00:01:45.532 --> 00:01:47.778
Which platforms can support this application?

00:01:48.062 --> 00:01:52.449
Any handphones and tablets that have a camera

00:01:52.449 --> 00:01:56.390
with ios or android can be used for this application.

00:01:57.058 --> 00:02:01.146
So, how much do we need to pay for this application?

00:02:01.146 --> 00:02:05.189
This application is so cheap.

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:09.026
It's free!

00:02:12.441 --> 00:02:15.094
And what is this application for?

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.335
Ha, it's exclusively for Upin &amp; Ipin magazine issue 38.

00:02:24.255 --> 00:02:29.324
So what the reason for the people to get this application?

00:02:33.087 --> 00:02:38.014
Because it is awesome. So go get it now!

00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:44.932
Whatever reason you have, it is no excuse (Alasan)!

00:02:44.932 --> 00:02:47.898
Don't make any more excuses; just get this comic

00:02:47.898 --> 00:02:51.551
and the best application in the market now.

00:02:51.868 --> 00:02:53.986
Yeah!
