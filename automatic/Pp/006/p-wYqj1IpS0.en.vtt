00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.010
 courts all said that I could not 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.570
 return to play more but after returning to 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.610
 The fields 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.220
 and more still in a crude that I want 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.410
 a lot and that is then October and 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.060
 thanks to president luis sabino that 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.140
 gave the opportunity to return and be 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.730
 disposition of them 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.220
 I kept dreaming of getting to more things 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.949
 important not to save because if always 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.449
 the dream to get very loud after sound 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.150
 the football because there is not the 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.710
 selection that's what I want most 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:48.699
 but first of all you have to think about 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.260
 the 12th and pick it up where it should be and 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.000
 be fine that the most interesting and 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.949
 talking about the selection there is some 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.809
 particular party that you remember 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.000
 in a special way that you played with 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.430
 the shirt of the redhead 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.950
 I do not always remember the matches against 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.710
 Brazil and Argentina were more difficult 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.000
 but we still got everything and we did 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.720
 everything possible to get a result 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.430
 positive 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.229
 there are many goals to both teams 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.790
 Brazilians in both the national team and 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.910
 the clubs when you played for america 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.040
 continue like that I think the matches 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.500
 most important were when I was in 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.330
 america good we play against two teams 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.190
 Brazilians a liberators cup that 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.290

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.140
 well I do not remember well but they were 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.399
 interesting matches and against argentina 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.110
 you remember that game where 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.540
 you made the play for the goal of nelson 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.580
 haedo is that the other side was messi 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.410
 and maradona as technical director is what 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.240

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.310
 of a good play that says and then it 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.320

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.150
 partner 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.250
