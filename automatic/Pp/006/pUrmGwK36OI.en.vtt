00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.419
 credit paid off what happens after that 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.030
 Welcome my name is 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.700
 mathias eilers and in this video 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.070
 you experience a psychological trick 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.990
 which makes sure you get out of the 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.050
 situation that you just got a loan 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.910
 have paid off what so already 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.130
 is positive and also sounds positive 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.189
 can get more out of it and that 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.650
 can automatically save a lot of money and 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.600
 at the end of the month continuously on 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.390
 In the long run really more money left over 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.190
 have first of all of which 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.230
 Loans I speak from here 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.670
 credit that you really afford 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.770
 can or could afford 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.480
 and I'm not talking about credit here 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.910
 your financial framework extremely 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.300
 have blown up the extremely burdened me 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.800
 to have 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.899
 that's another story again 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.239
 I'm really talking about credit for 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.910
 for example, consumer goods or for a 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.469
 car that you really do 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.879
 could 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.770
 what do most people about how 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.559
 Most people react when they are 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.600
 credit for such an issue is paid off 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.970
 most people just do it 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.710
 nothing they are happy that they are more 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.140
 have money left and know ok 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.990
 next month, for example, falls 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.060
 amount for my for my car 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.680
 Financing away let's just say 250 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.299
 euro and I know okay from next month 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.600
 I have 250 euros more 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.659
 what happens a reality this 250th 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.420
 euro more fizzle after two or three 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.820
 four months and flow into the whole 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.250
 normal output electricity because most 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.049
 People do not have a plan about their finances 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.000
 have and do not know what they what 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.040
 spend how much they spend 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.280
 and therefore they are in the example 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.159
 250 euro or generally said the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.549
 You then spend more on the 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.649
 end of the month you have lost and the advantage 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.500
 is gone 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:57.270
 what can you do or 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.329
 what psychological clocks can you do 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.969
 use for you but continuously 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.100
 to save more money and these or 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.750
 this condition is positive for you 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.360
 use that you paid right now in the war 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.000
 did we continue assuming that 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.890
 you hate a car hate about three 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.190
 years with a monthly burden 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.650
 from 250 euros and this falls 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.849
 For example, let's just say 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.709
 first burden falls away this burden 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.550
 Now you are doing the following you judge 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.980
 month before 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.390
 about the one Sparkurs or 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.510
 one day money account if you do not 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.120
 already has and dati this is a 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.340
 standing order on the first four with the 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.580
 exact sum in this example 250 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.519
 euro you pay for your car from 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.560
 so if the credit so end for the first 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.769
 fourth, your standing order begins 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.540
 with the 250 euros do that 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.720
 least and why you should so 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.599
 make it easy by this or 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.400
 through this act you liszt 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:02.159
 Outwitted cling your brain because 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.220
 the last three years it was for you 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:07.530
 completely okay and completely normal that 250 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.159
 euro from his salary from the giro account 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.110
 disappear and in the fall to 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:15.330
 Credit bank went now it is so that 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.700
 this process weiblein happens 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.530
 nothing new for your brain and this 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.540
 make sure you do not 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.700
 have to restrict if you have the 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.739
 years or could you spend the years too 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.280
 afford this loan you also contest 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.810
 afford to have missed 250 euros and it 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.030
 Most people find it hard when they have money 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.489
 First of all, you want to save money 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.909
 if you have worked aside 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.150
 lay 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:42.239
 In that case, you have over three years 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.810
 this 52 euro set aside in 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.569
 clinch 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.970
 she was drafted for the rate of 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.620
 a car and this advantage this 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.870
 psychological effect because you are yourself 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.590
 You've gotten used to it 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.049
 use 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.269
 but now it is this 250 euro 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:00.330
 do not go for a loan on it 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:03.150
 but these 250 euros land directly on 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.500
 your sparkonto and you can to 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.330
 for example, after a few months of vacation 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.880
 Pay for it or unexpectedly 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.160
 tons of your car without you 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.990
 you have to get used to without you 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.880
 must restrict and just this 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.040
 to get used to most people 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.060
 hard and you can use it here 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.670
 if you ever have a loan 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.770
 have finished and now it off 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.040
 have paid then use this advantage 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.480
 and it will be easy for you 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.250
 okay that was it for this topic of mine 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:35.100
