yeah I think so I think the great part
about<00:01:21.770> it<00:01:21.950> was<00:01:22.130> that<00:01:22.299> there<00:01:23.299> was<00:01:23.420> probably

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
about it was that there was probably

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.300 
about it was that there was probably
consistency<00:01:24.289> through<00:01:24.470> the<00:01:24.740> through<00:01:25.280> the

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
consistency through the through the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.639 
consistency through the through the
preseason<00:01:25.789> games<00:01:26.149> and<00:01:26.990> then<00:01:27.259> leave<00:01:27.409> with<00:01:27.530> your

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649

week was pretty tough kind of um trying

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.520 
week was pretty tough kind of um trying
to<00:01:46.759> call<00:01:46.909> for<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.149> ball<00:01:47.270> and<00:01:47.569> calling<00:01:48.380> the

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
to call for the ball and calling the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.969

the coaches are doing in the young squad

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.349 
the coaches are doing in the young squad
it's<00:02:08.420> making<00:02:08.750> me<00:02:08.840> feel<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:09.080> wee<00:02:09.229> bit<00:02:09.349> older

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:10.359 
it's making me feel a wee bit older

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:13.390 
it's making me feel a wee bit older
which<00:02:11.359> isn't<00:02:11.540> so<00:02:11.840> good<00:02:12.019> but<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.920> guys<00:02:13.250> are

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
which isn't so good but the guys are

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.550 
which isn't so good but the guys are
really<00:02:13.489> open<00:02:13.880> not<00:02:14.030> willing<00:02:14.239> to<00:02:14.269> learn<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:14.840> I

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
really open not willing to learn and I

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.560
