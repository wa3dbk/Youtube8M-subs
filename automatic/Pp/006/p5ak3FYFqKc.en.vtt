00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 Hi guys, I do a hairstyle that 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.639
 I love that the overuse and even a good 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.650
 hairstyle if you 're a little hair 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.559
 comes because you see the hair it does not 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.660
 is ideally clean but I think it will 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.150
 look great for you to do a hairstyle 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.250
 you will not share any means or 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:27.119
 side that I split will split a 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:31.320
 between the two or so 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.090
 so once was this division I go 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.730
 start on my left side you go 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.579
 grab more or less on the two fingers above 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.110
 from your eyebrow and take a spin 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:49.230
 appetite 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:53.850
 in this mecha you divide in three action 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:57.239
 half over the corner and now again 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.000
 I'm going to pass over the edge 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.890
 now I'm going to get the above average 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.890
 along with a little hair 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:13.020
 here I step on top of the other 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:16.409
 but this usually means the 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:21.750
 I pick up the top of Mexico from the top and 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:24.090
 together with mexico from above and together, then 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:31.200
 a Dutch built-in child only I 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:33.030
 'm picking up messes up, not down a 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.820
 time you 've taken your hair more or 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.579
 less up to the height of your ear question 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.470
 I picked up france and it will look like this. 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.770
 I think it's cool that she goes 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.829
 be the differential because positioning 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:51.680
 her where she's going to get stuck and now 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.680
 You'll get the show, give it a zoom. 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:05.369
 I 'm picking up her sides and 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.960
 pulling it out and even people can 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.960
 pull with everything 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:25.049
 Pressed it becomes much more beautiful 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.049
 today I will learn with the tie 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.739
 turning to you to see 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.890
 now I'll do something else the same 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.890
 thing on the other side 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:11.450
 again I will position trans and 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:16.960
 start pulling the tip many people 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.960
 was pull pulls with calm care here 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.540
 You're not going to leave, they do not pull at your 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:27.080
 hair right 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:29.360

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:35.300
