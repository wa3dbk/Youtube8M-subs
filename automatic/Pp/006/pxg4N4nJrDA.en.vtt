this is a book of it I think that Batman
should<00:00:08.220> read<00:00:08.490> because<00:00:09.019> Batman's<00:00:10.019> he<00:00:10.740> is

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
should read because Batman's he is

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.999 
should read because Batman's he is
really<00:00:11.610> trying<00:00:12.179> hard<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.630> make<00:00:12.900> Gotham<00:00:13.349> City<00:00:13.710> a

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
yeah he's proactive but - he doesn't

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.590 
yeah he's proactive but - he doesn't
have<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.260> end<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:34.770> mind<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.520> think<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.329> end

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
have the end in mind I think the end

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.299 
have the end in mind I think the end
goal<00:00:36.930> for<00:00:36.960> Batman<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:38.100> Gotham<00:00:38.960> City<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.500> safe

leave like my bad signal also first
things<00:00:56.820> first<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.719> one<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.289> habits<00:00:58.500> and

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
things first is one of the habits and

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.360 
things first is one of the habits and
I'm<00:01:00.539> not<00:01:00.840> sure<00:01:01.109> if<00:01:01.289> he's<00:01:01.469> doing<00:01:01.770> first<00:01:02.010> things

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.149 
first I mean he got a suit in a car
my<00:01:07.890> first<00:01:08.220> thing<00:01:08.490> might<00:01:08.670> be<00:01:08.990> finding<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.470> prison

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
my first thing might be finding a prison

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.399 
my first thing might be finding a prison
where<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.610> bad<00:01:11.760> guys<00:01:12.000> stay<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.780> cuz

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
where the bad guys stay in it cuz

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.649 
where the bad guys stay in it cuz
there's<00:01:13.680> obviously<00:01:14.250> like<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.880> leak<00:01:15.330> somewhere

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
there's obviously like a leak somewhere

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.570 
there's obviously like a leak somewhere
because<00:01:16.020> every<00:01:16.350> time<00:01:16.560> somebody<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.369> there

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
because every time somebody in there

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.840 
because every time somebody in there
they<00:01:17.970> just<00:01:18.000> come<00:01:18.330> back<00:01:18.479> out<00:01:18.720> um<00:01:19.500> also<00:01:19.890> he's<00:01:20.610> not

they just come back out um also he's not

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.390 
they just come back out um also he's not
thinking<00:01:21.180> win-win<00:01:22.049> that's<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.560> fourth<00:01:22.890> habit

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
thinking win-win that's the fourth habit

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.480 
thinking win-win that's the fourth habit
like<00:01:23.640> when<00:01:24.210> he<00:01:24.680> goes<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.710> there's<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.189> bank

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
like when he goes and there's a bank

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.520 
like when he goes and there's a bank
robber<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.030> he<00:01:27.180> beats<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.750> mess<00:01:27.960> out<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.409> this

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
robber and he beats the mess out of this

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.190 
robber and he beats the mess out of this
guy<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:29.400> only<00:01:29.579> when<00:01:30.060> that's<00:01:30.509> not<00:01:30.600> win-win

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
guy it's only when that's not win-win

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.109 
guy it's only when that's not win-win
what<00:01:31.530> does<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.829> robber<00:01:32.070> get<00:01:32.460> out<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.909> he

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
what does the robber get out of it he

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.749 
what does the robber get out of it he
should<00:01:33.439> motivate<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:35.009> robber<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.610> do

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
should motivate this robber to do

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:36.840 
should motivate this robber to do
something<00:01:36.210> better

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
something better

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.950 
something better
and<00:01:36.940> what<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:38.500> next<00:01:38.680> habit<00:01:39.159> is<00:01:39.960> understand

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
and what the next habit is understand

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.590 
and what the next habit is understand
before<00:01:41.409> being<00:01:41.920> understood<00:01:42.729> see<00:01:43.030> I<00:01:43.060> think<00:01:43.450> he

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
before being understood see I think he

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.870 
before being understood see I think he
just<00:01:43.840> goes<00:01:44.020> into<00:01:44.290> some<00:01:44.710> Batman<00:01:45.160> but<00:01:45.580> you're<00:01:45.850> a

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
bad guy understand this bad guy first

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.230 
bad guy understand this bad guy first
you<00:01:50.110> know<00:01:50.290> and<00:01:50.590> be<00:01:50.860> like<00:01:51.210> um<00:01:53.369> hey<00:01:54.369> what

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
he's not synergizing one bit because he

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.680 
he's not synergizing one bit because he
just<00:02:08.440> he's<00:02:09.009> like<00:02:09.039> I'm<00:02:09.459> standing<00:02:10.390> on<00:02:10.539> the
