actually have here this black one and we

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.190 
actually have here this black one and we
can<00:03:11.720> see<00:03:11.989> that<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.920> most<00:03:13.100> recent<00:03:13.250> sale<00:03:14.200> the

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.970 
can see that the most recent sale the
price<00:03:15.440> was<00:03:17.170> $20.14<00:03:18.170> this<00:03:18.440> looks<00:03:18.680> like<00:03:18.800> an

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
price was $20.14 this looks like an
