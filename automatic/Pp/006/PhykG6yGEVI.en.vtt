00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.430 
have the base of the pencil we need to
color<00:03:22.590> it<00:03:23.510> so<00:03:25.640> you<00:03:26.640> color<00:03:26.910> every<00:03:27.660> part<00:03:27.960> except

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
color it so you color every part except

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.530 
color it so you color every part except
for<00:03:28.620> this<00:03:28.710> little<00:03:28.770> metal<00:03:29.220> part<00:03:29.640> which<00:03:30.150> one<00:03:30.390> is

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
for this little metal part which one is

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.590 
for this little metal part which one is
a<00:03:30.930> different<00:03:31.470> thing<00:03:31.970> so<00:03:32.970> I'm<00:03:33.210> just<00:03:33.390> going<00:03:33.510> to

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
a different thing so I'm just going to

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.460 
a different thing so I'm just going to
bring<00:03:33.840> my<00:03:34.320> barrel<00:03:34.770> into<00:03:35.010> isolation<00:03:35.520> mode<00:03:35.910> and

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
bring my barrel into isolation mode and

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:44.690 
bring my barrel into isolation mode and
I'm<00:03:37.470> going<00:03:37.770> to<00:03:37.830> go<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.070> my<00:03:38.220> gradient<00:03:38.610> tool<00:03:43.700> so

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
I'm going to go to my gradient tool so

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.790 
I'm going to go to my gradient tool so
I'm<00:03:45.060> going<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:45.480> choose<00:03:46.020> a<00:03:46.080> color<00:03:48.260> I'm<00:03:49.260> going<00:03:49.740> to

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
I'm going to choose a color I'm going to

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
I'm going to choose a color I'm going to
do<00:03:49.950> blue<00:03:51.620> when<00:03:52.620> you're<00:03:52.770> choosing<00:03:52.980> colors<00:03:53.520> you

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
do blue when you're choosing colors you

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.670 
do blue when you're choosing colors you
do<00:03:53.940> not<00:03:54.120> want<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:54.720> make<00:03:54.959> it<00:03:55.170> drastically

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
do not want to make it drastically

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.440 
do not want to make it drastically
different<00:03:57.530> this<00:03:58.530> watches<00:03:59.160> has<00:03:59.940> a<00:03:59.970> good

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
different this watches has a good

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.810 
different this watches has a good
selection<00:04:02.090> like<00:04:03.470> you<00:04:04.470> don't<00:04:04.590> want<00:04:04.890> the<00:04:05.340> colors

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
selection like you don't want the colors

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.699 
selection like you don't want the colors
to<00:04:06.209> be<00:04:06.390> too<00:04:08.510> different<00:04:09.510> from<00:04:09.930> each<00:04:10.140> other<00:04:10.320> like

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
to be too different from each other like

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.560 
to be too different from each other like
you<00:04:10.830> don't<00:04:11.010> want<00:04:11.160> navy<00:04:11.430> blue<00:04:11.790> and<00:04:11.820> powder<00:04:12.209> blue

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
you don't want navy blue and powder blue

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.920 
you don't want navy blue and powder blue
and<00:04:12.860> we<00:04:13.860> want<00:04:14.100> to<00:04:14.250> change<00:04:14.580> the<00:04:15.060> angle<00:04:15.570> to<00:04:15.900> a

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
and we want to change the angle to a

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.720 
and we want to change the angle to a
next<00:04:16.260> 90<00:04:16.739> degrees<00:04:18.140> like<00:04:19.140> so<00:04:19.400> let's<00:04:20.400> get<00:04:20.549> out

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
next 90 degrees like so let's get out

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.270 
next 90 degrees like so let's get out
isolation<00:04:21.480> mode<00:04:21.630> I'm<00:04:22.560> going<00:04:22.800> to<00:04:22.919> color<00:04:23.100> the

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
isolation mode I'm going to color the

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.480 
isolation mode I'm going to color the
rest<00:04:23.430> of<00:04:23.669> them<00:04:23.790> and<00:04:24.030> I'll<00:04:24.510> see<00:04:24.870> you<00:04:24.990> done<00:04:28.490> okay

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
rest of them and I'll see you done okay

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.820 
rest of them and I'll see you done okay
so<00:04:29.550> now<00:04:29.910> that<00:04:29.940> we've<00:04:30.300> got<00:04:30.660> all<00:04:30.870> of<00:04:30.960> our<00:04:31.290> on

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
so now that we've got all of our on

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.120 
so now that we've got all of our on
parts<00:04:32.550> of<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.669> pencil<00:04:33.169> covered<00:04:34.169> except<00:04:34.860> for

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
parts of the pencil covered except for

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.600 
parts of the pencil covered except for
our<00:04:35.160> little<00:04:35.540> metal<00:04:36.540> cat<00:04:36.810> part<00:04:37.200> i'm<00:04:37.410> going<00:04:38.310> to

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
our little metal cat part i'm going to

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.580 
our little metal cat part i'm going to
show<00:04:38.850> you<00:04:38.880> how<00:04:39.150> to<00:04:39.210> color<00:04:39.780> that<00:04:40.050> so<00:04:40.290> it<00:04:40.380> looks

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
show you how to color that so it looks

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.850 
show you how to color that so it looks
like<00:04:40.710> metal<00:04:42.080> so<00:04:43.080> we're<00:04:43.290> going<00:04:43.380> to<00:04:43.560> go<00:04:43.650> to<00:04:43.680> our

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
like metal so we're going to go to our

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.409 
like metal so we're going to go to our
gradient<00:04:44.190> tool<00:04:44.580> Lecter<00:04:44.910> bring<00:04:45.120> it<00:04:45.270> into

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
gradient tool Lecter bring it into

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:48.860 
gradient tool Lecter bring it into
isolation<00:04:46.080> mode<00:04:46.440> and<00:04:47.030> we're<00:04:48.030> going<00:04:48.360> to<00:04:48.419> add

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
isolation mode and we're going to add

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.900 
isolation mode and we're going to add
two<00:04:49.380> stops<00:04:50.130> one<00:04:50.850> here<00:04:51.500> and<00:04:52.500> one<00:04:52.590> here<00:04:52.910> our

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
two stops one here and one here our

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.179 
two stops one here and one here our
first<00:04:54.570> stop

00:04:56.179 --> 00:04:56.189 
first stop

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:59.580 
first stop
we<00:04:57.189> need<00:04:57.370> to<00:04:57.490> go<00:04:57.639> into<00:04:57.879> web<00:04:58.240> RGB<00:04:58.930> for<00:04:59.229> all<00:04:59.409> of

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
we need to go into web RGB for all of

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:10.230 
we need to go into web RGB for all of
them<00:04:59.909> our<00:05:00.909> first<00:05:01.270> stop<00:05:01.569> is<00:05:02.879> f2<00:05:04.770> f2<00:05:06.180> f2<00:05:09.240> our

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:30.590 
we're going to make it about three

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:48.239 
we're going to make it about three
points<00:06:31.100> and<00:06:32.110> the<00:06:33.110> line<00:06:33.350> will<00:06:33.710> be<00:06:33.920> white

00:06:48.239 --> 00:06:48.249 

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:54.539

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:54.549 
now go to your layers or maybe not turn

00:06:54.549 --> 00:07:01.769 
now go to your layers or maybe not turn
the<00:06:54.639> opacity<00:06:54.879> down<00:06:55.859> to<00:07:00.149> ya<00:07:01.149> bout<00:07:01.389> seventy

00:07:01.769 --> 00:07:01.779 
the opacity down to ya bout seventy

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:04.349 
the opacity down to ya bout seventy
percent<00:07:01.989> is<00:07:02.319> good<00:07:02.639> all<00:07:03.639> you<00:07:03.849> have<00:07:03.939> to<00:07:04.029> do<00:07:04.179> is
