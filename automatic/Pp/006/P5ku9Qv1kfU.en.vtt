00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.429
 unesp personal speech art beauty 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.780
 Look, I got here to make a motorcycle. 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:16.320
 for you the trip of x650 fialho bulls 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.570
 ed chan superpop the ball came to the 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:25.289
 to the staff then take out 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:28.920
 Take it only because there she looks only 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:32.219
 2gb ddr5 memory is not compatible 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.829
 with gpu bush jackson already supports sl 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.680
 this here is the most interesting one third 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.980
 of board made and 3d video is beauty 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.809
 which exports two video cards in sl 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.309
 It's already great, okay? 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:57.590
 the other 650 normal this did not support 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:01:04.589
 sl's of obvious rap take off the plate and a 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:12.330
 toast to the pope 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:19.070
 I find it cute just see accessories 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:25.430
 that an instruction manual from within the 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.430
 standard should gear in another quick guide 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:33.270
 how does cd drivers do not use 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.420
 would be drivers download latest driver 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.590
 always on the site of nvidia and a neighbor and 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.530
 power bike and ei ei legia here attention 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.020
 not to pick up the standard kent board 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.869
 zin comes an adapter 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.689
 Since then, right? 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:56.070
 1 column adapts from lunch 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:58.860
 ex- popular 6-pin teacher does not have 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.689
 nothing much different than a package because 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.040
 we can live the size of the face 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:09.100
 of the board is much larger than 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:13.990
 the normal gtx 650 and the gtx 650 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:19.390
 and there, let me draw latina as deny 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:21.790
 the pack was the plate 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.830
 let me take the classics from her always 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.840
 called these plastics people bought 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.660
 by third parties 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.870
 on the other the classics do not forget 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.720
 then he won from all plastics 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.320
 that have here a plastic inside 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.360
 course we will try to remove the person 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.800
 What are you up here? 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.960
 also have 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:50.040
 and here in the middle also tries to get you 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:50.040
 can see well the texture of the plate 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.870
 HTA heated and glued also gives to 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.410
 take but look at the plate is here 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:10.000
 You can see up and see geforce. 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:14.140
 gtx 650 tiago boost on the top 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.620
 also geforce gtx and even bush a 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:22.900
 only 6-pin connector and here 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:25.200
 the csl ball show and lots of people were there 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.860
 complaining that he was wanting to ride 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.260
 660 150 sorry and now the plate has arrived 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.480
 Look here, you can see I'll tell 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.270
 here for you guys, look, the part 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.630
 rear of a normal gtx 650 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.410
 to realize that this board here looks only 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.660
 it's bigger 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.240
 150 and boost and will see that in the 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.310
 from the front you see the column of mine 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.570
 arm here looks just how much land from above 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.930
 For good people. 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:56.020
 Look at the size of the bush versus 650 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.610
 normal to 650 piai normal is also this 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.680
 so there's no need for me to get 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.570
 one just to show that this morning but 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.370
 all well organized 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.740
 the tightening of what is different 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.470
 on this plate because she has more than here 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.690
 It's normal, I took the liberty I got there. 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.330
 on youtube and the hardware a table 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.710
 for you take a look just let's go 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.500
 compare here let's compare 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:20.010
 first your two here the gt 650 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.050
 at r 3,150 th timbu 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.930
 here is the default speed of 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:27.630
 reference to the bush has a bit more 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.070
 clock is that specific model that the 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.080
 People are testing you now. 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.750
 sing 1072 here 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.390
 980 is not ok but this is just so you have 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.360
 a base even looks here only the speed 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.220
 This memory also gains a little bit here 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.680
 here is a bigger difference of all 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.020
 let's say so is the amount of bits 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.300
 taxis and 28 to 192 bits 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.040
 even dividing with 660 for example 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.400
 that band figure as you can 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.260
 have seen a significant increase in 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.330
 number of cuda colors is the same and both 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.460
 use direct x 11 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:03.060
 here they can pause and also 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.470
 compare 660 000 650 normal to 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.040
 you have a term from a base of 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.960
 reference to what I'm going to do now 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.430
 I'm going to put one to test for 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.260
 disseminate your results to you 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.970
 We're probably going to test games. 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.850
 Newer taken after the personal 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.860
 pretty with phrases 3 bar shopping 20 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.450
 agents also won from some people 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.390
 then there may come down to make a 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.730
 with a card and two 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.070
 plates is to serve you see what 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:31.260
 the real gain is the cost benefit to which 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.480
 Give resources are taking you home. 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.010
 so posted the video online we are 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.180
 favorites from a comment that is 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.990
 super important 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.160
 Thanks and even the next personal video is 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.650
 what we have to show you 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.620
 here from leaving here to donating looks 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:49.560
 only it has a displayport once in 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.910
 me and two to see it was this that only 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.910
 to let your value go blank
