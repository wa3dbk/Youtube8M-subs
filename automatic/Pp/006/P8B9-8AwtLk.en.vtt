00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
there's no there's not as many violent

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.730 
there's no there's not as many violent
crimes<00:01:32.280> over<00:01:32.759> here<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:34.200> may<00:01:34.350> be<00:01:34.409> true

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
crimes over here and that may be true

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.830 
crimes over here and that may be true
but<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.520> think<00:01:35.759> that's<00:01:35.939> more<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.420> mentality

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
but I think that's more of a mentality

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.740 
but I think that's more of a mentality
kind<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.500> thing<00:01:37.680> look<00:01:38.220> at<00:01:38.369> Mexico<00:01:38.909> they've<00:01:39.540> got

and shit uh it's a mentality thing look

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.139 
and shit uh it's a mentality thing look
at<00:01:48.990> Switzerland<00:01:49.680> they<00:01:50.009> have<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.549> most<00:01:50.790> guns

per<00:01:53.640> capita<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.420> they<00:01:54.570> have<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:54.810> think<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
per capita and they have I think the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.740 
per capita and they have I think the
lowest<00:01:55.649> crime<00:01:56.070> rate<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.729> world<00:01:56.759> so

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
lowest crime rate in the world so

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.810 
lowest crime rate in the world so
