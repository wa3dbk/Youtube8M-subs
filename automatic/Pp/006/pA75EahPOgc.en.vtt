00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.730
 Tania is traveling with her parents 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.139
 written a letter to his friend vero 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.510
 telling him how good he is 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.990
 happening but the letter is not right 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.990
 written 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.529
 tania has not taken into account the use of 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.529
 the initial capitals 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.349
 is written with a capital letter the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.720
 first word of a writing and the 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.370
 first word of a sentence after 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.370
 point and followed or point and 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.620
 after the use of the colon it is 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.450
 capitalize the word 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.140
 that follows the greeting of a letter and the 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.140
 textual quotes 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.810
 the capital is also written 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.570
 word that follows the closing of a 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.660
 interrogation or an exclamation always 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.820
 that after these there is not a coma for that 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.220
 the word safe if it starts with 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.390
 capital letter but not the accent that the 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.390
 exclamation you will love 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.260
 in the second part of the letter tanya 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.420
 continues to commit misspellings 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.880
 proper names are written with 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.550
 capitalized as those of people places or 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.110
 as well as geographical features 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.210
 the surnames and nicknames 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.820
 courtesy treatments carry 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.950
 initial capitalization especially if used 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.600
 its abbreviation in addition to the charges 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.060
 titles and hierarchies that make 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.210
 reference to a specific person as 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.490
 is the case of with prince foundation 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.110
 of Asturias is also badly written already 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.210
 that the names of establishments and 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.490
 Institutions, societies and corporations 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.560
 they are capitalized 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.630
 Finally , I know that the 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.549
 titles of publications movies and 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.580
 works of art are also written with 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.820
 capitals as they are the regenta and everything 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.820
 the rest 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.760
 with these indications, I'm sure that 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.510
 do not make again so many mistakes with 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.510
 uppercase
