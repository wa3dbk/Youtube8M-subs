Solomon when I got that I thought it's

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.119 
Solomon when I got that I thought it's
gonna<00:00:13.070> be<00:00:13.160> a<00:00:13.190> little<00:00:13.370> bit<00:00:13.519> too<00:00:13.849> much<00:00:14.499> for<00:00:15.499> the

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:16.129 
gonna be a little bit too much for the

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.800 
gonna be a little bit too much for the
fish<00:00:16.400> I<00:00:16.670> thought<00:00:16.940> it's<00:00:17.030> gonna<00:00:17.120> put<00:00:17.390> a<00:00:17.420> big<00:00:17.600> hole

fish I thought it's gonna put a big hole
in<00:00:17.840> once<00:00:18.440> I<00:00:18.560> started<00:00:18.860> shooting<00:00:19.070> just<00:00:19.760> small

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
in once I started shooting just small

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.919 
in once I started shooting just small
pan<00:00:20.330> fish<00:00:20.630> just<00:00:21.320> putting<00:00:21.820> holes<00:00:22.820> not<00:00:23.570> even<00:00:23.810> as

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:23.929 
pan fish just putting holes not even as

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:26.320 
pan fish just putting holes not even as
big<00:00:24.080> as<00:00:24.140> my<00:00:24.380> pinky<00:00:24.800> in<00:00:24.920> there<00:00:25.160> so<00:00:25.400> one<00:00:26.210> of<00:00:26.269> the

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
big as my pinky in there so one of the

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.609 
big as my pinky in there so one of the
size<00:00:26.570> of<00:00:26.720> the<00:00:26.840> shaft<00:00:27.109> once<00:00:27.949> it<00:00:28.099> was<00:00:28.220> all<00:00:28.369> done

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
size of the shaft once it was all done

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.230 
size of the shaft once it was all done
so<00:00:30.619> I<00:00:30.650> was<00:00:30.980> really<00:00:31.160> impressed<00:00:31.460> with<00:00:31.670> this<00:00:31.970> tip

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:32.240 
so I was really impressed with this tip

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.530 
so I was really impressed with this tip
I've<00:00:32.900> bent<00:00:33.860> this<00:00:34.100> one<00:00:34.370> and<00:00:35.150> I've<00:00:35.240> straightened

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
I've bent this one and I've straightened

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.600 
I've bent this one and I've straightened
it<00:00:35.690> with<00:00:35.810> a<00:00:35.840> vise<00:00:36.140> and<00:00:36.410> filed<00:00:36.980> it<00:00:37.160> back<00:00:37.340> down

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
it with a vise and filed it back down

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.840 
it with a vise and filed it back down
there<00:00:38.120> they're<00:00:38.450> pretty<00:00:38.660> durable<00:00:38.930> I<00:00:39.730> bend<00:00:40.730> it

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
there they're pretty durable I bend it

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.850 
there they're pretty durable I bend it
by<00:00:41.000> shooting<00:00:41.210> into<00:00:41.630> a<00:00:41.660> rock<00:00:41.990> at<00:00:42.290> close<00:00:42.530> range

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
by shooting into a rock at close range

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.310 
by shooting into a rock at close range
it<00:00:43.010> was<00:00:43.100> just<00:00:43.340> out<00:00:43.520> of<00:00:43.630> visual<00:00:44.630> sight<00:00:44.900> or

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
it was just out of visual sight or

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.130 
it was just out of visual sight or
sitting<00:00:45.710> flat<00:00:45.950> and<00:00:46.540> shocked<00:00:47.540> through<00:00:47.780> a<00:00:47.810> fish

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
sitting flat and shocked through a fish

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.460 
sitting flat and shocked through a fish
I<00:00:48.820> didn't<00:00:49.820> see<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:50.180> rock<00:00:50.330> and<00:00:50.690> it<00:00:50.960> bends<00:00:51.350> it

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
I didn't see the rock and it bends it

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.650 
I didn't see the rock and it bends it
probably<00:00:51.830> about<00:00:51.950> a<00:00:52.010> 20<00:00:52.310> degree<00:00:52.400> angle<00:00:52.640> as<00:00:53.420> they

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
probably about a 20 degree angle as they

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.600 
probably about a 20 degree angle as they
well<00:00:53.840> straighten<00:00:54.110> it<00:00:54.170> with<00:00:54.290> a<00:00:54.350> vise<00:00:54.620> they

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
well straighten it with a vise they

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.850 
well straighten it with a vise they
ground<00:00:55.910> it<00:00:56.030> back<00:00:56.270> down<00:00:56.540> with<00:00:56.690> a<00:00:56.720> grinder<00:00:57.200> then

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
ground it back down with a grinder then

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.950 
ground it back down with a grinder then
if<00:00:58.010> my<00:00:58.250> didn't<00:00:58.700> use<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:59.000> sander<00:00:59.450> at<00:00:59.570> night<00:00:59.750> you

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
if my didn't use the sander at night you

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.930 
if my didn't use the sander at night you
some<00:01:00.290> fine<00:01:00.530> grit<00:01:00.560> sandpaper<00:01:01.070> to<00:01:01.490> finish<00:01:01.790> it

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
some fine grit sandpaper to finish it

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.929 
some fine grit sandpaper to finish it
off<00:01:02.090> and<00:01:02.330> it<00:01:02.450> looks<00:01:02.630> as<00:01:02.960> good<00:01:02.990> as<00:01:03.260> men<00:01:03.610> so<00:01:04.610> they

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
off and it looks as good as men so they

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.740 
off and it looks as good as men so they
are<00:01:05.089> a<00:01:05.119> good<00:01:05.360> tip<00:01:05.770> they'll<00:01:07.240> go<00:01:08.240> back<00:01:08.479> into

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
are a good tip they'll go back into

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.050 
are a good tip they'll go back into
shape<00:01:09.200> as<00:01:09.799> long<00:01:10.159> as<00:01:10.250> you're<00:01:10.369> careful<00:01:10.520> I'm<00:01:10.850> sure

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
shape as long as you're careful I'm sure

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.700 
shape as long as you're careful I'm sure
you<00:01:11.149> can<00:01:11.270> snap<00:01:11.570> them<00:01:11.719> if<00:01:11.869> you<00:01:12.020> just<00:01:12.170> start

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
you can snap them if you just start

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.090 
you can snap them if you just start
cranking<00:01:12.950> on<00:01:13.189> kind<00:01:13.490> of<00:01:13.640> parent<00:01:14.920> so<00:01:15.920> when<00:01:16.070> I

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
cranking on kind of parent so when I

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.849 
cranking on kind of parent so when I
found<00:01:16.399> Sal<00:01:17.090> damar<00:01:17.390> online<00:01:17.750> I<00:01:18.109> saw<00:01:19.070> this<00:01:19.460> tip<00:01:19.789> I

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:20.859 
found Sal damar online I saw this tip I

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:23.969 
found Sal damar online I saw this tip I
thought<00:01:21.859> was<00:01:22.009> coming<00:01:22.219> closer<00:01:22.399> to<00:01:22.520> this<00:01:22.729> size

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
thought was coming closer to this size

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.649 
thought was coming closer to this size
but<00:01:24.979> it's<00:01:25.100> hard<00:01:25.249> to<00:01:25.280> tell<00:01:25.490> signs<00:01:25.820> in<00:01:26.060> a<00:01:26.119> picture

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.319 

you<00:01:29.659> can<00:01:29.719> see<00:01:30.310> there's<00:01:31.310> a<00:01:31.399> little<00:01:31.999> bit<00:01:32.179> of<00:01:32.270> a

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
you can see there's a little bit of a

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.120 
you can see there's a little bit of a
size<00:01:32.539> difference<00:01:32.569> the<00:01:33.259> wingspan<00:01:33.710> on<00:01:33.890> the

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
size difference the wingspan on the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.380 
size difference the wingspan on the
barbs<00:01:34.490> probably<00:01:34.969> about<00:01:35.679> an<00:01:36.700> inch<00:01:37.700> longer<00:01:38.090> on

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
barbs probably about an inch longer on

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.130 
barbs probably about an inch longer on
the<00:01:38.539> Mark<00:01:38.780> Martin<00:01:39.259> to<00:01:39.439> the<00:01:40.869> Martin<00:01:41.869> tip<00:01:42.020> is

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
the Mark Martin to the Martin tip is

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.719 
the Mark Martin to the Martin tip is
nice<00:01:42.350> because<00:01:43.299> it<00:01:44.299> can<00:01:44.450> need<00:01:44.630> to<00:01:45.579> you<00:01:46.579> can

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
nice because it can need to you can

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.450 
nice because it can need to you can
replace<00:01:46.969> just<00:01:47.299> the<00:01:47.840> tip<00:01:48.049> they<00:01:48.950> sell<00:01:49.219> extra

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
replace just the tip they sell extra

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.489 
replace just the tip they sell extra
tips<00:01:49.759> this<00:01:49.969> is<00:01:50.030> a<00:01:50.210> tempered<00:01:50.659> tip<00:01:50.869> they<00:01:51.350> also

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:51.499 
tips this is a tempered tip they also

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:53.440 
tips this is a tempered tip they also
come<00:01:51.770> in<00:01:51.859> a<00:01:51.920> standard<00:01:52.069> stainless<00:01:52.759> tip<00:01:53.210> is<00:01:53.420> a

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
come in a standard stainless tip is a

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.749 
come in a standard stainless tip is a
little<00:01:53.780> bit<00:01:53.869> cheaper<00:01:54.289> just<00:01:55.249> when<00:01:55.520> they<00:01:55.609> get

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
little bit cheaper just when they get

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.039 
little bit cheaper just when they get
really<00:01:55.939> nice<00:01:56.649> threads<00:01:57.649> are<00:01:57.829> the<00:01:57.859> same<00:01:58.929> and<00:01:59.929> you

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
really nice threads are the same and you

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.970 
really nice threads are the same and you
could<00:02:00.289> make<00:02:01.039> it<00:02:01.219> insane<00:02:01.780> too

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
could make it insane too

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:09.000 
could make it insane too
I<00:02:05.880> mind<00:02:06.880> yeah<00:02:07.120> not<00:02:07.570> fur<00:02:07.780> carp<00:02:08.050> I<00:02:08.320> don't<00:02:08.770> think<00:02:08.950> I

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.010 
I mind yeah not fur carp I don't think I

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.090 
I mind yeah not fur carp I don't think I
can<00:02:09.160> get<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:09.400> shot<00:02:09.640> all<00:02:09.760> the<00:02:09.850> way<00:02:09.910> through<00:02:11.100> but

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
can get the shot all the way through but

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.970 
can get the shot all the way through but
anyway<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.630> tips<00:02:14.230> are<00:02:14.410> replaced<00:02:14.740> what

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
anyway so the tips are replaced what

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.260 
anyway so the tips are replaced what
which<00:02:15.100> is<00:02:15.250> nice<00:02:15.460> if<00:02:15.850> you<00:02:15.970> scuff<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.480> tip<00:02:17.190> maybe

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
which is nice if you scuff the tip maybe

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.060 
which is nice if you scuff the tip maybe
tried<00:02:19.270> to<00:02:19.390> tip<00:02:19.570> off<00:02:19.750> on<00:02:19.990> a<00:02:20.020> rock<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:20.920> have

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
tried to tip off on a rock and you have

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.070 
tried to tip off on a rock and you have
an<00:02:21.190> extra<00:02:21.460> point<00:02:21.730> with<00:02:21.970> you<00:02:22.150> you<00:02:22.750> can<00:02:22.900> just

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
an extra point with you you can just

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.280 
an extra point with you you can just
change<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.470> point<00:02:23.830> out<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.840> keep<00:02:25.840> using<00:02:26.020> the

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
change the point out and keep using the

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.000 
change the point out and keep using the
same<00:02:26.580> subtle<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.980> I<00:02:30.780> have<00:02:31.780> uses<00:02:32.440> when<00:02:32.680> scuffed

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
same subtle so I have uses when scuffed

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.160 
same subtle so I have uses when scuffed
it<00:02:33.130> up<00:02:33.280> a<00:02:33.370> little<00:02:33.490> bit<00:02:33.790> I<00:02:33.970> filed<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.690> tip<00:02:34.870> back

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
it up a little bit I filed the tip back

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.530 
it up a little bit I filed the tip back
a<00:02:35.530> little<00:02:35.680> bit<00:02:35.920> I<00:02:36.190> thought<00:02:37.060> this<00:02:37.270> was<00:02:37.420> gonna

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
a little bit I thought this was gonna

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.450 
a little bit I thought this was gonna
put<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.810> big<00:02:38.050> damaging<00:02:38.620> hole<00:02:38.800> into<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.220> fish

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
put a big damaging hole into the fish

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.790 
put a big damaging hole into the fish
the<00:02:40.090> first<00:02:40.360> fish<00:02:40.660> I<00:02:40.780> came<00:02:40.990> across<00:02:41.230> with<00:02:41.560> it<00:02:41.680> I

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
the first fish I came across with it I

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.030 
the first fish I came across with it I
was<00:02:41.890> using<00:02:42.100> my<00:02:42.340> 55<00:02:42.850> centimeter<00:02:43.420> gun<00:02:43.860> it's<00:02:44.860> all

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
was using my 55 centimeter gun it's all

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.030 
was using my 55 centimeter gun it's all
I<00:02:45.070> had<00:02:45.400> I<00:02:45.730> couldn't<00:02:45.970> use<00:02:46.150> my<00:02:46.360> 90<00:02:46.780> because<00:02:47.710> of

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
I had I couldn't use my 90 because of

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.970 
I had I couldn't use my 90 because of
visibility<00:02:49.200> so<00:02:50.200> I<00:02:50.260> thought<00:02:50.500> well<00:02:50.680> I<00:02:50.740> want<00:02:50.920> to

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
visibility so I thought well I want to

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.770 
visibility so I thought well I want to
try<00:02:51.130> my<00:02:51.220> neat<00:02:51.520> point<00:02:51.820> so<00:02:52.240> I'm<00:02:52.300> gonna<00:02:52.450> try<00:02:52.720> it

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
try my neat point so I'm gonna try it

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.670 
try my neat point so I'm gonna try it
out<00:02:53.340> it's<00:02:54.340> really<00:02:54.490> streamlined<00:02:55.450> this<00:02:56.050> is<00:02:56.410> six

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
out it's really streamlined this is six

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.610 
out it's really streamlined this is six
seven<00:02:57.010> five<00:02:57.220> shaft<00:02:57.790> this<00:02:58.420> is<00:02:59.110> probably<00:02:59.500> about

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
seven five shaft this is probably about

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.020 
seven five shaft this is probably about
eight<00:02:59.980> millimeters<00:03:00.520> thick

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
eight millimeters thick

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.530 
eight millimeters thick
so<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.350> widest<00:03:02.860> point<00:03:03.100> on<00:03:03.340> here<00:03:03.640> is<00:03:04.120> maybe

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
so the widest point on here is maybe

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.050 
so the widest point on here is maybe
ignant<00:03:05.110> half<00:03:05.290> millimeters<00:03:05.830> thick<00:03:06.130> when<00:03:07.030> I

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
ignant half millimeters thick when I

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.050 
ignant half millimeters thick when I
shot<00:03:07.420> a<00:03:07.630> 12<00:03:07.959> inch<00:03:08.170> drum<00:03:08.560> I<00:03:08.920> shot<00:03:09.730> it<00:03:09.850> just

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
shot a 12 inch drum I shot it just

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.610 
shot a 12 inch drum I shot it just
behind<00:03:10.209> the<00:03:10.390> gill<00:03:10.570> plate<00:03:10.600> slightly<00:03:11.380> into<00:03:11.590> the

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
behind the gill plate slightly into the

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.080 
behind the gill plate slightly into the
meat<00:03:11.890> just<00:03:12.850> put<00:03:13.480> a<00:03:13.510> hole<00:03:13.750> in<00:03:13.780> it<00:03:14.050> that<00:03:14.260> was<00:03:14.709> I

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
meat just put a hole in it that was I

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.820 
meat just put a hole in it that was I
could<00:03:16.090> fit<00:03:16.330> a<00:03:16.360> pencil<00:03:16.840> through<00:03:17.020> and<00:03:17.410> it'd

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
could fit a pencil through and it'd

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.710 
could fit a pencil through and it'd
still<00:03:18.040> be<00:03:18.130> touching<00:03:18.520> on<00:03:18.580> all<00:03:18.730> sides<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:19.300> you

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
still be touching on all sides and you

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.750 
still be touching on all sides and you
know<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.989> fish<00:03:20.709> obviously<00:03:20.950> spread<00:03:21.459> and<00:03:21.610> team

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
know the fish obviously spread and team

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.670 
know the fish obviously spread and team
that<00:03:21.940> down<00:03:22.120> it<00:03:22.330> did<00:03:22.450> not<00:03:22.600> put<00:03:22.870> a<00:03:22.930> big<00:03:23.410> gaping

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
that down it did not put a big gaping

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.300 
that down it did not put a big gaping
hole<00:03:24.070> and<00:03:24.370> fit<00:03:24.550> I<00:03:25.030> was<00:03:25.750> really<00:03:26.620> surprised<00:03:27.070> at

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
hole and fit I was really surprised at

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.640 
hole and fit I was really surprised at
how<00:03:27.370> little<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:28.150> damage<00:03:28.570> was<00:03:28.780> to<00:03:29.020> the<00:03:29.050> fish<00:03:29.350> I

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
how little the damage was to the fish I

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.550 
how little the damage was to the fish I
went<00:03:30.220> on<00:03:30.280> to<00:03:30.400> shoot<00:03:30.640> a<00:03:30.910> couple<00:03:31.390> more<00:03:31.660> drum<00:03:32.020> a

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
went on to shoot a couple more drum a

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.979 
went on to shoot a couple more drum a
couple<00:03:33.100> apart<00:03:33.370> with<00:03:34.120> one<00:03:34.390> of<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:34.540> car<00:03:34.750> by<00:03:34.959> car

back<00:03:35.800> into<00:03:36.130> the<00:03:36.220> body<00:03:36.430> a<00:03:36.550> little<00:03:36.790> bit<00:03:36.970> further

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
back into the body a little bit further

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.110 
back into the body a little bit further
still<00:03:38.680> not<00:03:38.920> a<00:03:38.950> lot<00:03:39.160> of<00:03:39.190> damage<00:03:39.489> I<00:03:39.790> was<00:03:39.910> really

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.710 
but they're down in the notch and then
the<00:06:16.470> other<00:06:16.650> way<00:06:17.370> is<00:06:17.400> the<00:06:18.090> other<00:06:18.240> one<00:06:18.390> that<00:06:18.420> they

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
the other way is the other one that they

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.230 
the other way is the other one that they
come<00:06:18.990> with<00:06:19.020> is<00:06:19.470> a<00:06:19.530> standard<00:06:20.100> notch<00:06:20.700> in<00:06:21.150> the

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
come with is a standard notch in the

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.380 
come with is a standard notch in the
shaft<00:06:21.500> right<00:06:22.500> down<00:06:22.680> in<00:06:22.830> the<00:06:22.920> shaft<00:06:23.130> so<00:06:23.580> you

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.390 
shaft right down in the shaft so you

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.940 
shaft right down in the shaft so you
have<00:06:24.720> three<00:06:25.790> three<00:06:26.790> variations<00:06:27.090> on<00:06:27.510> that<00:06:27.660> up

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:27.950 
have three three variations on that up

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.340 
have three three variations on that up
but<00:06:28.950> the<00:06:29.160> torsion<00:06:29.640> two<00:06:29.960> looks<00:06:30.960> like<00:06:31.110> it<00:06:31.230> could

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.350 
but the torsion two looks like it could

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:37.220 
but the torsion two looks like it could
be<00:06:31.380> really<00:06:31.830> good<00:06:33.590> each<00:06:34.590> have<00:06:34.920> to<00:06:35.130> happen<00:06:36.230> so

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:37.230 
be really good each have to happen so

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.020 
be really good each have to happen so
that's<00:06:37.380> a<00:06:37.500> small<00:06:37.770> sample<00:06:38.220> once<00:06:38.400> Albemarle<00:06:38.880> has

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030 
that's a small sample once Albemarle has

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.840 
that's a small sample once Albemarle has
to<00:06:39.240> offer<00:06:39.800> some<00:06:40.800> of<00:06:40.830> the<00:06:41.040> tips<00:06:41.280> are<00:06:41.430> available

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850 
to offer some of the tips are available

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.700 
to offer some of the tips are available
