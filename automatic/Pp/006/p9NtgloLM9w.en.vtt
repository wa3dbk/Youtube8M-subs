should<00:03:10.550> recharge<00:03:11.550> your<00:03:11.730> battery<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:12.330> then<00:03:13.260> it

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
should recharge your battery and then it

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.440 
should recharge your battery and then it

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
will start on its own so if your battery

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.130 
will start on its own so if your battery
is<00:03:15.540> below<00:03:15.959> 78%<00:03:16.830> just<00:03:17.730> plug<00:03:18.360> in<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.660> charger

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.250 
is below 78% just plug in the charger
run<00:03:19.650> this<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.310> wait<00:03:23.300> this<00:03:24.300> will<00:03:24.540> now<00:03:24.720> take<00:03:24.780> I

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
run this and wait this will now take I

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.229 
run this and wait this will now take I
think<00:03:25.620> one<00:03:25.860> or<00:03:26.069> two<00:03:26.100> minutes<00:03:26.610> you<00:03:26.819> can<00:03:27.030> just

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
think one or two minutes you can just

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.030 
think one or two minutes you can just
skip<00:03:27.780> in<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.050> video<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:29.150> when<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:31.040> updater

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
skip in the video and when the updater

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.610 
skip in the video and when the updater
says<00:03:32.550> it's<00:03:32.940> around<00:03:33.300> 84%

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
says it's around 84%

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.430 
says it's around 84%
it's<00:03:35.000> practically<00:03:36.000> finished<00:03:36.450> because<00:03:36.720> this

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
it's practically finished because this

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.059 
it's practically finished because this
step<00:03:37.709> between<00:03:38.040> 84%<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:39.180> 100%<00:03:39.690> is<00:03:40.319> one<00:03:40.799> and<00:03:41.010> the

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
step between 84% and 100% is one and the

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.840 
step between 84% and 100% is one and the
very<00:03:41.250> same<00:03:41.610> so<00:03:42.510> if<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:43.290> reaches<00:03:43.739> 84%<00:03:44.400> it's

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
very same so if it reaches 84% it's

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:59.350 
very same so if it reaches 84% it's
finished

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.690 

those<00:04:00.020> will<00:04:00.260> of<00:04:00.440> course<00:04:00.740> work<00:04:00.950> with<00:04:01.310> any<00:04:01.490> kind

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
those will of course work with any kind

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.350 
those will of course work with any kind
