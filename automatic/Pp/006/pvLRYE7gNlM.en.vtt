00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.569
 show you now how to make a 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.550
 cut to a natural circle. 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.050
 I first made the wood cut 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.610
 using a great team 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.109
 you can see that there was not a cut 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.400
 perfect to put a radius of ten 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.699
 centimeters 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.789
 I already liked it, there's a mechanism here for 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.150
 that I can turn a part so that the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.080
 cutter just a ten-ray 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.430
 centimeters 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.280
 it works the be or mechanism that 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.890
 two ways of the same thickness 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.160
 the way I 'm going to make the cut 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.890
 a height difference on a ruler 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.460
 is flexible that to facilitate the 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.670
 part where I already liked is the 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.910
 distance between a bolt hole and 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:59.140
 up to the millimeter of 10 centimeters 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:03.190
 exactly so I can put 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:06.850
 the part that make fixing a sergeant 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.150
 way I can spin and make 1 to 1 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.990
 the precise cut lightning that what I 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.810
 wish 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:18.310
 It's good that we can see that the 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:22.500
 distance between the hole and points the cutter 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:25.900
 It has to be exactly 10 centimeters 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.710
 facilitate your fine tuning 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:33.210
 I recommend that you use the square 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.210
 to set the right angle 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.049
 take the fesa it is downloaded 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:16.600
 and here I was able to escape the wood and 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:21.730
 be aligned with the table to which the 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:23.560
 the procedure as the milling cutter is a 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.060
 into the wood that has a 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.910
 imperfect cut 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.840
 so I'll hold the wood, I'll go 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.870
 accomplish 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.330
 the ascent is frezza slowly to arrive 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.910
 to 10 cm and a little is to 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:41.260
 few I'm turning in the direction 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.150
 counterclockwise and the milling cutter rotates 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.120
 counter clockwise direction is also 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:50.250
 shape that will have worn the part 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.250
 exactly on the radio you want to 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.500
 an exact radius of 10 centimeters
