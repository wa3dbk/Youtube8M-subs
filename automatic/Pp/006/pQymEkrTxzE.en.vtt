00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.080 

so<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.950> want<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.190> start<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.549> recipe<00:01:08.790> by

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
so you want to start this recipe by

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.180 
so you want to start this recipe by
bringing<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.659> large<00:01:09.900> pot<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.380> water<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.979> boil

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
bringing a large pot of water to boil

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.640 
bringing a large pot of water to boil
and<00:01:11.610> then<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.510> want<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.900> quarter<00:01:13.470> your

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
and then you want to quarter your

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.200 
and then you want to quarter your
cabbage<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.369> would<00:01:14.549> have<00:01:14.640> been<00:01:14.759> really

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
cabbage this would have been really

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.609 
cabbage this would have been really
helpful<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.690> other<00:01:15.810> day<00:01:15.990> when<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.200> made<00:01:16.440> those

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
helpful the other day when I made those

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.590 
helpful the other day when I made those
cabbage<00:01:17.070> traps<00:01:17.280> but<00:01:17.700> quarter<00:01:18.060> your<00:01:18.180> cabbage

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
cabbage traps but quarter your cabbage

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.420 
cabbage traps but quarter your cabbage
and<00:01:18.810> if<00:01:18.930> they<00:01:19.049> still<00:01:19.350> have<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.680> core<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.220> them

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
and if they still have the core in them

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.330 
and if they still have the core in them
just<00:01:20.850> cut<00:01:21.180> diagonally<00:01:21.630> across<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.950> cabbage

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
just cut diagonally across the cabbage

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.160 
just cut diagonally across the cabbage
to<00:01:23.490> take<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.850> stem<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.509> core<00:01:24.720> out<00:01:24.899> and

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
to take the stem in the core out and

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.410 
to take the stem in the core out and
that's<00:01:25.710> much<00:01:26.009> easier<00:01:26.220> than<00:01:26.610> trying<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.970> core

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
that's much easier than trying to core

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.780 
that's much easier than trying to core
the<00:01:27.720> entire<00:01:27.750> head<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.710> cabbage<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.610> much

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
the entire head of cabbage so much

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.580 
the entire head of cabbage so much
easier<00:01:30.240> then<00:01:30.659> you're<00:01:30.840> going<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.049> go<00:01:31.170> ahead<00:01:31.259> and

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
easier then you're going to go ahead and

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.889 
easier then you're going to go ahead and
slice<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.280> cabbage<00:01:32.460> into<00:01:33.119> about<00:01:33.509> an<00:01:33.690> inch

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
slice the cabbage into about an inch

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.109 
slice the cabbage into about an inch
thick<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.560> whisk<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.369> don't<00:01:35.700> even<00:01:35.970> really

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
thick and whisk you don't even really

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.940 
thick and whisk you don't even really
