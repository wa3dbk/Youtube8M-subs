00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.060
 the working ladies do not pass to 5 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.810
 rounds of play in the top class 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.189
 Saturday 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.539
 have a thunderstorm due to rainfall 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.649
 we are filming the match unfortunately 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.239
 have to strike 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:35.100
 which means that we only give you the goal from the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.420
 first half 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.399
 after just four minutes it was a hit 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.350
 cossack boys then that maria lukoki one 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.190
 beautiful e2 entered with nassen l 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.059
 creati 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.059
 and complete it yourself 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.060
 according to the game of working ladies 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.470
 a little less true by hagen wim van 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.470
 the sea could score the equalizer 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.050
 Richie Basoski took care of the break 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.129
 sure cossack boys still with one 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.129
 ahead after the tea bowl 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.400
 in the second half it was again 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.350
 torture coki who was accurate and the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.000
 three points suggested safe 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.770
 after the game spar cossack boys tv 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.330
 with danny buijs who was happy with the 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.060
 fast lead 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.560
 go everything very quickly that's nice too 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.300
 had to say the approaching smooth one 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.800
 fifteen minutes tricky score not phase score 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.970
 by one also one one 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.220
 but must say about whole match 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.230
 considering that oh absolutely fat thinks 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.280
 deservedly have just turned 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.010
 lukoki scored twice 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.400
 yes yes the we know that they score 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.110
 power 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.780
 then i have a baby powell can one 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.250
 goal nice days the week before 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.680
 the first time since an injury shoot 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.030
 is coming again 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.200
 yes those are all guys who do have one 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.930
 have quite some scoring ability 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.790
 van Samen was injured today 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.470
 jaro and was shot last Thursday 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.990
 it's a bit lonely string we'll give them a moment 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.310
 wait and see what it is exactly 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.280
 then we will continue to next Tuesday 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.410
 look at the physio jesper who had what 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.780
 burden during the competition 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.979
 yes if you have 30 games or 40 if we 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.479
 the my footballs are always there 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.460
 twenty or thirty in between where you what 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.110
 minor gripes in've 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.270
 then there must be a better but even there 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.900
 come running you've been leading since 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.940
 today 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.470
 yes they happen to close lady because 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.390
 who said that during the game like it 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.650
 so he stays on top 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.900
 then as you big compliment to that 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.670
 group and because I mean go for it 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.100
 are in the top class 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.150
 Many new boys will turn boys off 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.220
 injuries 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.470
 well just played 5 12 they are 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.269
 big compliment to them but me 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.830
 happens to be fat with that yes we do 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.360
 can be the better pass after 30 games 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.519
 because last year I had a whole 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.989
 time at the top ultimately counts 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.209
 that doesn't end up being that when the 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.239
 to 30 games it says after Tuesday 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.290
 NFL cup sporting spirit 46 you go you go 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.390
 change in the setup 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.549
 no, because I have to tell you honestly and 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.920
 that is not too often that it is a trainers 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.570
 clichÃ© but we now have two 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.920
 let people watch sport 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.260
 I don't know what they do today 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.000
 have done that for 2 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.739
 played 6 I believe seven or eight goals 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 made 0 against and just seem real 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.170
 to be a very decent team 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.940
 maybe just from 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.170
 main class level 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.430
 so yes then we do not have the team the 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.210
 name that to underestimate because then 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.490
 so you can just have a hard time too 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.540
 full strength now we expect 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.110
 go to great lengths to accuracy 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.910
 so win 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.350
 more Monday but see how how 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.460
 we have entered this competition and then 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.540
 are also going to prepare us for again 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.640
 Tuesday 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.770
 First victory still enjoy it 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.120
 I just insure the boys 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.620
 by as you tuck the amount of energy 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.820
 and I find all today also in phases 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.040
 really have pretty good football 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.660
 played a lot of opportunities 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.860
 made some nice goals so then 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.010
 those guys deserve even to them to 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.010
 to enjoy
