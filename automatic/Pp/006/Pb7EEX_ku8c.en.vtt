switching over to pc gaming trying to

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.170 
switching over to pc gaming trying to
you<00:04:17.570> know<00:04:17.599> upgrade<00:04:18.289> to<00:04:18.560> next-gen<00:04:19.099> it<00:04:19.699> did<00:04:19.909> take

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
you know upgrade to next-gen it did take

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.659 
you know upgrade to next-gen it did take
me<00:04:20.209> a<00:04:20.419> while<00:04:20.630> compared<00:04:21.229> to<00:04:21.320> everything<00:04:21.739> but<00:04:22.610> I

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
me a while compared to everything but I

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.760 
me a while compared to everything but I

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
didn't really want to get a next-gen

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.189
