00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
that being said of course we will begin

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.300 
that being said of course we will begin
by<00:02:27.150> showcasing<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.200> action<00:02:28.800> feature<00:02:29.010> which

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
by showcasing the action feature which

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.370 
by showcasing the action feature which
is<00:02:29.489> of<00:02:29.580> course<00:02:29.760> our<00:02:30.030> key<00:02:30.420> right<00:02:30.600> here<00:02:30.870> so

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
is of course our key right here so

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.080 
is of course our key right here so
basically<00:02:31.709> what<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.069> get<00:02:32.220> is<00:02:32.280> this<00:02:32.580> key<00:02:32.880> and

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
basically what you get is this key and

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.940 
basically what you get is this key and
as<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:33.480> can<00:02:33.600> see<00:02:33.780> by<00:02:34.020> pressing<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.500> button<00:02:34.800> it

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
as you can see by pressing the button it

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.930 
as you can see by pressing the button it
basically<00:02:35.750> kind<00:02:36.750> of<00:02:36.840> pushes<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.560> lever

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
basically kind of pushes the lever

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.820 
basically kind of pushes the lever
forward<00:02:38.940> here<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:39.480> all<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.350> have<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.530> do<00:02:40.709> is

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
forward here and all you have to do is

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.040 
forward here and all you have to do is
load<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.190> into<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.700> butt<00:02:42.030> of<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.300> car<00:02:42.780> or<00:02:43.019> I

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
load it into the butt of the car or I

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.470 
load it into the butt of the car or I
guess<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.290> back<00:02:43.860> end<00:02:44.160> of<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.489> car<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.970> then

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
guess the back end of the car and then

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.229 
guess the back end of the car and then
all<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.080> do<00:02:46.230> is<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.830> press<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.430> button<00:02:47.730> and

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.850 

spider-man<00:02:51.239> goes<00:02:51.510> rushing<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.290> action<00:02:52.769> I

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
spider-man goes rushing to action I

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.340 
spider-man goes rushing to action I
guess<00:02:53.070> and<00:02:53.820> honestly<00:02:54.360> this<00:02:54.480> launch<00:02:54.780> is<00:02:54.930> pretty

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
guess and honestly this launch is pretty

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.320 
guess and honestly this launch is pretty
well<00:02:55.590> so<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.010> will<00:02:56.400> get<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.640> nice<00:02:56.880> amount<00:02:57.180> of

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
well so you will get a nice amount of

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.880 
well so you will get a nice amount of
distance<00:02:57.690> out<00:02:57.870> of<00:02:57.900> these<00:02:58.140> keys<00:02:58.470> which<00:02:58.739> is<00:02:58.860> a

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
distance out of these keys which is a

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.070 
distance out of these keys which is a
really<00:02:59.250> really<00:02:59.370> fun<00:02:59.600> little<00:03:00.600> gimmick<00:03:00.900> so

spider-man<00:03:23.130> relies<00:03:23.489> on<00:03:23.519> a<00:03:23.820> plentiful<00:03:24.540> amount

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
similarly to deliver it of course they

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.670 
similarly to deliver it of course they
share<00:03:29.700> those<00:03:29.880> weapons<00:03:30.150> of<00:03:31.079> course<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.500> cool

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
share those weapons of course the cool

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.979 
share those weapons of course the cool
thing<00:03:31.860> here<00:03:31.890> is<00:03:32.190> that<00:03:32.220> you<00:03:32.459> can<00:03:32.670> maneuver<00:03:33.600> both

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
thing here is that you can maneuver both

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.920 
thing here is that you can maneuver both
the<00:03:34.680> connection<00:03:35.160> point<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:35.730> move<00:03:36.299> around<00:03:36.420> to

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
the connection point and move around to

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.470 
the connection point and move around to
where<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.310> blaster<00:03:38.310> will<00:03:38.459> be<00:03:38.609> pointing<00:03:39.000> as<00:03:39.150> I

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
where the blaster will be pointing as I

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.539 
where the blaster will be pointing as I
said<00:03:39.660> before<00:03:39.810> these<00:03:40.590> made<00:03:40.950> me<00:03:41.130> really<00:03:41.519> feel

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
said before these made me really feel

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.640 
said before these made me really feel
like<00:03:41.940> it<00:03:42.120> would<00:03:42.239> be<00:03:42.299> awesome<00:03:42.570> to<00:03:42.810> see<00:03:43.049> a<00:03:43.079> Marvel

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
like it would be awesome to see a Marvel

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.580 
like it would be awesome to see a Marvel
type<00:03:44.070> like<00:03:44.609> Mario<00:03:45.030> Kart<00:03:45.060> type<00:03:45.570> game<00:03:45.840> where

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
type like Mario Kart type game where

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.840 
type like Mario Kart type game where
there<00:03:46.799> are<00:03:46.890> weapons<00:03:47.100> and<00:03:47.459> stuff<00:03:47.609> like<00:03:47.730> that

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
there are weapons and stuff like that

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.370 
there are weapons and stuff like that
maybe<00:03:48.060> that's<00:03:48.329> been<00:03:48.570> done<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:48.870> I<00:03:48.959> just<00:03:49.170> don't

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
maybe that's been done and I just don't

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.660 
maybe that's been done and I just don't
know<00:03:49.560> of<00:03:49.590> it<00:03:49.739> but<00:03:49.980> I<00:03:50.010> think<00:03:50.130> that<00:03:50.430> that<00:03:50.579> would

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
know of it but I think that that would

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.640 
know of it but I think that that would
have<00:03:50.730> been<00:03:50.820> a<00:03:50.940> really<00:03:51.239> sweet<00:03:51.600> idea<00:03:51.780> of<00:03:52.170> course

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
have been a really sweet idea of course

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.800 
have been a really sweet idea of course
the<00:03:52.829> cannons<00:03:53.250> or<00:03:53.549> the<00:03:53.970> Rockets<00:03:54.390> working<00:03:54.720> the

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
the cannons or the Rockets working the

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.500 
the cannons or the Rockets working the
exact<00:03:55.140> same<00:03:55.320> manner<00:03:56.100> I<00:03:56.640> like<00:03:57.150> of<00:03:57.239> some<00:03:57.390> of<00:03:57.450> the

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
exact same manner I like of some of the

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.849 
exact same manner I like of some of the
little<00:03:57.690> details<00:03:57.840> like<00:03:58.109> for<00:03:58.290> example<00:03:58.350> up<00:03:58.709> at

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
little details like for example up at

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:00.860 
little details like for example up at
the<00:03:58.920> front<00:03:59.160> here<00:03:59.430> this<00:04:00.060> little<00:04:00.359> part<00:04:00.690> of<00:04:00.750> the

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
the front here this little part of the

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.569 
the front here this little part of the
hood<00:04:01.019> kind<00:04:01.350> of<00:04:01.410> looks<00:04:01.590> like<00:04:01.709> a<00:04:01.799> muscle<00:04:02.370> car

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
hood kind of looks like a muscle car

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.160 
hood kind of looks like a muscle car
type<00:04:02.880> thing<00:04:03.120> that<00:04:03.299> you<00:04:03.420> would<00:04:03.540> see<00:04:03.750> something

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
that you would see on a muscle car I

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.069 
that you would see on a muscle car I
should<00:04:05.760> say<00:04:06.090> so<00:04:06.540> that's<00:04:06.690> a<00:04:06.750> nice<00:04:06.930> little

detailed shot
of<00:04:22.750> spider-man<00:04:23.379> I'm<00:04:23.590> gonna<00:04:23.740> do<00:04:23.860> my<00:04:23.979> best

of spider-man I'm gonna do my best

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:26.459 
of spider-man I'm gonna do my best
though<00:04:24.460> but<00:04:25.330> obviously<00:04:25.810> you<00:04:25.930> can<00:04:26.110> see<00:04:26.289> mr.

00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:26.469 
though but obviously you can see mr.

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:27.990 
though but obviously you can see mr.
spider-man<00:04:27.219> right<00:04:27.490> here

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
spider-man right here

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.360 
spider-man right here
so<00:04:28.300> unfortunately<00:04:28.449> he<00:04:28.990> lacks<00:04:29.199> a<00:04:29.620> lot<00:04:30.069> of<00:04:30.219> data

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
so unfortunately he lacks a lot of data

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.790 
so unfortunately he lacks a lot of data
I<00:04:30.550> mean<00:04:30.699> they<00:04:30.849> have<00:04:31.270> sculpted<00:04:31.750> in<00:04:31.870> the<00:04:32.050> webs

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
I mean they have sculpted in the webs

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.800 
I mean they have sculpted in the webs
and<00:04:33.009> stuff<00:04:33.280> but<00:04:33.879> they're<00:04:34.030> not<00:04:34.180> even<00:04:34.419> painted

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
and stuff but they're not even painted

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.260 
and stuff but they're not even painted
so<00:04:35.110> it<00:04:35.650> definitely<00:04:36.009> gives<00:04:36.370> it<00:04:36.460> a<00:04:36.550> feel<00:04:36.759> of<00:04:36.819> kind

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
so it definitely gives it a feel of kind

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.450 
so it definitely gives it a feel of kind
of<00:04:37.360> like<00:04:37.509> you<00:04:37.629> know<00:04:37.750> how<00:04:37.900> spider-man<00:04:38.500> looks<00:04:39.039> in

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
of like you know how spider-man looks in

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.670 
of like you know how spider-man looks in
the<00:04:39.849> first<00:04:40.449> spider-man<00:04:40.930> movie<00:04:41.319> I<00:04:41.379> think<00:04:41.469> it

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
the first spider-man movie I think it

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.860 
the first spider-man movie I think it
was<00:04:41.800> maybe<00:04:42.009> as<00:04:42.129> the<00:04:42.280> second<00:04:42.610> one<00:04:42.699> actually

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
was maybe as the second one actually

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.959 
was maybe as the second one actually
were<00:04:43.870> before<00:04:44.680> he<00:04:44.800> becomes<00:04:44.979> spider-man<00:04:45.550> he<00:04:45.759> has

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:45.969 
were before he becomes spider-man he has

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:48.089 
were before he becomes spider-man he has
liked<00:04:46.180> his<00:04:46.389> spider-man<00:04:47.229> wrestling<00:04:47.889> persona

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
liked his spider-man wrestling persona

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:50.820 
liked his spider-man wrestling persona
so<00:04:48.849> this<00:04:49.000> is<00:04:49.090> kind<00:04:49.360> of<00:04:49.449> much<00:04:49.930> more<00:04:49.960> that<00:04:50.500> kind

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
so this is kind of much more that kind

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.439 
so this is kind of much more that kind
of<00:04:50.889> look<00:04:51.099> because<00:04:51.400> the<00:04:51.610> white<00:04:51.789> gloves<00:04:52.180> here

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
the spider logo or at least at the

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.800 
the spider logo or at least at the
beginning<00:04:59.020> of<00:04:59.319> the<00:04:59.409> spider<00:04:59.650> logo<00:05:00.009> there<00:05:00.189> so

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
beginning of the spider logo there so

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.209 
beginning of the spider logo there so
definitely<00:05:01.810> a<00:05:01.960> little<00:05:02.620> bit<00:05:02.740> of<00:05:03.069> a

00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:03.219 
definitely a little bit of a

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:05.040 
definitely a little bit of a
disappointing<00:05:03.789> minifigure<00:05:04.300> and<00:05:04.449> especially

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
disappointing minifigure and especially

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.360 
disappointing minifigure and especially
of<00:05:05.110> course<00:05:05.169> because<00:05:05.620> it's<00:05:05.800> not<00:05:06.069> really<00:05:06.340> a

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
of course because it's not really a

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.779 
of course because it's not really a
minifigure<00:05:06.759> it's<00:05:06.909> more<00:05:07.029> like<00:05:07.150> a<00:05:07.180> mini<00:05:07.509> head

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
minifigure it's more like a mini head

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.369 
minifigure it's more like a mini head
but<00:05:09.789> I<00:05:10.029> would<00:05:10.449> be<00:05:10.599> nice<00:05:10.779> to<00:05:10.960> obviously<00:05:11.199> get<00:05:11.349> a

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:11.379 
but I would be nice to obviously get a

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:13.800 
but I would be nice to obviously get a
whole<00:05:11.560> figure<00:05:11.800> but<00:05:12.099> unfortunately<00:05:12.669> that<00:05:13.479> is

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
whole figure but unfortunately that is

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.100 
whole figure but unfortunately that is
not<00:05:14.439> the<00:05:15.099> case<00:05:15.310> and<00:05:15.729> we're<00:05:16.689> gonna<00:05:16.810> have<00:05:16.960> to

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
not the case and we're gonna have to

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.490 
not the case and we're gonna have to
kind<00:05:17.409> of<00:05:17.560> just<00:05:18.840> accept<00:05:19.840> it<00:05:19.990> at<00:05:20.110> this<00:05:20.229> point

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
kind of just accept it at this point

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.080 
kind of just accept it at this point
some<00:05:21.009> things<00:05:21.219> that<00:05:21.370> I<00:05:21.400> do<00:05:21.490> like<00:05:21.729> about<00:05:21.789> the

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
some things that I do like about the

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.429 
some things that I do like about the
part<00:05:22.330> is<00:05:22.509> of<00:05:22.659> course<00:05:22.870> the<00:05:23.020> wheels

00:05:23.429 --> 00:05:23.439 
part is of course the wheels

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:25.350 
part is of course the wheels
I<00:05:23.500> like<00:05:23.860> the<00:05:24.099> key<00:05:24.279> gimmick<00:05:24.639> I<00:05:24.729> think<00:05:24.939> it's<00:05:25.090> fun

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
I like the key gimmick I think it's fun

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.379 
I like the key gimmick I think it's fun
I<00:05:25.389> think<00:05:25.629> it's<00:05:25.840> very<00:05:26.440> very<00:05:26.710> powerful<00:05:27.580> for<00:05:27.940> what

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
I think it's very very powerful for what

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.200 
I think it's very very powerful for what
it<00:05:28.479> is<00:05:28.509> and<00:05:28.900> it<00:05:29.560> creates<00:05:29.830> a<00:05:29.889> fun<00:05:30.099> little<00:05:30.219> way<00:05:31.150> to

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
it is and it creates a fun little way to

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.779 
it is and it creates a fun little way to
play<00:05:31.569> around<00:05:31.779> with<00:05:32.139> these<00:05:32.949> racers<00:05:33.250> it's<00:05:33.669> a

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:33.789 
play around with these racers it's a

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:35.879 
play around with these racers it's a
really<00:05:34.180> simple<00:05:34.389> build<00:05:34.839> it<00:05:35.259> doesn't<00:05:35.710> take<00:05:35.860> very

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
really simple build it doesn't take very

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:38.279 
really simple build it doesn't take very
long<00:05:36.400> whatsoever<00:05:37.270> in<00:05:37.449> fact<00:05:37.719> I<00:05:37.870> would<00:05:37.990> probably

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
long whatsoever in fact I would probably

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.559 
long whatsoever in fact I would probably
say<00:05:38.440> that<00:05:38.469> I<00:05:38.919> kid<00:05:39.550> could<00:05:39.909> probably<00:05:40.150> even<00:05:40.300> have

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:40.569 
say that I kid could probably even have

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:42.689 
say that I kid could probably even have
this<00:05:40.719> assembled<00:05:41.259> in<00:05:41.379> ten<00:05:41.680> to<00:05:41.949> fifteen<00:05:42.339> minutes

have to give it a solid seven point five
out<00:06:14.409> of<00:06:14.589> ten<00:06:14.800> I<00:06:14.979> think<00:06:15.009> it's<00:06:15.310> a<00:06:15.430> fun<00:06:15.759> little<00:06:15.789> toy

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:16.539 
out of ten I think it's a fun little toy

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:20.100 
out of ten I think it's a fun little toy
and<00:06:16.810> definitely<00:06:17.560> for<00:06:18.479> two<00:06:19.479> or<00:06:19.629> three<00:06:19.839> bucks

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
and definitely for two or three bucks

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.719 
and definitely for two or three bucks
depending<00:06:20.710> on<00:06:20.800> how<00:06:20.889> much<00:06:21.039> you<00:06:21.189> pay<00:06:21.370> for<00:06:21.400> it

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:21.729 
depending on how much you pay for it

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:24.179 
depending on how much you pay for it
it's<00:06:22.089> definitely<00:06:22.419> worth<00:06:22.930> while<00:06:23.469> the<00:06:23.800> pickup

00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:24.189 
it's definitely worth while the pickup

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:26.010 
it's definitely worth while the pickup
or<00:06:24.460> worth<00:06:24.819> the<00:06:25.060> pickup<00:06:25.360> that<00:06:25.599> would<00:06:25.689> make<00:06:25.870> more

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.020 
or worth the pickup that would make more

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.260 
or worth the pickup that would make more
sense<00:06:26.080> but<00:06:26.680> unless<00:06:27.009> of<00:06:27.250> course<00:06:27.279> guys<00:06:27.729> I<00:06:28.029> hope

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
sense but unless of course guys I hope

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.339
