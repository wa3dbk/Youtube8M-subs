00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
summery look I would like to do a summer

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.960

wave<00:00:45.250> it<00:00:45.780> expands<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:47.170> hair<00:00:47.610> more<00:00:48.610> than<00:00:48.940> a

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
wave it expands the hair more than a

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.850 
wave it expands the hair more than a
curl<00:00:49.300> because<00:00:49.780> you're<00:00:49.900> doing<00:00:50.170> more<00:00:50.350> of<00:00:50.410> an<00:00:50.590> S

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
curl because you're doing more of an S

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.420 
curl because you're doing more of an S
wave<00:00:51.340> than<00:00:52.000> a<00:00:52.270> circular<00:00:53.140> wave<00:00:53.410> most<00:00:54.130> people

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
wave than a circular wave most people

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.400 
wave than a circular wave most people
would<00:00:54.640> think<00:00:54.850> a<00:00:55.060> curl<00:00:55.390> is<00:00:55.600> a<00:00:55.630> curl<00:00:55.870> what's<00:00:56.230> the

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
would think a curl is a curl what's the

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.590 
would think a curl is a curl what's the
difference<00:00:56.740> well<00:00:57.280> there<00:00:57.910> is<00:00:58.090> a<00:00:58.120> difference

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
difference well there is a difference

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.500 
difference well there is a difference
this<00:00:58.900> look<00:00:59.260> can<00:00:59.800> be<00:00:59.980> done<00:01:00.220> on<00:01:00.490> any<00:01:00.910> length<00:01:01.300> of

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
this look can be done on any length of

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.420 
this look can be done on any length of
hair<00:01:01.720> but<00:01:02.140> it<00:01:02.290> looks<00:01:02.590> the<00:01:02.800> best<00:01:03.010> when<00:01:03.310> you<00:01:03.400> have

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
hair but it looks the best when you have

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.930 
hair but it looks the best when you have
a<00:01:03.610> little<00:01:03.820> bit<00:01:03.970> more<00:01:04.180> length<00:01:04.800> so<00:01:05.800> you<00:01:06.280> know

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
a little bit more length so you know

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.940 
a little bit more length so you know
mine's<00:01:07.270> pretty<00:01:07.509> long<00:01:07.840> but<00:01:08.290> even<00:01:08.410> if<00:01:08.619> your<00:01:08.770> hair

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
mine's pretty long but even if your hair

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.700 
mine's pretty long but even if your hair
was<00:01:09.190> in<00:01:09.490> here<00:01:10.150> it<00:01:10.810> would<00:01:10.960> still<00:01:11.259> work<00:01:11.440> pretty

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
was in here it would still work pretty

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.109 
was in here it would still work pretty
well<00:01:11.800> it<00:01:12.250> just<00:01:12.280> kind<00:01:12.610> of<00:01:12.670> gives<00:01:12.790> you<00:01:12.880> a<00:01:12.910> lot<00:01:13.090> of

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
well it just kind of gives you a lot of

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.210 
well it just kind of gives you a lot of
fullness<00:01:13.450> so<00:01:13.899> those<00:01:14.229> people<00:01:14.440> who<00:01:14.619> have<00:01:14.979> like

you'll<00:01:50.110> also<00:01:50.350> need<00:01:50.649> some<00:01:50.709> sort<00:01:51.160> of<00:01:51.250> paste<00:01:51.610> or

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
you'll also need some sort of paste or

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.430 
you'll also need some sort of paste or
clay<00:01:52.240> to<00:01:52.539> kind<00:01:52.780> of<00:01:52.869> give<00:01:52.990> a<00:01:53.020> little<00:01:53.110> bit<00:01:53.350> of

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
clay to kind of give a little bit of

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.510 
clay to kind of give a little bit of
texture<00:01:54.100> to<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.429> curls<00:01:54.729> and<00:01:55.860> flexible<00:01:56.860> wrists

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
texture to the curls and flexible wrists

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.779 
texture to the curls and flexible wrists
that's<00:01:58.209> right<00:01:58.660> because<00:01:59.170> this<00:01:59.560> requires<00:02:00.220> a<00:02:00.459> lot

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
that's right because this requires a lot

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.120 
that's right because this requires a lot
of<00:02:01.090> bending<00:02:01.840> so<00:02:02.880> if<00:02:03.880> you<00:02:04.090> got<00:02:04.240> carpal<00:02:04.690> tunnel

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
of bending so if you got carpal tunnel

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.850 
of bending so if you got carpal tunnel
skip<00:02:06.130> to<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:06.429> next<00:02:06.700> video<00:02:07.289> so<00:02:08.289> before<00:02:08.649> you<00:02:08.740> do

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
skip to the next video so before you do

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.910 
skip to the next video so before you do
any<00:02:09.069> curling<00:02:09.640> spray<00:02:10.240> your<00:02:10.479> hair<00:02:10.720> all<00:02:10.929> over<00:02:10.990> you

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
any curling spray your hair all over you

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.800 
any curling spray your hair all over you
want<00:02:12.160> to<00:02:12.250> really<00:02:12.640> get<00:02:12.940> a<00:02:13.120> lot<00:02:13.330> of<00:02:13.450> spray<00:02:13.780> on

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
want to really get a lot of spray on

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.630 
want to really get a lot of spray on
that<00:02:14.260> hair<00:02:14.530> so<00:02:14.890> that<00:02:15.040> when<00:02:15.190> you<00:02:15.280> go<00:02:15.430> through

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
that hair so that when you go through

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.690 
that hair so that when you go through
and<00:02:15.819> curl<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.209> it<00:02:16.420> sets<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:17.200> curl<00:02:17.440> so<00:02:18.370> this<00:02:18.550> is

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
and curl it it sets the curl so this is

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.190 
and curl it it sets the curl so this is
basically<00:02:19.060> how<00:02:19.209> you<00:02:19.360> do<00:02:19.630> a<00:02:19.660> summer<00:02:19.959> wave

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
basically how you do a summer wave

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.170 
basically how you do a summer wave
you're<00:02:20.470> basically<00:02:20.770> just<00:02:20.860> rocking<00:02:21.550> that<00:02:21.760> iron

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
you're basically just rocking that iron

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.449 
you're basically just rocking that iron
on<00:02:22.480> its<00:02:22.780> edges<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.500> then<00:02:23.650> pulling<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.190> down

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
on its edges and then pulling it down

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.460 
on its edges and then pulling it down
rocking<00:02:25.270> it<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.599> other<00:02:25.750> side<00:02:26.080> and<00:02:26.290> pulling

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
rocking it to the other side and pulling

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.259 
rocking it to the other side and pulling
it<00:02:26.680> down<00:02:26.860> so<00:02:27.580> we're<00:02:27.700> going<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:27.849> do<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.000> close-up

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
it down so we're going to do a close-up

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.289 
it down so we're going to do a close-up
look<00:02:28.659> so<00:02:28.840> we're<00:02:28.989> turning<00:02:29.349> it<00:02:29.470> on<00:02:29.560> its<00:02:29.620> side

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
look so we're turning it on its side

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.640 
look so we're turning it on its side
pulling<00:02:31.299> it<00:02:31.420> a<00:02:31.480> little<00:02:31.629> bit<00:02:31.810> turn<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.349> on<00:02:32.500> its

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
pulling it a little bit turn it on its

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.600 
pulling it a little bit turn it on its
side<00:02:32.950> pull

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
side pull

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.580 
side pull
down<00:02:33.820> a<00:02:33.850> little<00:02:34.000> bit<00:02:34.390> then<00:02:35.110> we're<00:02:35.260> gonna<00:02:35.320> turn

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
down a little bit then we're gonna turn

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.650 
down a little bit then we're gonna turn
on<00:02:35.710> its<00:02:35.920> other<00:02:36.070> side<00:02:36.160> pull<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.180> down<00:02:37.390> a<00:02:37.420> little

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
on its other side pull it down a little

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.050 
on its other side pull it down a little
bit<00:02:37.930> turn<00:02:38.710> it<00:02:38.860> on<00:02:38.950> its<00:02:39.100> other<00:02:39.280> side<00:02:39.370> pull<00:02:40.030> it

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
bit turn it on its other side pull it

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.270 
bit turn it on its other side pull it
down<00:02:40.300> a<00:02:40.330> bit<00:02:40.510> so<00:02:40.900> it's<00:02:41.380> pretty<00:02:41.530> simple<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:42.220> if

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
down a bit so it's pretty simple and if

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.890 
down a bit so it's pretty simple and if
you<00:02:42.370> think<00:02:42.580> about<00:02:42.760> it<00:02:42.970> and<00:02:43.150> make<00:02:43.330> sense<00:02:43.600> how

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
you think about it and make sense how

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
you think about it and make sense how
you're<00:02:44.080> doing<00:02:44.320> it<00:02:44.440> you're<00:02:44.530> kind<00:02:44.740> of<00:02:44.770> just

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
you're doing it you're kind of just

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.740 
you're doing it you're kind of just
kinking<00:02:45.430> that<00:02:45.610> hair<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.330> need<00:02:46.510> to<00:02:46.630> go

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
kinking that hair and you need to go

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.900 
kinking that hair and you need to go
pretty<00:02:47.050> slow<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.770> you<00:02:48.280> don't<00:02:48.430> want<00:02:48.580> to<00:02:48.670> pull

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
pretty slow and you don't want to pull

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.360 
pretty slow and you don't want to pull
too<00:02:48.940> much<00:02:49.240> at<00:02:49.750> a<00:02:49.810> time<00:02:50.050> because<00:02:51.040> then<00:02:51.220> you'll

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
too much at a time because then you'll

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.150 
too much at a time because then you'll
have<00:02:51.430> too<00:02:51.970> long<00:02:52.570> of<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:52.960> wave<00:02:53.140> if<00:02:53.470> you<00:02:53.890> want<00:02:54.040> to

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
have too long of a wave if you want to

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.440 
have too long of a wave if you want to
be<00:02:54.280> really<00:02:54.490> kinky<00:02:54.670> you<00:02:54.940> need<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.180> go<00:02:55.270> a<00:02:55.300> little

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
be really kinky you need to go a little

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.260 
be really kinky you need to go a little
slower<00:02:56.100> so<00:02:57.100> we're<00:02:57.250> just<00:02:57.280> gonna<00:02:57.520> take<00:02:57.790> sections

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
slower so we're just gonna take sections

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.090 
slower so we're just gonna take sections
all<00:02:58.540> over<00:02:58.840> our<00:02:58.960> head<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.230> do<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.590> summer<00:02:59.830> wave

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
all over our head and do the summer wave

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.190 
all over our head and do the summer wave
in<00:03:00.370> alternating<00:03:00.970> directions<00:03:01.240> so<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.900> curls

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
in alternating directions so the curls

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.220 
in alternating directions so the curls
are<00:03:02.350> not<00:03:02.560> going<00:03:02.800> all<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.280> same<00:03:03.520> way<00:03:03.959> then<00:03:04.959> once

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
are not going all the same way then once

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.260 
are not going all the same way then once
you<00:03:05.350> get<00:03:05.500> done<00:03:05.680> curling<00:03:06.010> all<00:03:06.310> of<00:03:06.459> your<00:03:06.610> hair<00:03:06.940> go

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
you get done curling all of your hair go

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.270 
you get done curling all of your hair go
ahead<00:03:07.450> and<00:03:07.600> take<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:08.080> dry<00:03:08.410> texturizing<00:03:09.040> spray

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
ahead and take the dry texturizing spray

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.370 
ahead and take the dry texturizing spray
from<00:03:09.580> or<00:03:09.820> BAE<00:03:10.060> or<00:03:10.300> some<00:03:10.660> other<00:03:10.810> texturizing

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
from or BAE or some other texturizing

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.170 
from or BAE or some other texturizing
spray<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:12.040> just<00:03:12.220> spray<00:03:12.489> it<00:03:12.520> throughout<00:03:12.940> your

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
spray and just spray it throughout your

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.180 
spray and just spray it throughout your
hair<00:03:13.420> this<00:03:14.110> is<00:03:14.290> basically<00:03:14.560> it's<00:03:14.860> basically

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
hair this is basically it's basically

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.860 
hair this is basically it's basically
just<00:03:15.430> gonna<00:03:15.640> give<00:03:15.910> your<00:03:16.030> hair<00:03:16.209> some<00:03:16.239> texture

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
just gonna give your hair some texture

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.150 
just gonna give your hair some texture
so<00:03:17.050> it's<00:03:17.170> not<00:03:17.290> so<00:03:17.560> soft

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
so it's not so soft

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.190 
so it's not so soft
another<00:03:18.940> way<00:03:19.120> of<00:03:19.270> doing<00:03:19.390> this<00:03:19.630> is<00:03:19.690> taking<00:03:20.110> a

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
another way of doing this is taking a

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.510 
another way of doing this is taking a
paste<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:20.860> rubbing<00:03:21.130> it<00:03:21.220> through<00:03:21.400> your

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
paste and rubbing it through your

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.850 
paste and rubbing it through your
fingers<00:03:21.940> you<00:03:22.690> can<00:03:22.810> put<00:03:23.020> some<00:03:23.170> in<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.470> roots<00:03:23.680> of

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
fingers you can put some in the roots of
