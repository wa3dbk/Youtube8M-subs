00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
you see it's pretty thick knife has a

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:35.829 
you see it's pretty thick knife has a
really<00:05:34.879> comfortable<00:05:35.269> handle

really comfortable handle

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:38.319 
really comfortable handle
I<00:05:35.869> like<00:05:36.769> the<00:05:36.949> handles<00:05:37.369> like<00:05:37.789> this<00:05:38.059> that<00:05:38.269> are

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:38.329 
I like the handles like this that are

00:05:38.329 --> 00:05:40.089 
I like the handles like this that are
molded<00:05:38.719> on<00:05:38.869> that<00:05:39.259> don't<00:05:39.469> have<00:05:39.589> a<00:05:39.649> whole<00:05:39.860> lot<00:05:40.069> of

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099 
molded on that don't have a whole lot of

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:44.229 
molded on that don't have a whole lot of
texturing<00:05:41.079> they<00:05:42.079> they<00:05:42.879> they<00:05:43.879> don't<00:05:43.999> rub<00:05:44.209> your

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:44.239 
texturing they they they don't rub your

00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:47.619 
texturing they they they don't rub your
hand<00:05:44.769> too<00:05:45.769> much<00:05:46.149> but<00:05:47.149> they<00:05:47.269> got<00:05:47.449> enough

00:05:47.619 --> 00:05:47.629 
hand too much but they got enough

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:50.529 
hand too much but they got enough
texture<00:05:47.959> that's<00:05:48.199> going<00:05:48.469> on<00:05:48.619> to<00:05:48.999> this<00:05:49.999> one

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:50.539 
texture that's going on to this one

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:52.989 
texture that's going on to this one
there<00:05:50.989> are<00:05:51.079> all<00:05:51.199> the<00:05:51.349> spec<00:05:51.589> Wars<00:05:51.969> have<00:05:52.969> a

00:05:52.989 --> 00:05:52.999 
there are all the spec Wars have a

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:57.189 
there are all the spec Wars have a
hammering<00:05:53.449> pommel<00:05:54.079> and<00:05:55.689> my<00:05:56.689> understanding<00:05:56.839> is

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 
hammering pommel and my understanding is

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:00.579 
hammering pommel and my understanding is
it's<00:05:57.469> isolated<00:05:58.249> from<00:05:58.489> the<00:05:58.759> tang<00:05:59.439> like<00:06:00.439> the

00:06:00.579 --> 00:06:00.589 
it's isolated from the tang like the

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:02.079 
it's isolated from the tang like the
gerber<00:06:00.829> silver<00:06:01.099> Triton<00:06:01.489> or<00:06:01.579> something

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:02.089 
gerber silver Triton or something

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:05.229 
gerber silver Triton or something
if<00:06:02.809> you<00:06:03.079> hammer<00:06:03.649> something<00:06:04.429> electrical<00:06:05.059> with

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:05.239 
if you hammer something electrical with

00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:09.879 
if you hammer something electrical with
it<00:06:05.769> it<00:06:06.769> wouldn't<00:06:07.039> shock<00:06:07.269> but<00:06:08.709> if<00:06:09.709> you're

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:09.889 
it it wouldn't shock but if you're

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:11.289 
it it wouldn't shock but if you're
holding<00:06:10.069> on<00:06:10.219> to<00:06:10.369> handle<00:06:10.669> wants<00:06:10.849> to<00:06:10.939> be<00:06:11.089> in<00:06:11.149> is

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:11.299 
holding on to handle wants to be in is

00:06:11.299 --> 00:06:13.719 
holding on to handle wants to be in is
it's<00:06:11.479> all<00:06:11.629> plastic<00:06:11.959> and<00:06:12.259> has<00:06:12.499> no<00:06:13.159> Mel<00:06:13.429> sha

it's all plastic and has no Mel sha
interior<00:06:14.059> don't<00:06:14.239> guess<00:06:14.419> it<00:06:14.569> really<00:06:14.689> matters

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:19.540 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:25.140

she really nice Kydex not clicks in it

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.110 
she really nice Kydex not clicks in it
really<00:06:25.330> good<00:06:25.570> it<00:06:26.380> holds<00:06:26.920> it<00:06:27.040> you<00:06:27.790> know<00:06:27.880> really

waddle you'd really have to be moving

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.540 
waddle you'd really have to be moving
around<00:06:31.510> a<00:06:31.660> lot<00:06:31.810> to<00:06:32.110> shake<00:06:32.410> this<00:06:32.590> out<00:06:32.830> because

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
around a lot to shake this out because

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.960 
around a lot to shake this out because
it's<00:06:34.180> it's<00:06:34.930> difficult<00:06:35.830> to<00:06:36.130> pull<00:06:36.370> out<00:06:36.490> but<00:06:36.760> not

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
it's it's difficult to pull out but not

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:43.200 
it's it's difficult to pull out but not
undo<00:06:37.870> it<00:06:38.080> so<00:06:40.170> as<00:06:41.490> like<00:06:42.490> I<00:06:42.580> said<00:06:42.730> the<00:06:42.820> tech<00:06:43.030> lot

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.210 
undo it so as like I said the tech lot

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.060 
undo it so as like I said the tech lot
another<00:06:43.390> thing<00:06:43.600> with<00:06:43.780> this<00:06:43.960> one<00:06:44.170> is<00:06:44.350> the<00:06:44.860> tech

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.070 
another thing with this one is the tech

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.970 
another thing with this one is the tech
lock<00:06:45.280> is<00:06:45.430> riveted<00:06:45.790> to<00:06:45.910> the<00:06:46.030> sheet<00:06:46.710> so<00:06:47.710> if<00:06:47.860> you

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:47.980 
lock is riveted to the sheet so if you

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.040 
lock is riveted to the sheet so if you
ever<00:06:48.160> decide<00:06:48.520> that<00:06:48.730> you<00:06:48.940> some<00:06:49.540> reason<00:06:49.870> wanted

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.050 
ever decide that you some reason wanted

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.160 
ever decide that you some reason wanted
to<00:06:50.170> remove<00:06:50.440> the<00:06:50.590> tack<00:06:50.770> lock<00:06:51.510> broke<00:06:52.510> some<00:06:52.990> way

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:53.170 
to remove the tack lock broke some way

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:56.070 
to remove the tack lock broke some way
you<00:06:53.830> need<00:06:53.980> to<00:06:54.100> replace<00:06:54.490> it<00:06:54.840> you're<00:06:55.840> gonna<00:06:55.990> have

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 
you need to replace it you're gonna have

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.950 
you need to replace it you're gonna have
a<00:06:56.170> little<00:06:56.320> bit<00:06:56.470> of<00:06:56.530> a<00:06:56.590> problem

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 
a little bit of a problem

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.310 
a little bit of a problem
so<00:06:58.960> I<00:06:59.290> don't<00:06:59.650> see<00:06:59.980> that<00:07:00.130> as<00:07:00.280> a<00:07:00.310> negative

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:01.320 
so I don't see that as a negative

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.450 
so I don't see that as a negative
they've<00:07:02.320> been<00:07:02.440> riveted<00:07:02.710> on<00:07:03.040> it's<00:07:03.400> just

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:03.460 
they've been riveted on it's just

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.440 
they've been riveted on it's just
something<00:07:03.880> to<00:07:03.940> think<00:07:04.090> about

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:04.450 
something to think about

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.840 
something to think about
if<00:07:04.840> you<00:07:04.990> ever<00:07:05.200> you<00:07:06.070> know<00:07:06.160> there's<00:07:06.340> no<00:07:06.490> screws

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:06.850 
if you ever you know there's no screws

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.580 
if you ever you know there's no screws
to<00:07:07.000> come<00:07:07.180> loose<00:07:07.390> there's<00:07:07.750> no<00:07:08.080> hardware<00:07:08.560> to

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:08.590 
to come loose there's no hardware to

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:09.930 
to come loose there's no hardware to
worry<00:07:08.860> about<00:07:08.980> or<00:07:09.220> anything<00:07:09.370> like<00:07:09.610> that

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:09.940 
worry about or anything like that

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.590 
worry about or anything like that
it's<00:07:10.900> just<00:07:11.260> you<00:07:11.920> know<00:07:12.010> a<00:07:12.040> lot<00:07:12.550> of<00:07:12.640> times<00:07:12.880> tech

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:13.600 
it's just you know a lot of times tech

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.720 
it's just you know a lot of times tech
locks<00:07:13.870> will<00:07:14.110> be<00:07:14.140> we<00:07:15.040> can<00:07:15.190> change<00:07:15.430> the<00:07:15.580> position

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:15.730 
locks will be we can change the position

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.450 
locks will be we can change the position
of<00:07:16.150> all<00:07:16.390> many<00:07:16.570> different<00:07:16.840> things<00:07:17.080> and<00:07:17.440> so<00:07:18.430> you

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:18.460 
of all many different things and so you

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.390 
of all many different things and so you
could<00:07:18.700> carry<00:07:19.090> it<00:07:19.980> horizontally<00:07:20.980> across<00:07:21.130> your

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:21.400 
could carry it horizontally across your

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.950 
could carry it horizontally across your
back<00:07:21.520> or<00:07:21.880> something<00:07:22.060> like<00:07:22.210> that<00:07:22.420> this<00:07:22.600> just

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 
back or something like that this just

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.640 
back or something like that this just
set<00:07:23.110> up<00:07:23.230> to<00:07:23.320> carry<00:07:23.530> one<00:07:23.680> way<00:07:23.890> so<00:07:24.790> that's<00:07:25.030> just

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:25.650 
set up to carry one way so that's just

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.720 
set up to carry one way so that's just
something<00:07:26.650> to<00:07:26.770> think<00:07:26.800> about<00:07:27.040> in<00:07:27.310> the<00:07:27.370> design

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:27.730 
something to think about in the design

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:32.250 
something to think about in the design
feature<00:07:30.030> but<00:07:31.030> my<00:07:31.210> understanding<00:07:31.360> was<00:07:31.810> these

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:32.260 
feature but my understanding was these

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.980 
feature but my understanding was these
knives<00:07:32.530> were<00:07:32.800> collaboration<00:07:33.610> between

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:33.990 
knives were collaboration between

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.460 
knives were collaboration between
Timberline<00:07:34.990> which<00:07:35.890> was<00:07:36.100> originally<00:07:37.410> like<00:07:38.410> a

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:38.470 
Timberline which was originally like a

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:43.230 
Timberline which was originally like a
custom<00:07:38.980> knock<00:07:39.160> job<00:07:39.430> and<00:07:40.800> timber<00:07:42.000> gecko<00:07:43.000> which

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:43.240 
custom knock job and timber gecko which

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.940 
custom knock job and timber gecko which
Slater<00:07:43.540> bought<00:07:43.780> Timberline<00:07:44.290> the<00:07:44.530> name<00:07:44.740> and

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:44.950 
Slater bought Timberline the name and

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:48.150 
Slater bought Timberline the name and
everything<00:07:45.180> and<00:07:46.380> Ernest<00:07:47.380> Emerson<00:07:47.830> so<00:07:47.950> that's

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:48.160 
everything and Ernest Emerson so that's

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:56.400 
everything and Ernest Emerson so that's
the<00:07:48.400> design<00:07:48.730> influence<00:07:50.640> of<00:07:51.640> the<00:07:51.850> blade<00:07:55.290> it's<00:07:56.290> a

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:56.410 
the design influence of the blade it's a

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.740 
the design influence of the blade it's a
pretty<00:07:56.590> interesting<00:07:56.830> knife

00:07:59.740 --> 00:07:59.750 

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:03.820 

but<00:08:00.260> that<00:08:00.410> is<00:08:00.620> the<00:08:01.630> Timberline<00:08:02.630> Emerson<00:08:03.560> Eagle

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:03.830 
but that is the Timberline Emerson Eagle

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:11.320 
but that is the Timberline Emerson Eagle
expect<00:08:04.220> war<00:08:07.780> thanks<00:08:08.780> for<00:08:09.020> watching
