of<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.360> first<00:02:12.570> stage<00:02:12.860> runs<00:02:13.860> right<00:02:14.220> up<00:02:14.370> on<00:02:14.550> the

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
of the first stage runs right up on the

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.980 
of the first stage runs right up on the
Machine<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:16.670> put<00:02:17.670> your<00:02:17.880> keitel<00:02:18.630> aim<00:02:18.810> at

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
Machine and put your keitel aim at

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.320 
Machine and put your keitel aim at
eleven<00:02:19.320> o'clock<00:02:19.350> or<00:02:19.770> at<00:02:19.920> one<00:02:20.070> o'clock<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:21.240> he

eleven o'clock or at one o'clock and he

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.040 
eleven o'clock or at one o'clock and he
says<00:02:21.510> wait

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
says wait

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.420

none<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.070> the<00:02:24.110> ammunition<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.650> shoots<00:02:25.980> can<00:02:26.220> hit

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
none of the ammunition it shoots can hit

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.060 
none of the ammunition it shoots can hit
you<00:02:26.960> and<00:02:27.960> it's<00:02:28.200> slow<00:02:28.500> going<00:02:28.530> because

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
you and it's slow going because

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.420 
you and it's slow going because
especially<00:02:29.640> I<00:02:29.910> lost<00:02:30.450> my<00:02:30.660> tool<00:02:31.080> guided<00:02:32.040> missile

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
especially I lost my tool guided missile

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.760 
especially I lost my tool guided missile
but<00:02:33.150> it'll<00:02:33.390> blow<00:02:33.690> up<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.050> door<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.290> I'll<00:02:34.590> be

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
but it'll blow up the door and I'll be

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.100 
but it'll blow up the door and I'll be
able<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.040> progress<00:02:35.220> through<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:36.360> I<00:02:36.660> won't<00:02:36.870> die

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
able to progress through and I won't die

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.250 
able to progress through and I won't die
I<00:02:37.440> will<00:02:38.190> probably<00:02:38.400> change<00:02:38.880> this<00:02:39.210> but<00:02:40.020> I'm

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
I will probably change this but I'm

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.530 
I will probably change this but I'm
gonna<00:02:40.440> enjoy<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:41.100> you<00:02:41.670> know<00:02:41.700> being<00:02:42.180> able<00:02:42.270> to

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
gonna enjoy it you know being able to

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.030 
gonna enjoy it you know being able to
cheat<00:02:42.990> my<00:02:43.110> way<00:02:43.290> through<00:02:43.470> through<00:02:43.710> the<00:02:43.770> first

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
cheat my way through through the first

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.020 
cheat my way through through the first
stage<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.550> always<00:02:44.820> cool<00:02:46.310> it'll<00:02:47.310> tell<00:02:47.490> me<00:02:47.520> that

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
stage is always cool it'll tell me that

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.890 
stage is always cool it'll tell me that

hey I beat the target score and I've got
two<00:02:52.260> medals<00:02:52.620> there<00:02:52.860> because<00:02:53.190> I've<00:02:53.310> died<00:02:53.520> so

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
two medals there because I've died so

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.910 
two medals there because I've died so
many<00:02:53.940> times<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.480> can't<00:02:55.440> go<00:02:55.560> any<00:02:55.740> further

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
many times I can't go any further

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.650 
many times I can't go any further
because<00:02:56.220> this<00:02:56.430> game<00:02:56.670> is<00:02:56.700> locked<00:02:57.150> but<00:02:57.390> I'll<00:02:57.540> go

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
because this game is locked but I'll go

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.990 
because this game is locked but I'll go
back<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.080> main<00:02:58.260> menu<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.980> here<00:02:59.730> it<00:02:59.850> tells

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
back to the main menu and here it tells

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.190 
back to the main menu and here it tells
you<00:03:00.210> that<00:03:00.330> it<00:03:00.480> failed<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.870> market

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
you that it failed the market

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.170 
you that it failed the market
verification<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.100> that's<00:03:02.670> because<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:03.030> game

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
verification and that's because the game

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.570 
verification and that's because the game
isn't<00:03:03.570> quite<00:03:03.780> live<00:03:04.050> yet<00:03:04.380> but<00:03:05.040> we<00:03:05.160> will<00:03:05.310> look<00:03:05.430> at

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
isn't quite live yet but we will look at

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.990 
isn't quite live yet but we will look at
these<00:03:05.670> options<00:03:06.210> you<00:03:06.990> can<00:03:07.560> turn<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.430> music<00:03:08.550> up

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
and down sound effects you can change

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.550 
and down sound effects you can change
languages<00:03:14.700> from<00:03:14.850> English<00:03:15.209> to<00:03:15.560> several

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560

that I don't read so I'm not sure what

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.750 
that I don't read so I'm not sure what
they<00:03:21.480> are<00:03:21.510> but<00:03:21.959> they're<00:03:22.950> there<00:03:23.160> that's<00:03:23.489> cool

and of course your controls you can set

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.600 
and of course your controls you can set
them<00:03:27.330> so<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.810> virtual<00:03:28.290> joysticks<00:03:28.890> are<00:03:29.100> fixed

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
them so the virtual joysticks are fixed

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.330 
them so the virtual joysticks are fixed
at<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:29.850> bottom<00:03:30.770> change<00:03:31.770> it<00:03:31.950> so<00:03:32.160> they<00:03:32.280> are

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
at the bottom change it so they are

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.260 
at the bottom change it so they are
movable<00:03:32.850> and<00:03:33.000> float<00:03:33.300> or<00:03:33.900> change<00:03:34.560> it<00:03:34.770> to<00:03:34.980> a

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
movable and float or change it to a

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.800 
movable and float or change it to a
virtual<00:03:36.270> d-pad

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
virtual d-pad

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.710 
virtual d-pad
I<00:03:37.050> like<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:38.130> fixed<00:03:38.670> joysticks<00:03:39.300> so<00:03:39.540> that's

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
I like the fixed joysticks so that's

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.590 
I like the fixed joysticks so that's
what<00:03:39.870> I'll<00:03:39.989> do<00:03:40.170> for<00:03:40.290> that<00:03:41.180> okay<00:03:42.180> tell<00:03:42.420> me<00:03:42.450> about
