00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.400
 no but just look at the mushrooms here 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.680
 just enough for hundreds of juliens of us 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.749
 we are on a mushroom farm which is between 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.089
 Others delivers champignons practically 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:24.669
 in all the largest trading networks of ours 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:25.749
 cities generally grow here what 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:29.609
 we are eating 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:29.609
 let's find out how it works 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.960
 industrial production of russian 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.210
 champignon began precisely in Petersburg 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.250
 in the early nineteenth century were whole 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.280
 dynasties of Petersburg fish farmers 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.500
 Cheboksarova quivers Myakisheva technology 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.719
 kept secret and well known 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.840
 only that since then they are strong 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.840
 have changed 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.990
 first bring food for themselves 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.930
 mushrooms and they eat straw in chicken 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.540
 horse manure droppings and even gypsum mushrooms 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.059
 Calcium is also needed from all this 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.789
 fertilizers and together with the earth are laid in 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.689
 incubator chambers 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:12.619
 the mycelium enters the compost as grains 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.109
 wheat and rye 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.479
 mushroom on which spores are plotted as 

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:19.459
 just started comfortable conditions right there 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.590
 spawn starts to grow 

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:26.020
 such behavior of the guests but the compost itself 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.020
 have penetrates called grab 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.849
 hit the secret to successful mushrooming 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.829
 is to make in artificial 

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:35.240
 conditions as correct as possible 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:38.179
 model the natural environment 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.560
 mushroom habitat what they do here 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:41.149
 with this wildlife you never 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.739
 meet here is a tree 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.840
 This design is called 

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:46.549
 watering tree is Dutch 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.979
 technology that makes it easy and 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.879
 just irrigate six beds at once with 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.819
 champignons 

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:55.729
 and drink mushrooms exclusively pure water 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:58.099
 the same as we are with you and also as for us 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.399
 good health champignon is important 

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:04.310
 comfort all temperature parameters 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.739
 air and compost moisture 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.190
 carbon dioxide to control 

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:12.470
 computer if suddenly God forbid disconnect 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.709
 the light that happens to mushrooms like that 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.349
 idea but this should not be because 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.750
 we have our own mini-tec and light is usually not 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:23.780
 turns off but if it turns off 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.690
 the system will become then naturally mushrooms 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.090
 will grow very rapidly in 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.519
 temperature all focus growing this 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.010
 living organism in captivity when all 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.230
 seemingly already good for mycelium 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.930
 the worst temperature comes 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.790
 dramatically reduces shauk stress and she immediately 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.799
 begins to multiply hard to 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.900
 time to save the view is the law of nature 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.860
 which scientists are just successful 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.280
 manipulated 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.840
 we have official confirmation that 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.730
 on environmentally friendly and passed 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.760
 no environmental certification 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.410
 we do not use chemicals 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.930
 the mushroom does not need to be cleaned on only 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:04.300
 wash the legs ourselves we can cut it 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:07.940
 I have a chance while we fish to his wife 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.940
 notice on the heads tasty and economically 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.790
 sowed profitably and after 20 days 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.860
 delicacy is ready for the year on this farm on 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.100
 six thousand square meters 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.530
 grow 120 tons of champignon nature 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.050
 such records are certainly not capable of it 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.760
 celebration of the latest technology farm 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.800
 consumes 800 thousand kilowatts 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.570
 electricity per year as two 10-story 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.040
 houses 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.470
 automated all that's just the harvest 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.060
 still collected by hand so 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.790
 it turns out now all these mushrooms can 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.130
 collect and take for sale is ready 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.989
 all no no these troll utter tremble 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.290
 it spurs only here such the most 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:48.170
 large we collect it turns out ripe grapp 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.709
 this big sin is not always necessary 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.760
 take the mushrooms to cut and see if 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.280
 hymenophore 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.280
 pink means mushroom sang good
