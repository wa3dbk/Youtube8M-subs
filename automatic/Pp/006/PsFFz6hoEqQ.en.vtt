00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
fuel-efficient vehicle and to me this is

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.799 
fuel-efficient vehicle and to me this is
going<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.190> be<00:00:59.670> very<00:00:59.699> similar<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.660> results

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
going to be very similar to the results

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.869 
going to be very similar to the results
of<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.230> housing<00:01:01.949> bubble<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.250> we've<00:01:02.399> seen<00:01:02.640> at

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
of the housing bubble that we've seen at

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.189 
of the housing bubble that we've seen at
a<00:01:02.940> financial<00:01:03.120> bubble<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:03.930> we've<00:01:04.049> seen

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
a financial bubble that we've seen

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.570 
a financial bubble that we've seen
before<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.070> there<00:01:05.189> have<00:01:05.309> been<00:01:05.460> other

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
before that and there have been other

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.520 
before that and there have been other
bubbles<00:01:06.000> plenty<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.570> them<00:01:06.659> Japan<00:01:06.960> saw<00:01:07.200> bubble

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
bubbles plenty of them Japan saw bubble

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.100 
bubbles plenty of them Japan saw bubble
but<00:01:08.040> we<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.700> think<00:01:08.939> we<00:01:09.150> will<00:01:09.360> see<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.720> results

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
but we I think we will see the results

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.380 
but we I think we will see the results
of<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.260> subsidy<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:11.360> artificially<00:01:12.360> high

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
of the subsidy in artificially high

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.940 
of the subsidy in artificially high
prices<00:01:12.600> for<00:01:13.290> these<00:01:13.380> types<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.770> vehicles

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
prices for these types of vehicles

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.890 
prices for these types of vehicles
people<00:01:14.700> are<00:01:14.909> also<00:01:15.060> making<00:01:15.330> distorted

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.030 
articulate and so he told us the answer
he<00:02:57.980> said<00:02:58.330> our<00:02:59.330> currency<00:02:59.690> is<00:02:59.900> backed<00:03:00.110> by<00:03:00.260> faith

he said our currency is backed by faith
and<00:03:01.370> confidence<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:03.400> so<00:03:04.400> unfortunately<00:03:05.360> as

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
and confidence and so unfortunately as

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.320 
and confidence and so unfortunately as
sad<00:03:06.320> as<00:03:06.500> it<00:03:06.530> may<00:03:06.650> be<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.860> say<00:03:07.310> that<00:03:07.610> faith<00:03:08.120> and

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
sad as it may be to say that faith and

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.030 
sad as it may be to say that faith and
confidence<00:03:08.510> so<00:03:08.900> it<00:03:09.020> doesn't<00:03:09.530> just<00:03:09.739> go<00:03:09.860> on

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
confidence so it doesn't just go on

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.860 
confidence so it doesn't just go on
forever<00:03:10.250> by<00:03:10.580> itself<00:03:10.940> faith<00:03:11.540> and<00:03:11.720> confidence

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
forever by itself faith and confidence

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.140 
forever by itself faith and confidence
