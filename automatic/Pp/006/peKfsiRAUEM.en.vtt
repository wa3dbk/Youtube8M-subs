00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:07.980
 to 2.0 people in a different game a 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.669
 game that is not minecraft is called bosses 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.199
 town and I'm to do a kind of 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:14.519
 different videos until now or 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.719
 he has become accustomed to other people's banking 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.849
 pc games but I would like 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.170
 introduce me to ipad games 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.689
 I wish you could see another kind of 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.089
 content that we could play to other 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.060
 things and today I would like to try hairston 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:28.529
 although I've already been tainted good I'll give 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.480
 a little bit what I have here also 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.040
 I have decided that I think it would be much more 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.710
 entertained in this type of videos with 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.450
 a 2.0 so if you like the idea then 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.040
 I will always make a 10 the room 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.810
 is more or less collected in certain 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.790
 way but good I'm going to apply a 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.500
 little how this works gerson that 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.750
 it is exactly a card game 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.640
 I play this game when what they already said 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.830
 little nonsense good I never saw him play 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.330
 itself but I always criticized it a lot 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.520
 meaning I said this game I will not play 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.410
 novitiate ever and I'll teach you a 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.780
 little how this was taught here 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.130
 At the moment you can make your cards 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.910
 so to speak, there are different classes 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:07.229
 is attributed to magician hunter 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:10.140
 for dyn priest rogue shaman witch 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.970
 warrior and neutral those who are 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.280
 experts in this game I ask you too 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.630
 patience because I play four hours 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.630
 I have not played the game much either, so 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.790
 so much I can not know much about the 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.710
 let's play in adventure mode one 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.200
 practice so you can see a little bit of the 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.070
 we're going to play with my mallet 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.150
 of letters from the magician we choose it and go 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.710
 to choose against an opponent for example 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.920
 let's go to 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.090
 to make an opponent the same magician and you 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.180
 due to how it works is a game of 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.530
 blizzard and it's a game that the truth that 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.690
 is not liking enough is a game 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.890
 I did not expect me to get hooked and 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.060
 unfortunately it is in a state 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.450
 unfortunately what I do not like about 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.920
 the games tell me and well just 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.680
 with this video that I want to see is also 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.240
 your reaction if the game you like me 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.580
 I will try to advice the 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.800
 novices of what little he has learned and 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.070
 well also also that you see a little bit 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.690
 as a game and all this to see the cards 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.009
 I have here I like all the truth 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.680
 is that they are pretty good to begin with 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.239
 so I go there I have a deck of 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.950
 letters that only anyone 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.290
 expert would criticize me for that but 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.870
 well I took more or less what I thought 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.880
 that was the important thing let's start 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.130
 with 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.090
 let's take out 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.880
 I think first I think it here 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.350
 it's a good way to start like this if 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.730
 they want to attack us with the minions 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.170
 they will have to attack first our 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.510
 inflicts three damage points 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.510
 differentiated this is a letter is a 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.700
 enchant a spell and has got 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.760
 kill I wake up I have a ball of 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.590
 fire for now I will not use it is 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.470
 neither 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.280
 I'm going to get this one but the truth is that 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.280
 a little nonsense 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.760
 we take out this and 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.620
 we charge against our hero ne meego and 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.250
 we hope the goal of this game is 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.570
 take down the enemy on the other side 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.250
 has moved the camera is because it is 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:14.190
 lowering the battery ok we will load 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.640
 I wanted to hurry because I do not know if to take 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.640
 to this 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:24.090
 I will directly kill the murr what 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:25.799
 I'm interested in not staying alive I'm not going to 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.629
 take out any letter I will save me the 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.840
 I'm going to go for the hero I think I'm going 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.670
 well I'm not going wrong in my opinion it takes a 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.219
 This is what he has had because 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:40.730
 I came out first to call it that 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:40.730
 because he's got that I think 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.659
 I think he would kill me for doing this but 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:51.400
 I'm going to use this I upload it on this killed 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.090
 this one that I'm not interested in having it here 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.200
 near 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.989
 I'm going to throw the ball 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.420
 and I'm going to do it like that because I think 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.340
 that is how I should do it only 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.379
 I commit failures please if I comment final 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.420
 of this video tell me of the most 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:09.430
 intentionally possible okay I'm not a 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.550
 expert and that's why all the posts 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.319
 continuous will be very useful 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.769
 perfect 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:21.489
 let's finish this let's take out 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.750
 we load with this and load 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.639
 this also here the truth that 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.780
 We are leaving our subject enough 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.820
 rapporteur I will also say that this is not 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.680
 is a person this is a robot of 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.710
 call it like that I'm playing against 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.270
 someone who is not a person because in 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.370
 this case what I want is not to prove 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.560
 how good I am that is not much but 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.450
 just show you good right now 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.700
 Josemi mentioned to me that as you know 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.139
 is a guy who climbs hairston and that 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.820
 look at several holes to also go 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.070
 learning so a greeting from here 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:51.550
 from the channel this is because I have not 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.900
 removed notifications not good no 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.760
 they have left it is worth the brown bundle 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.260
 I did not want to take it out but I just finished 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.680
 for doing the foolish but good a 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.700
 greeting jose need in the video 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.520
 we are going to 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.740
 let's go attacking I think we have to 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.510
 make it really easy 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.070
 another two more points until we go to 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.160
 play alone until the truth that yes 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.120
 I get it to attack because it will attack 6 of 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.280
 damage that is very much 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.580
 the truth that this wine has so much 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.919
 let's say grace the fact that he is 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:27.210
 doing because logically it's a guide 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:30.120
 it's not the computer but well I think 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.949
 which also serves to basically serve 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.590
 so you can tell me if you like it 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.419
 or not and I know if I can upload this 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.389
 game to say it as well as this 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.370
 ok good I will attack because it is 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:43.860
 what I have to do there we are there 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.530
 We believe that the thing is already 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.960
 pretty clear but good I'm going to throw 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.340
 a ball threw and he gets one of 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.990
 life guys so the truth is that 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:56.080
 its so much 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:59.180
 easy we need nothing to hit him and I think that 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.960
 this hero has finished 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.850
 oh it's here we see it now we have 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.590
 fixed this letter we will be that if 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:09.020
 let's attack with this hero hero with 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.340
 this minion forgiveness to the hero does not leave us 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.840
 because I have to finish first with that 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.039
 it's old that has provoke causes 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.509
 say that first let's finish him 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:16.400
 so we're going to do is going to be 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:18.500
 turn it into a little sheep with our 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.600
 poly formia spell hit this 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.889
 way and now ending the hero do not we 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.919
 we wind up we do not do more things 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:26.690
 we're just going to the mess has been easy 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:28.580
 from the fact that I faced a 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.080
 Bichito are leaving building is 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.900
 because I'm stupid and no asset is 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.160
 what you have but good nothing happens in 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.550
 a girl salutes also that appeared in 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.560
 the video but good greeting for all 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.370
 good to also think about my deck of 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.070
 letters that I'm going to have to modify 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.900
 I had also thought ok if you like 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:48.289
 the game and if you like how I do it 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:50.000
 having two series does not deactivate but 

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:52.490
 types of hairston videos one would be 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.570
 making the curse of the branches that 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.560
 it's an adventure we do not have to go 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.630
 ending with the bosses 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.270
 against the crowned so to speak and 

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:02.910
 another would play or else in the mode 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.380
 against amateur people or good 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:07.110
 against people with rank that these are 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.850
 the rank ets that are said or play 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.320
 in the sand then we can find 

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:13.110
 three types of management videos that I 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.550
 I would like to know your opinion in this 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.840
 case for example we chose the hero and we 

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:17.610
 three letters are coming out that we have to 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.590
 go choosing which of them is the one that 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.030
 we want to stay like this we make our deck 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:23.910
 of letters and then we fight against a 

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:26.160
 opponent if we win well we win 

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:28.919
 gold I think gold helps us to buy 

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.510
 envelopes that come different letters or 

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:32.639
 well from rising level are the 

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.350
 we get we also have this pack of 

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:35.669
 cards that are goblins versus 

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.860
 gnomes that would be an expansion for 

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:41.880
 say it like that and then we have the packs 

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:45.600
 of adventures in the branches for example 

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:47.910
 has five clear wings I do not know how many 

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.530
 Well, they are by wing but good if you pay 25 

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.830
 report days such and then tar
