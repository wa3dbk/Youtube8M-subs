00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
at home it's not at all difficult so

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.280 
at home it's not at all difficult so
let's<00:01:17.370> see<00:01:17.580> how<00:01:17.820> do<00:01:17.880> we<00:01:18.060> go<00:01:18.270> about<00:01:18.390> what<00:01:19.170> you

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
let's see how do we go about what you

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.890 
let's see how do we go about what you
have<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.500> do<00:01:19.650> first<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.850> whole<00:01:21.090> green<00:01:21.540> gram

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
have to do first is the whole green gram

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.480 
have to do first is the whole green gram
or<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.229> moon<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.680> have<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.220> have<00:01:23.369> to

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
or the moon that you have you have to

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.870 
or the moon that you have you have to
soak<00:01:23.760> this<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.240> water<00:01:24.570> for<00:01:25.080> about<00:01:25.560> 5<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.369> 6

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
soak this in water for about 5 to 6

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.780 
soak this in water for about 5 to 6
hours<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.960> if<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.500> were<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.740> soak<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.310> I'll<00:01:29.520> put

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
hours so if I were to soak this I'll put

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.719 
hours so if I were to soak this I'll put
water<00:01:30.030> till<00:01:30.330> about<00:01:30.450> here<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:32.130> will<00:01:32.460> leave

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
water till about here and I will leave

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.030 
water till about here and I will leave
this<00:01:32.970> just<00:01:33.570> like<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:33.990> for<00:01:34.229> about<00:01:34.320> 4<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.010> 5

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
this just like this for about 4 to 5

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.179 
this just like this for about 4 to 5
hours<00:01:35.460> after<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.810> when<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.080> sow<00:01:37.409> green<00:01:37.830> gram

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
hours after that when you sow green gram

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.480 
hours after that when you sow green gram
this<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.240> how<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.780> looks<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.619> swells<00:01:41.220> up

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
this is how it looks it swells up

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.020 
this is how it looks it swells up
because<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.270> absorbs<00:01:42.869> all<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.200> water<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.430> it

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
because it absorbs all the water and it

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.840 
because it absorbs all the water and it
swells<00:01:45.479> like<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.990> but<00:01:46.470> yet<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:47.340> has<00:01:47.580> not

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
swells like this but yet this has not

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.140 
swells like this but yet this has not
sprouted<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:49.320> what<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.680> have<00:01:49.830> to<00:01:49.979> do<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.369> after

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
sprouted so what you have to do is after

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.859 
sprouted so what you have to do is after
