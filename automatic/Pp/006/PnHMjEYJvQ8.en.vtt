blue<00:03:43.359> Yeti<00:03:43.599> so<00:03:43.750> I've<00:03:43.840> had<00:03:43.989> it<00:03:44.109> sitting<00:03:44.290> on

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
blue Yeti so I've had it sitting on

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.430 
blue Yeti so I've had it sitting on
pieces<00:03:44.709> of<00:03:44.889> foam<00:03:45.129> and<00:03:45.599> cloths<00:03:46.599> and<00:03:47.049> stuff<00:03:47.290> like

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
pieces of foam and cloths and stuff like

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.979 
pieces of foam and cloths and stuff like
that<00:03:47.500> but<00:03:48.359> this<00:03:49.359> is<00:03:49.510> going<00:03:49.599> to<00:03:49.690> be<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:49.810> huge

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
that but this is going to be a huge

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:51.479 
that but this is going to be a huge
improvement<00:03:50.139> also<00:03:50.650> have<00:03:50.859> it<00:03:50.980> on<00:03:51.099> this

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
improvement also have it on this

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.150 
improvement also have it on this
suspension<00:03:52.329> boom<00:03:52.660> arm<00:03:52.930> that<00:03:53.590> I<00:03:53.620> got<00:03:53.889> it's

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
suspension boom arm that I got it's

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.710 
suspension boom arm that I got it's
quite<00:03:54.430> cheap<00:03:54.730> it's<00:03:54.879> really<00:03:55.090> nice<00:03:55.209> i<00:03:55.419> can<00:03:55.569> move

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
quite cheap it's really nice i can move

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.890 
quite cheap it's really nice i can move
the<00:03:55.840> mic<00:03:56.019> around<00:03:56.169> now<00:03:57.449> anywhere<00:03:58.449> I<00:03:58.480> want<00:03:58.750> like

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900

the mic around now anywhere I want like
a<00:03:58.930> broadcast<00:03:59.639> studio<00:04:00.639> arm<00:04:00.970> it's<00:04:01.120> really<00:04:01.269> nice

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:01.419

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:04.879 
a broadcast studio arm it's really nice
and<00:04:01.980> with<00:04:02.980> that<00:04:03.010> setup<00:04:03.400> I<00:04:03.730> can<00:04:04.150> also<00:04:04.299> adjust

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
and with that setup I can also adjust

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:08.670 
and with that setup I can also adjust
some<00:04:05.889> controls<00:04:06.370> of<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:07.329> audio<00:04:07.629> right<00:04:08.260> here

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
some controls of the audio right here

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.409 
some controls of the audio right here
and<00:04:08.829> i<00:04:08.889> can<00:04:08.919> control<00:04:09.400> noise<00:04:09.699> gate<00:04:10.120> which<00:04:10.299> is

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:10.419 
and i can control noise gate which is

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:11.640 
and i can control noise gate which is
going<00:04:10.540> to<00:04:10.599> be<00:04:10.659> really<00:04:10.989> good<00:04:11.019> because<00:04:11.199> i<00:04:11.500> have

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
going to be really good because i have

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.280 
going to be really good because i have
this<00:04:11.769> noisy<00:04:12.220> computer<00:04:12.760> sitting<00:04:13.659> right<00:04:14.079> next

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
this noisy computer sitting right next

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.009 
this noisy computer sitting right next
to<00:04:14.470> me<00:04:14.560> it<00:04:14.919> is<00:04:15.069> it's<00:04:15.190> as<00:04:15.310> far<00:04:15.639> away<00:04:15.790> as<00:04:16.209> it<00:04:16.810> can

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
to me it is it's as far away as it can

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.949 
to me it is it's as far away as it can
be<00:04:17.440> without<00:04:18.130> applying<00:04:18.699> extension<00:04:19.419> cables<00:04:19.750> for

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
be without applying extension cables for

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.350 
be without applying extension cables for
my<00:04:20.079> computer<00:04:20.320> so<00:04:21.010> i<00:04:21.370> mean<00:04:21.669> i<00:04:21.700> have<00:04:21.880> to<00:04:21.909> have<00:04:22.180> it

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
my computer so i mean i have to have it

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.180 
my computer so i mean i have to have it
in<00:04:22.389> here<00:04:22.690> where<00:04:22.990> I<00:04:23.020> record<00:04:23.440> because<00:04:23.620> I<00:04:23.740> work<00:04:24.010> on

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
in here where I record because I work on

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.810 
in here where I record because I work on
the<00:04:24.310> computer<00:04:24.669> as<00:04:24.820> I<00:04:25.090> record

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
the computer as I record

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.430 
the computer as I record
and<00:04:26.120> it's<00:04:26.420> the<00:04:26.480> only<00:04:26.690> way<00:04:26.780> I<00:04:26.810> can<00:04:26.930> do<00:04:27.140> it<00:04:27.290> so

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
and it's the only way I can do it so

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.250 
and it's the only way I can do it so
being<00:04:27.770> able<00:04:27.860> to<00:04:28.070> control<00:04:28.450> the<00:04:29.450> the

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
being able to control the the

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.200 
being able to control the the
compression<00:04:30.920> of<00:04:31.070> the<00:04:31.160> audio<00:04:31.880> when<00:04:32.120> i'm

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
compression of the audio when i'm

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.810 
compression of the audio when i'm
recording<00:04:32.330> it<00:04:32.750> is<00:04:32.930> really<00:04:33.680> good<00:04:33.890> so<00:04:34.550> that<00:04:34.700> is

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
recording it is really good so that is

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.640 
recording it is really good so that is
