older<00:00:20.699> fusions<00:00:21.210> it's<00:00:22.050> pretty<00:00:22.260> easy<00:00:22.439> it's

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
older fusions it's pretty easy it's

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.700 
older fusions it's pretty easy it's
right<00:00:23.820> above<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.330> fuse<00:00:24.600> box<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:25.199> smart

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
right above the fuse box a smart

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.410 
right above the fuse box a smart
junction<00:00:26.130> box<00:00:26.340> there<00:00:26.670> was<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.820> five<00:00:27.029> digit<00:00:27.210> code

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
junction box there was a five digit code

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.630 
junction box there was a five digit code
but<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.380> this<00:00:28.470> one<00:00:28.650> was<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.859> little<00:00:28.949> tricky<00:00:29.220> and

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
but in this one was a little tricky and

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.209 
but in this one was a little tricky and
called<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.630> dealer<00:00:30.929> he<00:00:31.470> said<00:00:31.710> there's<00:00:32.009> no

you hundred bucks bring it in and takes
about<00:00:37.290> an<00:00:37.500> hour<00:00:37.590> we'll<00:00:37.950> retrieve<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.489> code<00:00:38.670> so

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
about an hour we'll retrieve the code so

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.720 
about an hour we'll retrieve the code so
what<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:39.930> actually<00:00:40.050> did<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:41.190> guys<00:00:41.399> as<00:00:41.579> you

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
what I actually did and you guys as you

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.540 
what I actually did and you guys as you
can<00:00:41.910> see<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.860> smart<00:00:43.860> junction<00:00:44.340> box

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
can see this is a smart junction box

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.630 
can see this is a smart junction box
it's<00:00:45.270> mounted<00:00:45.899> right<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.980> corner<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
it's mounted right in that corner of the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.229 
it's mounted right in that corner of the
vehicle<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.950> I<00:00:49.950> already<00:00:50.489> retrieve<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> code

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
vehicle and I already retrieve the code

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.600 
vehicle and I already retrieve the code
but<00:00:51.449> what<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.629> did<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:51.899> had<00:00:52.260> one<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> spare<00:00:53.160> to

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
but what I did I had one is a spare to

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.850 
but what I did I had one is a spare to
show<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.910> what<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.329> looks<00:00:54.510> like<00:00:54.719> there<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.710> a

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
show you what it looks like there is a

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.290 
show you what it looks like there is a
size<00:00:56.489> 10<00:00:57.800> not<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.070> holding<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.579> in<00:00:59.699> place<00:00:59.850> and

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
size 10 not that holding it in place and

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.429 
size 10 not that holding it in place and
it's<00:01:01.079> sitting<00:01:01.620> right<00:01:01.649> underneath<00:01:03.080> there<00:01:04.080> and

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
it's sitting right underneath there and

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.719 
it's sitting right underneath there and
if<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.680> could<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.100> know<00:01:05.220> if<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.400> could<00:01:05.549> see

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
if you could you know if you could see

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.510 
if you could you know if you could see
it<00:01:05.880> but<00:01:06.090> it's<00:01:06.240> sitting<00:01:06.510> right<00:01:06.540> over<00:01:06.689> there

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
it but it's sitting right over there

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.969 
it but it's sitting right over there
what<00:01:08.520> they<00:01:08.670> did<00:01:08.939> in<00:01:09.840> older<00:01:10.140> vehicles<00:01:10.590> they<00:01:10.740> put

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
what they did in older vehicles they put

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.710 
what they did in older vehicles they put
the<00:01:11.100> code<00:01:11.310> right<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.880> sticker<00:01:12.119> it's<00:01:12.630> a

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the code right in this sticker it's a

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.410 
the code right in this sticker it's a
five<00:01:12.900> digit<00:01:13.049> code<00:01:13.229> button<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.799> 13<00:01:14.640> 14<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.180> 15

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
five digit code button a 13 14 and 15

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.539 
five digit code button a 13 14 and 15
fusion<00:01:16.049> they<00:01:16.680> actually<00:01:17.100> got<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> little

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
fusion they actually got a little

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.300 
fusion they actually got a little
smarter<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.180> they<00:01:18.390> put<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.320> code<00:01:19.590> on<00:01:19.830> the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
smarter and they put the code on the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.179 
smarter and they put the code on the
back<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.299> BCM<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.470> actually<00:01:22.740> says<00:01:22.950> key

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
back of the BCM and it actually says key

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.429 
back of the BCM and it actually says key
code<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:24.119> that's<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.479> five<00:01:24.689> digit<00:01:25.080> code<00:01:25.110> you

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
code so that's the five digit code you

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.219 
code so that's the five digit code you
need<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.860> unlock<00:01:26.340> your<00:01:26.490> car<00:01:26.759> just<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:27.780> case<00:01:27.869> you

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
need to unlock your car just in case you

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.130 
need to unlock your car just in case you
forgot<00:01:28.920> your<00:01:29.040> keys<00:01:29.310> or<00:01:29.549> things<00:01:30.030> like<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.450> so

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
forgot your keys or things like that so

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.260 
forgot your keys or things like that so
what<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.439> did<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.770> took<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.220> tenth<00:01:32.460> size<00:01:33.000> 10

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
what I did I took the tenth size 10

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.480 
what I did I took the tenth size 10
socket<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.960> use<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> little<00:01:34.740> mirror<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.159> went

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
socket I use a little mirror I went

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.730 
socket I use a little mirror I went
right<00:01:35.670> underneath<00:01:35.939> there<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:37.320> retrieve

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
right underneath there and I retrieve

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.480 
right underneath there and I retrieve
the<00:01:37.890> code<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.850> that's<00:01:39.810> how<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.110> do<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:41.340> all
