00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
just defaulted to the last template I

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.080 
just defaulted to the last template I

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
made which was for an earlier tutorial

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.029 
made which was for an earlier tutorial
excuse<00:00:21.090> me<00:00:21.300> so<00:00:21.960> what<00:00:22.170> we'll<00:00:22.289> do<00:00:22.439> is<00:00:22.470> just<00:00:22.830> call

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
excuse me so what we'll do is just call

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.339 
excuse me so what we'll do is just call
that<00:00:23.250> or<00:00:23.760> one<00:00:24.029> test<00:00:25.730> now<00:00:26.900> it<00:00:27.900> doesn't<00:00:28.199> give<00:00:28.289> you

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
that or one test now it doesn't give you

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.320 
that or one test now it doesn't give you
much<00:00:28.380> option<00:00:28.890> in<00:00:29.010> places<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.730> save<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.150> but<00:00:30.179> I

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
much option in places to save it but I

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.450 
much option in places to save it but I
think<00:00:30.390> version<00:00:30.990> 2<00:00:31.230> means<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.189> can<00:00:32.340> actually

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
think version 2 means you can actually

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.479 
think version 2 means you can actually
set<00:00:32.850> up<00:00:33.000> your<00:00:33.120> own<00:00:33.260> template<00:00:34.260> categories<00:00:34.860> but

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
set up your own template categories but

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.150 
set up your own template categories but
at<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.700> moment<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.540> best<00:00:36.660> option<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.350> that

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
at the moment the best option is that

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.910 
at the moment the best option is that
it's<00:00:38.309> an<00:00:38.399> affiliate<00:00:38.760> site<00:00:39.030> template<00:00:39.739> it<00:00:40.739> then

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
it's an affiliate site template it then

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.799 
it's an affiliate site template it then
asks<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.250> where<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.610> want<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.910> pick<00:00:42.570> up<00:00:42.600> a

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
asks you where you want to pick up a

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.160 
asks you where you want to pick up a
screenshot<00:00:43.140> from<00:00:43.410> now<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.160> screenshot<00:00:44.820> is

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
screenshot from now the screenshot is

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.060 
screenshot from now the screenshot is
when<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.289> do<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.530> preview<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.309> will

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
when you do the preview it will

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.130 
when you do the preview it will
basically<00:00:50.480> look<00:00:51.480> like<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.870> there<00:00:53.930> now<00:00:54.930> I've

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
basically look like that there now I've

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.520 
basically look like that there now I've
already<00:00:55.320> created<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.280> two<00:00:56.489> images<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.960> for

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
not the same as this tutorial the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.270 
not the same as this tutorial the
average<00:01:12.720> while<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.200> do<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.409> different<00:01:13.619> site<00:01:14.010> that

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
average while I do a different site that

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.310 
average while I do a different site that
you're<00:01:14.400> going<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.640> greater<00:01:15.020> depth<00:01:16.020> because

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
you're going to greater depth because

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.060 
you're going to greater depth because
obviously<00:01:16.619> not<00:01:17.070> limited<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.670> YouTube

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
obviously not limited to the YouTube

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.440 
obviously not limited to the YouTube
scenario<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.280> 10<00:01:20.549> minutes<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:20.970> X<00:01:21.090> amount<00:01:21.299> of

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
scenario of 10 minutes and X amount of

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.160 
scenario of 10 minutes and X amount of
megabytes<00:01:22.159> so<00:01:23.159> they<00:01:23.369> go<00:01:23.549> into<00:01:23.700> greater<00:01:24.000> detail

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
megabytes so they go into greater detail

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.580 
megabytes so they go into greater detail
they<00:01:25.170> also<00:01:25.320> show<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.770> how<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.340> made<00:01:26.759> those<00:01:27.150> and

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
they also show you how I made those and

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.620 
they also show you how I made those and
resize<00:01:28.590> them<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.040> everything<00:01:29.280> but<00:01:30.270> for<00:01:30.540> this

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
resize them and everything but for this

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.940 
resize them and everything but for this
I've<00:01:30.869> actually<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.229> made<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> couple<00:01:31.799> of

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
I've actually just made a couple of

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.050 
I've actually just made a couple of
quick<00:01:32.130> ones<00:01:32.159> directly<00:01:32.670> from<00:01:33.140> the<00:01:34.140> original

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
quick ones directly from the original

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:46.639 
quick ones directly from the original
PSD<00:01:36.060> file<00:01:39.740> so<00:01:41.090> I'll<00:01:42.090> open<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.630> one<00:01:44.180> and<00:01:45.649> we'll

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
PSD file so I'll open that one and we'll

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.770 
PSD file so I'll open that one and we'll
open<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:47.009> one<00:01:47.310> than<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.390> just<00:01:48.630> gives

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
open that one than that that just gives

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.499 
open that one than that that just gives
it<00:01:49.020> some<00:01:49.490> the<00:01:50.490> files<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.909> we<00:01:51.000> need<00:01:51.180> for<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.420> to

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
it some the files that we need for it to

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.340 
it some the files that we need for it to
show<00:01:51.540> on<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.869> template<00:01:52.259> menu<00:01:52.680> so

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.289 

test<00:01:56.350> template<00:01:59.610> we<00:02:00.610> don't<00:02:00.729> need<00:02:00.909> to<00:02:01.030> include

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
test template we don't need to include

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.290 
test template we don't need to include
publishing<00:02:01.840> details<00:02:02.320> and<00:02:02.799> we<00:02:03.790> don't<00:02:03.940> need<00:02:04.119> to

publishing details and we don't need to

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.760 
publishing details and we don't need to
include<00:02:04.570> additional<00:02:04.630> pages<00:02:05.320> because<00:02:05.560> we've

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
include additional pages because we've

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.419 
include additional pages because we've
not<00:02:05.890> set<00:02:06.130> anything<00:02:06.280> up<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:08.069> then<00:02:09.069> we<00:02:09.250> select

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
not set anything up and then we select

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:18.630 
not set anything up and then we select
that<00:02:09.759> and<00:02:13.050> with<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.080> bit<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.290> look<00:02:17.610> we'll<00:02:18.610> just

that and with a bit of look we'll just

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:28.590 
that and with a bit of look we'll just
save<00:02:19.410> close<00:02:24.569> or<00:02:25.569> select<00:02:25.900> add<00:02:26.319> website<00:02:27.450> if<00:02:28.450> we
