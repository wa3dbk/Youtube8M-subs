00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
it was just the timing or maybe the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.830 
it was just the timing or maybe the
personalities<00:01:16.790> of<00:01:16.820> all<00:01:17.090> three<00:01:17.360> of<00:01:17.390> us<00:01:17.540> but<00:01:17.780> I

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
personalities of all three of us but I

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.200 
personalities of all three of us but I

each<00:01:20.420> other<00:01:20.689> and<00:01:20.920> really<00:01:21.920> something<00:01:22.640> that

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
each other and really something that

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.719 
each other and really something that
goes<00:01:22.850> beyond<00:01:23.270> coaching<00:01:23.810> a<00:01:24.310> friendship<00:01:25.310> of

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
goes beyond coaching a friendship of

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.880

and<00:03:51.260> he<00:03:51.320> didn't<00:03:51.560> do<00:03:51.680> it<00:03:51.710> through<00:03:51.980> scoring<00:03:52.400> but

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
and he didn't do it through scoring but

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.340 
and he didn't do it through scoring but
somebody<00:03:52.910> had<00:03:53.090> to<00:03:53.120> take<00:03:53.420> on<00:03:53.630> that<00:03:53.810> role<00:03:54.080> and<00:03:54.140> he

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
somebody had to take on that role and he

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.510 
somebody had to take on that role and he
did<00:03:54.590> it<00:03:54.710> and<00:03:55.000> what<00:03:56.000> leadership<00:03:56.830> they<00:03:57.830> had<00:03:58.070> you

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
did it and what leadership they had you

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.580 
did it and what leadership they had you
know<00:03:58.550> the<00:03:58.820> leaders<00:03:59.150> Isiah<00:03:59.600> Thomas<00:03:59.870> me<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:00.410> one

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
know the leaders Isiah Thomas me and one

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.410 
know the leaders Isiah Thomas me and one
of<00:04:00.680> their<00:04:00.800> leaders<00:04:01.010> where<00:04:01.850> he<00:04:01.970> wasn't<00:04:02.150> afraid

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
of their leaders where he wasn't afraid

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.660 
of their leaders where he wasn't afraid
to<00:04:02.690> confront<00:04:03.080> new<00:04:03.650> players<00:04:03.980> or<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:04.310> younger

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
to confront new players or the younger

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.540 
to confront new players or the younger
players<00:04:04.970> to<00:04:05.270> show<00:04:05.480> them<00:04:05.960> the<00:04:06.170> way<00:04:06.350> so<00:04:07.310> there

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
players to show them the way so there

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:08.770 
players to show them the way so there
are<00:04:07.580> a<00:04:07.730> lot<00:04:07.910> of<00:04:07.940> lessons<00:04:08.210> and<00:04:08.510> I<00:04:08.540> think<00:04:08.720> the

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
are a lot of lessons and I think the

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.470 
are a lot of lessons and I think the
last<00:04:08.960> part<00:04:09.290> is<00:04:09.440> you<00:04:09.680> know<00:04:09.770> defense<00:04:10.480> is

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
last part is you know defense is

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.940 
last part is you know defense is
something<00:04:11.840> you<00:04:11.960> can<00:04:12.110> really<00:04:12.200> control<00:04:12.680> better

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
something you can really control better

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.310 
something you can really control better
than<00:04:13.160> offense<00:04:13.580> and<00:04:13.820> I<00:04:14.210> thought<00:04:14.690> you<00:04:15.020> know<00:04:15.050> for

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
than offense and I thought you know for

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.380 
than offense and I thought you know for
our<00:04:15.440> team<00:04:15.740> being<00:04:16.460> totally<00:04:16.880> committed<00:04:17.239> to

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
our team being totally committed to

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.510 
our team being totally committed to
being<00:04:17.600> a<00:04:17.720> great<00:04:17.840> defensive<00:04:18.500> team<00:04:18.560> will<00:04:19.310> take

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:19.520 
being a great defensive team will take

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.090 
being a great defensive team will take
us<00:04:19.729> the<00:04:19.940> furthest<00:04:20.390> that<00:04:20.630> we<00:04:20.780> can<00:04:21.020> go<00:04:21.200> that

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
us the furthest that we can go that

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.230 
us the furthest that we can go that
would<00:04:22.280> have<00:04:22.370> been<00:04:22.400> the<00:04:22.580> one<00:04:22.760> thing<00:04:23.000> yesterday

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
would have been the one thing yesterday

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.150 
would have been the one thing yesterday
that<00:04:23.660> I<00:04:23.690> think

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
that I think

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.250 
that I think
share<00:04:24.490> in<00:04:24.670> a<00:04:24.760> little<00:04:25.030> disappointment<00:04:25.750> not<00:04:26.230> a

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
share in a little disappointment not a

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.440 
share in a little disappointment not a
lot<00:04:26.530> but<00:04:26.800> there<00:04:27.520> were<00:04:27.610> times<00:04:27.820> we<00:04:28.090> were<00:04:28.210> picking

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
lot but there were times we were picking

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.120 
lot but there were times we were picking
and<00:04:28.690> choosing<00:04:28.720> on<00:04:29.200> how<00:04:29.350> hard<00:04:29.560> we<00:04:29.740> were<00:04:29.860> playing

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
and choosing on how hard we were playing

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.980 
and choosing on how hard we were playing
defensively<00:04:30.700> and<00:04:31.000> you<00:04:31.480> know<00:04:31.600> if<00:04:31.660> you<00:04:31.750> look<00:04:31.870> at

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
defensively and you know if you look at

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.900 
defensively and you know if you look at
the<00:04:32.020> final<00:04:32.440> score<00:04:32.590> and<00:04:33.070> how<00:04:33.220> Texas<00:04:33.730> Southern

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
the final score and how Texas Southern

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.450 
the final score and how Texas Southern
scored<00:04:34.390> on<00:04:34.540> us<00:04:34.570> they<00:04:35.320> scored<00:04:35.710> on<00:04:35.860> us<00:04:35.890> easier

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
scored on us they scored on us easier

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.520 
scored on us they scored on us easier
than<00:04:36.640> a<00:04:36.670> lot<00:04:36.880> of<00:04:37.030> teams<00:04:37.300> recently<00:04:37.870> have<00:04:38.080> so

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
than a lot of teams recently have so

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.860 
than a lot of teams recently have so
that's<00:04:39.100> hopefully<00:04:39.790> we<00:04:40.210> got<00:04:40.360> that<00:04:40.540> out<00:04:40.690> of<00:04:40.720> our

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
that's hopefully we got that out of our

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.340 
that's hopefully we got that out of our

says Matt sports 360 AZ do you like

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.210 
says Matt sports 360 AZ do you like
these<00:04:49.120> games<00:04:49.450> with<00:04:50.170> that<00:04:50.380> and<00:04:50.680> would<00:04:50.890> you<00:04:51.010> play

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
these games with that and would you play

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.270 
these games with that and would you play
them<00:04:51.310> during<00:04:51.460> the<00:04:51.640> regular<00:04:52.000> season<00:04:52.920> no<00:04:53.920> it's

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
them during the regular season no it's

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.890 
them during the regular season no it's
you<00:04:54.460> know<00:04:54.550> it's<00:04:54.580> hard<00:04:54.880> to<00:04:55.000> play<00:04:55.300> someone<00:04:55.630> that

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
you know it's hard to play someone that

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.730 
you know it's hard to play someone that
you<00:04:55.990> care<00:04:56.200> a<00:04:56.230> lot<00:04:56.410> about<00:04:56.790> and<00:04:58.560> you<00:04:59.560> know<00:04:59.590> this

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
you care a lot about and you know this

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.800 
you care a lot about and you know this
is<00:04:59.920> the<00:05:00.040> third<00:05:00.250> time<00:05:00.280> that<00:05:00.670> we've<00:05:00.820> played<00:05:01.120> so<00:05:01.510> I

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
is the third time that we've played so I

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.780 
is the third time that we've played so I
think<00:05:02.140> every<00:05:02.470> time<00:05:02.650> that<00:05:02.890> it<00:05:03.040> happens<00:05:03.460> it's

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
think every time that it happens it's

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.330 
think every time that it happens it's
it's<00:05:04.090> less<00:05:04.750> of<00:05:04.930> a<00:05:05.050> burden<00:05:05.230> and<00:05:05.650> it's<00:05:05.770> more<00:05:06.040> it

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
it's less of a burden and it's more it

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.080 
it's less of a burden and it's more it
feels<00:05:06.580> more<00:05:06.910> natural<00:05:07.590> and<00:05:08.590> this<00:05:09.460> feels<00:05:09.730> more

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
feels more natural and this feels more

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.910 
feels more natural and this feels more
natural<00:05:10.150> now<00:05:10.720> that<00:05:10.990> may<00:05:11.110> be<00:05:11.170> the<00:05:11.290> second<00:05:11.830> time

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:11.920 
natural now that may be the second time

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.010 
natural now that may be the second time
are<00:05:12.220> certainly<00:05:12.550> the<00:05:12.640> first<00:05:12.940> time<00:05:13.210> but

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
are certainly the first time but

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.840 
are certainly the first time but
inevitably<00:05:14.950> if<00:05:15.190> you're<00:05:15.340> in<00:05:15.430> this<00:05:15.580> tournament

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
inevitably if you're in this tournament

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.640 
inevitably if you're in this tournament
you're<00:05:16.210> going<00:05:16.330> to<00:05:16.390> find<00:05:16.690> yourself<00:05:16.900> matched<00:05:17.380> up

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
you're going to find yourself matched up

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.340 
you're going to find yourself matched up
against<00:05:18.040> friends<00:05:18.460> or<00:05:18.690> former<00:05:19.690> places<00:05:20.170> that

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
against friends or former places that

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.040 
against friends or former places that
you've<00:05:20.530> been<00:05:20.800> and<00:05:21.100> it<00:05:21.400> just<00:05:21.460> seems<00:05:21.910> to<00:05:22.150> be<00:05:22.180> part

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
you've been and it just seems to be part

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.360 
you've been and it just seems to be part
of<00:05:23.080> the<00:05:23.200> storyline<00:05:23.620> that<00:05:23.800> makes<00:05:24.190> the

of the storyline that makes the

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.090

bring up my brother you know as Dayton

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.020 
bring up my brother you know as Dayton
was<00:05:29.440> march<00:05:29.740> towards<00:05:30.160> the<00:05:30.250> Final<00:05:30.610> Four<00:05:30.760> and<00:05:30.820> we

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
was march towards the Final Four and we

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.200 
was march towards the Final Four and we
were<00:05:31.180> simultaneously<00:05:32.110> but<00:05:33.010> I<00:05:33.370> guess<00:05:34.000> that's

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
were simultaneously but I guess that's
