00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:11.410
 play acoustic including 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.240
 classical guitar is best sitting 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.850
 when we are standing, we are only 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:20.280
 we imitate with the help of a belt that position 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.280
 guitars that are comfortable when sitting 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.080
 but 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.790
 you can keep your guitar differently when playing 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.790
 you can just put your right foot on your left 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.510
 similar to this position not to 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.240
 numb foot we put it on 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:06.500
 approx 15 20 height 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.940
 centimeters to someone as convenient 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.680
 in fact the guitar stays exactly the same 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.680
 on the raised right thigh 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:20.509
 I personally play that way another 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.490
 version of this planting is planting until before 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:28.119
 mustache who puts his right foot on his left 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.119
 but not like all people but around the ankle 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.200
 classical guitarists put a stand 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:12.810
 under the left foot and guitar on their left 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.790
 the hip with the head of the neck on the level 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.940
 shoulder 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.990
 mostly some slightly lower y 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.900
 some slightly higher 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.490
 depending on the height of the stand 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.990
 recent years there were innovations 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.610
 screw to the body of the guitar 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.660
 special coaster 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:34.780
 which is put on the thigh and the vitor 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.810
 take the classic position with that 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.470
 that both feet are on the floor 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.000
 while planning your own genius 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.910
 itâ€™s best not to raise your legs 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.870
 so that the diaphragm does not clamp both legs 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.459
 stand on the floor 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:54.000
 Guitar on the right thigh so here I am doing and 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.000
 that's how it sings 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.280
 voiced 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.330
 eggs slightly 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.330
 and 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.670
 whatever landing there is to it 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:25.600
 main 3 I have freedom of feeling 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:29.320
 tool sit very straight 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:33.280
 as far as possible the body is nowhere 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:35.350
 the clavicle is not forward not to the side can 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.560
 lean on the back of the chair if 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:46.300
 someone can just sit comfortably 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:49.390
 upright shoulders free somehow 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:52.060
 nadym move to feel their freedom both 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.510
 hands free and no clamps any 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.310
 stress anywhere there is no left hand free 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.680
 rises to the guitar nowhere 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.440
 all right is sticking out 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.530
 hand rests on the edge of the shell and rebekki 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.770
 slightly lower or slightly higher than the elbow in 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.170
 depending on the length of the arm and not 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.910
 presses it down and only touches something 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.500
 have a guitar without the left hand 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.010
 must hold steady 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:21.190
 but not pinned down in a classic landing 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:24.690
 same shoulders loose nothing 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:27.630
 clamped nowhere turned on 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.980
 upper deck or vertically 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.980
 either slightly tilted up 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.010
 try not to bend over so as not to 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.650
 tired back 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.870
 for this we must of course quickly 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.470
 learn to play without looking at the left and on 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.470
 right hand
