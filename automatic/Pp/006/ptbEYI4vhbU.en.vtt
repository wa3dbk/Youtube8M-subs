00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200 
was right like a map of hawaii apiece it

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.260 
was right like a map of hawaii apiece it
was<00:06:17.380> her<00:06:17.980> because<00:06:18.250> she<00:06:18.370> likes<00:06:18.580> plotted<00:06:19.090> and

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
was her because she likes plotted and

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.120 
was her because she likes plotted and
everything<00:06:19.690> it<00:06:20.050> looked<00:06:20.260> like<00:06:20.350> it<00:06:20.560> was<00:06:20.680> a<00:06:20.710> splat

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.130 
everything it looked like it was a splat

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.680 
everything it looked like it was a splat
but<00:06:21.520> you<00:06:21.610> could<00:06:21.730> see<00:06:21.940> this<00:06:22.090> flat<00:06:22.360> there<00:06:22.510> was<00:06:22.600> a

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
but you could see this flat there was a

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.990 
but you could see this flat there was a
mark<00:06:22.960> where<00:06:23.140> the<00:06:23.200> splat<00:06:23.500> was<00:06:23.710> right<00:06:23.980> yeah<00:06:24.640> like

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
mark where the splat was right yeah like

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.090 
mark where the splat was right yeah like
Gorbachev's<00:06:25.630> forehead<00:06:26.080> yeah<00:06:26.710> like<00:06:26.800> orbit

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100 
Gorbachev's forehead yeah like orbit

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.130 
Gorbachev's forehead yeah like orbit
just<00:06:27.280> forehead<00:06:27.640> exactly<00:06:28.150> kelly<00:06:28.780> that's<00:06:29.050> a

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140 
just forehead exactly kelly that's a

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.230 
just forehead exactly kelly that's a
rather<00:06:29.380> common<00:06:29.800> thing<00:06:30.220> it's<00:06:30.610> a<00:06:30.850> sort<00:06:31.090> of<00:06:31.120> an

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
rather common thing it's a sort of an

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.060 
rather common thing it's a sort of an
allergic<00:06:31.510> mediate<00:06:32.050> reaction<00:06:32.650> it<00:06:32.800> doesn't

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070 
allergic mediate reaction it doesn't

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.400 
allergic mediate reaction it doesn't
mean<00:06:33.220> anything<00:06:33.250> at<00:06:34.060> people<00:06:34.330> or<00:06:34.570> it<00:06:34.810> it's<00:06:35.200> not

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:35.410 
mean anything at people or it it's not

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.380 
mean anything at people or it it's not
release<00:06:35.919> that<00:06:36.610> would<00:06:36.820> be<00:06:36.940> it's<00:06:37.060> not<00:06:37.210> even

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:37.390 
release that would be it's not even

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.760 
release that would be it's not even
really<00:06:37.480> a<00:06:37.600> loegen<00:06:37.960> sort<00:06:38.169> of<00:06:38.230> a<00:06:38.290> chemical

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:38.770 
really a loegen sort of a chemical

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.890 
really a loegen sort of a chemical
reaction<00:06:38.860> to<00:06:39.310> his<00:06:39.790> stuff<00:06:40.090> and<00:06:40.419> it's<00:06:40.540> nothing

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:40.900 
reaction to his stuff and it's nothing

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.560 
reaction to his stuff and it's nothing
it<00:06:41.080> doesn't<00:06:41.110> have<00:06:41.470> any<00:06:41.620> implications<00:06:42.190> really

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:42.570 
it doesn't have any implications really

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.570 
it doesn't have any implications really
but<00:06:43.570> because<00:06:43.960> it's<00:06:44.110> so<00:06:44.290> basic<00:06:44.680> or<00:06:45.160> something

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580 
but because it's so basic or something

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.880 
but because it's so basic or something
no<00:06:45.940> because<00:06:46.180> also<00:06:46.840> if<00:06:46.930> you<00:06:47.050> use<00:06:47.140> a<00:06:47.169> wood<00:06:47.440> spoon

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:47.890 
no because also if you use a wood spoon

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.700 
no because also if you use a wood spoon
that<00:06:48.400> will<00:06:48.910> also<00:06:49.060> make<00:06:49.510> it<00:06:49.540> all<00:06:49.870> worse<00:06:50.140> I<00:06:50.440> think

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:50.710 
that will also make it all worse I think

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.470 
that will also make it all worse I think
it's<00:06:50.830> just<00:06:50.890> you<00:06:51.190> know<00:06:51.310> your<00:06:51.490> skin<00:06:51.820> Kelly<00:06:52.150> it's

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:52.480 
it's just you know your skin Kelly it's

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.570 
it's just you know your skin Kelly it's
it's<00:06:52.810> you<00:06:53.050> know<00:06:53.169> since<00:06:53.560> organic<00:06:54.130> matter<00:06:54.370> just

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.580 
it's you know since organic matter just

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.680 
it's you know since organic matter just

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:55.690 
like anything else and when it gets

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.420

something<00:06:56.020> on<00:06:56.230> it<00:06:56.290> that<00:06:56.500> it's<00:06:56.800> not<00:06:56.950> usually
