00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.119 
isn't whether or not you're using script
but<00:00:44.510> it's<00:00:44.660> really<00:00:44.840> just<00:00:45.469> how<00:00:45.620> clean<00:00:45.890> is<00:00:46.100> your

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:48.589 
writing are the lines symmetrical I

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:50.919

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:54.319 
once I stop drinking coffee for a year

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:56.319 
once I stop drinking coffee for a year
because<00:00:54.499> I<00:00:54.710> wanted<00:00:54.980> to<00:00:55.100> practice<00:00:55.519> writing<00:00:56.239> on

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
because I wanted to practice writing on

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.389 
because I wanted to practice writing on
cakes<00:00:56.629> and<00:00:56.839> I<00:00:56.899> felt<00:00:57.109> like<00:00:57.230> I'd<00:00:57.379> be<00:00:57.499> able<00:00:57.649> to<00:00:57.769> do

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
cakes and I felt like I'd be able to do

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.029 
cakes and I felt like I'd be able to do
it<00:00:58.519> better<00:00:58.760> if<00:00:59.059> I<00:00:59.690> didn't<00:01:00.319> have<00:01:00.440> any<00:01:00.589> coffee

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
it better if I didn't have any coffee

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.969 
it better if I didn't have any coffee
and<00:01:01.850> it<00:01:02.329> worked<00:01:02.539> marginally<00:01:03.140> well<00:01:03.289> I<00:01:03.559> still

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
and it worked marginally well I still

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:05.710 
and it worked marginally well I still
don't<00:01:04.129> write<00:01:04.370> that<00:01:04.519> well<00:01:04.760> I'm<00:01:05.030> a<00:01:05.120> lefty<00:01:05.540> and<00:01:05.570> I

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
don't write that well I'm a lefty and I

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.180 
don't write that well I'm a lefty and I
don't<00:01:05.870> know<00:01:05.990> if<00:01:06.080> that<00:01:06.229> has<00:01:06.409> an<00:01:06.560> impact<00:01:06.830> or<00:01:07.070> not

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
don't know if that has an impact or not

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.730 
don't know if that has an impact or not
but<00:01:07.460> in<00:01:07.550> any<00:01:07.610> event<00:01:07.760> I<00:01:08.240> do<00:01:08.600> try<00:01:08.990> to<00:01:09.020> get<00:01:09.350> all<00:01:09.560> my

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
lines nice and parallel so that things

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.460 
lines nice and parallel so that things
look<00:01:12.710> reasonably<00:01:13.250> clean<00:01:13.670> and<00:01:13.970> if<00:01:14.270> I<00:01:14.360> have<00:01:14.600> more

you<00:02:07.490> are<00:02:07.610> going<00:02:07.730> to<00:02:07.790> have<00:02:07.970> to<00:02:08.149> sort<00:02:08.720> of<00:02:08.810> reverse

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
you are going to have to sort of reverse

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.930 
you are going to have to sort of reverse
things<00:02:09.500> well<00:02:09.769> when<00:02:10.099> I<00:02:10.129> learned<00:02:10.429> how<00:02:10.580> to<00:02:10.610> do<00:02:10.849> it

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
things well when I learned how to do it

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.520 
things well when I learned how to do it
it<00:02:11.000> was<00:02:11.120> your<00:02:11.300> magazines<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.050> it<00:02:12.140> was<00:02:12.230> really

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
it was your magazines and it was really

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.380 
it was your magazines and it was really
hard<00:02:12.739> to<00:02:13.280> reverse<00:02:13.430> everything<00:02:13.849> it<00:02:14.209> was<00:02:14.300> very

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
hard to reverse everything it was very

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.210 
hard to reverse everything it was very
very<00:02:14.780> challenging<00:02:15.019> to<00:02:15.440> learn<00:02:15.590> these<00:02:15.860> so<00:02:16.040> now<00:02:16.190> I

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
very challenging to learn these so now I

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.339 
very challenging to learn these so now I
guess<00:02:16.489> this<00:02:17.090> is<00:02:17.269> payback<00:02:17.480> time<00:02:17.870> for<00:02:18.140> all<00:02:18.230> you

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
guess this is payback time for all you

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:19.270 
guess this is payback time for all you
righties<00:02:18.709> out<00:02:18.890> there

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
righties out there

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.059 
righties out there
I'll<00:02:19.670> start<00:02:20.030> by<00:02:20.180> piping<00:02:20.629> a<00:02:20.840> little<00:02:21.170> conical

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
I'll start by piping a little conical

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.800 
I'll start by piping a little conical
shaped<00:02:22.340> bulb<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:22.940> then<00:02:23.060> I'm<00:02:23.150> going<00:02:23.269> to<00:02:23.330> go<00:02:23.480> up

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
shaped bulb and then I'm going to go up

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.680 
shaped bulb and then I'm going to go up
and<00:02:24.110> over<00:02:24.440> one<00:02:25.660> two

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
and over one two

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.450 
and over one two
three<00:02:28.690> times<00:02:29.020> now<00:02:29.920> I'm<00:02:30.040> going<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.220> put<00:02:30.370> an

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
three times now I'm going to put an

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:37.610 
three times now I'm going to put an
outer<00:02:30.700> row

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.280 

and<00:02:38.160> I'll<00:02:38.310> go<00:02:38.489> around<00:02:38.879> a<00:02:39.180> couple<00:02:39.629> times<00:02:39.750> until

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
and I'll go around a couple times until

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.699 
and I'll go around a couple times until
it<00:02:40.379> feels<00:02:40.680> like<00:02:40.860> it's<00:02:41.010> got<00:02:41.190> enough<00:02:41.489> bulk<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:42.629> it

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
it feels like it's got enough bulk to it

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.960 
it feels like it's got enough bulk to it
there's<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:43.980> rose<00:02:44.190> I'm<00:02:44.430> going<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.640> pick<00:02:44.819> it<00:02:44.910> up

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
there's the rose I'm going to pick it up

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.720 
there's the rose I'm going to pick it up
with<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.239> scissors<00:02:45.629> and<00:02:47.269> place<00:02:48.269> it<00:02:48.510> right

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
with the scissors and place it right

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.780 
with the scissors and place it right
here<00:02:50.730> I'll<00:02:51.330> make<00:02:51.510> another<00:02:52.190> I'll<00:02:53.190> start<00:02:53.610> by

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
here I'll make another I'll start by

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.289 
here I'll make another I'll start by
piping<00:02:54.239> a<00:02:54.480> little<00:02:55.349> bulb<00:02:55.590> here<00:02:56.129> and<00:02:56.819> now<00:02:57.120> I'm

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
piping a little bulb here and now I'm

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.949 
piping a little bulb here and now I'm
going<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.510> make<00:02:58.760> three<00:02:59.760> overlapping<00:03:00.330> petals

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
going to make three overlapping petals

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.070 
going to make three overlapping petals
and<00:03:01.970> then<00:03:02.970> make<00:03:03.180> another<00:03:03.330> row<00:03:03.780> outside<00:03:04.349> that

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
and then make another row outside that

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.050 
and then make another row outside that
maybe<00:03:07.080> add<00:03:07.290> in<00:03:07.319> a<00:03:07.560> couple<00:03:07.920> more<00:03:08.099> until<00:03:09.000> it

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
maybe add in a couple more until it

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.750 
maybe add in a couple more until it
looks<00:03:09.269> like<00:03:09.360> it's<00:03:09.630> amply<00:03:10.019> big<00:03:10.370> there<00:03:11.370> we<00:03:11.519> have

to<00:04:01.739> have<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.250> nice<00:04:02.549> paper<00:04:03.480> cone<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:04.519> cut<00:04:05.519> that

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
to have a nice paper cone and cut that

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.379 
to have a nice paper cone and cut that
into<00:04:05.970> a<00:04:06.419> V<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.200> then<00:04:07.680> pipe<00:04:07.980> this<00:04:08.790> way<00:04:09.030> I<00:04:09.060> think

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
into a V and then pipe this way I think

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:10.729 
into a V and then pipe this way I think
they<00:04:09.480> look<00:04:09.660> a<00:04:09.750> little<00:04:09.900> more<00:04:10.049> delicate<00:04:10.530> let<00:04:10.680> me

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
they look a little more delicate let me

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:18.159 
they look a little more delicate let me
show<00:04:10.889> you<00:04:10.980> how<00:04:11.160> I<00:04:11.190> do<00:04:11.340> that<00:04:11.760> just<00:04:12.540> cut<00:04:12.930> here<00:04:13.380> and

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.229 

cut<00:04:19.169> here<00:04:19.620> and<00:04:19.829> I'm<00:04:19.889> going<00:04:20.010> to<00:04:20.099> squeeze<00:04:20.760> to<00:04:21.000> see

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
cut here and I'm going to squeeze to see

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.850 
cut here and I'm going to squeeze to see
if<00:04:21.359> it's<00:04:21.539> coming<00:04:21.840> out<00:04:21.959> symmetrically<00:04:22.710> and

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
if it's coming out symmetrically and

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.440 
if it's coming out symmetrically and
it's<00:04:22.950> not<00:04:23.160> quite<00:04:23.520> symmetrical<00:04:23.760> so<00:04:24.240> I'm<00:04:24.330> going

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
it's not quite symmetrical so I'm going

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.450 
it's not quite symmetrical so I'm going
to<00:04:24.510> cut<00:04:24.660> a<00:04:24.690> little<00:04:24.870> bit<00:04:25.020> more<00:04:25.289> off<00:04:25.470> and<00:04:26.070> try<00:04:26.400> it

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
to cut a little bit more off and try it

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.320 
to cut a little bit more off and try it
again<00:04:26.639> to<00:04:27.060> see<00:04:27.419> that's<00:04:28.200> better<00:04:29.180> and<00:04:30.180> you'll

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
again to see that's better and you'll

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.839 
again to see that's better and you'll
notice<00:04:30.570> I'm<00:04:30.870> kind<00:04:31.080> of<00:04:31.139> shivering<00:04:32.010> my<00:04:32.160> hand<00:04:32.550> so

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849 
notice I'm kind of shivering my hand so

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:36.650 
notice I'm kind of shivering my hand so
that<00:04:32.880> you<00:04:33.060> get<00:04:33.240> a<00:04:33.270> little<00:04:33.570> bit<00:04:33.630> of<00:04:33.780> texture<00:04:35.660> in

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
that you get a little bit of texture in

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.680 
that you get a little bit of texture in
each<00:04:37.200> one<00:04:37.410> of<00:04:37.470> the<00:04:37.620> leaves<00:04:38.150> and<00:04:39.150> then<00:04:39.419> maybe<00:04:39.599> a

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
each one of the leaves and then maybe a

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:47.680 
each one of the leaves and then maybe a
few<00:04:40.050> leaves<00:04:40.260> out<00:04:40.560> here

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.750 

I'll<00:04:48.140> finish<00:04:48.440> this<00:04:48.770> by<00:04:49.010> making<00:04:49.400> slightly

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
I'll finish this by making slightly

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.390 
I'll finish this by making slightly
larger<00:04:50.540> leaves<00:04:50.780> that<00:04:51.140> come<00:04:51.410> from<00:04:51.620> the<00:04:51.800> base<00:04:52.070> of

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
larger leaves that come from the base of

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.550 
larger leaves that come from the base of
the<00:04:52.430> rose<00:04:52.790> so<00:04:53.240> that<00:04:53.390> instead<00:04:54.050> of<00:04:54.110> just<00:04:54.230> looking

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
the rose so that instead of just looking

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.410 
the rose so that instead of just looking
at<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:54.800> yellow<00:04:55.190> I'm<00:04:55.790> going<00:04:55.970> to<00:04:56.030> be<00:04:56.120> able<00:04:56.210> to

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
at the yellow I'm going to be able to

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.720 
at the yellow I'm going to be able to
look<00:04:56.570> at<00:04:56.720> a<00:04:56.810> nice<00:04:56.960> little<00:04:57.350> fringe<00:04:58.220> of<00:04:58.400> green

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
look at a nice little fringe of green

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
look at a nice little fringe of green
now<00:04:59.570> one<00:05:00.140> thing<00:05:00.290> I'd<00:05:00.410> like<00:05:00.530> to<00:05:00.590> point<00:05:00.950> out<00:05:01.160> and

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
now one thing I'd like to point out and

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.930 
now one thing I'd like to point out and
that<00:05:02.750> is<00:05:02.960> that<00:05:03.230> when<00:05:03.650> I<00:05:03.680> wrote<00:05:03.980> happy<00:05:04.550> birthday

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
that is that when I wrote happy birthday

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.540 
that is that when I wrote happy birthday
mom<00:05:05.180> I<00:05:05.480> noticed<00:05:06.020> right<00:05:06.110> off<00:05:06.410> the<00:05:06.590> bat<00:05:06.740> that<00:05:06.770> the

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
mom I noticed right off the bat that the

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.960 
mom I noticed right off the bat that the
birthday<00:05:07.970> wasn't<00:05:08.210> centered<00:05:08.780> to<00:05:08.960> my<00:05:09.140> liking<00:05:09.440> so

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
birthday wasn't centered to my liking so

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.030 
birthday wasn't centered to my liking so
I<00:05:10.970> made<00:05:11.390> that<00:05:11.510> mental<00:05:11.870> note<00:05:12.110> and<00:05:12.140> then<00:05:12.590> when<00:05:13.010> I

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
I made that mental note and then when I

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.420 
I made that mental note and then when I
did<00:05:13.340> the<00:05:13.520> spray<00:05:14.000> I<00:05:14.390> made<00:05:15.380> sure<00:05:15.740> that<00:05:15.770> I<00:05:16.100> had<00:05:16.220> the

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
did the spray I made sure that I had the

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.370 
did the spray I made sure that I had the
spray<00:05:16.910> coming<00:05:17.270> all<00:05:17.510> the<00:05:17.720> way<00:05:17.750> up<00:05:17.840> to<00:05:18.080> the<00:05:18.170> left

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
spray coming all the way up to the left

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.870 
spray coming all the way up to the left
of<00:05:18.560> the<00:05:18.650> B<00:05:18.890> there<00:05:19.130> was<00:05:19.220> a<00:05:19.280> little<00:05:19.520> bit<00:05:19.610> more

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
of the B there was a little bit more

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.390 
of the B there was a little bit more
space<00:05:20.180> to<00:05:20.420> the<00:05:20.540> left<00:05:20.870> of<00:05:21.080> the<00:05:21.200> B<00:05:21.410> than<00:05:22.040> to<00:05:22.280> the

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
space to the left of the B than to the

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.790 
space to the left of the B than to the
right<00:05:22.610> of<00:05:22.880> the<00:05:23.030> why<00:05:23.500> people<00:05:24.500> would<00:05:24.650> have

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
right of the why people would have

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.370 
right of the why people would have
noticed<00:05:25.460> that<00:05:25.970> the<00:05:26.210> birthday<00:05:26.570> wasn't<00:05:27.170> quite

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
noticed that the birthday wasn't quite

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.320 
noticed that the birthday wasn't quite
centered<00:05:27.920> but<00:05:28.040> I<00:05:28.100> think<00:05:28.370> that<00:05:28.580> the<00:05:28.850> act<00:05:29.060> of

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
centered but I think that the act of

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.030 
centered but I think that the act of
bringing<00:05:29.690> the<00:05:29.840> spray<00:05:30.230> all<00:05:30.500> the<00:05:30.620> way<00:05:30.710> up<00:05:30.800> to<00:05:30.920> the

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
bringing the spray all the way up to the

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.920 
bringing the spray all the way up to the
top<00:05:31.310> makes<00:05:31.700> it<00:05:31.910> so<00:05:32.090> that<00:05:32.120> the<00:05:32.270> cake<00:05:32.570> looks<00:05:32.840> a

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
top makes it so that the cake looks a

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.300 
top makes it so that the cake looks a
bit<00:05:32.960> more<00:05:33.290> symmetrical<00:05:33.860> than<00:05:33.920> it<00:05:34.160> otherwise

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
bit more symmetrical than it otherwise

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.900 
bit more symmetrical than it otherwise
would<00:05:34.610> and<00:05:35.180> so<00:05:35.990> here<00:05:36.380> is<00:05:36.650> our<00:05:37.010> cake<00:05:37.400> for<00:05:37.760> Mom
