to be in for it to work and it's

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.340

it<00:01:29.400> but<00:01:29.579> if<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.759> put<00:01:29.909> them<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.090> order<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.570> ace

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
it but if you put them in order so ace

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.710 
it but if you put them in order so ace
through<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.920> King<00:01:32.189> in<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:33.090> pie<00:01:33.270> all<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.630> them

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
through to King in a pie all of them

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.999 
through to King in a pie all of them
like<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.049> then<00:01:34.200> it'll<00:01:34.320> be<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.470> lot<00:01:34.619> easier<00:01:34.680> to

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
like that then it'll be a lot easier to

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.679 
like that then it'll be a lot easier to
search<00:01:35.340> through<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.700> cards<00:01:36.090> for<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.450> number

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
search through the cards for the number

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.289 
search through the cards for the number
that<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.900> actually<00:01:37.049> need<00:01:37.970> so<00:01:38.970> now<00:01:39.090> I'm<00:01:39.210> going

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
that you actually need so now I'm going

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.550 
that you actually need so now I'm going
to<00:01:39.360> explain<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.990> what<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.229> order<00:01:40.409> has<00:01:40.530> to

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
to explain to you what the order has to

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.990 
to explain to you what the order has to
be<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.780> if<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.930> start<00:01:43.140> with<00:01:43.259> clubs<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:44.000> pick

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
be and if you start with clubs and pick

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.389 
be and if you start with clubs and pick
out<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.270> three<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:46.320> can<00:01:46.500> be<00:01:46.619> any<00:01:46.770> number<00:01:46.920> but<00:01:47.250> I

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
out the three it can be any number but I

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.800 
out the three it can be any number but I
find<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.759> easier<00:01:47.820> if<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.119> just<00:01:48.270> start<00:01:48.540> on<00:01:48.659> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
find it easier if you just start on the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.139 
find it easier if you just start on the
three<00:01:49.159> because<00:01:50.159> you're<00:01:50.640> actually<00:01:50.939> going<00:01:51.060> to

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
three because you're actually going to

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.620 
three because you're actually going to
be<00:01:51.210> adding<00:01:52.610> adding<00:01:53.610> three<00:01:53.880> numbers<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.240> then

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
be adding adding three numbers and then

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.840 
be adding adding three numbers and then
add<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.140> next<00:01:55.380> card<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.640> have<00:01:56.729> the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
add in the next card so you have the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.160 
add in the next card so you have the
three<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.119> clubs<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.600> have<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.840> six<00:01:58.049> of

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
three of clubs so you have the six of

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.649 
three of clubs so you have the six of
Hearts<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.619> have<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.950> nine<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.340> spades<00:01:59.909> so

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
Hearts you have the nine of spades so

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.120 
Hearts you have the nine of spades so
you<00:02:00.750> have<00:02:01.049> three<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.530> clubs<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:01.860> your<00:02:01.950> hands

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
you have three of clubs in your hands

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.399 
you have three of clubs in your hands
and<00:02:02.579> just<00:02:02.759> grab<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.119> six<00:02:03.299> hearts<00:02:03.689> this<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.290> why

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
and just grab the six hearts this is why

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.499 
and just grab the six hearts this is why
it<00:02:04.500> would<00:02:04.619> be<00:02:04.649> 0k<00:02:05.460> we're<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:05.790> order<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.479> can

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
it would be 0k we're in order so you can

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.270 
it would be 0k we're in order so you can
just<00:02:06.810> see<00:02:07.259> where<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.590> straight<00:02:07.860> away<00:02:07.979> and

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
just see where it is straight away and

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.750 
just see where it is straight away and
you<00:02:09.119> want<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.330> put<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.569> on<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.869> top<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:10.979> just

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
you want to put that on the top so just

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.490 
you want to put that on the top so just
put<00:02:11.879> them<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.150> pile<00:02:12.300> like<00:02:12.540> that

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
put them in a pile like that

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.230 
put them in a pile like that
then<00:02:13.680> go<00:02:13.890> ahead<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.400> keep<00:02:14.700> on<00:02:14.850> adding<00:02:15.060> on

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
then go ahead and keep on adding on

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.420 
then go ahead and keep on adding on
three<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:16.110> just<00:02:16.500> do<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.680> few<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.100> you<00:02:17.130> get<00:02:17.340> the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
three so I just do a few so you get the

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.930 
three so I just do a few so you get the
idea<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.180> that's<00:02:18.480> really<00:02:18.720> simple<00:02:19.130> so<00:02:20.130> nine<00:02:20.730> of

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
idea and that's really simple so nine of

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.990 
idea and that's really simple so nine of
spades<00:02:21.240> and<00:02:21.740> then<00:02:22.740> ten<00:02:23.100> Jack<00:02:23.370> queen<00:02:23.760> of

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
spades and then ten Jack queen of

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.170 
spades and then ten Jack queen of
diamonds<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:25.160> then<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.610> get<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.820> hang<00:02:26.970> of<00:02:27.060> it

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
diamonds and then you get the hang of it

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.270 
diamonds and then you get the hang of it
so<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:27.420> just<00:02:27.570> go<00:02:27.720> through<00:02:27.990> and<00:02:28.260> go<00:02:28.980> until

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
so you just go through and go until

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.190 
so you just go through and go until
you've<00:02:29.400> done<00:02:29.580> all<00:02:29.820> of<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.060> cards<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.510> then

they<00:03:03.630> pick<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.370> from<00:03:05.370> where<00:03:05.520> they've<00:03:05.670> picked

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
they pick so from where they've picked

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.240 
they pick so from where they've picked
that<00:03:06.030> out<00:03:06.150> there<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:07.410> give<00:03:07.830> that<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.010> them

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
that out there you give that to them

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.430 
that out there you give that to them
make<00:03:08.820> sure<00:03:08.850> it's<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.270> one<00:03:09.300> card<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:09.870> then

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
make sure it's the one card and then

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.229 
make sure it's the one card and then
here's<00:03:10.860> a<00:03:11.040> really<00:03:11.430> important<00:03:11.820> part<00:03:11.910> you<00:03:12.120> need

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
here's a really important part you need

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.610 
here's a really important part you need
to<00:03:12.300> make<00:03:12.450> sure<00:03:12.600> that<00:03:12.750> you<00:03:12.870> put<00:03:13.020> the<00:03:13.050> right<00:03:13.380> hand

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
to make sure that you put the right hand

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.820 
to make sure that you put the right hand
pile<00:03:14.160> on<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.550> bottom<00:03:15.450> and<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:16.470> left<00:03:16.590> hand

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
pile on the bottom and the left hand

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.229 
pile on the bottom and the left hand
pile<00:03:17.070> on<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.280> top<00:03:17.549> if<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:17.880> do<00:03:18.060> it<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.209> other

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
pile on the top if you do it the other

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.330 
pile on the top if you do it the other
way<00:03:18.420> around<00:03:18.660> then<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:18.930> won't<00:03:19.019> work<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:19.560> this

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
way around then it won't work and this

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.310 
way around then it won't work and this
is<00:03:20.459> where<00:03:20.640> obviously<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.780> don't<00:03:22.019> know<00:03:22.200> what

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
is where obviously you don't know what

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.660 
is where obviously you don't know what
their<00:03:22.470> card<00:03:22.650> is<00:03:22.799> yet<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.160> this<00:03:23.250> is<00:03:23.400> where<00:03:23.580> you

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
their card is yet and this is where you

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.060 
their card is yet and this is where you
need<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:23.940> guess<00:03:24.120> or<00:03:25.110> actually<00:03:25.769> where<00:03:25.950> you

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
need to guess or actually where you

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.060 
need to guess or actually where you
figure<00:03:26.850> out<00:03:26.880> what<00:03:27.120> their<00:03:27.269> card<00:03:27.480> is<00:03:27.799> so<00:03:28.799> to<00:03:28.860> do

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
figure out what their card is so to do

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.160 
figure out what their card is so to do
this<00:03:29.250> you<00:03:30.150> look<00:03:30.330> at<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.600> bottom<00:03:30.870> of<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.019> deck

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
this you look at the bottom of the deck

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.440 
this you look at the bottom of the deck
I<00:03:31.440> don't<00:03:31.920> want<00:03:32.070> to<00:03:32.130> do<00:03:32.220> it<00:03:32.340> obviously<00:03:32.880> like<00:03:33.180> if

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
I don't want to do it obviously like if

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.880 
I don't want to do it obviously like if
they<00:03:33.570> see<00:03:33.630> you<00:03:33.900> looking<00:03:34.380> at<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.560> bottom<00:03:34.830> of

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
they see you looking at the bottom of

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.590 
they see you looking at the bottom of
the<00:03:34.950> deck<00:03:35.100> instead<00:03:35.310> they're<00:03:36.180> obviously<00:03:36.450> going

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
the deck instead they're obviously going

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.120 
the deck instead they're obviously going
to<00:03:36.660> think<00:03:36.870> that<00:03:37.110> that's<00:03:37.680> how<00:03:37.830> you're<00:03:38.040> getting

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
to think that that's how you're getting

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.670 
to think that that's how you're getting
the<00:03:38.370> card<00:03:38.610> so<00:03:38.910> just<00:03:39.570> take<00:03:40.080> a<00:03:40.110> sneaky<00:03:40.590> little

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
the card so just take a sneaky little

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.680 
the card so just take a sneaky little
glance<00:03:40.980> at<00:03:41.190> it<00:03:41.220> like<00:03:41.430> that<00:03:41.640> so<00:03:42.360> here<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.600> can

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
glance at it like that so here you can

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.600 
glance at it like that so here you can
see<00:03:42.900> that<00:03:43.440> is<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.650> eight<00:03:43.920> of<00:03:43.950> diamonds<00:03:44.220> and

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
see that is the eight of diamonds and

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.970 
see that is the eight of diamonds and
this<00:03:45.450> is<00:03:45.600> where<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.870> chased<00:03:46.140> rule<00:03:46.500> comes<00:03:46.739> in

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
this is where the chased rule comes in

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.490 
this is where the chased rule comes in
and<00:03:47.130> this<00:03:47.190> is<00:03:47.340> why<00:03:47.489> it's<00:03:47.670> called<00:03:47.790> chased<00:03:48.150> is

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
and this is why it's called chased is

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.490 
and this is why it's called chased is
you<00:03:49.500> need<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:50.600> work<00:03:51.600> your<00:03:51.780> way<00:03:51.870> through<00:03:51.900> and

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
you need to work your way through and

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.890 
you need to work your way through and
figure<00:03:52.769> out<00:03:52.799> so<00:03:53.579> we're<00:03:54.299> on<00:03:54.360> the<00:03:54.480> diamonds

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
figure out so we're on the diamonds

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.690 
figure out so we're on the diamonds
which<00:03:55.260> is<00:03:55.440> actually<00:03:55.799> the<00:03:55.950> last<00:03:56.160> of<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.489> chase

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
which is actually the last of the chase

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.440 
which is actually the last of the chase
so<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.780> next<00:03:57.959> in<00:03:58.140> order<00:03:58.470> is<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.709> clubs<00:03:58.950> so<00:03:59.730> if

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
so the next in order is the clubs so if

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.449 
so the next in order is the clubs so if
the<00:04:00.989> diamond<00:04:01.380> if<00:04:01.799> it's<00:04:01.950> a<00:04:02.010> diamond<00:04:02.220> on<00:04:02.430> the

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
the diamond if it's a diamond on the

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.069 
the diamond if it's a diamond on the
bottom<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:02.880> next<00:04:02.970> their<00:04:03.480> card<00:04:03.780> will<00:04:03.930> be<00:04:04.049> a

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
bottom the next their card will be a

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.410 
bottom the next their card will be a
club<00:04:04.350> say<00:04:05.220> if<00:04:05.400> it's<00:04:05.610> a<00:04:05.760> heart<00:04:06.120> on<00:04:06.299> the<00:04:06.390> bottom

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
club say if it's a heart on the bottom

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.840 
club say if it's a heart on the bottom
then<00:04:06.840> it<00:04:06.959> will<00:04:07.049> be<00:04:07.170> a<00:04:07.200> spade<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:07.739> so<00:04:08.310> on<00:04:08.459> so<00:04:08.730> is

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
then it will be a spade and so on so is

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.660 
then it will be a spade and so on so is
the<00:04:09.000> one<00:04:09.150> that's<00:04:09.840> after<00:04:10.110> the<00:04:10.709> chased<00:04:10.950> order<00:04:11.370> so

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
the one that's after the chased order so

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.819 
the one that's after the chased order so
I'll<00:04:12.570> do<00:04:12.750> it<00:04:12.810> a<00:04:12.900> couple<00:04:13.049> of<00:04:13.140> times<00:04:13.380> to<00:04:13.560> explain

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
I'll do it a couple of times to explain

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.400 
I'll do it a couple of times to explain
it<00:04:14.040> further<00:04:14.250> and<00:04:14.549> then<00:04:15.299> so<00:04:15.690> you<00:04:15.959> already<00:04:16.200> know

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
it further and then so you already know

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.990 
it further and then so you already know
that<00:04:16.440> suit<00:04:16.829> so<00:04:17.070> it's<00:04:17.220> going<00:04:17.310> to<00:04:17.370> be<00:04:17.489> a<00:04:17.519> club<00:04:17.760> and

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
that suit so it's going to be a club and

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.630 
that suit so it's going to be a club and
then<00:04:18.720> to<00:04:18.930> guess<00:04:19.109> their<00:04:19.320> actual<00:04:19.829> number<00:04:20.430> you

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
then to guess their actual number you

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.159 
then to guess their actual number you
need<00:04:20.790> to<00:04:20.910> add<00:04:21.060> on<00:04:21.090> three<00:04:21.539> to<00:04:21.720> the<00:04:21.750> number<00:04:22.080> on

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
need to add on three to the number on

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.010 
need to add on three to the number on
the<00:04:22.320> bottom<00:04:22.470> of<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.650> card<00:04:22.890> so<00:04:23.220> eight<00:04:23.910> nine<00:04:24.630> ten

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
the bottom of the card so eight nine ten

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.290 
the bottom of the card so eight nine ten
Jack<00:04:25.410> so<00:04:26.070> they<00:04:26.310> should<00:04:26.580> have<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:26.880> Jack<00:04:27.060> of

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
Jack so they should have the Jack of

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.890 
Jack so they should have the Jack of
clubs<00:04:27.449> of<00:04:27.659> this<00:04:27.780> has<00:04:27.900> worked<00:04:28.050> correctly<00:04:29.900> so

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
clubs of this has worked correctly so

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.070 
clubs of this has worked correctly so
that<00:04:31.379> obviously<00:04:31.729> there<00:04:32.729> you<00:04:32.759> go<00:04:33.020> show<00:04:34.020> you

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
that obviously there you go show you

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.809 
that obviously there you go show you
their<00:04:34.379> card<00:04:34.650> and<00:04:34.919> there'd<00:04:35.099> be<00:04:35.129> hopefully

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:35.819 
their card and there'd be hopefully

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:37.270 
their card and there'd be hopefully
amazed<00:04:36.120> at<00:04:36.360> what<00:04:36.479> you've<00:04:36.599> just<00:04:36.629> done<00:04:36.960> and<00:04:37.229> then

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
amazed at what you've just done and then

heart<00:05:05.250> for<00:05:05.580> the<00:05:05.639> chest<00:05:05.940> and<00:05:06.240> then<00:05:06.810> you<00:05:06.930> add<00:05:07.080> on

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
heart for the chest and then you add on

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.950 
heart for the chest and then you add on
ten<00:05:07.469> four<00:05:07.800> seven<00:05:08.099> eight<00:05:08.310> nine<00:05:08.759> ten<00:05:09.120> so<00:05:09.330> they

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
ten four seven eight nine ten so they

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.439
