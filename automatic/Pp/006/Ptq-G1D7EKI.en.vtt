00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.540
 Hi everyone , how are you? 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.960
 Today I'll show you how I do. 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.199
 I make my tea please I want to drums 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.410
 story of taking soda and I 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:23.279
 I always bought the year mate tea with the 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:27.510
 time and then seeing the toll in 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:33.079
 internet and I discovered that people buy 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:37.980
 has lots of sodium and health 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:44.940
 in that I am always to use for you 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:48.840
 connect to the I think that now let's 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.879
 so let's go first to the 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.520
 concentrate ingredients 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.309
 You will need two pans one 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.670
 large and an average one wooden spoon 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:03.539
 to stir cloves and cinnamon powder or 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.860
 August duck and her brand's matte tea. 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.900
 preference 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.500
 depending on the brand and may be more 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.689
 strong or weak, so be careful 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.780
 a jar that holds temperature well 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.960
 hot sieve this is mine already 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.869
 stained with so much tea and four 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.909
 bottles to store concentrate I 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.369
 I like these glass because I can handle it 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.460
 very high temperatures 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.890
 So let's put the water in the 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.640
 two pans and add cinnamon and 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.579
 clove 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.909
 I usually put two full spoons 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.299
 of cinnamon soup and two full spoons 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.350
 cable tea 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.350
 I mix and I hope to boil 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:53.340
 When I 've already retaliated, I turn off the fire. 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:55.409
 to add the matted tea put more 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.539
 or less than half the package in each 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.439
 pot placing a little more on the 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:04.109
 panela and with the fire still 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:12.629
 are mixing all the tea in the 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:15.060
 water then turn on the heat and wait to boil 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:17.580
 again at the beginning you have to stay 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.760
 mixing all the time because it boils and 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.379
 overflows like milk 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.150
 but just wait a little bit because he 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:27.410
 already adapts and does not need to stay 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.410
 mixing all the time 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.930
 I wait 15 minutes of it boiling and that's it. 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.319
 just turn off the fire separate already and the sieve 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.840
 and start sifting I'm very 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.579
 In this hour I always end up 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.650
 doing dirt in the kitchen so beware 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:50.239
 With the pan it's super hot, I always 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.239
 vague use in both hands 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.750
 and now just get the tea and put a 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.610
 glass jar 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.530
 if you do not have a glass jar that 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.970
 hang in high 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.040
 you can choose a jar of 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:09.080
 plastic but then you have to wait the 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.080
 tea to cool completely 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:18.240
 equestrian process until all tea 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.240
 of the two pots 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:29.140
 for me it always gives three and a half bottles 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.879
 but it will depend on the quality of the tea 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.680
 to know if it will get stronger 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:35.019
 or weaker 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:40.830
