00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
feels kind of small compared to the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.800 
feels kind of small compared to the
other<00:01:38.369> Bondi<00:01:39.209> vinyls<00:01:39.569> I've<00:01:39.660> had<00:01:41.270> and<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.660> is

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
other Bondi vinyls I've had and this is

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.809 
other Bondi vinyls I've had and this is
new<00:01:43.050> although<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.649> has<00:01:43.770> no<00:01:43.920> tags<00:01:44.190> but<00:01:44.550> it

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
new although it has no tags but it

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:46.669 
new although it has no tags but it
doesn't<00:01:45.360> seem<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.630> be<00:01:45.750> genuine<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.289> has<00:01:46.410> the

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
doesn't seem to be genuine it has the

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.559 
doesn't seem to be genuine it has the
the<00:01:47.149> Bondi<00:01:48.149> stampings<00:01:48.869> down<00:01:49.050> here<00:01:49.399> it<00:01:50.399> says<00:01:50.569> mm

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569 
the Bondi stampings down here it says mm

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:54.740 
the Bondi stampings down here it says mm
so<00:01:52.440> this<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.770> about<00:01:53.009> 11<00:01:53.849> years<00:01:53.940> old<00:01:54.239> but<00:01:54.569> it's

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.809 
implemented on the inside of the play I
don't<00:02:06.149> know<00:02:06.270> it's<00:02:06.420> molded<00:02:07.110> into<00:02:07.319> the<00:02:07.819> excuse

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
sprinkle on the inside but it gives a

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.350 
sprinkle on the inside but it gives a
really<00:02:13.440> nice<00:02:13.560> effect<00:02:14.000> now<00:02:15.000> as<00:02:15.120> far<00:02:15.300> as
