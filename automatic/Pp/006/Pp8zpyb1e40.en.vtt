00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
because I'm generally fairly careful

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.880 
because I'm generally fairly careful
with<00:01:53.820> my<00:01:53.970> phones<00:01:54.470> but<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.530> just<00:01:55.680> work<00:01:55.860> your

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
with my phones but you just work your

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.330 
with my phones but you just work your
way<00:01:56.130> around<00:01:56.250> get<00:01:56.579> all<00:01:56.729> those<00:01:56.880> tabs<00:01:57.210> off<00:01:58.340> and

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
way around get all those tabs off and

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.560 
way around get all those tabs off and
you<00:01:59.549> could<00:01:59.759> probably<00:01:59.909> just<00:02:00.149> pull<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.479> right

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
you could probably just pull it right

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.179 
you could probably just pull it right
off<00:02:00.630> but<00:02:02.270> there<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.390> goes<00:02:03.570> again<00:02:04.020> just<00:02:04.740> thin

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
off but there it goes again just thin

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.399 
off but there it goes again just thin
plastic<00:02:05.460> back<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.689> doesn't<00:02:06.840> really<00:02:07.020> feel

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
plastic back it doesn't really feel

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.710 
plastic back it doesn't really feel
flimsy<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.340> my<00:02:08.459> opinion<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:08.970> feels<00:02:09.149> very<00:02:09.390> much

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
flimsy in my opinion it feels very much

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.339 
flimsy in my opinion it feels very much
like<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.140> s3<00:02:10.289> on<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.520> inside<00:02:11.849> you<00:02:12.780> have<00:02:12.930> the

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
like the s3 on the inside you have the

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.550 
like the s3 on the inside you have the
the<00:02:13.530> battery<00:02:13.859> here<00:02:14.810> this<00:02:15.810> is<00:02:15.959> a<00:02:15.989> micro<00:02:16.349> SIM

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
the battery here this is a micro SIM

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.800 
the battery here this is a micro SIM
card<00:02:16.829> regular<00:02:17.249> SIM<00:02:17.519> would<00:02:17.879> fit<00:02:18.150> if<00:02:18.420> I<00:02:18.540> took<00:02:18.719> the

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
card regular SIM would fit if I took the

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.119 
card regular SIM would fit if I took the
battery<00:02:19.109> out<00:02:19.139> you<00:02:19.349> can<00:02:19.469> see<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:19.680> fit<00:02:19.829> in<00:02:19.950> there

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
battery out you can see it fit in there

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.390 
battery out you can see it fit in there
so<00:02:20.909> yeah<00:02:21.599> it's<00:02:21.749> a<00:02:21.840> dual<00:02:21.989> SIM<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.889> forgot<00:02:23.310> to

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
so yeah it's a dual SIM I forgot to

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.580 
so yeah it's a dual SIM I forgot to
mention<00:02:23.549> that<00:02:23.849> so<00:02:24.569> it's<00:02:24.780> very<00:02:24.900> easy<00:02:25.049> to<00:02:25.319> get<00:02:25.499> to

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
mention that so it's very easy to get to

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.170 
mention that so it's very easy to get to
the<00:02:25.709> insides<00:02:26.040> again<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.489> just<00:02:26.609> pull<00:02:27.030> this

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
the insides again you just pull this

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.520 
the insides again you just pull this
right<00:02:27.269> off<00:02:27.569> and<00:02:27.840> then<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.019> pop<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.349> right<00:02:28.379> back

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
right off and then you pop it right back

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.250 
right off and then you pop it right back
on<00:02:29.239> so<00:02:30.239> I'm<00:02:30.329> still<00:02:30.540> getting<00:02:30.629> used<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:30.989> this<00:02:31.109> so

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
on so I'm still getting used to this so

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.539 
on so I'm still getting used to this so
it<00:02:31.349> takes<00:02:31.500> me<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.620> little<00:02:31.769> while<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.219> get<00:02:32.310> all

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
it takes me a little while to get all

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.740 
it takes me a little while to get all
the<00:02:32.700> tabs<00:02:32.939> back<00:02:33.480> on<00:02:33.719> just<00:02:34.049> right<00:02:34.340> but<00:02:35.750> anyway

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
the tabs back on just right but anyway

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.179 
the tabs back on just right but anyway
it's<00:02:37.079> a<00:02:37.349> really<00:02:38.129> easy<00:02:38.159> to<00:02:38.519> do<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:39.500> it's<00:02:40.500> as<00:02:41.010> far

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
it's a really easy to do and it's as far

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:43.039 
it's a really easy to do and it's as far
as<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.370> can<00:02:41.430> tell<00:02:41.609> very<00:02:41.909> solid<00:02:42.329> -<00:02:42.480> I've<00:02:42.689> never

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
as I can tell very solid - I've never

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.239 
as I can tell very solid - I've never
felt<00:02:43.169> like<00:02:43.379> I<00:02:43.530> was<00:02:43.620> going<00:02:43.739> to<00:02:43.799> break<00:02:44.040> one<00:02:44.069> of

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:44.249 
felt like I was going to break one of

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:46.149 
felt like I was going to break one of
the<00:02:44.370> clips<00:02:44.609> off<00:02:44.790> while<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.060> was<00:02:45.239> doing<00:02:45.359> it

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159 
the clips off while I was doing it

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:48.369 
the clips off while I was doing it
anything<00:02:47.159> like<00:02:47.459> that

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
anything like that

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.690 
anything like that
in<00:02:49.379> terms<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.829> design<00:02:50.069> you<00:02:50.219> can<00:02:50.370> tell<00:02:50.519> it's

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
in terms of the design you can tell it's

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.580 
in terms of the design you can tell it's
it's<00:02:51.030> more<00:02:51.389> squarish<00:02:51.930> like<00:02:52.109> a<00:02:52.139> lot<00:02:52.319> of<00:02:52.409> phones

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
it's more squarish like a lot of phones

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.599 
it's more squarish like a lot of phones
are<00:02:52.769> these<00:02:52.949> days<00:02:54.919> but<00:02:55.919> yeah<00:02:56.069> that<00:02:56.250> that's<00:02:56.400> the

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
are these days but yeah that that's the

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.030 
are these days but yeah that that's the
hardware<00:02:56.939> in<00:02:57.239> a<00:02:57.569> nutshell<00:02:57.750> just<00:02:58.739> to<00:02:58.859> show<00:02:59.010> off

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
hardware in a nutshell just to show off

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.000 
hardware in a nutshell just to show off
the<00:02:59.370> video<00:02:59.669> camera<00:02:59.849> performance<00:03:00.719> of<00:03:00.840> this<00:03:01.010> so

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
the video camera performance of this so

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.459 
the video camera performance of this so
I<00:03:02.040> took<00:03:02.159> a<00:03:02.280> just<00:03:02.879> a<00:03:02.939> video<00:03:03.180> clip<00:03:03.510> walking<00:03:04.409> the

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:04.469 
I took a just a video clip walking the

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:06.110 
I took a just a video clip walking the
pooch<00:03:04.680> earlier<00:03:05.040> today<00:03:05.310> walking<00:03:05.609> around<00:03:05.909> one

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
pooch earlier today walking around one

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.199 
pooch earlier today walking around one
of<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.379> hiking<00:03:07.379> trails<00:03:07.829> here<00:03:08.120> started<00:03:09.120> my

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
of the hiking trails here started my

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.550 
of the hiking trails here started my
hand<00:03:09.389> got<00:03:09.510> in<00:03:09.599> that<00:03:09.689> way<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.049> camera<00:03:10.409> there

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
hand got in that way the camera there

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.339 
hand got in that way the camera there
but<00:03:10.799> I<00:03:11.040> know<00:03:11.669> it's<00:03:11.939> difficult<00:03:12.599> to<00:03:12.689> tell<00:03:12.840> video

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
but I know it's difficult to tell video

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:14.990 
but I know it's difficult to tell video
quality<00:03:13.889> when<00:03:14.280> you're<00:03:14.400> looking<00:03:14.579> at<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:14.819> video

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
quality when you're looking at a video

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.770 
quality when you're looking at a video
of<00:03:15.419> a<00:03:15.629> video<00:03:15.900> on<00:03:16.290> Amazon<00:03:17.010> but<00:03:18.000> overall<00:03:18.269> I<00:03:18.389> was

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
of a video on Amazon but overall I was

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.140 
of a video on Amazon but overall I was
really<00:03:19.259> happy<00:03:19.439> with<00:03:20.310> how<00:03:20.459> well<00:03:20.639> it<00:03:20.759> turned<00:03:20.819> out

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
really happy with how well it turned out

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.659 
really happy with how well it turned out
it<00:03:21.389> looks<00:03:21.540> great<00:03:21.930> on<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.199> screen<00:03:22.530> he<00:03:23.400> was<00:03:23.519> just

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:23.669
