 which we have here it is 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.259

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.870
 I done bit different times as me 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.989
 a little go behind the scenes 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.030
 for a day or a night with one 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.030
 Train Provider Tell me 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.440
 A closer look at what the colleagues 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.269
 because doing so here in Hanover 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.440
 We started with that from ece 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:49.610
 we have even cleared away 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.620
 washed this time 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.390
 we will do everything in this video 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.350
 then we have, of course, see 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.970
 the whole thing a bit more 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.620
 exactly what else is behind it 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.600
 still happens and that would like 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:05.600
 I deploy in this video 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:08.150
 a lot of fun shortly after the service began, it was 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.680
 directly already going on the first nbc came 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.119
 on time in hanover and the 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.860
 Working day took its course 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.830
 but what tasks has christoph 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.260
 actually as a train deployment yes as 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.680
 Provider 1 here in Hanover 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:25.670

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.720
 clear away 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.820
 Make them what they are going to do 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.410
 then with the rangierlok and the bc 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.600

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.790
 Afterwards pulls the park 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.080
 again completely on over lead accordingly 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.750
 single and ece shutdown then drive 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.030
 I do the same with the second bcg 42 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.120
 and then prepare the highlights 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.780
 these two have been upgraded earlier 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.940
 Turn off the train preparation 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:00.350
 reservation what belongs to everything 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:03.440
 in the morning I have a cd 3 2 403 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.760
 I drive to basel I drive 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.760
 ready in the morning and anna witt 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.130
 well then accompanied by Christoph times 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.970
 his tour is generated by the night 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.070
 provide 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.450
 a quick look out the window if all 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.490
 have left the train in the train and 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.900
 The staff has reported the train ready 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.580
 if christoph is mine too 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.570
 dispatcher ready to take off 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.490
 direction voerde do 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.470
 I would like to know something else first 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.830
 christoph in his activity the most 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.390
 fun makes this change the 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.060
 We not only have this crying here 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.840
 already teller beyond just lf 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.640
 activities 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.680
 this mismatch with us that we 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.200
 I do not believe in doing both 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.740
 so often that makes but I'm 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.740
 most fun 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.190
 after a little break comes too 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.440
 already that was black with the wa 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.850
 before coupe was the budget from 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.070
 equipped and prepared for the 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.410
 washing line exactly brings the wash 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.300
 lures now in ic the wash is 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.459
 activated the pantograph collapsed 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.470
 the fans fold closed and the 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.270
 lok pulls the train at a total of two km / h 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.739
 through the washhouse this 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.690
 speed must not be exceeded 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.050
 Otherwise the ic will not be right 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.910
 clean 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.380
 In addition, a special acid as 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.730
 detergent used with it too 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.220
 really the most stubborn dirt 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.180
 disappears afterwards this is with 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.950
 rinsed with water 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.750
 after all, it should shine again 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.980
 then the board so fast 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.420
 the train will be changed 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.769
 upgraded and it continues in 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.580
 direction long distance traffic 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.040
 hannover hainholz 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.390
 Here the question comes to my mind like 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.660
 Actually, that's with responsibility 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.810
 in the profession to the responsibility in 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.350
 my job already of course the dish 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.000
 Responsibility about these trains here 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:41.330
 should not handle it lightly 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.940
 because it's not cheap 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.519
 or it is quite a whole 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.739
 beautiful technology in here we hang 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.930
 are responsible for that in the morning 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:56.750
 the trains here these ics we in 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:58.320
 Hainholz certainly have and you say that 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.730
 security-related things no 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.380
 safety-related things here 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.920
 addressed are that the train heal 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.660
 his terminal can reach the 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.580
 first cd is now in hanover rolls 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.100
 Now make a little break then go 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.510
 It continues with the two meters exactly that 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.340
 Let's do that too, that was the first one 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.080
 provide part of the train 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.910
 I thank you for seeing 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:23.490
 and say to next pro here ever 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:26.850
 a small preview of these ics here 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.740
 of course have internal systems on it where 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.320
 They upgraded themselves in this condition 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:35.210
 turn off yourself by braking and 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.210
 Carry out self-tests
