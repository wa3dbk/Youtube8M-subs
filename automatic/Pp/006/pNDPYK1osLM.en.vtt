vehicle in the performance which is
really<00:05:37.310> cool<00:05:37.520> i<00:05:37.580> love<00:05:37.850> the<00:05:38.000> kaaba's<00:05:38.360> included

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
really cool i love the kaaba's included

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.750 
really cool i love the kaaba's included
that<00:05:38.930> with<00:05:39.080> this<00:05:39.290> of<00:05:40.010> course<00:05:40.250> you<00:05:40.370> have<00:05:40.490> live

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
that with this of course you have live

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.730 
that with this of course you have live
data<00:05:41.060> now<00:05:41.660> the<00:05:41.720> live<00:05:41.990> data<00:05:42.200> you're<00:05:42.440> going<00:05:42.650> to

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
data now the live data you're going to

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.130 
data now the live data you're going to
be<00:05:42.830> able<00:05:42.860> to<00:05:43.100> display<00:05:43.430> on<00:05:43.820> the<00:05:44.630> same<00:05:44.990> thing

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
be able to display on the same thing

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.990 
be able to display on the same thing
that<00:05:45.290> the<00:05:45.380> ECU<00:05:45.800> reads<00:05:46.070> such<00:05:46.280> as<00:05:46.430> coolant<00:05:46.790> temp

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
that the ECU reads such as coolant temp

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.840 
that the ECU reads such as coolant temp
egt<00:05:47.630> boost<00:05:48.230> that<00:05:49.040> kind<00:05:49.280> of<00:05:49.340> stuff<00:05:49.550> that's<00:05:49.640> just

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850 
egt boost that kind of stuff that's just

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.640 
egt boost that kind of stuff that's just
a<00:05:49.940> really<00:05:50.300> nice<00:05:50.810> thing<00:05:51.140> the<00:05:51.200> Kaaba<00:05:51.500> is

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
a really nice thing the Kaaba is

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:52.570 
a really nice thing the Kaaba is
included<00:05:51.980> with<00:05:52.070> that<00:05:52.190> that<00:05:52.310> you<00:05:52.370> can<00:05:52.490> just

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
included with that that you can just

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.150 
included with that that you can just
watch<00:05:52.880> that<00:05:53.180> and<00:05:54.050> then<00:05:54.380> also<00:05:54.590> you<00:05:54.740> have<00:05:54.919> theta

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
watch that and then also you have theta

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.650 
watch that and then also you have theta
long<00:05:55.490> and<00:05:55.669> you<00:05:55.730> can<00:05:55.880> actually<00:05:56.000> record<00:05:56.450> all

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660 
long and you can actually record all

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.510 
long and you can actually record all
that<00:05:56.840> data<00:05:57.020> and<00:05:57.260> then<00:05:57.770> go<00:05:57.890> back<00:05:57.919> and<00:05:58.130> look<00:05:58.370> at

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
that data and then go back and look at

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.780 
that data and then go back and look at
it<00:05:58.669> at<00:05:58.820> a<00:05:58.850> later<00:05:59.090> time<00:05:59.240> umm<00:06:00.220> we<00:06:01.220> also<00:06:01.370> have<00:06:01.640> the

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:01.790 
it at a later time umm we also have the

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.460 
it at a later time umm we also have the
ECU<00:06:02.180> settings<00:06:02.630> now<00:06:02.810> this<00:06:02.990> is<00:06:03.140> going<00:06:03.260> to<00:06:03.380> be

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
ECU settings now this is going to be

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.540 
ECU settings now this is going to be
where<00:06:03.590> you're<00:06:03.740> going<00:06:03.890> to<00:06:03.950> set<00:06:04.100> up<00:06:04.220> your<00:06:04.310> launch

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
where you're going to set up your launch

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.390 
where you're going to set up your launch
control<00:06:05.230> your<00:06:06.230> flat<00:06:06.470> foot<00:06:06.680> shifting<00:06:07.040> that

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
control your flat foot shifting that

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.860 
control your flat foot shifting that
kind<00:06:07.610> of<00:06:07.669> stuff<00:06:07.850> all<00:06:08.030> the<00:06:08.150> fun<00:06:08.330> stuff<00:06:08.360> that<00:06:08.750> we

running really well actually all right

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:21.680 
running really well actually all right
now<00:06:19.410> being<00:06:20.220> that<00:06:20.310> these<00:06:20.460> are<00:06:20.729> our<00:06:21.180> vehicle

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
now being that these are our vehicle

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.120 
now being that these are our vehicle
specific<00:06:21.840> I<00:06:22.229> do<00:06:22.290> kind<00:06:22.560> of<00:06:22.590> want<00:06:22.740> to<00:06:22.800> go<00:06:22.860> through

the different kits that caught has of

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.379 
the different kits that caught has of
course<00:06:25.710> they<00:06:26.160> have<00:06:26.310> them<00:06:26.460> for<00:06:26.639> the<00:06:26.760> Subarus<00:06:27.120> of
