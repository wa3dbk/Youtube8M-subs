we're here at asset 2015 and talking

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.649 
we're here at asset 2015 and talking
about<00:00:02.250> precision<00:00:02.669> genomics<00:00:03.270> I'm<00:00:03.389> here<00:00:03.570> was

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
about precision genomics I'm here was

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:04.820 
about precision genomics I'm here was
Jonathan<00:00:04.049> Hirsch<00:00:04.200> the<00:00:04.410> founder<00:00:04.710> and

Jonathan Hirsch the founder and
president<00:00:04.980> of<00:00:05.370> psy<00:00:05.640> ops<00:00:05.819> now<00:00:06.390> John<00:00:06.660> tell<00:00:06.899> us<00:00:06.990> a

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
president of psy ops now John tell us a

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.080 
president of psy ops now John tell us a
little<00:00:07.080> bit<00:00:07.319> about<00:00:07.620> some<00:00:08.490> of<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.700> successes

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
little bit about some of the successes

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.459 
little bit about some of the successes
you've<00:00:09.240> seen<00:00:09.540> with<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.750> precision<00:00:09.990> genomics

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
you've seen with the precision genomics

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.740 
you've seen with the precision genomics
program<00:00:10.679> yeah<00:00:11.010> so<00:00:11.370> we<00:00:11.700> started<00:00:12.269> working<00:00:12.660> with

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
program yeah so we started working with

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.959 
program yeah so we started working with
Intermountain<00:00:13.290> about<00:00:13.440> two<00:00:13.830> years<00:00:14.099> ago<00:00:14.250> now<00:00:14.639> at

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
Intermountain about two years ago now at

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.680 
Intermountain about two years ago now at
ASCO<00:00:15.480> 2013<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.650> so<00:00:17.190> far<00:00:17.550> our<00:00:17.910> relationship

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
ASCO 2013 and so far our relationship

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.990 
ASCO 2013 and so far our relationship
with<00:00:18.840> Intermountain<00:00:19.380> has<00:00:19.560> demonstrated

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
with Intermountain has demonstrated

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.359 
with Intermountain has demonstrated
significant<00:00:21.000> success<00:00:21.600> not<00:00:22.230> just<00:00:22.289> in<00:00:23.039> enabling

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
significant success not just in enabling

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.029 
significant success not just in enabling
the<00:00:24.050> operationalization<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.560> precision

rolling out in conjunction with

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.540 
rolling out in conjunction with
Intermountain<00:01:47.870> over<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:48.800> next<00:01:49.100> few<00:01:49.310> months

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
Intermountain over the next few months

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.300 
Intermountain over the next few months
is<00:01:49.880> a<00:01:49.940> feature<00:01:50.870> that<00:01:51.020> we<00:01:51.500> call<00:01:51.770> similar

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
is a feature that we call similar

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.610 
is a feature that we call similar
patients<00:01:52.580> and<00:01:53.060> what<00:01:53.600> that<00:01:53.750> feature<00:01:54.050> allows

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
patients and what that feature allows
