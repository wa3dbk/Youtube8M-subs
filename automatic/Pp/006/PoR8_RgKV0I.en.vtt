objects within your video clip in this

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.540 
objects within your video clip in this
case<00:00:24.480> we<00:00:24.630> could<00:00:24.750> track<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.170> biker<00:00:25.430> once<00:00:26.430> you

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
case we could track the biker once you

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.670 
case we could track the biker once you
have<00:00:26.699> done<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.939> tracker<00:00:27.269> or<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.019> multiple<00:00:28.650> of

have done a tracker or a multiple of

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.890 
have done a tracker or a multiple of
trackers<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.400> can<00:00:29.880> attach<00:00:30.150> graphics<00:00:30.720> and

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
trackers you can attach graphics and

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.479 
trackers you can attach graphics and
titles<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.230> these<00:00:31.500> trackers<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.160> title

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
titles to these trackers so a title

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.709 
titles to these trackers so a title
would<00:00:32.579> follow<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:33.059> biker<00:00:33.329> down<00:00:33.570> the

customize motion UI you'll notice

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.810 
customize motion UI you'll notice
there's<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.950> number<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.309> different<00:00:50.640> places

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
there's a number of different places

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.910 
there's a number of different places
where<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.210> can<00:00:51.390> change<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.930> position<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.860> the

the title the size of the title drop
shadow<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.760> opacity<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.600> all<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.109> is

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
shadow the opacity and all of this is

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
keyframe Irbil within this keyframe err

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.750 
keyframe Irbil within this keyframe err
so<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.410> case<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.859> made<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.070> keyframe<00:01:02.460> at<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
so in this case I made a keyframe at the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.759 
so in this case I made a keyframe at the
beginning<00:01:03.120> with<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.329> biking<00:01:03.690> title<00:01:03.989> rotated

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
beginning with the biking title rotated

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.830 
beginning with the biking title rotated
a<00:01:04.860> little<00:01:04.890> bit<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.519> left<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.939> then

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
a little bit to the left and then

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.230 
a little bit to the left and then
animated<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.470> with<00:01:07.590> another<00:01:07.830> keyframe<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
animated it with another keyframe to the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.480 
animated it with another keyframe to the
right

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
right

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.100

arrows the clip is animated as I showed

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.070 
arrows the clip is animated as I showed
you<00:01:48.340> in<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.580> previous<00:01:48.760> step<00:01:49.300> you<00:01:49.540> can<00:01:49.930> also

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
you in the previous step you can also

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.930 
you in the previous step you can also
have<00:01:50.380> custom<00:01:50.860> animations<00:01:51.340> that<00:01:51.400> you<00:01:51.520> create

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
have custom animations that you create

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.390 
have custom animations that you create
on<00:01:52.060> your<00:01:52.090> own<00:01:52.230> in<00:01:53.230> this<00:01:53.410> case<00:01:53.620> I<00:01:53.890> made<00:01:54.250> this

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
on your own in this case I made this

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.930 
on your own in this case I made this
animation<00:01:55.920> then<00:01:56.920> you'll<00:01:57.100> notice<00:01:57.370> now<00:01:57.550> it

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
animation then you'll notice now it

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.860 
animation then you'll notice now it
moves<00:01:58.270> like<00:01:58.480> that<00:01:58.690> title<00:01:59.080> that<00:01:59.110> I<00:01:59.230> did<00:01:59.440> earlier

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
moves like that title that I did earlier

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.030 
moves like that title that I did earlier
the<00:02:01.870> advantage<00:02:02.260> of<00:02:02.380> making<00:02:02.650> a<00:02:02.710> custom

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
the advantage of making a custom

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.040 
the advantage of making a custom
animation<00:02:03.220> on<00:02:03.700> an<00:02:03.790> object<00:02:04.180> and<00:02:04.330> saving<00:02:04.660> it<00:02:04.780> is

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
animation on an object and saving it is

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.570 
animation on an object and saving it is
that<00:02:05.260> you<00:02:05.380> can<00:02:05.530> use<00:02:05.710> that<00:02:05.860> animation<00:02:06.400> in<00:02:06.490> the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
that you can use that animation in the

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.830 
that you can use that animation in the
future<00:02:06.880> with<00:02:07.030> other<00:02:07.180> titles<00:02:07.630> or<00:02:07.720> other

we've<00:03:40.740> also<00:03:40.920> added<00:03:41.190> variable<00:03:41.760> speed<00:03:42.030> so<00:03:42.780> if<00:03:42.870> I

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960 
we've also added variable speed so if I

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
video properties you'll notice now that

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.750 
video properties you'll notice now that
there's<00:03:48.660> a<00:03:48.720> variable<00:03:49.110> speed<00:03:49.260> button<00:03:49.730> when<00:03:50.730> I

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
there's a variable speed button when I

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.640 
there's a variable speed button when I
click<00:03:51.000> on<00:03:51.090> variable<00:03:51.510> speed<00:03:51.810> you'll<00:03:52.380> notice

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
click on variable speed you'll notice

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.070 
click on variable speed you'll notice
now<00:03:52.800> there's<00:03:53.010> a<00:03:53.070> keyframe<00:03:53.490> to<00:03:53.790> interface<00:03:54.120> and

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
now there's a keyframe to interface and

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.660 
now there's a keyframe to interface and
this<00:03:55.230> keyframed<00:03:55.650> interface<00:03:56.070> allows<00:03:56.430> you<00:03:56.580> to

this keyframed interface allows you to

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.230 
this keyframed interface allows you to
add<00:03:56.820> keyframes<00:03:57.360> and<00:03:57.830> change<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:59.040> speed<00:03:59.340> so

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
add keyframes and change the speed so

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.850 
add keyframes and change the speed so
for<00:04:00.420> instance<00:04:00.750> some<00:04:01.170> of<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.320> effects<00:04:01.650> you<00:04:01.830> see

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
for instance some of the effects you see

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.220 
for instance some of the effects you see
in<00:04:02.220> different<00:04:02.340> music<00:04:02.790> videos<00:04:02.820> and<00:04:03.450> in

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
different movies scan around and play

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.470 
different movies scan around and play
around<00:04:07.340> dynamically<00:04:08.340> with<00:04:08.490> the<00:04:08.610> speed<00:04:08.910> in

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
around dynamically with the speed in

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.270 
around dynamically with the speed in
this<00:04:09.660> case<00:04:09.930> you<00:04:10.350> can<00:04:10.530> do<00:04:10.620> it<00:04:10.710> very<00:04:10.830> very<00:04:10.950> easily

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
this case you can do it very very easily

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.340 
this case you can do it very very easily
by<00:04:11.580> adding<00:04:11.940> keyframes<00:04:12.420> and<00:04:12.660> scrubbing

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
by adding keyframes and scrubbing
