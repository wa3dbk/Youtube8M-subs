00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 I have a question for you. 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 What does this city know about luxury, huh? 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 What does this city that has passed through hell know about the beautiful moments of life? 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 Ok, I'll tell you. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 More than the rest. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 You see, this is the hottest flame that hardens steel. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 Both hard work and firm faith. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 And understanding how this generation is connected with each of us. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 That is who we are. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 This is our story. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 This is not what you read in the papers. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 This is not what is written by people who have never been here before. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 People who do not know what we are capable of. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Because when it reached luxury, 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 it says more about where it came from and for whom. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 Now we are from America - 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 but not from New York, 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 or from the City of the Winds (Chicago), 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 or from Sin City (Las Vegas), 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 we are certainly not one of these Emerald Cities. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 This is Auto City (Detroit) 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 and this is what we do.
