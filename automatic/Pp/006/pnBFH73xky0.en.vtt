00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.490 
for the race as it slows down we pulled
that<00:03:09.209> Packer<00:03:09.480> out<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:09.900> keep<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.170> splitter<00:03:10.410> on

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
that Packer out to keep the splitter on

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.290 
that Packer out to keep the splitter on
the<00:03:10.680> ground<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.280> it's<00:03:11.670> kind<00:03:11.850> of<00:03:11.880> a<00:03:12.000> little<00:03:12.209> bit

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
the ground and it's kind of a little bit

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.060 
the ground and it's kind of a little bit
of<00:03:12.390> a<00:03:12.450> guesstimate<00:03:12.870> on<00:03:12.989> on<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.440> pace<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:13.920> what

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
of a guesstimate on on the pace and what

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.470 
of a guesstimate on on the pace and what
it's<00:03:14.190> going<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.340> be<00:03:14.550> for<00:03:14.850> Sunday<00:03:15.150> because<00:03:15.209> it's

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
it's going to be for Sunday because it's

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.479 
it's going to be for Sunday because it's
always<00:03:15.750> slower<00:03:16.019> in<00:03:16.260> a<00:03:16.350> race<00:03:16.530> but<00:03:17.160> you<00:03:17.340> never

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
always slower in a race but you never

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.270 
always slower in a race but you never
know<00:03:17.670> how<00:03:17.820> much<00:03:17.850> and<00:03:18.410> certainly<00:03:19.410> by<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.709> by

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
know how much and certainly by the by

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.979 
know how much and certainly by the by
how<00:03:20.430> many<00:03:20.700> times<00:03:20.970> we<00:03:21.209> pulled<00:03:21.420> packer<00:03:21.660> out<00:03:21.840> I'd

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
how many times we pulled packer out I'd

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.840 
how many times we pulled packer out I'd
say<00:03:22.170> we<00:03:22.290> miss<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:22.590> quite<00:03:22.769> a<00:03:22.800> bit<00:03:22.890> but<00:03:23.220> you<00:03:23.760> know

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
say we miss it quite a bit but you know

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.130 
say we miss it quite a bit but you know
just<00:03:23.910> proud<00:03:24.239> of<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.420> guys<00:03:24.570> it's<00:03:24.930> days<00:03:25.110> like

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
think that you know we'll have a shot

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.290 
think that you know we'll have a shot
when<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.250> time's<00:03:32.430> right<00:03:32.580> for<00:03:32.850> a<00:03:32.880> championship

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
when the time's right for a championship

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.509 
when the time's right for a championship
well<00:03:33.870> we<00:03:34.019> gambled<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.709> run<00:03:34.860> before<00:03:35.220> that<00:03:35.370> we

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
well we gambled the run before that we

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:36.979 
well we gambled the run before that we
made<00:03:35.700> the<00:03:35.850> gamble<00:03:36.360> to<00:03:36.390> win<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.660> race<00:03:36.780> run

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
made the gamble to win the race run

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.870 
made the gamble to win the race run
before<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.440> yellow<00:03:37.650> came<00:03:37.890> out<00:03:38.100> and<00:03:38.610> then

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
before and the yellow came out and then

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.550 
before and the yellow came out and then
pretty<00:03:39.120> much<00:03:39.209> we're<00:03:39.480> on<00:03:39.600> a<00:03:39.630> dead-end<00:03:39.900> strategy

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
pretty much we're on a dead-end strategy

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.720 
pretty much we're on a dead-end strategy
no<00:03:40.709> matter<00:03:40.890> what<00:03:41.100> you<00:03:41.220> do<00:03:41.340> you<00:03:41.459> were<00:03:41.550> going<00:03:41.700> to

no matter what you do you were going to

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.509 
no matter what you do you were going to
lose<00:03:41.940> so<00:03:42.209> we<00:03:42.330> had<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.780> pit<00:03:42.959> there<00:03:43.230> on<00:03:44.100> that<00:03:44.280> last

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
lose so we had to pit there on that last

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.460 
lose so we had to pit there on that last
yellow<00:03:44.880> just<00:03:45.120> kind<00:03:45.690> of<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.810> way<00:03:45.900> our<00:03:46.050> seasons

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
guess Jerry with the 22 in 22 but just

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.330 
guess Jerry with the 22 in 22 but just
didn't<00:04:04.380> work<00:04:04.470> out<00:04:04.650> for<00:04:04.709> us<00:04:04.890> today<00:04:05.040> on<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.220> two
