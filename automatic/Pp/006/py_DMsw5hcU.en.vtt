00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
you'll be taking shortcuts you'll be

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.150 
you'll be taking shortcuts you'll be
launching<00:00:42.149> props<00:00:42.600> taking<00:00:43.350> out<00:00:43.440> other<00:00:43.649> guys<00:00:43.860> or

just<00:00:44.190> using<00:00:44.780> sssst<00:00:45.780> moves<00:00:46.050> but<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.649> way<00:00:46.800> that

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
just using sssst moves but the way that

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.950 
just using sssst moves but the way that
the<00:00:47.100> shortcuts<00:00:47.789> on<00:00:47.879> people<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.510> traps<00:00:48.750> to

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
the shortcuts on people and the traps to

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.690 
the shortcuts on people and the traps to
operate<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.950> need<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.250> know<00:00:50.280> them

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
operate is is that you need to know them

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.790 
operate is is that you need to know them
so<00:00:50.910> when<00:00:51.360> you're<00:00:51.480> playing<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.780> game<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.140> you

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
so when you're playing the game you you

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.319 
so when you're playing the game you you
become<00:00:53.070> aware<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.520> where<00:00:53.969> all<00:00:54.149> these

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
become aware of where all these

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.850 
become aware of where all these
opportunities<00:00:54.809> are<00:00:55.079> even<00:00:55.530> if<00:00:55.620> you're<00:00:55.770> not

you're in a position in a good like
incoming<00:01:03.239> line<00:01:03.840> but<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.350> you'll<00:01:04.619> be<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:04.920> a

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
incoming line but you you'll be in a

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.070 
incoming line but you you'll be in a
position<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.400> take<00:01:06.090> advantage<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.720> or

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
position to take advantage of that or

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.750 
position to take advantage of that or
that<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.860> never<00:01:08.040> like<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.310> take<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.610> one

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
that you never like to take the one

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.310 
that you never like to take the one
group<00:01:09.000> where<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.330> know<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.659> just<00:01:09.869> this<00:01:10.020> one

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
group where you know that just this one

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.899 
group where you know that just this one
trap<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.860> never<00:01:11.010> managed<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.670> avoid

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
trap that you never managed to avoid

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.429 
trap that you never managed to avoid
when<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:12.299> launched<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:13.200> sort<00:01:13.380> of

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
when it's launched and that sort of

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.130 
when it's launched and that sort of
thing<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:14.130> there's<00:01:14.700> very<00:01:14.880> much<00:01:15.060> need<00:01:15.720> to

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
thing so there's very much need to

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.530 
thing so there's very much need to
remain<00:01:16.740> aware<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.790> track<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.270> how<00:01:18.390> it's

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
remain aware of the track and how it's

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.109 
remain aware of the track and how it's
changed<00:01:18.990> from<00:01:19.290> from<00:01:19.590> laptop<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.610> order<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:20.939> do

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
changed from from laptop in order to do

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.800 
changed from from laptop in order to do
well<00:01:22.850> initially<00:01:23.850> when<00:01:24.150> we<00:01:24.180> started<00:01:24.570> thinking

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
well initially when we started thinking

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.289 
well initially when we started thinking
about<00:01:24.869> ways<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.259> like<00:01:25.740> bring<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.759> destruction

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
about ways to like bring the destruction

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.719 
about ways to like bring the destruction
into<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.600> more<00:01:27.869> core<00:01:28.200> part<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.650> gameplay<00:01:29.070> we

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
into a more core part of the gameplay we

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.370 
into a more core part of the gameplay we
just<00:01:29.970> how<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.090> cut<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.630> very<00:01:30.900> nice<00:01:31.170> like

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
just how I cut it this very nice like

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.789 
just how I cut it this very nice like
visual<00:01:31.829> ways<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.490> bit<00:01:33.030> like<00:01:33.650> taking<00:01:34.650> down

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
visual ways of a bit like taking down

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.039 
visual ways of a bit like taking down
buildings<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.460> stuff<00:01:35.640> actually<00:01:36.509> only<00:01:36.659> play

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
buildings and stuff actually only play

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
test we find like realized that there is

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.819 
test we find like realized that there is
a<00:01:39.030> big<00:01:39.270> mental<00:01:39.509> block<00:01:39.900> with<00:01:39.930> with<00:01:40.290> most<00:01:40.500> people

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
a big mental block with with most people

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.740 
a big mental block with with most people
that<00:01:41.009> what<00:01:41.640> when<00:01:41.790> they've<00:01:41.970> been<00:01:42.299> playing<00:01:42.540> like

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
that what when they've been playing like

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.569 
that what when they've been playing like
arcade<00:01:43.110> driving<00:01:43.409> games<00:01:43.619> for<00:01:43.890> in<00:01:44.159> some<00:01:44.369> cases

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
arcade driving games for in some cases

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.690 
arcade driving games for in some cases
decades<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.619> they're<00:01:46.619> just<00:01:46.799> very<00:01:47.100> adept<00:01:47.490> at

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
decades and they're just very adept at

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.760 
decades and they're just very adept at
avoiding<00:01:48.060> obstacles<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.380> stopped<00:01:49.619> and

avoiding obstacles and I stopped and

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.080 
avoiding obstacles and I stopped and
here<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.130> really<00:01:50.340> need<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.640> get<00:01:50.729> over<00:01:50.909> the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
here you really need to get over the

here you really need to get over the

the most effective way possible even
when<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.610> means<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.030> go<00:01:57.180> you're<00:01:57.360> going

what<00:02:01.820> we're<00:02:01.970> doing<00:02:02.299> is<00:02:02.420> we<00:02:02.570> are<00:02:02.600> using<00:02:02.780> color

what we're doing is we are using color

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.170 
what we're doing is we are using color
so<00:02:03.560> like<00:02:03.710> yellow<00:02:04.130> is<00:02:04.280> warning<00:02:04.610> you<00:02:04.729> off<00:02:04.909> like

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
so like yellow is warning you off like

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.580 
so like yellow is warning you off like
like<00:02:05.450> don't<00:02:05.689> try<00:02:05.900> to<00:02:05.960> drive<00:02:06.229> through<00:02:06.439> this

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
like don't try to drive through this

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.960 
like don't try to drive through this
it's<00:02:06.799> not<00:02:06.950> going<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.189> work<00:02:07.310> and<00:02:07.549> we<00:02:07.729> are<00:02:07.820> using

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
it's not going to work and we are using

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.880 
it's not going to work and we are using
them<00:02:08.270> like<00:02:08.509> silhouette<00:02:08.899> so<00:02:09.259> if<00:02:09.410> it's<00:02:09.679> higher

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
them like silhouette so if it's higher

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.040 
them like silhouette so if it's higher
than<00:02:09.920> a<00:02:10.280> car<00:02:10.610> it's<00:02:10.940> a<00:02:11.060> probably<00:02:11.720> not<00:02:11.900> i'm<00:02:12.020> not

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
than a car it's a probably not i'm not

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.559 
than a car it's a probably not i'm not
going<00:02:12.380> to<00:02:12.440> be<00:02:12.590> easily<00:02:13.160> distractible<00:02:14.030> if<00:02:14.330> it's

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
going to be easily distractible if it's

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.720 
going to be easily distractible if it's
obviously<00:02:15.260> something<00:02:15.680> that<00:02:15.800> you<00:02:15.950> can<00:02:16.099> see<00:02:16.370> to

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
obviously something that you can see to

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.940 
obviously something that you can see to
generally<00:02:17.660> you<00:02:17.750> can<00:02:17.810> just<00:02:18.080> just<00:02:18.350> drive<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.590> it

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
generally you can just just drive to it

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.670 
generally you can just just drive to it
and<00:02:19.270> I<00:02:20.270> think<00:02:20.660> it's<00:02:20.870> working<00:02:21.050> surprisingly

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
and I think it's working surprisingly

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.710 
and I think it's working surprisingly
well<00:02:21.920> I<00:02:22.100> really<00:02:22.430> expected<00:02:22.790> it<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.360> be<00:02:23.390> a<00:02:23.510> much

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
well I really expected it to be a much

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.020 
well I really expected it to be a much
much<00:02:23.959> bigger<00:02:24.020> issue<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.770> people<00:02:25.100> but<00:02:25.459> I<00:02:25.819> don't

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
much bigger issue to people but I don't

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.610 
much bigger issue to people but I don't
know<00:02:26.120> we<00:02:26.360> will<00:02:26.569> see<00:02:26.690> how<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:26.900> feels<00:02:27.440> in<00:02:27.560> the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
know we will see how it feels in the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.320 
know we will see how it feels in the
fine<00:02:27.830> one<00:02:27.980> game<00:02:28.160> but<00:02:28.280> currently<00:02:28.790> I'm<00:02:28.940> not<00:02:29.209> too

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
fine one game but currently I'm not too

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.430 
fine one game but currently I'm not too
worried<00:02:29.540> about<00:02:29.599> that<00:02:32.050> big<00:02:33.050> thing<00:02:33.230> that<00:02:33.260> we

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
worried about that big thing that we

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.840 
worried about that big thing that we
want<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.650> do<00:02:33.800> with<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.010> course<00:02:34.220> was<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.430> make

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
want to do with the course was to make

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.150 
want to do with the course was to make
them<00:02:35.030> askim<00:02:35.630> compatible<00:02:36.350> with<00:02:36.440> each<00:02:36.650> other<00:02:36.920> as

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
them askim compatible with each other as

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.250 
them askim compatible with each other as
possible<00:02:37.700> like<00:02:37.970> we<00:02:38.150> really<00:02:38.750> don't<00:02:38.900> want<00:02:39.140> to

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
possible like we really don't want to

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.360 
possible like we really don't want to
end<00:02:39.380> up<00:02:39.440> with<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.680> situation<00:02:40.130> where<00:02:40.250> like

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
end up with the situation where like

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.830 
end up with the situation where like
everybody's<00:02:40.819> playing<00:02:41.060> with<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.450> same<00:02:41.600> time

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
everybody's playing with the same time

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.120 
everybody's playing with the same time
I'm<00:02:41.930> multiplayer<00:02:42.380> because<00:02:42.650> this<00:02:42.799> one<00:02:42.980> how

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
I'm multiplayer because this one how

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.280 
I'm multiplayer because this one how
that<00:02:43.280> is<00:02:43.400> clearly<00:02:43.970> so<00:02:44.390> superior<00:02:45.140> to

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
that is clearly so superior to

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.100 
that is clearly so superior to
everything<00:02:45.739> else<00:02:45.980> so<00:02:46.250> we<00:02:47.030> will<00:02:47.299> try<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.569> figure

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
everything else so we will try to figure

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.110 
everything else so we will try to figure
out<00:02:48.230> ways<00:02:48.560> to<00:02:48.620> make<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.069> cause<00:02:49.370> look<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:49.940> feel

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
out ways to make the cause look and feel

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.300 
out ways to make the cause look and feel
different<00:02:50.690> enough<00:02:50.959> to<00:02:50.989> in<00:02:51.530> handling<00:02:52.069> and

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
different enough to in handling and

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.470 
different enough to in handling and
driving<00:02:53.209> feel<00:02:53.500> or<00:02:54.500> without<00:02:55.480> sacrificing

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
driving feel or without sacrificing

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.970 
driving feel or without sacrificing
their<00:02:56.600> ability<00:02:57.019> to<00:02:57.049> compete<00:02:57.769> with<00:02:57.950> each<00:02:58.040> other

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
their ability to compete with each other

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.140 
their ability to compete with each other
sometime<00:03:00.980> they're<00:03:01.280> like<00:03:01.519> a<00:03:01.549> couple<00:03:01.700> of<00:03:02.030> years

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
sometime they're like a couple of years

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.759 
sometime they're like a couple of years
back<00:03:02.450> when<00:03:02.690> we<00:03:02.810> were<00:03:02.989> trying<00:03:03.410> to<00:03:03.560> figure<00:03:03.650> out

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
back when we were trying to figure out

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.849 
back when we were trying to figure out
what<00:03:03.920> we<00:03:04.069> would<00:03:04.220> do<00:03:04.400> after<00:03:04.579> that<00:03:04.730> out<00:03:05.060> and<00:03:05.859> we

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
what we would do after that out and we

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.920 
what we would do after that out and we
were<00:03:06.890> quite<00:03:07.459> worried<00:03:07.940> that<00:03:08.060> it<00:03:08.329> sort<00:03:08.630> of<00:03:08.720> felt

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
were quite worried that it sort of felt

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.599 
were quite worried that it sort of felt
like<00:03:09.109> that<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.680> one<00:03:10.250> at<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.370> traditional

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
like that the one at the traditional

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.789 
like that the one at the traditional
arcade<00:03:11.329> Grace's<00:03:11.690> just<00:03:11.930> that<00:03:12.380> it<00:03:12.530> just<00:03:12.709> wasn't

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
arcade Grace's just that it just wasn't

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.890 
arcade Grace's just that it just wasn't
like<00:03:13.130> a<00:03:13.280> market<00:03:13.640> for<00:03:13.760> it<00:03:13.820> anymore<00:03:14.090> I<00:03:14.480> think

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
like a market for it anymore I think

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.160 
like a market for it anymore I think
there<00:03:15.049> is<00:03:15.079> an<00:03:16.540> expectation<00:03:17.540> with<00:03:18.019> the

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
there is an expectation with the

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.599 
there is an expectation with the
audience<00:03:18.410> that<00:03:18.709> they<00:03:18.859> just<00:03:19.130> want<00:03:19.370> something

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
audience that they just want something

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.550 
audience that they just want something
more<00:03:19.790> it's<00:03:20.480> not<00:03:20.660> enough<00:03:20.930> that<00:03:20.959> it's<00:03:21.290> a<00:03:21.380> good

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
more it's not enough that it's a good

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.430 
more it's not enough that it's a good
arcade<00:03:21.980> racer<00:03:22.700> and<00:03:23.180> for<00:03:23.540> me<00:03:23.660> personally<00:03:23.870> we

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
arcade racer and for me personally we

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.220 
arcade racer and for me personally we
went<00:03:24.650> only<00:03:25.400> a<00:03:25.549> couple<00:03:25.700> of<00:03:25.880> months<00:03:26.209> ago<00:03:26.269> over

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
went only a couple of months ago over

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.110 
went only a couple of months ago over
the<00:03:27.410> point<00:03:27.709> that<00:03:27.829> I<00:03:28.010> would<00:03:28.250> genuinely<00:03:28.670> pay

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
the point that I would genuinely pay

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.180 
the point that I would genuinely pay
full<00:03:29.359> price<00:03:29.420> for<00:03:29.660> this<00:03:29.959> game<00:03:30.260> due<00:03:30.920> to<00:03:30.980> some

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
full price for this game due to some

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.560 
full price for this game due to some
features<00:03:31.609> which<00:03:31.730> we<00:03:32.239> haven't<00:03:32.390> been

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
features which we haven't been

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.170 
features which we haven't been
discussing<00:03:32.989> yet<00:03:33.260> well<00:03:34.070> but<00:03:34.190> like<00:03:34.220> that<00:03:34.549> just

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
discussing yet well but like that just

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.940 
discussing yet well but like that just
the<00:03:35.359> driving<00:03:35.630> in<00:03:35.989> itself<00:03:36.320> I<00:03:36.500> don't<00:03:36.680> think<00:03:36.739> it's

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
the driving in itself I don't think it's

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.890 
the driving in itself I don't think it's
it's<00:03:37.730> enough<00:03:37.970> for<00:03:38.000> for<00:03:38.390> a<00:03:38.420> full-priced

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
it's enough for for a full-priced

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.569 
it's enough for for a full-priced
console<00:03:39.290> game<00:03:39.440> anymore<00:03:39.680> it<00:03:40.010> there<00:03:40.310> has<00:03:40.430> to<00:03:40.519> be

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
console game anymore it there has to be

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:45.160 
console game anymore it there has to be
something<00:03:40.850> more<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:44.000> direct<00:03:44.690> feedback<00:03:44.900> that

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
something more the direct feedback that

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.870 
something more the direct feedback that
we<00:03:45.290> have<00:03:45.440> got<00:03:45.620> from<00:03:45.829> from<00:03:46.100> like<00:03:46.280> existing

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
we have got from from like existing

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.610 
we have got from from like existing
which<00:03:47.030> has<00:03:47.180> a<00:03:47.269> fans<00:03:47.510> and<00:03:47.870> from<00:03:48.049> bock<00:03:48.230> beer<00:03:48.380> fans

which has a fans and from bock beer fans

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.650 
which has a fans and from bock beer fans
has<00:03:48.799> been<00:03:48.950> I<00:03:48.980> think<00:03:49.190> surprisingly<00:03:49.549> positive<00:03:50.180> I

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
has been I think surprisingly positive I

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.270 
has been I think surprisingly positive I
was<00:03:51.049> really<00:03:51.319> expecting<00:03:51.500> something<00:03:51.950> worse

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
was really expecting something worse

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.000 
was really expecting something worse
like<00:03:53.090> I'm<00:03:53.630> something<00:03:54.140> of<00:03:54.290> a<00:03:54.380> retread<00:03:54.680> pamper

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
like I'm something of a retread pamper

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.129 
like I'm something of a retread pamper
myself<00:03:55.220> and<00:03:55.760> if<00:03:55.880> I<00:03:56.000> heard<00:03:56.180> her<00:03:56.630> had<00:03:56.959> heard<00:03:57.109> that

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:57.139 
myself and if I heard her had heard that

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:58.990 
myself and if I heard her had heard that
another<00:03:57.530> car<00:03:57.980> games<00:03:58.190> today<00:03:58.370> would<00:03:58.579> be<00:03:58.700> doing<00:03:58.910> a

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
another car games today would be doing a

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.150 
another car games today would be doing a
new<00:03:59.150> bitch<00:03:59.540> better<00:03:59.750> i<00:03:59.840> would<00:03:59.930> be<00:04:00.139> worried<00:04:00.470> but

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
new bitch better i would be worried but

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.280 
new bitch better i would be worried but
i<00:04:02.060> think<00:04:02.569> that<00:04:02.600> we<00:04:02.780> have<00:04:02.900> been<00:04:02.989> very<00:04:03.139> open

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
i think that we have been very open

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.559 
i think that we have been very open
about<00:04:03.650> that<00:04:04.010> this<00:04:04.430> is<00:04:04.579> not<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:04.880> end<00:04:04.910> of<00:04:05.359> each

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
about that this is not the end of each

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.629 
about that this is not the end of each
race<00:04:05.750> at<00:04:05.900> per<00:04:06.049> se<00:04:06.079> like<00:04:06.650> I<00:04:06.680> think<00:04:07.400> there's

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:07.639 
race at per se like I think there's

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.550 
race at per se like I think there's
probably<00:04:07.790> going<00:04:08.120> to<00:04:08.209> be<00:04:08.299> a<00:04:08.450> rich<00:04:09.170> way<00:04:09.290> to<00:04:09.349> eight

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
probably going to be a rich way to eight

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.410 
probably going to be a rich way to eight
at<00:04:09.769> some<00:04:09.799> point<00:04:10.310> it's<00:04:10.730> not<00:04:10.879> going<00:04:11.060> to<00:04:11.150> be<00:04:11.269> made

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
at some point it's not going to be made

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.980 
at some point it's not going to be made
by<00:04:11.569> us<00:04:11.720> but<00:04:11.989> hopefully<00:04:12.349> like<00:04:12.590> one<00:04:12.769> of

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
by us but hopefully like one of

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.620 
by us but hopefully like one of
cause<00:04:13.230> internal<00:04:13.530> studios<00:04:13.920> or<00:04:14.040> whatever<00:04:14.310> and

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
cause internal studios or whatever and

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.330 
cause internal studios or whatever and
this<00:04:15.630> is<00:04:15.780> just<00:04:15.990> a<00:04:16.110> new<00:04:16.290> new<00:04:16.530> branch<00:04:16.800> for<00:04:17.190> each

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
this is just a new new branch for each

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.490 
this is just a new new branch for each
racer<00:04:17.730> like<00:04:18.120> I<00:04:18.150> would<00:04:18.600> personally<00:04:18.810> love<00:04:19.230> to<00:04:19.380> do

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
racer like I would personally love to do

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.590 
racer like I would personally love to do
an<00:04:19.680> unbounded<00:04:20.310> to<00:04:20.580> like<00:04:20.850> we<00:04:20.940> have<00:04:21.060> plenty<00:04:21.420> of

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
an unbounded to like we have plenty of

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.390 
an unbounded to like we have plenty of
features<00:04:21.840> as<00:04:22.110> we<00:04:22.230> just<00:04:22.440> couldn't<00:04:22.740> fit<00:04:22.950> in<00:04:23.100> in

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
features as we just couldn't fit in in

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.500 
features as we just couldn't fit in in
this<00:04:23.610> game<00:04:23.910> and<00:04:25.580> but<00:04:26.580> we<00:04:26.700> really<00:04:26.910> don't<00:04:27.270> know

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
this game and but we really don't know

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.300 
this game and but we really don't know
how<00:04:27.630> it's<00:04:27.810> going<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:27.990> play<00:04:28.110> out<00:04:28.200> from<00:04:29.130> what<00:04:29.280> I

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
how it's going to play out from what I

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.810 
how it's going to play out from what I
understand<00:04:30.260> they<00:04:31.260> could<00:04:31.920> very<00:04:32.160> well<00:04:32.220> be<00:04:32.580> like

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
understand they could very well be like

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.240 
understand they could very well be like
a<00:04:32.850> rich<00:04:33.120> race<00:04:33.330> or<00:04:33.450> eight<00:04:33.660> and<00:04:33.980> unbounded<00:04:34.980> too

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
a rich race or eight and unbounded too

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.580 
a rich race or eight and unbounded too
but<00:04:35.580> we<00:04:35.700> don't<00:04:35.850> know<00:04:35.940> yet<00:04:36.150> like<00:04:36.840> I<00:04:37.080> can<00:04:37.260> easily

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
but we don't know yet like I can easily

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:51.129 
but we don't know yet like I can easily
see<00:04:37.740> them<00:04:37.950> coexisting

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:53.199
