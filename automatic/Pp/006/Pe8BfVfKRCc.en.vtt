00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.300
 very cross 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.059
 Welcome to the live 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.400
 Here I bring you another tutorial and this time 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.740
 let's see a transport system with 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.750
 very simple water and for me one of the 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.960
 fastest transports that I've seen in 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.760
 minecraft never so good the only 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.610
 what we need are pressure plates and 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.190
 be of wood or stone and a 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.380
 small boat cubes of water and a structure 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:33.039
 As you can see, four blocks wide in 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.140
 straight line how are you going to see the system 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:36.670
 take speed in a straight line so 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.410
 now I will explain how you can do 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.600
 curves with this transportation system 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.399
 but well let's go see how 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.660
 let's build a vale to start what 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.520
 what we are going to do is put dishes 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.390
 pressure at a distance of about five 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.489
 blocks of the starting stretch 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.690
 and what we're going to do in that little box 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.280
 that stays there is to fill it 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.350
 completely water worth 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.149
 that's where we will put our first 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.559
 boats to start in what is the 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.300
 water circuit that is going to 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.149
 transport through our world 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.130
 Okay so I have water wells 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:08.500
 infinite out there is filling in as 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.899
 you see until the water is calm 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.730
 to make it worth it facilitated 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:14.590
 next thing we have to do is according to 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:18.820
 we have put the pressure plates in that 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.740
 line we're going to put four four cubes 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.260
 of water would be needed but I think with 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.880
 about three already looks good so good 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.560
 as you see we put two in the beginning and 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.330
 one at the end and it looks good has 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.380
 to be all the straight stream to 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.720
 that there are no currents in other 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.510
 directions and do not move us so good 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.870
 once you put those four cubes of 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.090
 water what we are going to do is in the 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.040
 final block of the current not in the 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.040
 before we are going to put pressure plates 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.330
 again and you have to go repeating 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.460
 repeating the process enough times 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.320
 so it's good to just take cubes 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.990
 of water in the way of building it is 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.580
 pretty easy on itself so good no 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.130
 you will have no problem in building them 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.710
 As I tell you, I think you only need 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.090
 33 water cubes 2 there at the beginning and 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.890
 one at the end and they already stay online 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.840
 straight but very important that you review 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.510
 that the currents are not going towards 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.710
 no site is worth more we follow more 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.380
 pressure plates 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.660
 remember not in the last block that is 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.610
 remains of water but in the previous vale 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.540
 so we continue as you see I'm going to 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.130
 try 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.640
 do a little bit fast so that the 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.220
 not tutorial 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.260
 doing the same thing all the time and good 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.760
 at the end of the whole I have put a curve 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.440
 so you can see how this can be done 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.500
 system to do the curves and everything 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.750
 this so good and I already notice that 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.090
 we have enough animals here 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.209
 trolleys so it will be pretty 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.040
 complicated to go around the 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.950
 circuit but I have been able to do some 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.200
 proof that it looks pretty good like that 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.810
 how good we are, we are still in the last 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.580
 block of water not in the penultimate in the 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.760
 that go from the last one we put back 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.500
 water and like that all the time and it can be 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.030
 be a bit heavy but in 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.010
 reality is quite easy not 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.019
 we need nothing but water and that 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.430
 structure as you see and the dishes to 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.959
 pressure that I have done with wood 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.630
 because they are easier to get 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.269
 simply and well there are already the 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.250
 troll sheep 'no and we're already reaching 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.560
 what is the corner is how we are going to 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.360
 do the corner theme because this 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.030
 only circuit as I tell you just catch 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.550
 speed 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.670
 in a straight line, so what are we going 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.650
 to do in that space that is left 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.900
 end in the curve or where we want to stop 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.230
 let's say the circuit what we're going to do 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.030
 is to put a piece of water back 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.220
 water block a small pool with water 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.319
 stalemate is worth it and for that we are going to put 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.690
 pressure plates also to distinguish 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.690
 endorse it so well we're just going 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.130
 to make another space with equal water 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.790
 what we have done in the area where we have 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.890
 started that circuit and as you can see there is 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.540
 to go throwing, throwing until 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.310
 the water is stagnant so it does not 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.600
 give us more problems or move us the 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.820
 boat for any place worth 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.640
 there you see how it is filling and 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.250
 alone and there we would have it and I'm going to do 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.110
 a test so you can see how it takes 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.730
 speed in this water circuit 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.620
 because it 's amazing with those currents 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.390
 of water I take an incredible speed 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.660
 I have not seen any form of 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.640
 transporting faster is impossible 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.380
 less so far I hope to find 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.700
 some other way of and well how do 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.440
 let's use just put 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.500
 our little boat of water we are going to 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.060
 ride on it we headed towards the 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.570
 water currents and as you see boom 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.120
 we go 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.890
 the speed like there are animals around here 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.530
 bathing because they have seen the pool and 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.730
 they could not resist getting into it 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.890
 quite difficult 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.710
 get to the bottom of the stagnant water that 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.600
 we have put there but well I would not have 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.890
 more complication and if we want to do the 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.930
 curve the only thing we would have to do 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.240
 where we have put these dishes put 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.410
 more current in the other direction is worth 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.300
 I'm going to do another test to see if the 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.340
 animals leave me to see you but 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.930
 as if you have fixed a little the 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.850
 speed that is caught with this system 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.410
 of water is incredible 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.150
 we go a lot faster than on rails 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.120
 I'm pretty sure we're going 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.620
 faster and we put good as you see us 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.890
 directly to the water streams and 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.840
 Pum pig on the road, you see the 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.210
 speed we would stay in this area 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.180
 stagnant and from here we could with the 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.310
 boat go to another road in a straight line from 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.690
 streams of water as you see simply 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.850
 I hope you liked the tutorial 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.500
 I'll leave it here, you know how it 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.480
 does and we can simply do it from 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.130
 any type of size is worth it so 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.070
 good guys I hope as I tell you that you 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.780
 You liked the PSUV like you liked it 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.370
 for more videos you know and I do not expect anything 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.560
 that may soon bring you new ones 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.930
 tutorials of course this system 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.550
 I liked it a lot and I would say 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.840
 that at least try it once because 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.850
 the speed that is caught is really 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:41.340
 interesting is so good with this 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.340
 I say goodbye a little hello and see you later
