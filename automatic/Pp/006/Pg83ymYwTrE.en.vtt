drill method I will be using cattail a

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.160 
drill method I will be using cattail a
poplar<00:00:09.450> board<00:00:10.040> some<00:00:11.040> straw<00:00:11.690> to<00:00:12.690> place<00:00:12.929> the

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
poplar board some straw to place the

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.919 
poplar board some straw to place the
Ember<00:00:13.440> in<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.700> leaf<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.330> collect<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.780> hot

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
Ember in and a leaf to collect the hot

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.410 
Ember in and a leaf to collect the hot
dust<00:00:17.869> this<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.230> baseboard<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.180> these<00:00:21.180> are

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
dust this is the baseboard and these are

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.900 
dust this is the baseboard and these are
areas<00:00:21.720> where<00:00:22.170> I've<00:00:22.289> already<00:00:22.500> created<00:00:22.949> embers

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
areas where I've already created embers

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.290 
areas where I've already created embers
I<00:00:24.859> began<00:00:25.859> by<00:00:25.920> using<00:00:26.460> my<00:00:26.550> knife<00:00:26.760> point<00:00:27.119> and

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
I began by using my knife point and

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.970 
I began by using my knife point and
making<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.720> depression<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.470> baseboard

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
making a depression in the baseboard

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.479 
making a depression in the baseboard
then<00:00:29.939> spinning<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.570> drill<00:00:30.840> on<00:00:31.109> top<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:32.040> those

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
then spinning the drill on top of those

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.780 
then spinning the drill on top of those
depressions<00:00:33.559> once<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.890> drill<00:00:35.280> was<00:00:35.550> well

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
depressions once the drill was well

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.119 
depressions once the drill was well
seated<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.420> baseboard<00:00:36.960> then<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.829> cut<00:00:38.100> a

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
seated in the baseboard then I cut a

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.959 
seated in the baseboard then I cut a
notch<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.989> in<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.200> notch<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.920> where<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.790> hot

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
notch and in this notch is where the hot

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.340 
notch and in this notch is where the hot
dust<00:00:42.329> will<00:00:42.930> collect<00:00:44.090> begin<00:00:45.090> by<00:00:45.270> placing<00:00:45.780> a

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
dust will collect begin by placing a

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.610 
dust will collect begin by placing a
moisture<00:00:46.980> barrier<00:00:47.160> down<00:00:47.610> such<00:00:48.000> as<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.620> paper

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
moisture barrier down such as this paper

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.720 
moisture barrier down such as this paper
bag<00:00:50.930> then<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:51.960> place<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.530> leaf<00:00:52.890> down<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.550> catch

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
bag then I place the leaf down to catch

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.400 
bag then I place the leaf down to catch
the<00:00:53.910> hot<00:00:54.090> dust<00:00:55.309> then<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.520> baseboard<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.410> then

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
the hot dust then the baseboard and then

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.680 
the hot dust then the baseboard and then
I<00:00:58.500> plant<00:00:58.829> my<00:00:58.980> foot<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.489> top<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.210> baseboard

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
I plant my foot on top of the baseboard

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:10.150 
I plant my foot on top of the baseboard
to<00:01:00.899> secure<00:01:01.320> it

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:21.160 

then<00:01:12.440> I'll<00:01:13.440> place<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.940> drill<00:01:15.710> into<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.220> slot

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.930 

and<00:01:22.170> then<00:01:22.500> I'll<00:01:22.620> start<00:01:23.010> trying<00:01:23.370> to<00:01:23.520> generate

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
and then I'll start trying to generate

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:40.250 
and then I'll start trying to generate
heat<00:01:38.360> temperature<00:01:39.360> has<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.570> get<00:01:39.870> up<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.200> around

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
heat temperature has to get up to around

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.590 
heat temperature has to get up to around
700<00:01:40.770> degrees<00:01:41.540> before<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:43.020> -<00:01:43.650> boy<00:01:44.150> ignite<00:01:45.150> into

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
700 degrees before the - boy ignite into

00:01:45.600 --> 00:02:48.850 
700 degrees before the - boy ignite into
an<00:01:45.690> ember

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.910 

as<00:02:49.860> you<00:02:50.040> can<00:02:50.190> see<00:02:51.379> the<00:02:52.379> dust<00:02:54.440> has<00:02:55.440> now<00:02:55.620> become

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
as you can see the dust has now become

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:03.770 
as you can see the dust has now become
an<00:02:56.040> ember

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.960 

I'll<00:03:04.530> place<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:05.040> diced<00:03:07.760> inside<00:03:08.760> of<00:03:08.880> the

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
I'll place the diced inside of the

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.330 
I'll place the diced inside of the
tinder<00:03:09.300> bundle
