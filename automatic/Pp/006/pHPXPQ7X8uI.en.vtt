00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
should have maybe for battle in preflop

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.050 
should have maybe for battle in preflop
um<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:19.020> just<00:01:19.860> had<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.070> bit<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.369> an<00:01:20.520> awkward<00:01:20.640> stack

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
um I just had a bit of an awkward stack

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.880 
um I just had a bit of an awkward stack
where<00:01:21.330> like<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.810> was<00:01:22.080> making<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.409> pretty<00:01:22.710> big

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
where like I was making a pretty big

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:23.960 
where like I was making a pretty big
commitment<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.369> knew<00:01:23.490> he's<00:01:23.640> going<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.820> three

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
commitment I knew he's going to three

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.060 
commitment I knew he's going to three
bend<00:01:24.150> me<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.229> button<00:01:25.470> basically<00:01:25.860> with<00:01:25.950> any

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
bend me on the button basically with any

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.920 
bend me on the button basically with any
two<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:26.970> should<00:01:27.330> have<00:01:27.420> four<00:01:27.600> bit<00:01:27.750> but<00:01:27.900> I

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
two so I should have four bit but I

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.060 
two so I should have four bit but I
thought<00:01:28.080> my<00:01:28.170> hand<00:01:28.350> at<00:01:28.439> value<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.890> maybe<00:01:29.009> I

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
thought my hand at value and maybe I

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.840 
thought my hand at value and maybe I
could<00:01:29.189> like<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.430> kind<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.790> set<00:01:30.360> my<00:01:30.390> trap<00:01:30.720> him

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
could like to kind of set my trap him

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.580 
could like to kind of set my trap him
but<00:01:33.079> anyway<00:01:34.079> then<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.290> end<00:01:34.380> up<00:01:34.409> like

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
but anyway then I end up like

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.960 
but anyway then I end up like
double-barreling<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.340> he's<00:01:35.579> only<00:01:35.759> made<00:01:35.939> a

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
double-barreling and he's only made a

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.960 
double-barreling and he's only made a
flush<00:01:36.180> by<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.390> river<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:37.610> you<00:01:38.610> know<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.850> is

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
flush by the river and you know that is

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.490 
flush by the river and you know that is
what<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.479> felt<00:01:39.659> like<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.810> played<00:01:39.990> super

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
what it is I felt like I played super
