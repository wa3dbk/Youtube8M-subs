I<00:00:00.650> am<00:00:01.650> Jackie<00:00:01.920> horsey<00:00:02.429> and<00:00:02.700> i<00:00:02.939> am<00:00:03.090> a<00:00:03.210> usq

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
I am Jackie horsey and i am a usq

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.179 
I am Jackie horsey and i am a usq
student<00:00:06.020> my<00:00:07.020> father's<00:00:07.410> a<00:00:07.440> concrete<00:00:07.950> is<00:00:08.069> her

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
student my father's a concrete is her

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.700 
student my father's a concrete is her
growing<00:00:08.370> up<00:00:08.550> we<00:00:08.730> were<00:00:08.760> always<00:00:09.380> helping<00:00:10.380> out

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
growing up we were always helping out

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.249 
growing up we were always helping out
and<00:00:10.980> even<00:00:11.580> like<00:00:11.759> three<00:00:12.599> school<00:00:12.840> holidays

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
and even like three school holidays

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.580 
and even like three school holidays
would<00:00:13.440> go<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.950> pretend<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.519> be<00:00:14.580> concrete<00:00:15.030> errs

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
would go and pretend to be concrete errs

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.930 
would go and pretend to be concrete errs
so<00:00:16.590> I've<00:00:16.680> always<00:00:16.830> had<00:00:17.130> an<00:00:17.250> interest<00:00:17.430> I

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
so I've always had an interest I

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.090 
so I've always had an interest I
finished<00:00:18.660> high<00:00:18.810> school<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.500> went<00:00:19.800> straight

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
finished high school I went straight

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.640 
finished high school I went straight
into<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.520> workforce<00:00:21.000> as<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.420> trainee<00:00:22.020> drafter

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
into the workforce as a trainee drafter

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.040 
into the workforce as a trainee drafter
I<00:00:22.890> had<00:00:23.640> been<00:00:23.850> drafting<00:00:24.269> for<00:00:24.420> about<00:00:24.570> five<00:00:24.810> years

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
I had been drafting for about five years

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.740 
I had been drafting for about five years
and<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.470> sort<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.800> felt<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.310> I'd<00:00:27.029> gone<00:00:27.330> as<00:00:27.570> far

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
and I sort of felt that I'd gone as far

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.720 
and I sort of felt that I'd gone as far
as<00:00:27.810> i<00:00:27.990> could<00:00:28.050> go<00:00:28.410> myself<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.640> my<00:00:29.699> partner

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
as i could go myself and my partner

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.970 
as i could go myself and my partner
moved<00:00:30.210> back<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.539> Brisbane<00:00:30.900> at<00:00:31.050> may<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.560> I

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
moved back to Brisbane at may and I

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.680 
moved back to Brisbane at may and I
guess<00:00:32.309> that's<00:00:32.579> when<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:32.790> decided<00:00:33.180> I'd<00:00:33.480> had

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
guess that's when I decided I'd had

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.620 
guess that's when I decided I'd had
enough<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:34.110> drafting<00:00:34.790> so<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.000> next<00:00:36.030> sort<00:00:36.540> of

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
enough of drafting so the next sort of

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.260 
enough of drafting so the next sort of
step<00:00:36.840> was<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.200> go<00:00:37.320> into<00:00:37.350> engineering<00:00:38.270> so

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
step was to go into engineering so

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.810 
step was to go into engineering so
that's<00:00:39.570> where<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.809> went<00:00:43.010> studying<00:00:44.010> externally

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
that's where I went studying externally

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.170 
that's where I went studying externally
