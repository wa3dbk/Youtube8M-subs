00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.680 
need to get used to it because in
battlefield<00:02:54.519> 4<00:02:54.580> it<00:02:54.819> was<00:02:54.940> very<00:02:55.120> prominent<00:02:55.630> the

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
battlefield 4 it was very prominent the

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.180 
battlefield 4 it was very prominent the
bullet<00:02:55.959> jaw<00:02:56.079> but<00:02:56.230> obviously<00:02:56.650> here<00:02:56.980> because

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
bullet jaw but obviously here because

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.490 
bullet jaw but obviously here because
the<00:02:57.250> maps<00:02:57.430> are<00:02:57.549> a<00:02:57.610> lot<00:02:57.790> smaller<00:02:58.120> it's<00:02:58.900> not<00:02:59.200> as

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
the maps are a lot smaller it's not as

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.870 
the maps are a lot smaller it's not as
prominent<00:02:59.860> anymore<00:03:00.340> but<00:03:00.519> it<00:03:00.610> is<00:03:00.700> still

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
prominent anymore but it is still

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.190 
prominent anymore but it is still
something<00:03:01.180> you<00:03:01.420> need<00:03:01.569> to<00:03:01.599> consider<00:03:01.930> when

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
something you need to consider when

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.680 
something you need to consider when
sniping<00:03:02.680> so<00:03:02.890> it's<00:03:03.040> definitely<00:03:03.459> still<00:03:03.849> there

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
sniping so it's definitely still there

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.140 
sniping so it's definitely still there
so<00:03:05.230> for<00:03:05.410> me<00:03:05.500> sniping<00:03:06.040> in<00:03:06.160> a<00:03:06.220> hard<00:03:06.400> line<00:03:06.640> it's<00:03:07.000> a

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
so for me sniping in a hard line it's a

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.850 
so for me sniping in a hard line it's a
lot<00:03:07.269> more<00:03:07.299> enjoyable<00:03:07.780> than<00:03:08.170> in<00:03:08.319> battlefield<00:03:08.769> 4

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
lot more enjoyable than in battlefield 4

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.350 
lot more enjoyable than in battlefield 4
again<00:03:09.310> because<00:03:09.579> you<00:03:09.670> don't<00:03:09.849> have<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.000> smoke

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
again because you don't have the smoke

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.819 
again because you don't have the smoke
trail<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:10.989> you<00:03:11.110> get<00:03:11.230> a<00:03:11.260> lot<00:03:11.410> more<00:03:11.440> feedback

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
trail and you get a lot more feedback

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.880 
trail and you get a lot more feedback
when<00:03:12.250> you<00:03:12.340> take<00:03:12.519> a<00:03:12.549> shot<00:03:12.879> and<00:03:13.290> I'm<00:03:14.290> just<00:03:14.650> a

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
when you take a shot and I'm just a

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.740 
when you take a shot and I'm just a
whole<00:03:15.099> lot<00:03:15.340> better<00:03:15.579> for<00:03:16.000> some<00:03:16.150> reason<00:03:16.510> it's

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
whole lot better for some reason it's

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.750 
whole lot better for some reason it's
just<00:03:17.049> a<00:03:17.110> lot<00:03:17.260> of<00:03:17.410> getting<00:03:17.560> used<00:03:17.620> to<00:03:17.890> now<00:03:18.489> one

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
just a lot of getting used to now one

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.670 
just a lot of getting used to now one
thing<00:03:18.790> there<00:03:19.269> is<00:03:19.390> a<00:03:19.420> glitch<00:03:19.840> in<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.500> system

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
thing there is a glitch in the system

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.250 
thing there is a glitch in the system
somewhere<00:03:21.220> in<00:03:21.640> the<00:03:21.730> hardline<00:03:22.180> stratosphere<00:03:23.049> a

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
somewhere in the hardline stratosphere a

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.530 
somewhere in the hardline stratosphere a
lot<00:03:23.739> of<00:03:23.860> people<00:03:24.069> think<00:03:24.280> this<00:03:24.519> is<00:03:24.579> related<00:03:24.879> to

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
lot of people think this is related to

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.390 
lot of people think this is related to
your<00:03:25.930> mesh<00:03:26.230> settings<00:03:26.709> your<00:03:26.920> graphical

your mesh settings your graphical

your mesh settings your graphical
settings<00:03:27.579> but<00:03:27.910> essentially<00:03:28.389> what<00:03:28.690> happens<00:03:29.079> is

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200

pressed<00:03:33.700> that<00:03:34.150> is<00:03:34.480> your<00:03:34.690> right<00:03:34.900> mouse<00:03:35.230> button

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
pressed that is your right mouse button

near<00:03:35.829> your<00:03:36.220> aim<00:03:36.489> button<00:03:36.850> doesn't<00:03:37.150> matter

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
near your aim button doesn't matter

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:38.610

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
your target you will most likely get

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.879 
your target you will most likely get
that<00:03:42.700> hit<00:03:42.880> marker<00:03:43.180> if<00:03:43.329> it<00:03:43.450> actually<00:03:43.569> lends<00:03:44.079> now

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
that hit marker if it actually lends now

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.220 
that hit marker if it actually lends now
if<00:03:45.190> you<00:03:45.579> were<00:03:45.730> to<00:03:45.760> take<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.510> very<00:03:46.690> same<00:03:46.900> shot

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
if you were to take the very same shot

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.530 
if you were to take the very same shot
and<00:03:47.530> your<00:03:48.340> bullet<00:03:48.639> is<00:03:48.790> supposed<00:03:49.120> land<00:03:49.389> but

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
and your bullet is supposed land but

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.110 
and your bullet is supposed land but
instead<00:03:49.780> of<00:03:49.930> keeping<00:03:50.590> your<00:03:51.250> sniper<00:03:51.609> rifle

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
instead of keeping your sniper rifle

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.699 
instead of keeping your sniper rifle
scope<00:03:52.450> tin<00:03:52.630> so<00:03:52.780> you<00:03:52.870> can<00:03:53.019> see<00:03:53.139> the<00:03:53.260> bullet<00:03:53.410> land

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
scope tin so you can see the bullet land

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.259 
scope tin so you can see the bullet land
if<00:03:53.889> you<00:03:53.919> release<00:03:54.430> it<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:55.510> bolt<00:03:56.109> your<00:03:56.560> rifle<00:03:57.269> you

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
if you release it to bolt your rifle you

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.830 
if you release it to bolt your rifle you
won't<00:03:59.049> get<00:03:59.440> a<00:03:59.709> hitmarker<00:03:59.950> because<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:01.630> game

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
won't get a hitmarker because the game

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.720 
won't get a hitmarker because the game
thing<00:04:02.200> so<00:04:02.440> this<00:04:02.560> is<00:04:02.680> really<00:04:02.829> strange<00:04:03.220> okay<00:04:03.579> now

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
thing so this is really strange okay now

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.280 
thing so this is really strange okay now
the<00:04:03.790> game<00:04:04.000> thing<00:04:04.299> is<00:04:04.419> that<00:04:04.540> if<00:04:04.660> you<00:04:04.780> don't<00:04:05.019> see

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
the game thing is that if you don't see

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.509 
the game thing is that if you don't see
your<00:04:05.410> enemy<00:04:05.769> if<00:04:05.829> he<00:04:05.919> doesn't<00:04:06.160> render<00:04:06.280> it<00:04:06.430> on

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
your enemy if he doesn't render it on

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
one of the fixes that they tried to

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.300 
one of the fixes that they tried to
apply<00:04:37.120> to<00:04:37.540> the<00:04:38.020> game<00:04:38.199> to<00:04:38.470> sort<00:04:38.770> of<00:04:38.919> you<00:04:39.280> know

straighten<00:04:39.730> out<00:04:39.910> the<00:04:40.090> netcode<00:04:40.860> making<00:04:41.860> the

straighten out the netcode making the

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.820 
straighten out the netcode making the
bullet<00:04:42.250> shots<00:04:42.600> basically<00:04:43.600> client-side<00:04:44.290> so<00:04:44.620> if

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
bullet shots basically client-side so if

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.830 
bullet shots basically client-side so if
it<00:04:44.979> doesn't<00:04:45.250> appear<00:04:45.460> on<00:04:45.550> your<00:04:45.669> screen<00:04:45.970> if<00:04:46.540> it's

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.840 
it doesn't appear on your screen if it's

speaking<00:05:09.490> about<00:05:09.669> the<00:05:09.729> netcode<00:05:10.000> and<00:05:10.570> networked

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080

speaking about the netcode and networked
related<00:05:11.680> stuff<00:05:12.190> and<00:05:12.400> things<00:05:12.669> I<00:05:13.000> think<00:05:13.060> that

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
related stuff and things I think that

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.450 
related stuff and things I think that
this<00:05:13.660> game<00:05:13.960> now<00:05:14.260> I<00:05:14.290> know<00:05:14.470> for<00:05:14.710> a<00:05:14.979> fact<00:05:15.070> that

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
this game now I know for a fact that

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.250 
this game now I know for a fact that
this<00:05:15.760> game<00:05:16.000> feels<00:05:16.270> a<00:05:16.419> lot<00:05:16.510> more<00:05:16.570> snappier<00:05:17.229> than

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
this game feels a lot more snappier than

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.650 
this game feels a lot more snappier than
battlefield<00:05:17.950> 4<00:05:18.220> does<00:05:18.520> it<00:05:19.000> feels<00:05:19.330> a<00:05:19.479> whole<00:05:19.510> lot

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
battlefield 4 does it feels a whole lot

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.420 
battlefield 4 does it feels a whole lot
more<00:05:19.900> polished<00:05:20.410> and<00:05:20.590> I<00:05:20.620> feel<00:05:20.830> like<00:05:20.950> my<00:05:21.130> shots

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
more polished and I feel like my shots

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.940 
more polished and I feel like my shots
or<00:05:21.760> just<00:05:22.060> all<00:05:22.210> wet<00:05:22.630> when<00:05:22.810> I<00:05:22.840> shoot<00:05:23.229> something<00:05:23.560> I

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
or just all wet when I shoot something I

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.070 
or just all wet when I shoot something I
know<00:05:24.280> that<00:05:24.550> my<00:05:24.940> bullets<00:05:25.330> are<00:05:25.600> going<00:05:25.930> to

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
know that my bullets are going to

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.240 
know that my bullets are going to
register<00:05:26.650> and<00:05:26.830> I<00:05:27.160> haven't<00:05:27.520> seen<00:05:27.760> any<00:05:28.150> netcode

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
register and I haven't seen any netcode

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.070 
register and I haven't seen any netcode
silliness<00:05:30.250> if<00:05:30.520> that<00:05:30.760> makes<00:05:30.940> any<00:05:31.060> sense<00:05:31.180> I<00:05:31.630> know

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
silliness if that makes any sense I know

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.840 
silliness if that makes any sense I know
it's<00:05:32.380> not<00:05:32.530> easy<00:05:32.590> to<00:05:32.979> tell<00:05:33.190> though<00:05:33.370> because<00:05:33.550> the

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
it's not easy to tell though because the

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.150 
it's not easy to tell though because the
TT<00:05:34.240> k<00:05:34.479> or<00:05:34.630> the<00:05:34.780> time<00:05:34.960> to<00:05:35.110> kill<00:05:35.320> is<00:05:35.530> very<00:05:35.740> short

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
TT k or the time to kill is very short

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.310 
TT k or the time to kill is very short
therefore<00:05:36.910> you<00:05:37.030> die<00:05:37.240> very<00:05:37.479> fasting<00:05:38.080> and

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
therefore you die very fasting and

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.409 
therefore you die very fasting and
sometimes<00:05:39.039> you're<00:05:39.280> just<00:05:39.340> you<00:05:39.610> not<00:05:39.760> sure<00:05:40.150> if

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 
sometimes you're just you not sure if

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:41.969 
sometimes you're just you not sure if
that<00:05:40.690> person<00:05:41.260> should<00:05:41.289> have<00:05:41.530> gotten<00:05:41.680> the<00:05:41.770> kill

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
that person should have gotten the kill

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:43.379 
that person should have gotten the kill
on<00:05:42.010> you<00:05:42.250> or<00:05:42.340> not<00:05:42.490> because<00:05:42.669> again<00:05:42.970> everyone

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.389 
on you or not because again everyone

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:46.170 
on you or not because again everyone
dies<00:05:43.630> so<00:05:43.870> fast<00:05:43.900> in<00:05:44.380> this<00:05:44.470> game<00:05:44.760> but<00:05:45.760> overall<00:05:46.060> I

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
dies so fast in this game but overall I

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.540 
dies so fast in this game but overall I
have<00:05:46.600> seen<00:05:46.960> massive<00:05:47.410> improvements<00:05:48.280> in<00:05:48.340> a<00:05:48.400> net

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
have seen massive improvements in a net

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.040 
have seen massive improvements in a net
good<00:05:48.760> compared<00:05:49.180> to<00:05:49.330> all<00:05:49.570> that<00:05:49.720> stuff<00:05:50.020> that

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
good compared to all that stuff that

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.779 
good compared to all that stuff that
happened<00:05:50.260> to<00:05:50.800> battlefield<00:05:50.950> 4<00:05:51.460> and<00:05:51.580> is<00:05:51.639> still

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:51.789 
happened to battlefield 4 and is still

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:54.629 
happened to battlefield 4 and is still
present<00:05:52.090> in<00:05:52.360> battlefield<00:05:52.990> 4<00:05:53.070> definitely<00:05:54.070> now

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
as far as sniping goes again it's a lot

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.529 
as far as sniping goes again it's a lot
more<00:05:56.710> enjoyable<00:05:57.460> than<00:05:57.820> it<00:05:57.970> ever<00:05:58.090> was<00:05:58.360> in

00:05:58.529 --> 00:05:58.539 
more enjoyable than it ever was in

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:00.620 
more enjoyable than it ever was in
battlefield<00:05:58.990> 4<00:05:59.050> it's<00:05:59.440> just<00:05:59.680> a<00:05:59.800> lot<00:05:59.979> snappier

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
battlefield 4 it's just a lot snappier

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.600 
battlefield 4 it's just a lot snappier
across<00:06:01.630> the<00:06:01.810> board<00:06:02.050> and<00:06:02.349> just<00:06:02.950> so<00:06:03.160> much<00:06:03.310> fun<00:06:03.550> I

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 
I essentially think of this game and a

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:22.710 
I essentially think of this game and a
beta<00:06:21.160> giving<00:06:21.580> all<00:06:21.760> of<00:06:21.789> the<00:06:22.000> positives<00:06:22.510> and

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 
beta giving all of the positives and

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.110 
beta giving all of the positives and
negatives<00:06:22.780> and<00:06:23.440> you<00:06:23.770> might<00:06:23.979> even<00:06:24.010> see<00:06:24.610> a<00:06:24.849> new

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
negatives and you might even see a new

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.510 
negatives and you might even see a new
