00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 ah 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:14.270
 and we have to move on from that hour we are 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:17.450
 here we are we are here 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:20.090
 we are here here we are both in one 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.570
 new review of another way in bar or mine 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.550
 in bar or mini for friends and good 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:29.590
 as you can see I was here sweating the 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.590
 fat drop because I do not know 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:42.040
 I do not see the sun like that once inside sweating 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.510
 and I good let's start this mod 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.479
 mainly add realism to 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.000
 game is going to complicate a bit the 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:51.470
 survival and in what way then as 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.530
 you see in the interface we have several 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.460
 bars to the right hand and the hand 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.960
 left 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.400
 let's go explaining we're going to 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.920
 start on the left the one above 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.140
 of the whole is the temperature now 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.479
 we see more or less that we are at 21 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.340
 degrees centigrade I do not know if you go 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.920
 it will be more or less the same 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.450
 and this bar has some colors going 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.039
 from blue to red the ideal 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.140
 obviously it will be always maintained 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:18.289
 in the green but if we are in some 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.490
 snowy environment what is cold feet 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:25.380
 squares already of the cold that does 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:28.409
 at least 14 have or 14 degrees or by 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.630
 example in water this temperature is going to 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.880
 begin to descend obviously if the 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.189
 temperature reached blue extremes 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.470
 that we would be getting closer to 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.439
 very low temperatures will start to 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.500
 going down never comes out with that doctors that 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.179
 the hearts of life in the 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.470
 otherwise we are in some territory 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:51.659
 desert and we have been here for a week and not 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.780
 we found more than camels we are very 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.810
 close to lava but efe almost you itch 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.490
 They do not bite us but they catch you in the mood 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.690
 or grove to this bar start 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.610
 room the right towards the color 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.880
 red the temperature will start to rise 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.990
 we will notice it mainly because 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.709
 we will see that our character starts to 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.330
 sweat 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:11.670
 although we go in the first person or in 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.840
 third we will start to leave as droplets 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.540
 of rain 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.650
 Wherever we go where we go and if 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.080
 you are playing in the first person 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.060
 you will also see droplets fall ahead 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.830
 of your vision this means that 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.300
 we are losing body water with 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.950
 very hot this water will start to 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.050
 descend super fast which is the second 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.019
 bar that we have just below the 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.940
 hydration and effectively if we arrive 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.590
 to have a lot of temperature too 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.440
 we will die began to lower the 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.080
 hearts by extreme heat at 53 degrees 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.110
 centÃ­grados that this and has a hot 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.730
 man my mother and I am going to explode 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.790
 I am a pot Price 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.440
 and this limit was maximum our 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.440
 character would start to burn 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.209
 do not see if it stings the sun 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:01.790
 the second bar is hydration 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.560
 as I say it is simply going down 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.680
 naturally we obviously need 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.970
 drink water by lowering temperature 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.970
 Legislation level 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.900
 perfect and it is restored then drinking 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.150
 water jars or make water mod 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.310
 add three items that are three little bottles 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.870
 of water one is salt water that the 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.780
 we will take from the sea obviously it is not 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.250
 advisable to drink the other one is water 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.740
 cool 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.090
 and the other one is water because badly damaged 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.920
 will poison you but you will recover 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.470
 hydration and good the other cold water 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.060
 it will lower the temperature during a 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.360
 short period of time but also 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.420
 recovers also recovers hydration and 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.670
 we go to the bars on the right 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.350
 we have the air quality is 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.140
 this one that has like three small bubbles 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.230
 same is one hundred percent and that deals 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.080
 as you have a house you are 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.400
 locked in a mine or good finitas 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.230
 situations where you are not in the 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.120
 Outdoor air quality can be 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.209
 bad or very low there can be very little 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.730
 oxygen then what will you need to have 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.500
 plants inside house like those that 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.750
 we have here at the sides of the table by 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.670
 example for them to do the 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.500
 photosynthesis or the supposed photosynthesis 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.109
 what is done in the main craft and these 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.660
 issue or two so that the quality of the 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.580
 air is much greater and finally 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.810
 we have the exit bar that also 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.120
 is one hundred percent that is sanity 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.980
 or mental health this is what it is about 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.460
 if you are in dark places locked or 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:36.610
 you do not have horribly ugly houses 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.080
 and other things so they are pretty 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.720
 sad 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.949
 this sanity will begin to lower that's what 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.110
 It happens when sanity starts to go down 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:49.389
 about 50 percent or less 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:52.560
 of bar you start to emit as thorns 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.560
 lilacs like the sender man 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:59.150
 this means that you have a 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:03.449
 drawing out mental health Sanity 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.919
 and you start hearing to see things that first 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.259
 you will begin to hear them begin and 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:11.400
 explosions skeletons spiders screams 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:12.960
 noises I do not know different things that you 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.590
 they indicate that you are losing your mind 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.379
 completely 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.300
 good different things that tell you 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:20.219
 that you really have to change your home 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.909
 or to come up to the surface to find 

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:27.990
 a red flower and make some remains or 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:30.450
 something like that to be human again 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.070
 is here x and the chicken mister chicken that 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.210
 they will explain the physics of this 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:38.270
 mode please proceed 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:41.889
 as much as we want if we do not build 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:44.270
 intelligently the blocks will fall 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:46.130
 in the same way as sand or that the 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.569
 it will be like that, it will happen with all 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.919
 blocks in the same way that no 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:51.139
 we can make a house simply from 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:52.810
 stone because the roof will come down and 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:56.090
 how to remedy this as very easy 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:58.669
 making constructions with two fingers 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.349
 front with logic let's say if we make a 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.840
 roof we will have to use beams that 

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:04.490
 will be the untreated logs 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.550
 sanz or wooden boards if not the trunk 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.440
 just as it is cut with the ax this what 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.129
 what will allow is that these blocks 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.050
 hold on 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:15.569
 we want to put it once we have 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:18.449
 locked in the house and what happens 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:20.369
 Well, we can not place it here if 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:23.189
 you see why the blocks fall 

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:26.480
 we should put the crystal first and 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:28.729
 then the stone above because if 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.840
 because if not we do not 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:32.460
 they do not leave us 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.990
 Well we hope you liked it 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.389
 this mode makes the game a lot 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.919
 more real at the hands of x an explanation 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:39.300
 incredible I had the comments for 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:42.020
 if you have any question or 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.970
 we will answer as quickly as possible 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.889
 subscribe to follow the activity of 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.360
 our channel and like if you want that 

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:50.919
 we have done a good job I hope that 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.919
 you like it and until the next video 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:07:00.700
 Well, let's ask what it looks like to 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.700
 we are here
