00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.840 
tremendous yeah I'm going to rip the rip
the<00:01:48.420> tired<00:01:48.899> burn<00:01:49.170> off<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.409> rims<00:01:49.700> you<00:01:50.700> guys

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
the tired burn off the rims you guys

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.130 
the tired burn off the rims you guys
don't<00:01:51.060> have<00:01:51.090> an<00:01:51.240> advantage<00:01:51.509> with<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.869> torque

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
don't have an advantage with the torque

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.899 
don't have an advantage with the torque
coming<00:01:52.860> out<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.100> bottom<00:01:53.220> versus<00:01:53.700> with<00:01:53.880> a

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
coming out the bottom versus with a

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.700 
coming out the bottom versus with a
v-twin<00:01:54.299> especially<00:01:55.229> running<00:01:55.409> all<00:01:55.590> that

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
v-twin especially running all that

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.690 
v-twin especially running all that
compression<00:01:56.040> because<00:01:56.219> you're<00:01:56.369> going<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.520> come

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
compression because you're going to come

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.249 
compression because you're going to come
in<00:01:56.820> on<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.000> straightaway<00:01:57.420> you're<00:01:58.079> going<00:01:58.200> to

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
in on the straightaway you're going to

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.569 
in on the straightaway you're going to
let<00:01:58.439> off<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.770> throttle<00:01:58.799> with<00:01:59.369> all<00:01:59.490> that

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
let off the throttle with all that

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.219 
let off the throttle with all that
compression<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.180> going<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.390> act<00:02:00.509> like<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.930> brake

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
compression is going to act like a brake

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.319 
compression is going to act like a brake
almost<00:02:01.619> where<00:02:02.430> he's<00:02:02.549> just<00:02:02.790> going<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:02.969> come<00:02:03.210> in

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
almost where he's just going to come in

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.209 
almost where he's just going to come in
and<00:02:03.450> laid<00:02:03.659> on<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.840> side<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.890> I'm<00:02:05.040> going<00:02:05.130> to

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
and laid on the side and I'm going to

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.380 
and laid on the side and I'm going to
turn<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.490> wheel<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.880> thing<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.149> just<00:02:06.210> go

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
turn the wheel this thing is just go

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.690 
turn the wheel this thing is just go
group<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.170> we're<00:02:07.560> going<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.770> just<00:02:08.129> straighten

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
group and we're going to just straighten

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.580 
group and we're going to just straighten
that<00:02:08.970> corner<00:02:09.330> up<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.720> shoot<00:02:10.080> down<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.410> the

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
that corner up and it shoot down to the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.670 
that corner up and it shoot down to the
next<00:02:10.830> corner<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.870> instead<00:02:12.870> of

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
next corner and instead of

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.380 
next corner and instead of
guys<00:02:13.829> are<00:02:14.010> coming<00:02:14.280> on<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.519> outside<00:02:14.909> you<00:02:15.359> can

in but whoop whoop that's our in these

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.449

guys<00:02:22.379> are<00:02:22.530> all<00:02:22.590> coming<00:02:22.769> out<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.189> when<00:02:23.340> they're

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
guys are all coming out and when they're

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.800 
guys are all coming out and when they're
coming<00:02:23.700> in<00:02:23.819> the<00:02:23.909> corner<00:02:24.269> they're<00:02:24.420> actually

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
coming in the corner they're actually

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.720 
coming in the corner they're actually
kind<00:02:25.019> of<00:02:25.079> checking<00:02:25.620> as<00:02:25.769> they're<00:02:26.430> coming

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
kind of checking as they're coming

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.920 
kind of checking as they're coming
through<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:27.000> corner<00:02:27.329> their<00:02:27.480> front<00:02:27.719> tire<00:02:27.900> is

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
through the corner their front tire is

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.170 
through the corner their front tire is
checking<00:02:28.379> on<00:02:28.620> them<00:02:28.799> my<00:02:29.310> idea<00:02:29.670> is<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.819> hit<00:02:30.060> the

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
checking on them my idea is to hit the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.110 
checking on them my idea is to hit the
corner<00:02:30.420> tight<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:31.010> actually<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.670> know<00:02:32.700> glide

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
corner tight and actually you know glide

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.910 
corner tight and actually you know glide
through<00:02:33.629> and<00:02:33.930> then<00:02:34.170> as<00:02:34.319> we're<00:02:34.530> starting<00:02:34.829> to

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
through and then as we're starting to

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.629 
through and then as we're starting to
come<00:02:35.280> in<00:02:35.599> hit<00:02:36.599> it<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:36.959> you<00:02:36.989> roll<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.159> actually

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:38.639 
come in hit it and you roll it actually

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:41.660 
come in hit it and you roll it actually
roll<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.659> just<00:02:40.049> you<00:02:40.709> know<00:02:40.769> instead<00:02:41.189> of<00:02:41.370> us

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
roll it and just you know instead of us

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.970 
roll it and just you know instead of us
I<00:02:41.909> think<00:02:41.939> with<00:02:42.389> weight<00:02:42.750> may<00:02:43.230> play<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.650> an

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
I think with weight may play to an

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.699 
I think with weight may play to an
advantage<00:02:44.579> on<00:02:44.760> on<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.420> yeah<00:02:45.780> looks<00:02:46.319> like<00:02:46.379> a<00:02:46.530> big

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
advantage on on it yeah looks like a big

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.099 
advantage on on it yeah looks like a big
two<00:02:46.889> can<00:02:47.129> be<00:02:47.340> so<00:02:48.239> I<00:02:48.269> don't<00:02:48.480> like<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:48.780> we're

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
two can be so I don't like that we're

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:50.300 
two can be so I don't like that we're
going<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.260> have<00:02:49.409> our<00:02:49.650> tanks<00:02:50.010> going<00:02:50.159> to<00:02:50.250> be

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
going to have our tanks going to be

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.309 
going to have our tanks going to be
right<00:02:50.489> here<00:02:50.639> in<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.790> frame<00:02:51.030> rails<00:02:51.269> let's<00:02:52.139> go

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
right here in the frame rails let's go

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.559 
right here in the frame rails let's go
your<00:02:52.500> fuel<00:02:52.799> tank<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.310> our<00:02:53.939> oil<00:02:53.970> tanks<00:02:54.419> over

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
your fuel tank and our oil tanks over

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.649 
your fuel tank and our oil tanks over
right<00:02:55.109> here<00:02:55.519> so<00:02:56.519> if<00:02:56.639> I<00:02:56.730> ever<00:02:56.879> blow<00:02:57.209> up<00:02:57.329> the<00:02:57.480> oil

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
right here so if I ever blow up the oil

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.440 
right here so if I ever blow up the oil
tank<00:02:57.930> I<00:02:58.169> want<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.680> basically<00:02:58.969> get<00:02:59.969> covered<00:03:00.359> in

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
tank I want to basically get covered in

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.429 
tank I want to basically get covered in

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449 
good but yeah we had a bit of a

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:22.969 
good but yeah we had a bit of a
clearance<00:03:22.379> problem

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:22.979 
clearance problem

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:25.069 
clearance problem
this<00:03:23.459> piece<00:03:23.669> wouldn't<00:03:24.120> fit<00:03:24.299> bunch<00:03:24.959> of

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
this piece wouldn't fit bunch of

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.300 
this piece wouldn't fit bunch of
different<00:03:25.349> setups<00:03:25.530> you<00:03:25.799> can<00:03:25.919> do<00:03:26.010> on<00:03:26.129> this

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310
