positioned reflectors on the surface of
the<00:00:33.590> moon<00:00:33.739> and<00:00:33.920> we're<00:00:34.010> gonna<00:00:34.130> shoot<00:00:34.340> a<00:00:34.460> laser

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
the moon and we're gonna shoot a laser

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.549 
the moon and we're gonna shoot a laser
off<00:00:35.059> one<00:00:35.329> of<00:00:35.420> them<00:00:35.570> and<00:00:35.840> let<00:00:35.900> the<00:00:36.079> light<00:00:36.200> bounce

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
off one of them and let the light bounce

one<00:00:40.910> question<00:00:41.260> how<00:00:42.260> can<00:00:42.379> you<00:00:42.470> be<00:00:42.559> sure<00:00:42.590> it

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
one question how can you be sure it

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.790 
one question how can you be sure it
won't<00:00:43.010> blow<00:00:43.160> up<00:00:43.190> a<00:00:44.650> laser<00:00:45.650> the<00:00:46.129> moon

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.580 

see<00:00:50.340> now<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.790> is<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.059> man<00:00:51.329> for<00:00:51.660> penny

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
see now this is a man for penny

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.430 
see now this is a man for penny
haha<00:00:54.310> that's<00:00:54.610> a<00:00:54.850> great<00:00:55.120> question<00:00:55.360> Zach<00:00:55.930> no

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
haha that's a great question Zach no

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.090 
haha that's a great question Zach no
it's<00:00:56.620> not

question<00:01:00.430> how<00:01:00.730> could<00:01:00.910> somebody<00:01:01.090> possibly

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
question how could somebody possibly

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.700 
question how could somebody possibly
think<00:01:02.110> we're<00:01:02.260> going<00:01:02.410> to<00:01:02.500> blow<00:01:02.710> up<00:01:02.890> the<00:01:03.070> moon

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
think we're going to blow up the moon

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.270 
think we're going to blow up the moon
that's<00:01:05.710> a<00:01:05.950> great<00:01:06.160> question

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
that's a great question

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.920 
that's a great question
don't<00:01:09.280> worry<00:01:09.490> about<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:09.910> moon<00:01:10.090> we<00:01:10.270> we<00:01:10.570> set<00:01:10.810> our

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
don't worry about the moon we we set our

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.020 
don't worry about the moon we we set our
laser<00:01:11.110> to<00:01:11.440> stun<00:01:12.540> smart<00:01:14.369> now<00:01:15.369> we'll<00:01:15.610> be<00:01:15.729> able<00:01:15.850> to

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
laser to stun smart now we'll be able to

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.490 
laser to stun smart now we'll be able to
see<00:01:16.210> the<00:01:16.360> beam<00:01:16.510> when<00:01:16.660> it<00:01:16.780> leaves<00:01:16.960> but<00:01:17.290> it<00:01:17.350> won't

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
see the beam when it leaves but it won't

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.719 
see the beam when it leaves but it won't
be<00:01:17.560> strong<00:01:17.800> enough<00:01:17.979> when<00:01:18.130> it<00:01:18.220> comes<00:01:18.430> back<00:01:18.670> to

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
be strong enough when it comes back to

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:19.920 
be strong enough when it comes back to
be<00:01:18.940> seen<00:01:19.119> by<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:19.300> naked<00:01:19.479> eye

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
be seen by the naked eye

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.130 
be seen by the naked eye
naked

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.360 

right<00:01:26.710> now<00:01:26.979> yet<00:01:27.159> funny<00:01:28.229> job<00:01:29.229> that<00:01:30.040> device

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
right now yet funny job that device

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.160 
right now yet funny job that device
there<00:01:30.729> will<00:01:31.120> measure<00:01:31.510> the<00:01:31.720> photons<00:01:32.050> that

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
there will measure the photons that

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.420 
there will measure the photons that
return<00:01:32.530> and<00:01:32.800> let<00:01:32.920> us<00:01:33.010> see<00:01:33.130> it<00:01:33.190> on<00:01:33.280> this

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
return and let us see it on this

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.450 
return and let us see it on this
computer<00:01:33.760> Raj<00:01:34.060> get<00:01:34.270> them<00:01:34.390> some<00:01:34.510> glasses<00:01:35.460> cool

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
preparing to fire laser at the moon make

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.210 
preparing to fire laser at the moon make
it<00:01:47.420> so

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.000 

there<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.490> there's<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.000> spike<00:01:55.010> 2.5

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
there it is there's the spike 2.5

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.289 
there it is there's the spike 2.5
seconds<00:01:56.369> for<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.549> light<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.700> return<00:01:57.060> that's

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
seconds for the light to return that's

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:04.030 
seconds for the light to return that's
the<00:01:57.540> movie<00:02:01.909> that's<00:02:02.909> your<00:02:03.030> big<00:02:03.150> experiment

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
the movie that's your big experiment

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.670 
the movie that's your big experiment
however<00:02:05.040> lying<00:02:05.580> on<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.820> screen<00:02:06.259> yeah<00:02:07.259> but

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
however lying on the screen yeah but

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.279 
however lying on the screen yeah but
think<00:02:08.190> about<00:02:08.429> what<00:02:08.880> this<00:02:09.060> represents<00:02:09.420> the

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
think about what this represents the

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.140 
think about what this represents the
fact<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.679> we<00:02:10.770> can<00:02:10.950> do<00:02:11.069> this<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.580> only<00:02:11.790> way

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
fact that we can do this is the only way

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.790 
fact that we can do this is the only way
of<00:02:12.180> definitively<00:02:12.989> proving<00:02:13.500> that<00:02:13.590> there<00:02:13.770> are

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
of definitively proving that there are

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.340 
of definitively proving that there are
man-made<00:02:13.890> objects<00:02:14.790> on<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.150> moon<00:02:15.330> put<00:02:16.170> there

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
man-made objects on the moon put there

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.140 
man-made objects on the moon put there
by<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.500> member<00:02:16.860> of<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:17.040> species<00:02:17.280> at<00:02:17.580> only<00:02:17.700> 60
