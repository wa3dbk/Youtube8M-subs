remember<00:02:09.130> we're<00:02:09.280> going<00:02:09.429> to<00:02:09.489> animate<00:02:09.850> the

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.430 
remember we're going to animate the
dancers<00:02:10.420> so<00:02:10.720> think<00:02:10.959> about<00:02:11.079> how<00:02:11.290> your

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
dancers so think about how your

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.410 
dancers so think about how your
character<00:02:11.620> would<00:02:11.920> look<00:02:12.130> as<00:02:12.340> it<00:02:12.549> moves<00:02:12.760> ideally

you<00:02:13.540> could<00:02:13.720> break<00:02:13.930> your<00:02:14.079> design<00:02:14.410> into

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
you could break your design into

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.289 
you could break your design into
individual<00:02:15.310> body<00:02:15.489> parts<00:02:15.850> then<00:02:16.060> you<00:02:16.150> could

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
individual body parts then you could

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:17.940 
individual body parts then you could
upload<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:16.750> template<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.530> animators
