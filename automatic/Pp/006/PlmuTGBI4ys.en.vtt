00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
differential in the gearbox so I figured

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.350 
differential in the gearbox so I figured
I<00:00:30.810> would<00:00:30.840> give<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.230> try<00:00:31.880> use<00:00:32.880> this<00:00:33.030> thing<00:00:33.210> and

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
I would give it a try use this thing and

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.569 
I would give it a try use this thing and
try<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.540> extract<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.230> oil<00:00:34.649> from<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.010> fill

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
try to extract the oil from the fill

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.880 
try to extract the oil from the fill
side<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:37.079> differentials<00:00:37.649> and

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
side of it of the differentials and

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.510 
side of it of the differentials and
through<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.879> dipstick<00:00:39.350> tube<00:00:40.350> on<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:41.160> engine

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
through the dipstick tube on the engine

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.940 
through the dipstick tube on the engine
and<00:00:41.989> see<00:00:42.989> how<00:00:43.050> much<00:00:43.110> oil<00:00:43.260> actually<00:00:43.500> get<00:00:43.800> out

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
and see how much oil actually get out

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.010 
and see how much oil actually get out
and<00:00:43.980> then<00:00:44.340> go<00:00:45.000> through<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.270> whole<00:00:45.390> motion<00:00:45.809> and

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
and then go through the whole motion and

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.470 
and then go through the whole motion and
pull<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.530> drain<00:00:46.710> plug<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.190> see<00:00:47.520> what<00:00:47.670> how

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
pull the drain plug and see what how

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.660 
pull the drain plug and see what how
much<00:00:48.629> oil<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:49.079> left<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.469> there<00:00:49.649> see<00:00:50.489> if<00:00:50.550> it's

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
much oil is left in there see if it's

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.150 
much oil is left in there see if it's
worth<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.960> time<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.020> effort<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.469> try<00:00:53.070> and

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
worth the time and effort to try and

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.979 
worth the time and effort to try and
extract<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.579> through<00:00:53.760> those<00:00:53.879> different<00:00:54.570> fill

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
extract it through those different fill

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.720 
extract it through those different fill
ports<00:00:55.430> so<00:00:56.430> stay<00:00:56.789> tuned<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:58.399> let's<00:00:59.399> see<00:00:59.550> how

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
ports so stay tuned and let's see how

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.029 
ports so stay tuned and let's see how
much<00:00:59.940> actually<00:01:00.600> comes<00:01:00.780> out<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.170> remembers

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
much actually comes out and remembers

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.399 
much actually comes out and remembers
filt<00:01:02.879> ports<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.480> then<00:01:03.600> what<00:01:03.750> we<00:01:03.870> actually<00:01:04.290> get

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
filt ports and then what we actually get

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.080 
filt ports and then what we actually get
out<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.680> drain<00:01:04.860> port<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.700> may<00:01:05.820> not<00:01:05.939> be

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
out of the drain port it may not be

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.460 
out of the drain port it may not be
worth<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.270> effort<00:01:06.510> but<00:01:06.930> we're<00:01:07.049> going<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.200> find

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
worth the effort but we're going to find

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.010 
worth the effort but we're going to find

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
and we'll see how much engine we can

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.109 
and we'll see how much engine we can
suck<00:01:31.619> out<00:01:31.829> we<00:01:32.100> know<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.610> commander

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
suck out we know that the commander

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.120 
suck out we know that the commander
calls<00:01:33.329> for<00:01:33.600> about<00:01:33.780> two<00:01:33.960> quarts<00:01:34.200> 2.2<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.950> count

that<00:05:39.050> it<00:05:39.680> sometimes<00:05:40.039> it's<00:05:40.189> hard<00:05:40.369> to<00:05:40.399> tell<00:05:40.610> a

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
that it sometimes it's hard to tell a

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.420 
that it sometimes it's hard to tell a
little<00:05:40.939> bit<00:05:41.059> of<00:05:41.180> oil<00:05:41.360> looks<00:05:41.779> like<00:05:41.960> a<00:05:41.990> lot<00:05:42.430> with

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
little bit of oil looks like a lot with

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.809 
little bit of oil looks like a lot with
the<00:05:44.889> gearbox<00:05:45.889> down<00:05:46.339> there

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:46.819 
the gearbox down there

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:51.489 
the gearbox down there
I<00:05:46.849> got<00:05:47.419> literally<00:05:48.369> probably<00:05:49.369> 1015<00:05:50.059> drops<00:05:50.499> very

00:05:51.489 --> 00:05:51.499 
I got literally probably 1015 drops very

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:54.820 
I got literally probably 1015 drops very
very<00:05:52.069> very<00:05:52.279> little<00:05:52.610> oil<00:05:52.759> came<00:05:53.209> out<00:05:53.360> of<00:05:53.449> that<00:05:53.830> so

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
very very little oil came out of that so

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.369 
very very little oil came out of that so
I'm<00:05:55.279> comfortable<00:05:55.879> doing<00:05:56.389> that<00:05:56.839> method<00:05:57.229> all

00:05:57.369 --> 00:05:57.379 
I'm comfortable doing that method all

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:59.379 
I'm comfortable doing that method all
the<00:05:57.469> way<00:05:57.559> around<00:05:57.830> for<00:05:58.039> those<00:05:58.159> two<00:05:58.430> and<00:05:58.789> with

00:05:59.379 --> 00:05:59.389 
the way around for those two and with

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:00.760 
the way around for those two and with
the<00:05:59.479> front<00:05:59.599> differential<00:06:00.020> I<00:06:00.289> know<00:06:00.469> it's<00:06:00.619> dark

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
the front differential I know it's dark

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:01.149 
the front differential I know it's dark
in<00:06:00.979> there

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:01.159 
in there

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:03.699 
in there
so<00:06:01.520> let's<00:06:01.729> stand<00:06:01.969> here<00:06:02.180> and<00:06:02.240> talk<00:06:02.469> I've<00:06:03.469> got

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:03.709 
so let's stand here and talk I've got

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:06.609 
so let's stand here and talk I've got
maybe<00:06:04.580> half<00:06:04.729> ounce<00:06:05.180> out<00:06:05.419> of<00:06:05.569> it<00:06:05.719> so<00:06:06.319> for<00:06:06.499> those

00:06:06.609 --> 00:06:06.619 
maybe half ounce out of it so for those

00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:09.760 
maybe half ounce out of it so for those
three<00:06:07.009> components<00:06:08.199> that's<00:06:09.199> the<00:06:09.319> easy<00:06:09.499> way<00:06:09.709> to

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
three components that's the easy way to

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.070 
three components that's the easy way to
do<00:06:09.979> it<00:06:10.009> without<00:06:10.189> making<00:06:10.430> a<00:06:10.639> mess<00:06:11.080> haven't

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
do it without making a mess haven't

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.260 
do it without making a mess haven't
worried<00:06:12.199> about<00:06:12.319> dropping<00:06:12.499> the<00:06:12.740> skid<00:06:12.949> plate

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
worried about dropping the skid plate

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.239 
worried about dropping the skid plate
you<00:06:14.270> know<00:06:14.330> you<00:06:14.389> can<00:06:14.629> see<00:06:14.839> there<00:06:15.680> is<00:06:15.830> oil<00:06:15.979> down

00:06:16.239 --> 00:06:16.249 
you know you can see there is oil down

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:17.589 
you know you can see there is oil down
in<00:06:16.430> there<00:06:16.610> from<00:06:16.789> when<00:06:16.939> I<00:06:17.029> was<00:06:17.149> trying<00:06:17.300> to<00:06:17.419> fill

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599 
in there from when I was trying to fill

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:19.899 
in there from when I was trying to fill
it<00:06:17.689> back<00:06:17.839> up<00:06:17.899> it's<00:06:18.830> always<00:06:19.219> a<00:06:19.249> tedious<00:06:19.580> process

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:19.909 
it back up it's always a tedious process

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:21.909 
it back up it's always a tedious process
and<00:06:20.509> you<00:06:20.569> can<00:06:20.689> use<00:06:20.839> that<00:06:20.990> a<00:06:21.050> lot<00:06:21.199> transfer<00:06:21.619> pump

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 
and you can use that a lot transfer pump

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:25.600 
and you can use that a lot transfer pump
to<00:06:22.759> refill<00:06:23.149> it<00:06:23.180> as<00:06:23.419> well<00:06:23.629> but<00:06:23.839> I<00:06:23.870> tend<00:06:24.110> to<00:06:24.610> like

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 
to refill it as well but I tend to like

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.189 
to refill it as well but I tend to like
to<00:06:25.639> do<00:06:25.819> things<00:06:25.939> like<00:06:26.089> that<00:06:26.180> by<00:06:26.449> hand<00:06:26.749> so<00:06:27.019> I<00:06:27.050> can

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199 
to do things like that by hand so I can

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:29.949 
to do things like that by hand so I can
monitor<00:06:27.499> a<00:06:27.949> little<00:06:28.279> more<00:06:28.399> closely<00:06:28.959> less

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:29.959 
monitor a little more closely less

00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:32.589 
monitor a little more closely less
likely<00:06:30.259> to<00:06:30.319> overfill<00:06:30.800> it<00:06:30.830> as<00:06:31.039> well<00:06:31.219> on<00:06:31.599> the

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:32.599 
likely to overfill it as well on the

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:37.089 
likely to overfill it as well on the
rear<00:06:32.719> differential<00:06:33.789> about<00:06:34.789> here<00:06:35.180> I<00:06:35.949> was<00:06:36.949> not

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:37.099 
rear differential about here I was not

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:39.820 
rear differential about here I was not
able<00:06:37.339> to<00:06:37.610> get<00:06:37.789> the<00:06:38.120> suction<00:06:38.779> hose<00:06:39.169> into<00:06:39.559> the

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:41.599

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:44.679 
differential just the way the fill port
is<00:06:41.919> it<00:06:42.919> goes<00:06:43.129> in<00:06:43.370> it<00:06:43.999> kind<00:06:44.149> of<00:06:44.240> makes<00:06:44.479> a<00:06:44.569> weird
