front of the Frog

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.190 
front of the Frog
we'll<00:01:18.500> get<00:01:18.590> that<00:01:18.740> area<00:01:19.039> filled<00:01:19.340> up<00:01:19.520> in<00:01:19.789> there

and<00:01:21.200> it<00:01:21.289> depends<00:01:21.649> on<00:01:21.740> whether<00:01:21.890> this<00:01:22.369> horse<00:01:22.550> has

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
and it depends on whether this horse has

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.880 
and it depends on whether this horse has
already<00:01:22.940> started<00:01:23.149> rotating<00:01:23.539> or<00:01:24.140> we'll<00:01:24.770> talk

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
already started rotating or we'll talk

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.230 
already started rotating or we'll talk
about<00:01:24.950> with<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:25.220> coffin<00:01:25.429> bones<00:01:25.759> tipping<00:01:26.030> down

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
about with the coffin bones tipping down

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.910 
about with the coffin bones tipping down
we<00:01:26.450> may<00:01:26.600> cut<00:01:26.869> this<00:01:26.990> off<00:01:27.170> on<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.470> front<00:01:27.770> if

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
we may cut this off on the front if

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.830 
we may cut this off on the front if
we're<00:01:28.039> not<00:01:28.130> sure<00:01:28.340> whether<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:28.819> whole<00:01:29.420> coffin

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
we're not sure whether the whole coffin

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.210 
we're not sure whether the whole coffin
bone<00:01:29.960> is<00:01:30.080> gonna<00:01:30.229> just<00:01:30.409> sink<00:01:30.590> straight<00:01:30.890> down<00:01:31.100> to

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
bone is gonna just sink straight down to

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.279 
bone is gonna just sink straight down to
rotate<00:01:31.610> we'll<00:01:31.850> go<00:01:31.940> ahead<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:32.750> just<00:01:32.899> have<00:01:33.110> the

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
rotate we'll go ahead and just have the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:34.990 
rotate we'll go ahead and just have the
entire<00:01:33.590> foot<00:01:34.009> here<00:01:34.280> so<00:01:34.399> we're<00:01:34.520> gonna<00:01:34.610> come<00:01:34.880> in

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
entire foot here so we're gonna come in

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.410 
entire foot here so we're gonna come in
here<00:01:35.259> we're<00:01:36.259> going<00:01:36.440> to<00:01:36.500> go<00:01:36.590> around<00:01:36.709> this

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
here we're going to go around this

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.300 
here we're going to go around this
figure<00:01:38.420> eight<00:01:38.600> it<00:01:38.840> we<00:01:39.350> block<00:01:39.590> both<00:01:39.770> front<00:01:40.069> feet

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
figure eight it we block both front feet

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.980 
figure eight it we block both front feet
I'll<00:01:40.460> just<00:01:40.610> walk<00:01:40.820> them<00:01:41.000> a<00:01:41.060> few<00:01:41.299> steps<00:01:41.600> in<00:01:41.930> the

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
I'll just walk them a few steps in the

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
stall we see how comfortable they are if

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.120 
stall we see how comfortable they are if
they<00:01:44.810> look<00:01:44.990> like<00:01:45.020> this<00:01:45.350> horse<00:01:45.649> and<00:01:46.009> they're

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
fine then I know I'm just dealing with

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:49.870 
fine then I know I'm just dealing with
the<00:01:48.380> front<00:01:48.590> feet<00:01:48.799> and<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:49.130> vast<00:01:49.369> majority<00:01:49.520> of

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
the front feet and the vast majority of

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.179 
the front feet and the vast majority of
cases<00:01:50.090> all<00:01:50.810> we're<00:01:51.049> dealing<00:01:51.140> with<00:01:51.350> this<00:01:51.590> the

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
cases all we're dealing with this the

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:53.950 
cases all we're dealing with this the
front<00:01:52.430> feet

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
front feet

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.960 
front feet

and basically they're just heart bar
blanks<00:01:56.420> it<00:01:56.570> takes<00:01:56.780> some<00:01:56.960> of<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.140> time<00:01:57.350> out<00:01:57.560> of

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
blanks it takes some of the time out of

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.410 
blanks it takes some of the time out of
making<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.160> heart<00:01:58.340> bar<00:01:58.520> but<00:01:58.910> you<00:01:58.940> still<00:01:59.240> have

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
making the heart bar but you still have

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.240 
making the heart bar but you still have
to<00:01:59.600> be<00:01:59.690> able<00:01:59.810> to<00:01:59.990> fit<00:02:00.200> it<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:00.350> fuller<00:02:00.740> it<00:02:00.980> that

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
to be able to fit it and fuller it that

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.640 
to be able to fit it and fuller it that

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.679 
same time you see the way everything
kind<00:03:43.709> of<00:03:43.799> just<00:03:43.860> soaks<00:03:44.730> in<00:03:44.939> as<00:03:45.060> a<00:03:45.090> liquid<00:03:45.569> it

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:45.689 
kind of just soaks in as a liquid it

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.679 
kind of just soaks in as a liquid it
sets<00:03:45.930> up<00:03:46.079> to<00:03:46.319> a<00:03:46.349> solid<00:03:47.000> first<00:03:48.000> nail<00:03:48.239> hole<00:03:48.420> right

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:48.689 
sets up to a solid first nail hole right

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:51.080 
sets up to a solid first nail hole right
it's<00:03:49.409> a<00:03:49.590> good<00:03:49.769> general<00:03:50.250> assumption<00:03:50.790> of<00:03:50.909> where

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
it's a good general assumption of where

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.569 
it's a good general assumption of where
we<00:03:51.239> want<00:03:51.450> that<00:03:51.689> the<00:03:52.650> break<00:03:52.859> over<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:53.250> be<00:03:53.370> where

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
we want that the break over to be where

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.849 
we want that the break over to be where
the<00:03:53.670> foot<00:03:53.849> leaves<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.180> ground<00:03:54.590> let's<00:03:55.590> see<00:03:55.739> how

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
the foot leaves the ground let's see how

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.860 
the foot leaves the ground let's see how
far<00:03:56.129> we<00:03:56.340> are<00:03:56.459> off<00:03:56.700> of<00:03:56.730> that<00:03:57.060> we're<00:03:57.540> just<00:03:57.659> about

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
far we are off of that we're just about

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.780 
far we are off of that we're just about
right<00:03:58.109> we're<00:03:58.859> getting<00:03:59.189> pretty<00:03:59.340> close<00:03:59.519> we

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
right we're getting pretty close we

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.190 
right we're getting pretty close we
could<00:03:59.939> have<00:04:00.030> came<00:04:00.180> back<00:04:00.359> maybe<00:04:00.569> slight<00:04:00.989> bit

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
could have came back maybe slight bit

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.470 
could have came back maybe slight bit
more
