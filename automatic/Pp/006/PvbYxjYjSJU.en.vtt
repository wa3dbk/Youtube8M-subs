00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.810
 hello to all guys and well back on 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.029
 android mod 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.950
 if you like my style 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.110
 Classical firmware hello mimics your 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.029
 device is not supported or if 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.099
 you simply want to try some 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.110
 of his duties before deciding whether 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:29.800
 flash the real rom is not there 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.840
 worry 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.329
 all this is possible thanks to a 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.940
 simple application miui light express 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:40.360
 the requirements are basic 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.359
 android 4.0 or above a gigabyte of 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.309
 ram and 100 megabytes of free space in the 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:47.410
 case one of the three conditions does not 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.449
 unfortunately it is not satisfied 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.820
 guaranteed package operation 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.160
 let's see how to install it and what it offers 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.350
 being an app provided by the same hello 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.420
 the apk file is enough for me and I'm not 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.640
 need root or recovery 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.699
 modified for this you will simply have to 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.490
 go to system settings e 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.690
 under security, enable the origins 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.950
 unknown 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.200
 in this way you can install 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.650
 applications not coming from the play 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.780
 store 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.490
 then you will have to download the file that 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.020
 found in trading description e 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.820
 you will need to create an account 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.490
 obviously totally free 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.290
 to download select it e 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.450
 give to the stable 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.730
 voila the procedure will be complete and 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.770
 then you can open the first app 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.080
 startup will take a few moments because the 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.960
 everything must load the next ones instead 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.190
 as you can see they are very fast 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.440
 let's take a look at the elements there 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.240
 are made available or the 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.010
 launcher the lockscreen and some 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.710
 classic applications of miui 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.479
 as you see the style the similar one s s 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.280
 and with regards to the settings 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.140
 of the launcher we find that change 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.510
 allows you to add shortcuts and 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.520
 widgets and for the latter we can 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.550
 decide between ours and those of the Roma 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.410
 for example the one to free the ram 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.480
 background obviously allows us to 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.340
 change the wallpaper and theme there 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.050
 lets you choose the appearance to give 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.210
 to the launcher but this section is sailing 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.860
 I'll show you in a moment by continuing with 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.750
 the settings we find fonts for 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.280
 customize phone fonts 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.070
 settings that refer to the settings 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.380
 system and launcher in which we find the 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.270
 main options among the settings 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.440
 common new launcher allows 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.870
 set what we are using 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.610
 as default 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.470
 choose between different effects of 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.540
 transition enable scrolling 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.390
 background and change the size 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.819
 back up the grid e 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.709
 other on the block we can set the 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.450
 lockscreen that you see as already 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.760
 mentioned is also the classic one 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.489
 of the miui is that it allows unlocking with 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.829
 an upward messeging swipe does it 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.680
 same but with messages and contact with i 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:51.319
 you would never say contacts on the market but 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.120
 if we can set the store by choosing 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.220
 whether to make updates to 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.500
 asp and background themes e 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.810
 choosing whether to download only in wifi or 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.310
 even in 3g to use my cloud 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.980
 instead you need to be logged in with 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.810
 the account hello me that voice allows 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.780
 to perform online backups of 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.430
 contacts photo messages and notes on 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.019
 advanced functions we find the voices 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.599
 show launcher through which 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.280
 we can share the home download that 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.379
 shows a simple chronology of the 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.390
 elements we downloaded blocklist 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:23.299
 which serves to create a black list for 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.519
 block messages and calls and directories 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.810
 finally on information we can 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.000
 check for any 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.350
 updates and to have precisely 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.390
 information in Chinese 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.920
 back to the main screen like this 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.410
 I show you what are some of the 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.720
 custom app from hi me over to 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.880
 phone contacts and messages are there 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.620
 in the toolbox folder aidap for 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.810
 hide applications from 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.120
 homescreen kinheim search to perform 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.560
 a search for files on the phone and 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.330
 this function can also be 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.520
 activated with a swipe upwards 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.880
 layout to organize the interface 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.380
 an app to lock the device 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.790
 tusk presence to free the ram 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.550
 block and close any 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.290
 open applications and categories for 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.050
 automatically divide all 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.790
 our applications in launcher folders 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.160
 it simply refers to the settings 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.710
 which we have just seen in the folder 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.570
 store instead you can see the two markets 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.070
 the first for applications and the 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.170
 according to the themes 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.670
 both are in Chinese and if so how much 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.590
 regards the first this renders 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.510
 its use is particularly difficult 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.940
 because the downloaded apps are also 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.560
 in this language it does not affect the use 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.060
 of the second as the themes 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.160
 they will only customize the look 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.840
 aesthetic of the launcher and will not touch 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.330
 the writings that therefore will remain 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.370
 Italian these themes that have always been 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.920
 one of the main strengths of the 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.210
 miui there are lots of them for a fee 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.550
 while others free 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:49.400
 now I go on local so it came monster 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:51.740
 one of those free or universe 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.889
 applying it as you see the aesthetics is 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.290
 changed both on the unlock screen 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:59.419
 that in the camera browser interface 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.400
 gallery and music are not those of 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.020
 hello me but refer to our app if 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.990
 they only show the icon 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.060
 custom suggestions is an example 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.910
 of widgets provided by the app for the 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.949
 quick composition of emails and text messages 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.449
 and the same applies to the useful panel 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:17.330
 which you see at the top with the tools 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:19.250
 quick good the main things veil 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.229
 show and add that if you like it 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.570
 style this app or better this 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:25.610
 suite is what works for you 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.139
 perfection fluidity allows use 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.360
 daily and in a period enough 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:31.850
 ample test because I'm trying it 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.139
 since version 2.0 is now we are 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.610
 to 2.4 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:37.070
 I never noticed crash or 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.810
 also malfunctions and I would add 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.270
 above all it does not affect too much 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.099
 massive on energy consumption than for 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.349
 a launcher and for applications of 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:47.150
 this type is fundamental in my opinion 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:49.220
 so I highly recommend you to 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.110
 try it and if you follow my advice 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.940
 to let me know in the comments like vi 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.500
 you are found perfect 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.449
 nothing else to add then this 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.280
 that's all for today if the video is there 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:00.229
 liked I recommend you put a nice me
