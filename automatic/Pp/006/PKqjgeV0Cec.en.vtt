oh<00:00:19.350> my<00:00:19.529> gosh<00:00:19.740> we're<00:00:20.130> on<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.310> Xbox<00:00:20.640> one<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:21.270> guess

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
oh my gosh we're on the Xbox one I guess

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.330 
oh my gosh we're on the Xbox one I guess
I<00:00:21.810> don't<00:00:22.140> know<00:00:22.230> if<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.350> said<00:00:22.529> it'd<00:00:22.619> be<00:00:22.949> my<00:00:23.039> next

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
I don't know if I said it'd be my next

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.830

one will call the end of dragons so

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.240

basically<00:00:25.109> every<00:00:25.380> time<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.619> duplicate<00:00:26.099> they

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
basically every time you duplicate they

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.070 
basically every time you duplicate they
duplicate<00:00:26.640> five<00:00:26.939> more<00:00:27.269> as<00:00:27.390> far<00:00:27.570> as<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.689> can<00:00:27.750> find

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
duplicate five more as far as I can find

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.019 
duplicate five more as far as I can find
and<00:00:28.349> so<00:00:28.920> like<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.400> know<00:00:29.429> if<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:29.670> do<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:29.849> once

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
and so like you know if you do it once

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.299 
and so like you know if you do it once
tonight<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.990> get<00:00:31.109> 6<00:00:31.500> all<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.830> sudden<00:00:32.130> here<00:00:32.279> I

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
tonight you get 6 all of a sudden here I

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.470 
tonight you get 6 all of a sudden here I
think<00:00:32.520> we<00:00:32.579> have<00:00:32.669> like<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.790> leather<00:00:33.030> now<00:00:33.270> know

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
think we have like a leather now know

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.170 
think we have like a leather now know
for<00:00:33.660> sure<00:00:34.050> exactly<00:00:34.380> but<00:00:34.649> um<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.370> can<00:00:35.550> only<00:00:35.790> work

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
for sure exactly but um it can only work

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.180 
for sure exactly but um it can only work
on<00:00:36.440> worlds<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.620> were<00:00:37.800> previously

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
on worlds that were previously

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.610 
on worlds that were previously
previously<00:00:38.700> on<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.149> 360<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.960> then<00:00:40.469> you

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
previously on the 360 and then you

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.850 
previously on the 360 and then you
transfer<00:00:40.950> them<00:00:41.250> over<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.120> xbox<00:00:42.480> one<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.960> I

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
transfer them over to the xbox one and I

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.020 
transfer them over to the xbox one and I
don't<00:00:44.040> know<00:00:44.160> if<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.399> gonna<00:00:44.579> be<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.850> case

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
don't know if this is gonna be the case

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.580 
don't know if this is gonna be the case
for<00:00:45.059> ps4<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.660> would<00:00:45.930> assume<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.230> will<00:00:46.410> be

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
for ps4 I would assume it will be

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.979 
for ps4 I would assume it will be
because<00:00:47.280> like<00:00:48.210> they're<00:00:48.420> pretty<00:00:48.690> much<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
because like they're pretty much the

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.869 
because like they're pretty much the
same<00:00:49.200> between<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.680> two<00:00:49.800> consoles<00:00:50.190> okay<00:00:50.820> so

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
same between the two consoles okay so

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.970 
same between the two consoles okay so
it's<00:00:51.059> super<00:00:51.300> easy<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.960> have<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.230> have<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.649> world

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
it's super easy you have to have a world

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.350 
it's super easy you have to have a world
that<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.250> had<00:00:53.340> transferred<00:00:53.879> over<00:00:54.090> from<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
that you had transferred over from the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.630 
that you had transferred over from the
xbox<00:00:54.510> 360<00:00:55.110> like<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.379> said<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.800> then<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.460> have

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
xbox 360 like I said and then you have

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.250 
xbox 360 like I said and then you have
to<00:00:56.850> whenever<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.480> load<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.719> up<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.109> have<00:00:58.230> to

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
to whenever you load it up you have to

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.380 
to whenever you load it up you have to
make<00:00:58.500> sure<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.949> disabled<00:00:59.550> autosave<00:01:00.059> is

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
make sure that the disabled autosave is

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.420 
make sure that the disabled autosave is
turn<00:01:01.109> off<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.770> like<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.190> will

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
turn off so that like it will

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.579 
turn off so that like it will
automatically<00:01:03.120> save<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.629> for<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.470> as<00:01:04.559> you

I'm<00:01:51.360> count<00:01:51.570> with<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.720> bug<00:01:51.960> fixed<00:01:52.409> like<00:01:52.860> for<00:01:53.070> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
I'm count with a bug fixed like for the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.590 
I'm count with a bug fixed like for the
next<00:01:53.159> one<00:01:53.490> I'm<00:01:53.579> assuming<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.149> on<00:01:54.299> them<00:01:54.479> on

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
next one I'm assuming this is on them on

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.440 
next one I'm assuming this is on them on
the<00:01:54.899> list<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.380> things<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.860> fix<00:01:56.100> because<00:01:56.460> like

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
the list of things to fix because like

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.700 
the list of things to fix because like
it<00:01:57.570> happens<00:01:57.869> whether<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.200> wanted<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.500> or<00:01:58.590> not

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
it happens whether you wanted to or not

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.310 
it happens whether you wanted to or not
pretty<00:01:59.040> much<00:01:59.159> whenever<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.520> save<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.320> so

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
pretty much whenever you save it and so

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.319 
pretty much whenever you save it and so
I<00:02:01.590> would<00:02:02.340> recommend<00:02:02.369> like<00:02:02.880> what<00:02:03.030> I'm<00:02:03.090> gonna<00:02:03.210> do

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
and then come in the end and then save

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.170 
and then come in the end and then save
it<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:26.160> don't<00:02:26.370> have<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.640> be<00:02:26.730> in<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.030> end

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180
