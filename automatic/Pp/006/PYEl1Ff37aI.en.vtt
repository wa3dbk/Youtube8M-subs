 Everyone is having this game, right? 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:07.060
 It is a mistake that is not easy so I will 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.300
 make an observation as I opened the 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.300
 game 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.860
 wait to finish installing here 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.370
 is the game's staff is not going to make a 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.890
 observation that everyone was has a 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.110
 error when entering the first phase 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.080
 so it's not you play with you a 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.630
 click the button you expect to reach 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:49.410
 in this part that it is technical here 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:51.720

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.220

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.810
 such because it is already in play said 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.590
 he will stay down here writing the 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.510
 ping 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.000
 then you will have a written percentage 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.920
 doc at the end of this percentage is the 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.900
 install the game in the place you 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.250
 Expect to play so always was to play and 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:15.390
 takes too little then that's all it means 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.400
 no work from there you go there in the self 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.650
 I'll show you that ideology 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.050
 if you are if it is not mine not 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.730
 appeared on the desktop 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:29.100
 Let me just know the world that has 11 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:34.230
 86 programs and search for the fake 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:36.090

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.280

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.190

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:48.300
 It's easier to play. 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:51.300
