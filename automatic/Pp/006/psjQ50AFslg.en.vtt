00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.240
 neither software nor its contemporaries 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.670
 they would have admitted in no way that the 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.650
 tragedy philosophy but what matters 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.360
 to point out is that those texts have 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.460
 survived and have been transmitted from a 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.380
 unpredictable way like all the 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.180
 makes part of a context for the 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.410
 that were not written 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.410
 the knowledge of error 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.550
 the suit condition 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.890
 that I believe that where is best reflected 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.890
 is in the tragedy of Sophocles 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.670
 in the background what is raising 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.159
 the problem of how we arrived 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.229
 to know what we have to give 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.470
 the question that I do are 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.960
 answer alone 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.160
 knowing one knowing what it is that 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.440
 he wants to know what he can do 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.430
 do 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.280
 and most of all we wrong then 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.870
 in which we are falling 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.530
 permanently is where we find the 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.630
 health force 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.580
 much of Western philosophy has 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.470
 been a reflection on tragic issues 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.570
 this circumstance has not occurred in 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.970
 in vain the most likely thing is that no longer 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.890
 to buy a look 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.409
 genoa about the tragedy the alien gaze 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.770
 philosophically ignore this problem it 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.770
 raised 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.000
 through the theater think of itself 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.650
 many times we fall into topics we think 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.720
 that theater is a criticism of 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.980
 society but it is a criticism without more 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.810
 because the author also wants 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.580
 who has won with a martÃ­nez partner of 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.800
 live then have somehow 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.270
 carbon 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.520
 I think there is a problem that 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.860
 in the background is the problem that is followed 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.590
 raising now that is the problem of 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.890
 how a society can think can be 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.540
 build kidnap be ethically or if 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.490
 have any chance of doing it 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.310
 so I think it's a problem that 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.470
 in the background to superman 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.270
 I believe therefore and this is the thesis that 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.220
 we try to get in this book that 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.290
 read sharp hot eyes it is 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.510
 one of the ways in which the story of 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.620
 your vacation allows us and even us 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.620
 they force you to read it
