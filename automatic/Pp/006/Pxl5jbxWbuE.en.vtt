00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.380
 when you asked racing fans 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.100
 which game you currently play the most 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.600
 looking forward 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.389
 the answer is probably almost always 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.059
 project cars its why it's fast 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.219
 no other racing game that answers 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.699
 last years celebrates racing 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.830
 as much as project cars 52 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.990
 Races are available from day one 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.880
 of course including classics 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.099
 again hockenheimring or silverstone 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.930
 but also some rather unknown 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.650
 stretch such as the mount 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.180
 panorama socket in australia are included 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.380
 not to neglect is natural 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.320
 also the selection of mobile 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.059
 subsets added in project cars 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.219
 Most known car manufacturers 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.010
 Nevertheless, the choice is with 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.230
 almost 70 cars just a bit different 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.719
 racing games like for example 5 provided 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.160
 The Xbox One offer over 200 years 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.160
 trend rising 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.900
 project cars does not want to go with it 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.910
 convincing his scope but before 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.860
 all with his driving experience and that 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.410
 The ambitious game also succeeds 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.560
 the auto taxes turn on like theirs 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.030
 real role models who all driving aids 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.490
 disabled and a professional sports car 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.080
 as the gampert uses should be before 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.110
 have also practiced properly 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.850
 The gampert does not have abs and co 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.790
 who achieve a good placement here 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.500
 Above all, he wants one 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.420
 real gaming steering wheel with one 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.010
 Gamepad you can not do it 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.010
 to get mister under control 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.940
 Although project ks offers you besides the 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.740
 Possibility to drive free races too 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.020
 a career and multiplayer mode 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.420
 Unfortunately, there is no option yet 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.580
 for beginners with various exercises 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.200
 and explanations to the digital engine 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.960
 sport can be introduced 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.790
 who is new in the podcast that should 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.570
 first of all with the little ps-boliden 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.759
 to practice 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.759
 for example with the go karts 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.180
 who ever in his side job 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.890
 has left the white dinger 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.130
 just make a lot of fun 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.320
 are fast and are also perfect 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.020
 Of course, the asphalt also applies in the 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.060
 Project cars just beginners can do so 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.430
 learn the game and feel and 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.780
 so slowly to the larger ones 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.610
 brought cars 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.590
 at some point it is enough because once again for 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.590
 a fast-paced formula 1 boliden 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.409
 by the way, autofanatiker may over 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.129
 fling the pretty ones in ps's room 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:45.200
 looking forward 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.750
 every vehicle here became one to one 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.640
 reconstructed but beware who too much 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.890
 who could look through the area 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.340
 track and his opponents out of sight 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.340
 to lose 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.840
 even if such a crash your engine and 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.700
 Everything around it properly 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.069
 to suffer a lot 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.170
 Unfortunately, the glasses look spectacular 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.790
 not admitted you should also be on 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.349
 Do not build accidents on the runway 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.940
 but if you're already off the track 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.660
 then it should at least come off 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.830
 look spectacular or not 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.540
 By the way, the right one is spectacular 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.180
 word for the presentation of project 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.930
 Cars no matter if the graphics of the engine sound 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.940
 or the fantastic weather effects 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.920
 Broadcast just looks great 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.989
 and brings a lot of atmosphere 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.480
 The asphalt is particularly cool in the 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.920
 weather effects that are dynamic so 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.120
 It may be that here are the first three 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.790
 round in bright sunshine 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.410
 drive and then suddenly a huge one 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.900
 thunderstorm storm raises 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.209
 the whole thing is not just fun the cool 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.920
 but also brings one well 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.900
 a certain challenge in the races 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.910
 I'm still in the box and now 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.410
 we put new tires on it or hope 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.900
 I just that thunderstorm 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.880
 pulls over quickly that is alone 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.769
 your decision but you should 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.180
 to meet wisely because is simple and 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.180
 moving race decisive 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.050
 project cars is clearly aimed 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.360
 hardcore racing fans get but 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.760
 also exactly the gaming experience delivered 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.380
 which they have been waiting for so long 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.970
 if the developer is still here 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.769
 create more cars in the game 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.810
 install and maybe beginners 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.640
 better to have a hand then 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.890
 broadcast even the potential 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.700
 current genre king provided 5 compper 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.700
 overturn
