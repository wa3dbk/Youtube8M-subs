00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
be some some specialty embedded

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:53.860 
be some some specialty embedded
applications<00:00:53.269> where<00:00:53.480> they<00:00:53.629> try<00:00:53.839> and

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
applications where they try and

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.979 
applications where they try and
overclock<00:00:54.469> it<00:00:54.499> the<00:00:55.399> big<00:00:55.579> push<00:00:55.850> in<00:00:56.030> ddr3<00:00:56.719> right

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
overclock it the big push in ddr3 right

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.849 
overclock it the big push in ddr3 right
now<00:00:57.199> is<00:00:57.530> to<00:00:59.079> bring<00:01:00.079> it<00:01:00.199> to<00:01:00.320> lower<00:01:00.530> and<00:01:00.739> lower

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
now is to bring it to lower and lower

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:02.529 
now is to bring it to lower and lower
power<00:01:01.219> levels<00:01:01.579> so<00:01:01.760> there's<00:01:01.969> three<00:01:02.300> different

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
power levels so there's three different

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.920 
power levels so there's three different
voltages<00:01:04.269> classes<00:01:05.269> that<00:01:05.420> you<00:01:05.510> can<00:01:05.540> get<00:01:05.780> the

in<00:02:28.430> embedded<00:02:29.120> systems<00:02:29.450> as<00:02:30.050> well<00:02:30.130> so<00:02:31.130> within

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
in embedded systems as well so within

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.360 
in embedded systems as well so within
jedec<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:33.440> latest<00:02:34.130> generation<00:02:34.600> is<00:02:35.600> gddr5<00:02:36.470> so

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
jedec the latest generation is gddr5 so

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.000 
jedec the latest generation is gddr5 so
right<00:02:37.640> now<00:02:37.670> you<00:02:37.880> can<00:02:38.300> get<00:02:38.450> gddr5<00:02:39.350> memories

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
right now you can get gddr5 memories

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.670 
right now you can get gddr5 memories
which<00:02:40.880> are<00:02:41.060> running<00:02:41.330> at<00:02:41.480> about<00:02:41.810> six<00:02:42.230> gigabits

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
which are running at about six gigabits

feedback<00:03:23.060> so<00:03:23.660> that<00:03:23.690> errors<00:03:24.290> could<00:03:25.190> be

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
feedback so that errors could be

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.420 
feedback so that errors could be
identified<00:03:26.140> per<00:03:27.140> chip<00:03:27.200> and<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:28.040> controller

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
identified per chip and the controller

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.910 
identified per chip and the controller
can<00:03:28.670> take<00:03:28.820> appropriate<00:03:29.150> action<00:03:29.750> so<00:03:30.290> there's<00:03:30.560> a

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
can take appropriate action so there's a

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.870 
can take appropriate action so there's a
there's<00:03:31.730> a<00:03:31.790> provision<00:03:32.440> basically<00:03:33.440> for

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
there's a provision basically for

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.370 
there's a provision basically for
transaction<00:03:34.880> retry<00:03:35.329> if<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.690> controller<00:03:36.079> sees

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
transaction retry if the controller sees

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.330 
transaction retry if the controller sees
a<00:03:36.410> problem<00:03:36.709> then<00:03:37.549> it<00:03:38.000> is<00:03:38.989> expected<00:03:39.769> to<00:03:39.950> decide

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
a problem then it is expected to decide

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.160 
a problem then it is expected to decide
whether<00:03:40.549> it<00:03:40.730> needs<00:03:40.850> to<00:03:41.150> say<00:03:41.870> there<00:03:42.049> was<00:03:42.140> a

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
whether it needs to say there was a

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.199 
whether it needs to say there was a
right<00:03:42.440> failure<00:03:42.709> that<00:03:43.400> it<00:03:43.519> needs<00:03:43.700> to<00:03:43.850> try<00:03:44.060> and

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
right failure that it needs to try and

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.569 
right failure that it needs to try and
rewrite<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:44.690> data<00:03:44.930> so<00:03:45.739> if<00:03:45.829> you<00:03:45.950> turn<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.370> dial

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
rewrite the data so if you turn the dial

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.759 
rewrite the data so if you turn the dial
the<00:03:46.760> other<00:03:46.940> way<00:03:47.150> and<00:03:47.390> have<00:03:48.320> a<00:03:48.350> goal<00:03:48.620> of

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
the other way and have a goal of

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.729 
the other way and have a goal of
optimizing<00:03:49.459> power<00:03:49.930> especially<00:03:50.930> for<00:03:51.410> battery

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
optimizing power especially for battery

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.120 
optimizing power especially for battery
operated<00:03:52.220> devices<00:03:52.640> you<00:03:53.269> get<00:03:53.480> LP<00:03:53.930> ddr<00:03:54.350> and<00:03:54.590> so

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
operated devices you get LP ddr and so

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.720 
operated devices you get LP ddr and so
this<00:03:55.430> this<00:03:55.820> is<00:03:56.140> again<00:03:57.140> a<00:03:57.170> volatile<00:03:57.650> memory<00:03:57.860> but

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
this this is again a volatile memory but

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.539 
this this is again a volatile memory but
the<00:03:58.910> architecture<00:03:59.660> and<00:03:59.930> the<00:04:00.250> interfaces<00:04:01.250> have

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
the architecture and the interfaces have

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.340 
the architecture and the interfaces have
been<00:04:01.760> optimized<00:04:02.269> to<00:04:02.510> reduce<00:04:03.079> power

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
been optimized to reduce power

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.280 
been optimized to reduce power

consumption so the focus there is is

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.310

basically<00:05:36.110> this<00:05:36.260> is<00:05:36.320> static<00:05:37.130> memories<00:05:37.520> often

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
basically this is static memories often

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:42.129 
basically this is static memories often
now<00:05:38.990> the<00:05:39.520> the<00:05:40.520> static<00:05:40.910> memories<00:05:41.300> will<00:05:41.810> have

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:42.139 
now the the static memories will have

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:45.310 
now the the static memories will have
two<00:05:42.860> ports<00:05:43.280> and<00:05:43.520> so<00:05:43.669> the<00:05:43.850> common<00:05:44.510> term<00:05:44.840> used<00:05:45.169> in

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
two ports and so the common term used in

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.170 
two ports and so the common term used in
the<00:05:45.440> industry<00:05:45.860> for<00:05:45.890> static<00:05:46.460> memories<00:05:46.820> is<00:05:47.030> now

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
the industry for static memories is now

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.930

QDR which means quad data rate but
basically<00:05:50.419> it<00:05:50.630> describes<00:05:51.050> a<00:05:51.290> two<00:05:51.500> port<00:05:51.710> memory

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
basically it describes a two port memory

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.190 
basically it describes a two port memory

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:56.580 
increases the this endurance factor goes

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.030 
increases the this endurance factor goes
down<00:06:56.940> and<00:06:57.660> this<00:06:57.840> is<00:06:58.020> where<00:06:58.200> the<00:06:58.320> sixth<00:06:58.620> type<00:06:58.830> of

00:06:59.030 --> 00:06:59.040 
down and this is where the sixth type of

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.030 
down and this is where the sixth type of
memory<00:06:59.940> comes<00:07:00.420> into<00:07:00.660> play<00:07:00.900> which<00:07:01.860> is

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:02.040 
memory comes into play which is

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.800 
memory comes into play which is
basically<00:07:02.460> managed<00:07:03.120> flash<00:07:03.650> or<00:07:04.880> flash<00:07:05.880> or<00:07:06.510> mass

called UHS two neither of those are
available<00:07:44.160> now<00:07:44.310> but<00:07:44.340> that<00:07:45.300> is<00:07:45.480> the<00:07:45.600> next

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:45.810 
available now but that is the next

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.050 
available now but that is the next
generation<00:07:45.870> that's<00:07:46.500> being<00:07:46.740> worked<00:07:47.040> on<00:07:47.220> so

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:48.060 
generation that's being worked on so

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.940 
generation that's being worked on so
these<00:07:48.240> are<00:07:48.420> really<00:07:48.570> the<00:07:48.780> six<00:07:49.050> basic<00:07:49.500> types<00:07:49.740> of

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:49.950 
these are really the six basic types of

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.270 
these are really the six basic types of
memory<00:07:50.280> technology<00:07:50.970> and<00:07:51.210> there<00:07:51.930> are

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:52.280 
memory technology and there are

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.620 
memory technology and there are
fundamental<00:07:53.280> changes<00:07:53.940> and<00:07:54.120> fundamental

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:54.630 
fundamental changes and fundamental

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.660 
fundamental changes and fundamental
limits<00:07:54.960> that<00:07:55.200> each<00:07:55.830> of<00:07:56.010> these<00:07:56.100> are<00:07:56.310> hitting

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:56.670 
limits that each of these are hitting

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.450 
limits that each of these are hitting
that<00:07:57.180> are<00:07:57.630> really<00:07:57.960> driving<00:07:58.320> this<00:07:58.710> this

00:07:59.450 --> 00:07:59.460 
that are really driving this this

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:08.780 
that are really driving this this
revolution<00:08:00.180> in<00:08:00.390> design<00:08:00.750> and<00:08:00.780> test

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:08.790
