00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 i 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.900
 and we are going to start making a soup of 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.430
 potatoes that makes me a saucer 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.450
 wonderful and I will tell you why the 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.880
 first because it is a source of 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.980
 very interesting carbohydrates that apart 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.439
 brings a lot of potassium to our 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.600
 body and having more potassium in our 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.090
 body because we avoid a heart attack 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.939
 we have less fluid retention 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.960
 2 the other is that we can also reduce 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.880
 any kind of disease 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.390
 cardiovascular and also if you have the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.690
 low blood pressure because 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.130
 you lower it so we're going to see the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.320
 ingredients of this recipe because I think 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.160
 that if it suits us to eat it 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.160
 We are going to use 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.120
 three tablespoons of olive oil half 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.670
 cup of sliced ​​almonds an onion 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.769
 finally chopped four peeled potatoes and 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.010
 chopped into cubes a spoonful of 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:56.260
 parsley a teaspoon of paprika two 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.960
 liters of water two tablespoons of consommé 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.780
 of powdered chicken and two boiled eggs and 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.030
 chopped into cubes or pieces or as 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.159
 you prefer and it's very easy to 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.590
 prepare this soup I tell them I repeat 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.509
 is very healthy in search all the 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.600
 ingredients so that they had the 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.070
 essential fatty acids you need 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.320
 all our veins our arteries 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.450
 so as to dilate and circulate well 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.759
 is not reserving cholesterol and on the other 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.530
 part that has a lot of potassium so that 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.800
 this potent also help then to 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.140
 decrease all kinds of filth that is 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.179
 they are sticking there until the pain 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.850
 of head remove the potassium from before 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:35.770
 now the excess potassium tache because 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.149
 then instead of reducing 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.009
 possibilities of infarction by the 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.500
 you increase that is not good but good 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.320
 a sopita why I for that reason I alleged 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.479
 the medicine is there 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.970
 and here in the food not in the pills 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.909
 to that there is that food know that if it is 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.700
 as a tablet if you if you take it well 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.650

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.660
 cholesterol which is the best example that 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.789
 I can have here at hand to hug 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.230

 the chips of more that are already cold but 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.370
 they can think super good 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.120

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.610
 leave 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.379

 cooking or cooking good I'm going to 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.870
 give anything else because I asked 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:47.480
 addressed if you boil the 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.519
 potatoes with a splash of vinegar to the 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.959
 time for the pan when they are already 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.000
 boiled instead of all being made 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.470
 as puree they are cut perfect and they remain 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.470
 well enriches pretty girls 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.790
 grandma's advice 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:06.000
 who said that the son 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.730
 well now let's add a little bit of 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.519
 parsley that is proven that two 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.569
 Spoons of parsley help to lower 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.569
 also blood pressure 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.489
 and they also help this roll of the 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.209
 Stomach discomfort from the 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.209
 intestine 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:32.550
 Now let's add the paprika 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:35.920
 powdered 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.810
 this does give flavor to everything 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.050
 so that it changes now if they find 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.850
 Factory by factory fasting seasonings 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.470
 there is a cure and this has also happened 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.540
 color that can also give you a flavor 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.860
 very rich this soup 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:54.289
 and now we are going to add 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.289
 water with water 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:01.050
 you have to pay once and for all with the 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.139
 water let's put some consomme in 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.139
 powder 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.790
 and this must be allowed to boil 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.969
 takes very well so that also the potato 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.599
 you release starch 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:12.599
 Hello 

00:05:13.299 --> 00:05:17.829
 so that the leg also releases the 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.169
 starch and then when releasing the starch 

00:05:17.829 --> 00:05:21.879
 we have in the broth stay in the 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.199
 broth that starch that is going to be very 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:25.659
 interesting for people who have 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:27.729
 diabetes because then when eating the 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:30.639
 starch us what we cause is 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:33.059
 that much more insulin is used 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:35.499
 gradually these are no longer those slumps 

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:38.259
 they're all sugar that suddenly you 

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:40.539
 they give until hallucinations come to have or 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:43.059
 they are lying on a chair 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:44.499
 who can not even walk is very 

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:46.299
 important the friend who then tell me 

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:48.879
 is that potatoes get fat because they do not 

00:05:46.299 --> 00:05:51.429
 It depends a lot how you prepare them if they are 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:53.019
 fried yes sure they keep in your 

00:05:51.429 --> 00:05:54.759
 decision of the chips or if they are of the 

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:56.649
 fries or if they will get the 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:06:00.659
 oil if it is not convenient to eat them but 

00:05:56.649 --> 00:06:02.619
 if so, the sopita I repeat potassium 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:04.839
 very important for all conditions 

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:06.429
 cardiac for all that is pressure 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:08.439
 all the blood circulation is going to 

00:06:06.429 --> 00:06:11.049
 help a good already protect at the level 

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:13.479
 caloric because it is not so much or not 

00:06:11.049 --> 00:06:15.009
 no no if they are if we are talking about 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:17.349
 carbohydrates 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:20.229
 we are talking about calories but they are 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:22.270
 calories that have a good value 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:23.619
 important in the body and apart from 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.279
 they will help us throughout the process 

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:26.559
 mental 

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:29.169
 then remember when we 

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:31.149
 we eat complex carbohydrates in addition 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:34.119
 of the contribution of fiber we will be 

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:36.669
 causing the creation of precursors of 

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:38.499
 melatonin neurotransmitter neurons 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:40.210
 will be finished pamina all this that goes to 

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:43.210
 help us to be at peace and 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:47.259
 thinking how you should connections and in what 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:49.210
 who wants my sopita that smells like 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:52.840
 the sky itself 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:55.180
 I'm going to get here to nothing that we got 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.039
 of a commercial cut and do not go 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:00.810
 because we came back with a scorpionfish 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:00.810
 Donostia we come back
