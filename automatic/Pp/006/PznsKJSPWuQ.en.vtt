00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:08.730
 how an organizer with bottles is made 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.360
 materials two plastic bottles 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.400
 the same well washed 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:19.480
 and what with a needle capotera 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:26.090
 a closure and scalpel 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:30.200
 scissors a marker a cloth and papers 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:35.960
 several first of all you have to clean 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:38.030
 the bottles then we mark with a 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.150
 line the distance by which we cut 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.550
 the bottle the area we need is the 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.070
 base of the bottle 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.750
 carefully we cut what we just 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.750
 delineate until it is like this 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:55.339
 at the edges of our bases let's say 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.190
 holes with the needle every 5 millimeters 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:00.729
 approximately until the two remain 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.729
 A) Yes 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.770
 now we take thread we insert it in the 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.040
 needle and we tie a knot to the 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.040
 final 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.290
 we take the closure and put the tip 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.370
 against one of the bottle bases 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.610
 pending that the edge that against the 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.910
 bottle and we went through the bottle for a 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.050
 hole also sewing the closure 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:28.540
 continue with the next hole 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.540
 pulling hard every time things 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.140
 So you continue to turn it around 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.290
 and 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.590
 and knots him in the end 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.390
 i 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.729
 we do the same to the other base of 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.140
 single bottle that with the missing side 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.690
 of the sky at the end the two bases are left 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.060
 joined by the closing and they already have the 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.109
 organizer 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:01.159
 you can decorate it if you want 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:01.159
 and fill it with what fits 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.540
 I danced
