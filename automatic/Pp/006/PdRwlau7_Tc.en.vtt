00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.420 
criticisms now I haven't actually had a
chance<00:03:34.600> to<00:03:34.810> play<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:35.170> game<00:03:35.350> but<00:03:35.770> I<00:03:35.980> have<00:03:36.280> been

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
chance to play the game but I have been

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.150 
chance to play the game but I have been
keeping<00:03:36.760> an<00:03:36.850> eye<00:03:36.970> on<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.600> feedback<00:03:38.050> and<00:03:38.320> the

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
keeping an eye on the feedback and the

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.800 
keeping an eye on the feedback and the
footage<00:03:39.820> of<00:03:39.940> though<00:03:40.030> there<00:03:40.240> is<00:03:40.360> of<00:03:40.540> it<00:03:40.630> online

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
footage of though there is of it online

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.380 
footage of though there is of it online
and<00:03:41.260> that<00:03:41.350> sort<00:03:41.620> of<00:03:41.680> thing<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.910> it<00:03:43.000> does<00:03:43.150> seem

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
and that sort of thing and it does seem

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.199 
and that sort of thing and it does seem
that<00:03:44.340> giving<00:03:45.340> it<00:03:45.430> a<00:03:45.459> lower<00:03:45.610> score<00:03:45.760> for<00:03:46.030> being

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
that giving it a lower score for being

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.480 
that giving it a lower score for being
buggy<00:03:46.420> is<00:03:46.720> more<00:03:47.020> than<00:03:47.140> fair<00:03:47.350> now<00:03:47.709> obviously<00:03:48.250> an

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
buggy is more than fair now obviously an

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.370 
buggy is more than fair now obviously an
MMO<00:03:48.880> is<00:03:49.270> going<00:03:49.450> to<00:03:49.540> have<00:03:49.660> to<00:03:49.810> eating<00:03:50.050> problems
