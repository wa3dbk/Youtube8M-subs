you're all tangled up because I planted

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.730 
you're all tangled up because I planted
them<00:00:21.210> probably<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.020> little<00:00:22.230> too<00:00:22.470> closely

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
them probably a little too closely

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:32.479 
them probably a little too closely
together<00:00:29.720> this<00:00:30.740> look<00:00:31.740> different<00:00:32.130> than<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.279> beet

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
together this look different than a beet

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.610 
together this look different than a beet
and<00:00:32.790> now<00:00:33.420> there's<00:00:33.660> no<00:00:33.809> feet<00:00:34.020> on<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.260> bottom<00:00:34.530> so

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
separated the lead from the beets so

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.389 
separated the lead from the beets so
this<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.350> beautiful<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.070> get<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.280> at

I'm afraid of mandolin slicer so I'm
going<00:01:29.899> to<00:01:29.990> use<00:01:30.080> the<00:01:30.470> food<00:01:31.220> processor<00:01:31.280> instead

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
going to use the food processor instead

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.999
