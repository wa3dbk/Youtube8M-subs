00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:08.370
 good in this video tutorial we are going to 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.249
 perform the installation of a rom from 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.519
 the application already having me installed 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:16.110
 on the phone the original recovery as 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.750
 difference of the original travel good 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.580
 Well, if we enter the recovery that 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.740
 we can do it by combining 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.770
 of keys or by the same application 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.680
 that there is a point is 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.900
 if when entering in recovery we see the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.120
 Android lying with admiration is 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.510
 that we have the original recovery u 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:41.540
 official and if anything else appears 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:44.810
 is that we have a modified recovery 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:48.760
 or a custom recovery in this case how 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:52.520
 it's going to be through the original recovery 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.100
 this would be a scenario similar to good 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.930
 we have received our terminal and what 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.720
 first thing we want to do is update 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:03.560
 the rom 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:07.700
 for the last official available 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.770
 china or by the latest available from 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.079
 What is it 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.200
 for this good process it makes us 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:16.759
 it is first necessary to install the application 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.030
 that we can find it in the play 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.280
 store or on the website www.cai.es in 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.649
 the download section we the 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.649
 we download the install 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.800
 we open the application recognizes us 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:37.190
 our terminal and the options of 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.200
 downloads are going to be alone or are they going to be 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.770
 exclusive for the terminal that has been 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.890
 detected good in this case we will click 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.380
 in downloads and we're going to do the 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.200
 installation of the last official round 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.100
 that there is a point is to click and we 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.100
 button to download 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.740
 once downloaded 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:05.370
 we would go to tools rooms this menu 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.630
 if you are root in the terminal 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.720
 well, it would appear 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.940
 something like this in case of not being root in 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.680
 the terminal would have options like that of 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.900
 install recovery that would not be 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.690
 available as well as restart recovery 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.540
 etcetera but good even not being 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.900
 root for the installation of a new 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.660
 the application will perform the 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.980
 process that is exactly the same as 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.200
 let's make in this video 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.200
 click on the install button rom 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.340
 in the dropdown of downloaded rounds 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.780
 we will select the rom that we have 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.740
 downloaded in this case the last 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.560
 official 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.950
 point is and the button is enabled 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.230
 install rom 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.480
 this other message or any other 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.769
 content that appears within this 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.180
 menu would not be necessary to touch 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.310
 absolutely none of them and 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.420
 directly we would proceed to press the 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.520
 Install button rom 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.250
 the application of 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.849
 update we click on the arrow that 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.680
 appears on the right asks us if that 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.569
 we are sure to continue that this 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.870
 operation can not be recovered we press 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.470
 to accept 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:25.379
 and it will automatically restart in 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.230
 recovery and start the installation of 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:30.090
 the rom we have indicated 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.400
 to know what the process is doing 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.069
 correctly or what 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.790
 I was not seeing any problem 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:43.030
 always up here in the recovery 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:46.470
 original official up here has to 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.470
 appear the progress bar 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.590
 automatically once the 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.310
 installation the phone is going to 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.890
 restart the only one was going to start the 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:02.500
 new distribution or the new rom in 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:05.020
 case that bar disappears 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.700
 halfway through the process and you see that the 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.700
 Android keeps turning 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.760
 surely or there will be some mistake or some 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:17.199
 problem with the update already 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.680
 depending on each of the 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:22.449
 terminals you access the menu or that 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.300
 information by pressing any of the 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:28.570
 buttons in this case that is an axis 4 b 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.729
 would be pressing the power button when pressing 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.280
 the power button, because they are here 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:35.289
 would go to the menu and as at this point 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.509
 would appear the error message that is 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:39.509
 giving or error that has occurred 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.240
 as I was saying 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.060
 the phone automatically restarts 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:02.069
 and start or start of 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.069
 the new rom that we have installed 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:13.190
 the first start usually 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:16.160
 Take some time because when you remove 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.530
 all 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.750
 files or all configurations 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.360
 good user then in that first 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.870
 start is when it is being generated 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:29.150
 the whole environment 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.990
 so it's available 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.990
 for the user 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:43.370
 well we can see how 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.560
 has been installed 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.620
 the new distribution 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:52.040
 with the new rom and good because 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:56.360
 we could proceed to configure 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.260
 our taste and so on and nothing else for 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.700
 keep up with all the news 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:03.700
 from jiayu we keep connected to
