00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.219
 hi all heaven heaven I hope this 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.410
 will be great today we end up 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.560
 for the following lessons to be learned at 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.050
 know either the territory of the bosses 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.100
 he wants what he 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.110
 today we will attack the lesson 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:31.250
 number 2 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:33.200
 anticipation is gone, gone 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.690
 but before launching when and the sound 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.640
 so beautiful so virtual I propose to you 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.890
 understand the beautiful subject with the word 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.570
 anticipated the green anticipate they had 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.030
 reached team anticipates divided into 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.699
 two parts for the haunted part which 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.319
 mean before second part kamerhe 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.539
 which means take one could be 

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:52.129
 preceded by taking the lead when we 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.960
 learn every day I see already 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.640
 come to your questions what is the 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.989
 report to fifa 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.769
 why are you talking to us about this and are 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.300
 very good questions 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.190
 men and women there are two types of 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.609
 defensive movements the action and the 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.049
 reaction 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.909
 the reaction is the fact of realizing a 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.350
 movement as a result of a movement 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.180
 of the opponent that is to say that there 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.440
 go right you go right for him 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.730
 do a laundry for example the 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.650
 reaction is anticipating is 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.780
 to say that we will take the lead with 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.060
 tactical moves to block the 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.890
 acer block these movements block the 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.310
 first action attacks to illustrate 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.350
 my comments 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.400
 look instead of attacking the player 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.220
 ball carrier 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.530
 I step back and I go on the solution that 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.650
 did not rest opponents in addition had 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.390
 seen right after the after this tackle we're going 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.710
 to say a little missed I fail between right 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.840
 and left and in all chosen outside 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.400
 because I had observed my opponent 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.110
 again after analyzing my 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.060
 opponent I guess he's pretty 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.650
 in a hurry who will make the game pass but the 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.780
 a little disgusting goal from there you but 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.250
 good it's more for the competition than it 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.350
 must achieve this kind of purpose 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.820
 player watching on the radar I pass 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.520
 in front of 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.590
 the player who seemed to me the most 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.970
 suitable for the pass and intercepts 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.140
 the pass 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.250
 this stimulus have to go on the 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.380
 player I'm going directly to his 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.909
 gold teammate with double speed 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.550
 hington m i get the ball 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.960
 that's also the anticipation in the 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.300
 same kind rejected on the wearer of the 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.729
 balloon I run very quickly on the 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.500
 player who will receive the pass in order to 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.880
 to pass correctly in anticipation 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.160
 are three very important points 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.200
 the first 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.580
 the observation phase indeed you 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.000
 will need to know a different minimum 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.830
 opponent 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.930
 for that you will have to observe 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.420
 analyze his game during the 15 20 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.910
 first virtual minutes of the match and 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.990
 to be able to anticipate later 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.490
 opponent's movements 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.440
 second point it's a question of 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.080
 touch indeed in of course she trt 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.450
 you have total control of your 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.760
 player and so you can cut our 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.740
 players from the player or the balloon to your 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.510
 without having a physical constraint 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.190
 and so feel stuck because of the 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.240
 computer control the third point 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.240
 it's just a question to the geometries 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.830
 this action reflects this aspect 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.930
 geometric look I get lÃ© 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.310
 balloon like that now we're going back 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.140
 back to understand why I 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.660
 get it back stop 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.400
 that's perfect so we could see it I 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.500
 stay away from the balloon port because 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.270
 if I get too close to the ball 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.980
 will pass too quickly next to me and I 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.360
 will have no opportunity for action 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.490
 while if I stay away the time that 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.360
 the ball arrives on me I will have the 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.090
 time to build buildings 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.410
 necessary to recover Walloon 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.760
 done it's just a question of angle and 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.480
 from distance but hey I'm not going 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.950
 tell me about it 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.360
 given that we are not in 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:29.280
 math class but be careful 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:29.280
 anticipation not if it's done 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.450
 at 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.349
 in short sometimes we are in phase with 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.660
 the opponent we easily guess if he 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.050
 going to go right or left right or 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.849
 to the left 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.500
 what's up or left left 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.140
 sometimes we are not there at all 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:53.310
 when you face in life sometimes 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:56.010
 it can quickly become boring life past 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.060
 in the past you will have understood this 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.280
 technical has limits 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.769
 firstly if the opponent is rather 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.319
 good rather clever in the game he goes 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.720
 see that you anticipate and so he goes 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.250
 just stop taking over 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.970
 time in his choices and so they go 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.590
 pass more easily 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.750
 secondly finally become late and go 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.760
 that meals are not calculated things 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.790
 incredible is the feeling it's 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.530
 feeling and if you get a little late 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:24.000
 and that you'll be able to hold like 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:29.160
 that and I think no one's cassette 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.290
 come video as it serves to what to say 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.330
 I screwed up sometimes I'm a little bit 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.810
 anticipation and it's in my game I 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.000
 can not do anything 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.710
 I plead guilty then after to too much 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.380
 think we play even more peter 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.280
 good perrett he's pulling who in 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:47.740
 practice by a right-hander so add 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:49.889
 but build left 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.889
 bush 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.660
 c 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.670
 ah ya but bresc the sound was there for 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.320
 tell you that playing it is the 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.850
 sometimes take a step back and 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.919
 think it's cool too 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.080
 now if you want to discover or 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:09.460
 review lesson number one you just have 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.600
 click here it's free 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:22.030
 and it's more like a video 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:26.280
 sympathetic to his list 500 times 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.280
 yeah that's right on starts so yes 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.540
 hasta la vista baby
