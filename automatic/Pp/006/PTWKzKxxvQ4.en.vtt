the<00:00:17.050> other<00:00:17.170> thing<00:00:17.410> that's<00:00:17.529> interesting<00:00:17.710> here

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160 
the other thing that's interesting here

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.670 
the other thing that's interesting here
is<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:19.390> way<00:00:19.539> we<00:00:19.689> irrigate<00:00:20.050> if<00:00:20.410> you<00:00:20.500> go<00:00:20.619> to

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680 
is the way we irrigate if you go to

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.620 
is the way we irrigate if you go to
Chile<00:00:21.039> or<00:00:21.250> Argentina<00:00:21.279> you'll<00:00:22.180> notice<00:00:22.480> that<00:00:22.570> a

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
Chile or Argentina you'll notice that a

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.720 
Chile or Argentina you'll notice that a
lot<00:00:22.720> of<00:00:22.869> the<00:00:23.020> vineyards<00:00:23.410> are<00:00:23.470> irrigated<00:00:24.039> what

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
lot of the vineyards are irrigated what

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.429 
lot of the vineyards are irrigated what
we<00:00:24.849> call<00:00:25.029> flat<00:00:25.360> irrigation<00:00:25.930> so<00:00:26.050> I'll<00:00:26.140> actually

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
we call flat irrigation so I'll actually

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.830 
we call flat irrigation so I'll actually
bring<00:00:26.800> the<00:00:27.250> water<00:00:27.550> when<00:00:28.240> it's<00:00:28.360> you<00:00:28.449> run<00:00:28.630> in<00:00:28.750> a

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
bring the water when it's you run in a

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.600 
bring the water when it's you run in a
trough<00:00:29.140> beside<00:00:29.560> the<00:00:29.710> vineyards<00:00:30.039> but<00:00:30.279> what<00:00:30.430> we

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
trough beside the vineyards but what we

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.299 
trough beside the vineyards but what we
do<00:00:30.820> here<00:00:31.210> is<00:00:31.329> where<00:00:31.930> she<00:00:32.110> run<00:00:32.290> hoses<00:00:32.860> down<00:00:32.890> by

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
do here is where she run hoses down by

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.290 
do here is where she run hoses down by
the<00:00:33.370> vine<00:00:33.670> and<00:00:33.969> we<00:00:34.750> have<00:00:34.989> little<00:00:35.440> drippers

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
the vine and we have little drippers

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.389 
the vine and we have little drippers
that<00:00:37.300> allow<00:00:37.690> the<00:00:37.750> water<00:00:38.079> to<00:00:38.200> fall<00:00:38.530> out<00:00:38.770> in<00:00:39.040> any

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
that allow the water to fall out in any

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.940 
that allow the water to fall out in any
particular<00:00:39.760> location<00:00:40.090> that<00:00:40.570> we<00:00:40.719> want<00:00:40.950> near

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
particular location that we want near

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.190 
particular location that we want near
the<00:00:42.100> vine<00:00:42.309> we<00:00:42.850> choose<00:00:43.180> not<00:00:43.480> to<00:00:43.539> put<00:00:43.899> it<00:00:43.989> right

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.200 
the vine we choose not to put it right

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.170 
the vine we choose not to put it right
on<00:00:44.350> the<00:00:44.469> base<00:00:44.649> of<00:00:44.860> the<00:00:44.950> vine<00:00:45.129> because<00:00:45.550> if<00:00:45.910> we

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
on the base of the vine because if we

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.700 
on the base of the vine because if we
put<00:00:46.210> it<00:00:46.480> right<00:00:46.629> here<00:00:46.690> we'll<00:00:47.079> find<00:00:47.379> the<00:00:47.500> roots

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
put it right here we'll find the roots

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.669 
put it right here we'll find the roots
really<00:00:48.039> develop<00:00:48.579> a<00:00:48.789> real<00:00:49.629> big<00:00:49.960> ball<00:00:50.260> around

00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:50.679 
really develop a real big ball around

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:52.380 
really develop a real big ball around
where<00:00:50.949> that<00:00:50.980> dripper<00:00:51.489> would<00:00:51.640> be<00:00:51.789> so<00:00:51.999> we<00:00:52.120> tend

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
where that dripper would be so we tend

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.899 
where that dripper would be so we tend
to<00:00:52.510> put<00:00:53.350> the<00:00:53.440> drippers<00:00:53.769> between<00:00:54.219> the<00:00:54.399> vines<00:00:54.609> so

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909 
to put the drippers between the vines so

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:56.369 
to put the drippers between the vines so
the<00:00:54.999> roots<00:00:55.210> will<00:00:55.359> actually<00:00:55.600> go<00:00:55.749> out<00:00:55.929> and<00:00:56.109> fight

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
the roots will actually go out and fight

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.049 
the roots will actually go out and fight
for<00:00:56.589> that<00:00:56.679> water<00:00:56.890> and<00:00:57.460> put<00:00:57.670> a<00:00:57.699> little<00:00:57.850> bit<00:00:57.969> more

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
for that water and put a little bit more

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.399 
for that water and put a little bit more
stress<00:00:58.449> on<00:00:58.629> them<00:00:58.780> make<00:00:58.960> them<00:00:59.079> better

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
stress on them make them better

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:01.229 
stress on them make them better
and<00:01:00.219> while<00:01:00.370> I'm<00:01:00.489> here<00:01:00.519> you'll<00:01:00.819> notice<00:01:01.120> that

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
and while I'm here you'll notice that

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.450 
and while I'm here you'll notice that
the<00:01:01.359> dirt<00:01:01.629> or<00:01:01.960> what<00:01:02.140> we<00:01:02.229> have<00:01:02.260> on<00:01:02.530> top<00:01:02.829> is<00:01:03.399> just

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
the dirt or what we have on top is just

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.360 
the dirt or what we have on top is just
little<00:01:04.360> this<00:01:05.199> is<00:01:05.350> this<00:01:05.560> is<00:01:05.710> pruning<00:01:06.040> wood<00:01:06.159> from

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
little this is this is pruning wood from

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.520 
little this is this is pruning wood from
last<00:01:06.580> year<00:01:06.909> so<00:01:07.090> we've<00:01:07.540> tend<00:01:07.750> to<00:01:07.840> mulch<00:01:08.110> that<00:01:08.380> in

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
last year so we've tend to mulch that in

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.050 
last year so we've tend to mulch that in
and<00:01:08.680> actually<00:01:08.950> brings<00:01:09.190> back<00:01:09.430> more<00:01:09.610> organic

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
and actually brings back more organic

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.180 
and actually brings back more organic
matter<00:01:10.210> you'll<00:01:10.840> also<00:01:11.020> notice<00:01:11.409> that<00:01:11.560> with<00:01:12.159> a

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
matter you'll also notice that with a

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.820 
matter you'll also notice that with a
complete<00:01:12.670> cover<00:01:13.030> of<00:01:13.270> grass<00:01:14.080> in<00:01:14.409> the<00:01:14.500> vineyard

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
complete cover of grass in the vineyard

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.649 
complete cover of grass in the vineyard
row<00:01:15.040> this<00:01:15.310> is<00:01:15.370> another<00:01:15.790> way<00:01:16.030> that<00:01:16.060> we<00:01:16.360> can<00:01:16.479> work

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
row this is another way that we can work

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.930 
row this is another way that we can work
with<00:01:16.690> sustainable<00:01:17.380> viticulture<00:01:17.979> by<00:01:18.610> allowing

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
with sustainable viticulture by allowing

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.540 
with sustainable viticulture by allowing
this<00:01:19.450> grass<00:01:19.750> to<00:01:19.990> die<00:01:20.260> off<00:01:20.470> in<00:01:20.650> the<00:01:20.680> summer<00:01:20.980> that

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
this grass to die off in the summer that

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.520 
this grass to die off in the summer that
allows<00:01:21.850> for<00:01:22.090> better<00:01:22.150> water<00:01:22.600> penetration<00:01:23.410> in

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
allows for better water penetration in

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.530 
allows for better water penetration in
the<00:01:23.560> fall<00:01:23.860> and<00:01:24.070> we<00:01:24.190> start<00:01:24.460> to<00:01:24.550> get<00:01:24.700> rain<00:01:24.940> you

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
the fall and we start to get rain you

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.370 
the fall and we start to get rain you
can<00:01:25.660> imagine<00:01:26.020> if<00:01:26.140> we<00:01:26.260> cut<00:01:26.530> we<00:01:27.390> just<00:01:28.390> all<00:01:29.050> this

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
can imagine if we cut we just all this

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.650 
can imagine if we cut we just all this
grass<00:01:29.890> matter<00:01:30.250> in<00:01:30.490> you<00:01:31.120> could<00:01:31.270> imagine<00:01:31.510> that

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
grass matter in you could imagine that

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.360 
grass matter in you could imagine that
the<00:01:31.840> humerus<00:01:32.230> layer<00:01:32.440> or<00:01:32.650> the<00:01:32.680> organic<00:01:33.190> layer

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
the humerus layer or the organic layer

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.100 
the humerus layer or the organic layer
would<00:01:33.730> gradually<00:01:34.060> start<00:01:34.390> to<00:01:34.450> get<00:01:34.600> broken<00:01:34.810> down

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
would gradually start to get broken down

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.630 
would gradually start to get broken down
and<00:01:35.380> we<00:01:35.770> wouldn't<00:01:36.010> be<00:01:36.070> able<00:01:36.130> to<00:01:36.280> get<00:01:36.400> enough

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
and we wouldn't be able to get enough

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.400 
and we wouldn't be able to get enough
water<00:01:36.850> penetration<00:01:37.450> during<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:37.930> fall<00:01:38.140> season

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
water penetration during the fall season

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.110 
water penetration during the fall season
that's<00:01:38.740> been<00:01:38.890> so<00:01:39.190> important<00:01:39.700> for<00:01:39.820> a<00:01:39.880> future

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
that's been so important for a future

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.510 
that's been so important for a future
