00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.819 

the<00:00:00.719> fourth<00:00:00.960> pattern<00:00:01.260> we're<00:00:01.410> going<00:00:01.439> to<00:00:01.650> listen

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
the fourth pattern we're going to listen

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.260 
the fourth pattern we're going to listen
to<00:00:02.010> today<00:00:02.220> is<00:00:02.280> the<00:00:02.460> shotgun<00:00:02.820> microphone

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
to today is the shotgun microphone

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.090 
to today is the shotgun microphone
pattern<00:00:03.629> this<00:00:03.990> is<00:00:04.200> much<00:00:04.410> narrower<00:00:04.770> than<00:00:04.859> the

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
pattern this is much narrower than the

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.530 
pattern this is much narrower than the
super<00:00:05.370> cardioid<00:00:05.670> cardioid<00:00:06.420> or

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
super cardioid cardioid or

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.299 
super cardioid cardioid or
omnidirectional<00:00:06.930> so<00:00:07.799> let's<00:00:07.980> hear<00:00:08.130> what<00:00:08.280> that

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
omnidirectional so let's hear what that

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.350 
omnidirectional so let's hear what that
sounds<00:00:08.429> like<00:00:10.190> on<00:00:11.190> axis<00:00:11.670> we've<00:00:11.849> got<00:00:12.059> great

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
sounds like on axis we've got great

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.780 
sounds like on axis we've got great
pickup<00:00:12.750> of<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.019> white<00:00:13.170> noise<00:00:13.340> but<00:00:14.340> as<00:00:14.460> we<00:00:14.639> move

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
pickup of the white noise but as we move

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.599 
pickup of the white noise but as we move
off<00:00:14.969> axis<00:00:15.450> we<00:00:16.350> will<00:00:16.470> notice<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.070> sound

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
off axis we will notice that the sound

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.560 
off axis we will notice that the sound
starts<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.119> drop<00:00:18.270> off<00:00:18.480> just<00:00:18.900> about<00:00:19.199> there<00:00:19.650> so

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
starts to drop off just about there so

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.470 
starts to drop off just about there so
we've<00:00:21.570> got<00:00:21.750> great<00:00:22.109> rejection<00:00:23.000> of<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.240> sound

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
we've got great rejection of the sound

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.410 
we've got great rejection of the sound
source<00:00:24.779> all<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.590> way<00:00:25.949> around<00:00:26.310> but<00:00:27.000> like<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
source all the way around but like the

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.240 
source all the way around but like the
super<00:00:27.689> cardioid<00:00:28.019> we<00:00:28.349> should<00:00:28.619> notice<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.099> little

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
super cardioid we should notice a little

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.370 
super cardioid we should notice a little
bit<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.609> high-frequency<00:00:30.029> pick<00:00:30.480> up<00:00:30.630> as<00:00:30.779> we

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
bit of a high-frequency pick up as we

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.749 
bit of a high-frequency pick up as we
get<00:00:31.470> directly<00:00:31.890> behind<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.279> microphone

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
get directly behind the microphone

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.970 
get directly behind the microphone
something<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.270> be<00:00:33.360> careful<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.809> let's<00:00:34.680> move<00:00:34.860> it

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
something to be careful of let's move it

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.040 
something to be careful of let's move it
back<00:00:35.100> around<00:00:35.309> again<00:00:36.149> great<00:00:36.390> rejection<00:00:36.870> from

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
back around again great rejection from

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.580 
back around again great rejection from
the<00:00:37.170> sides<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:38.450> once<00:00:39.450> we<00:00:39.600> get<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.809> about<00:00:40.140> here

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
the sides and once we get to about here

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.650 
the sides and once we get to about here
we<00:00:41.100> should<00:00:41.280> come<00:00:41.820> back<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.030> with<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.390> strong

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
we should come back in with a strong

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.529 
we should come back in with a strong
pickup<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.100> course<00:00:44.370> as<00:00:44.579> I've<00:00:45.120> said<00:00:45.300> every

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
pickup and of course as I've said every

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.990 
pickup and of course as I've said every
time<00:00:45.719> best<00:00:46.230> pickup<00:00:46.590> pattern<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.460> directly<00:00:47.850> in

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
time best pickup pattern is directly in

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.630 
time best pickup pattern is directly in
front<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.390> microphone<00:00:49.370> so<00:00:50.370> let's<00:00:50.520> hear

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
front of the microphone so let's hear

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.490 
front of the microphone so let's hear
what<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:50.820> sounds<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:51.210> with<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> voice<00:00:51.719> I'll

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
what that sounds like with a voice I'll

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.569 
what that sounds like with a voice I'll
stand<00:00:52.770> directly<00:00:53.160> in<00:00:53.250> front<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
stand directly in front of the

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.700 
stand directly in front of the
microphone<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.690> should<00:00:54.899> hear<00:00:54.989> great<00:00:55.379> pickup

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
microphone you should hear great pickup

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.799 
microphone you should hear great pickup
of<00:00:55.829> my<00:00:55.949> voice<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.489> as<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.090> move<00:00:57.300> around<00:00:57.420> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
of my voice and as I move around the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.810 
of my voice and as I move around the
rejection<00:00:58.260> will<00:00:58.379> start<00:00:58.649> right<00:00:58.949> about<00:00:59.280> here

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
rejection will start right about here

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.580 
rejection will start right about here
and<00:00:59.910> my<00:01:00.449> voice<00:01:00.629> will<00:01:00.840> disappear<00:01:01.289> from<00:01:01.410> this

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
and my voice will disappear from this

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:14.690 
and my voice will disappear from this
microphone<00:01:12.680> and<00:01:13.680> right<00:01:13.860> about<00:01:14.100> here<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.460> should

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
microphone and right about here I should

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.100 
microphone and right about here I should
be<00:01:14.790> moving<00:01:15.090> back<00:01:15.240> into<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.659> pattern<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.049> the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
be moving back into the pattern of the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.530 
be moving back into the pattern of the
microphone<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.799> again<00:01:17.430> great<00:01:17.640> sound<00:01:17.970> so

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
microphone and again great sound so

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.999 
microphone and again great sound so
that's<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.869> shotgun<00:01:19.290> microphone<00:01:19.770> very

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
that's the shotgun microphone very

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.909 
that's the shotgun microphone very
popular<00:01:20.460> microphone<00:01:20.909> for<00:01:21.150> filming<00:01:22.909> shotgun
