if any kind from them so you can just

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.950 
if any kind from them so you can just
lose<00:04:52.160> them<00:04:52.310> all<00:04:52.490> but<00:04:53.270> once<00:04:53.479> you<00:04:53.630> get<00:04:53.780> all<00:04:53.930> your

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
tokens which about 300 would be good I

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.200 
tokens which about 300 would be good I
have<00:04:57.260> a<00:04:57.290> hundred<00:04:57.530> and<00:04:57.680> sixty-five<00:04:58.250> but<00:04:59.180> I

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
have a hundred and sixty-five but I

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.850 
have a hundred and sixty-five but I
don't<00:04:59.479> need<00:04:59.570> to<00:04:59.720> gear<00:04:59.870> about<00:05:00.200> 300<00:05:00.620> would<00:05:00.680> be<00:05:00.830> a

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
don't need to gear about 300 would be a

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.850 
don't need to gear about 300 would be a
fluent<00:05:01.250> amount<00:05:01.520> for<00:05:02.000> each<00:05:02.090> run<00:05:02.680> actually<00:05:03.680> I

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
fluent amount for each run actually I

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.130 
fluent amount for each run actually I
think<00:05:03.979> you<00:05:04.100> get<00:05:04.220> about<00:05:04.370> 450<00:05:05.360> people<00:05:05.540> if<00:05:05.960> you

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
think you get about 450 people if you

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.230 
think you get about 450 people if you
get<00:05:06.290> the<00:05:06.380> whole<00:05:06.500> dungeon<00:05:06.770> killed<00:05:07.150> its<00:05:08.150> on

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
get the whole dungeon killed its on

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.170 
get the whole dungeon killed its on
average<00:05:08.630> but<00:05:09.530> once<00:05:10.280> you<00:05:10.400> get<00:05:10.520> all<00:05:10.700> your<00:05:10.790> tokens

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
average but once you get all your tokens

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.200 
average but once you get all your tokens
I'd<00:05:11.979> I'd<00:05:12.979> recommend<00:05:13.430> getting<00:05:13.550> a<00:05:13.700> lot<00:05:13.850> don't
