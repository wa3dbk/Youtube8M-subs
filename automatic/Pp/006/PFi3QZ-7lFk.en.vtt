00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:03.930
 to 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.000
 now how I had 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.110
 then I will teach them how to change 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.670
 the kernel of your android phone in this 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.940
 case an xperia mini pro 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.090
 what we need is the program phrases 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.090
 tool 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.480
 and obviously the kernel to flyer what 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.480
 let's do is open the flash tool 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.239
 and know where we have the kernel 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.039
 and I 'm going to leave the flash tour link 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.039
 in case you do not have it 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.930
 ok with this 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.320
 what we are going to do is give here and 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:08.180
 we flash and select the option 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.180
 fast boot the second we give ok 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.850
 will be displayed in this menu 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.670
 here 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.180
 let's connect the phone in mode 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.610
 fast boot as we connect it in fast 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.000
 boot well before connecting we press 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.640
 the volume key up they know 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.680
 upload volume we keep it and connect 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.770
 the USB cable by holding down the 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.770
 key 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.420
 obviously with the phone turned off 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.830
 sorry 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.830
 with the phone off 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:55.470
 let's connect then the phone 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:59.330
 and that will give us the blue led in the case 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.920
 of the xperia neo xperia arc and 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.880
 experience with physical buttons is the 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.550
 menu key we do not leave it but that of 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.420
 menu but in the xperia mini and xperia 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.390
 mini but the volume key up ok 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.890
 being connected tells us in fast boot 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.520
 we check that it says fast boot the blue led 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.380
 we give him then 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.240
 we select the option in the menu 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:29.110
 drop-down select kernel flash 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:32.230
 and another window will unfold 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.680
 here we are going to look for the kernel that we are going 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.680
 to flash 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.379
 here then we are going to select the 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:52.930
 phone in this case I have there 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.930
 selected many can be the kernel 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:04.069
 the beige kernel 2.8 let's open 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.349
 is going to tell us that neil and 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.470
 will quickly be raising and going to 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:11.629
 say operation ready after this the 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.500
 kernel is the flagellum we only start 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.500
 the phone and already
