it's hard to do with one hand um here's

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
it's hard to do with one hand um here's
the<00:02:26.290> RAM<00:02:26.680> slots<00:02:27.160> there's<00:02:27.580> two<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:29.350> six<00:02:29.680> or<00:02:29.860> AM

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
it when it's disabled it gives like

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.650 
it when it's disabled it gives like
weird<00:03:10.360> feedback<00:03:10.630> sounds<00:03:11.380> out<00:03:12.250> of<00:03:12.430> it<00:03:12.660> and

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
weird feedback sounds out of it and

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.140 
weird feedback sounds out of it and
here's<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:13.989> heatsink<00:03:14.640> under<00:03:15.640> this<00:03:15.820> is<00:03:16.030> the

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
here's the heatsink under this is the

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.280 
here's the heatsink under this is the
Pentium<00:03:16.510> 4<00:03:16.780> processor<00:03:17.620> and<00:03:18.720> yeah<00:03:19.780> it's<00:03:20.049> kind

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
Pentium 4 processor and yeah it's kind

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.860

miss it I don't know I didn't alright so
on<00:03:56.780> this<00:03:57.780> isn't<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.290> BIOS<00:03:58.799> version<00:03:59.250> which

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
on this isn't the BIOS version which

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.459 
on this isn't the BIOS version which
allows<00:03:59.639> you<00:03:59.939> to<00:04:00.090> move<00:04:00.359> the<00:04:00.599> mouse<00:04:00.780> this<00:04:01.079> I

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:01.469 
allows you to move the mouse this I

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:03.610 
allows you to move the mouse this I
think<00:04:01.650> that<00:04:01.950> was<00:04:02.189> introduced<00:04:02.700> in<00:04:02.969> the

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
think that was introduced in the

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.390 
think that was introduced in the
Optiplex<00:04:04.620> 330<00:04:05.749> um<00:04:06.749> so<00:04:07.469> yeah<00:04:07.620> this<00:04:07.799> is<00:04:07.950> system

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
Optiplex 330 um so yeah this is system

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.240 
Optiplex 330 um so yeah this is system
info<00:04:09.829> bios<00:04:10.829> version<00:04:11.370> is<00:04:11.989> November<00:04:12.989> 2006<00:04:13.919> I

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
info bios version is November 2006 I

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.610 
info bios version is November 2006 I
think<00:04:15.209> that<00:04:15.359> was<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:15.780> most<00:04:16.229> recent<00:04:16.650> update

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
think that was the most recent update

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.350 
think that was the most recent update
Pentium<00:04:19.620> 4<00:04:19.970> 3<00:04:20.970> gigahertz<00:04:21.289> hyper<00:04:22.289> threading

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
Pentium 4 3 gigahertz hyper threading

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.700 
Pentium 4 3 gigahertz hyper threading
and<00:04:24.360> then<00:04:24.479> 64-bit<00:04:25.320> to<00:04:25.620> make<00:04:25.800> Sukesh<00:04:27.710> 800

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
and then 64-bit to make Sukesh 800

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.140 
and then 64-bit to make Sukesh 800
megahertz<00:04:29.539> bus<00:04:30.539> speed<00:04:31.250> and<00:04:32.250> so<00:04:32.490> a<00:04:32.520> single<00:04:32.970> core

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
megahertz bus speed and so a single core

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.450 
megahertz bus speed and so a single core
it's<00:04:33.630> it's<00:04:33.870> not<00:04:34.080> really<00:04:34.380> that<00:04:34.710> gave<00:04:35.430> a

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
it's it's not really that gave a

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.550 
it's it's not really that gave a
processor<00:04:36.120> um

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
processor um

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:46.490 
processor um

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
just a memory to the gigs of ddr2 yeah

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:53.240 
just a memory to the gigs of ddr2 yeah
just<00:04:47.599> basic<00:04:48.599> bio<00:04:49.590> stuff<00:04:51.710> so<00:04:52.710> there's<00:04:53.190> a

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
just basic bio stuff so there's a

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.689 
just basic bio stuff so there's a
there's<00:04:53.610> really<00:04:53.820> a<00:04:53.940> lot<00:04:54.090> of<00:04:54.270> options<00:04:54.630> in<00:04:54.720> here
