00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
to figure out a way to make them work in

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.229 
to figure out a way to make them work in
the<00:00:39.110> game<00:00:39.320> and<00:00:39.620> we<00:00:40.309> have<00:00:40.460> a<00:00:40.489> bunch<00:00:40.910> more<00:00:41.120> stuff

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
the game and we have a bunch more stuff

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:42.549 
the game and we have a bunch more stuff
that<00:00:41.570> we're<00:00:41.660> going<00:00:41.750> to<00:00:41.809> be<00:00:41.870> doing<00:00:42.020> over<00:00:42.410> the

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
that we're going to be doing over the

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.709 
that we're going to be doing over the
course<00:00:42.649> of<00:00:42.860> the<00:00:42.920> weeks<00:00:43.180> to<00:00:44.180> make<00:00:44.329> the<00:00:44.539> game

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 
course of the weeks to make the game

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.350 
course of the weeks to make the game
more<00:00:44.750> fun<00:00:45.050> and<00:00:45.649> hopefully<00:00:46.399> move<00:00:46.940> towards<00:00:47.300> the

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
more fun and hopefully move towards the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.430 
more fun and hopefully move towards the
finished<00:00:47.629> product<00:00:48.340> ok<00:00:49.340> so<00:00:49.399> today<00:00:50.230> we<00:00:51.230> have<00:00:51.410> the

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
finished product ok so today we have the

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.160 
finished product ok so today we have the
stealth<00:00:51.920> it<00:00:52.250> doesn't<00:00:52.940> really<00:00:53.329> look<00:00:53.809> that

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
stealth it doesn't really look that

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.880 
stealth it doesn't really look that
great<00:00:54.770> because<00:00:55.100> we're<00:00:55.820> limited<00:00:56.649> there's<00:00:57.649> no

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
great because we're limited there's no

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.189 
great because we're limited there's no
way<00:00:58.070> to<00:00:58.129> make<00:00:58.399> you<00:00:58.609> crouch<00:00:59.050> except<00:01:00.050> with<00:01:00.170> the

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
way to make you crouch except with the

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.290 
way to make you crouch except with the
Kinect<00:01:00.770> and<00:01:00.980> I<00:01:01.430> don't<00:01:01.609> think<00:01:01.879> it's<00:01:02.090> going<00:01:02.239> to

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
Kinect and I don't think it's going to

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.540 
Kinect and I don't think it's going to
work<00:01:02.510> the<00:01:02.690> way<00:01:02.809> I<00:01:02.840> want<00:01:03.410> it<00:01:03.469> to<00:01:03.530> so<00:01:04.280> want<00:01:04.430> to<00:01:04.489> be

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
work the way I want it to so want to be

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.190 
work the way I want it to so want to be
able<00:01:04.610> to<00:01:04.729> move<00:01:04.850> around<00:01:05.030> while<00:01:05.570> crouching<00:01:05.899> and

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
able to move around while crouching and

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.170 
able to move around while crouching and
stuff<00:01:06.470> and<00:01:06.710> I<00:01:07.430> don't<00:01:07.610> think<00:01:07.820> that's<00:01:07.970> gonna

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
stuff and I don't think that's gonna

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.510 
stuff and I don't think that's gonna
really<00:01:08.720> happen<00:01:09.080> another<00:01:09.679> thing<00:01:09.920> is<00:01:10.190> in

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
really happen another thing is in

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.510 
really happen another thing is in
stealth<00:01:10.849> games<00:01:11.119> you<00:01:12.050> usually<00:01:12.229> turn<00:01:13.220> like

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
stealth games you usually turn like

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.050 
stealth games you usually turn like
opaque<00:01:14.030> when<00:01:14.630> you<00:01:14.869> go<00:01:15.200> into<00:01:15.319> stealth<00:01:15.649> and<00:01:16.060> the

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
opaque when you go into stealth and the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.529 
opaque when you go into stealth and the
opacity<00:01:17.709> tile<00:01:18.709> does<00:01:19.099> not<00:01:19.250> exist<00:01:19.819> so<00:01:20.209> I<00:01:20.240> cannot

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
opacity tile does not exist so I cannot

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:22.510 
opacity tile does not exist so I cannot
change<00:01:20.929> the<00:01:21.080> opacity<00:01:21.259> unless<00:01:21.890> I<00:01:22.069> just<00:01:22.280> edit

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
change the opacity unless I just edit

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.940 
change the opacity unless I just edit
the<00:01:22.610> properties<00:01:22.789> of<00:01:23.209> the<00:01:23.330> person<00:01:23.770> itself<00:01:24.770> i

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
the properties of the person itself i

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.400 
the properties of the person itself i
think<00:01:24.979> i<00:01:25.490> can<00:01:25.640> do<00:01:25.759> it<00:01:25.789> that<00:01:26.030> way<00:01:26.209> anywho<00:01:27.170> let's

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410

close and if i go into stealth which is

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.249 
close and if i go into stealth which is
by<00:01:39.979> hitting<00:01:40.250> control<00:01:40.750> there's<00:01:41.750> a<00:01:41.810> cloud<00:01:42.229> of

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
by hitting control there's a cloud of

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.550 
by hitting control there's a cloud of
smoke<00:01:42.530> and<00:01:42.920> i<00:01:43.459> turn<00:01:43.670> invisible<00:01:43.789> and<00:01:44.479> he<00:01:45.319> cannot

going to change that global stuff
boolean<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.480> true<00:02:45.960> and<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:47.730> rest<00:02:47.970> is<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.840> little

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
boolean to true and the rest is a little

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.320 
boolean to true and the rest is a little
bit<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.320> fighting<00:02:49.680> stuff<00:02:49.890> so<00:02:50.640> when<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.120> press

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
bit of fighting stuff so when you press

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.300 
bit of fighting stuff so when you press
X<00:02:51.600> you're<00:02:51.930> going<00:02:52.050> to<00:02:52.110> do<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.260> powerful<00:02:52.860> attack

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
X you're going to do a powerful attack

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.750 
X you're going to do a powerful attack
and<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:54.480> requires<00:02:54.930> your<00:02:55.470> global<00:02:56.010> stealth<00:02:56.550> to

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
and it requires your global stealth to

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.270 
and it requires your global stealth to
equal<00:02:57.060> true<00:02:57.560> you're<00:02:58.560> going<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:58.770> attack<00:02:59.040> with

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
equal true you're going to attack with

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.780 
equal true you're going to attack with
wind<00:02:59.610> up<00:02:59.880> unblockable<00:03:00.690> with<00:03:00.959> damage<00:03:01.320> 100<00:03:01.890> and

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
wind up unblockable with damage 100 and

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.550 
wind up unblockable with damage 100 and
that's<00:03:03.270> basically<00:03:03.720> going<00:03:04.020> to<00:03:04.080> one<00:03:04.260> shot

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
that's basically going to one shot

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.410 
that's basically going to one shot
whatever<00:03:05.250> you're<00:03:05.430> attacking<00:03:05.880> unless<00:03:06.239> they

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
whatever you're attacking unless they

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.990 
whatever you're attacking unless they
have<00:03:06.570> more<00:03:06.720> than<00:03:06.840> 100<00:03:06.989> health<00:03:07.430> so<00:03:08.430> once<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:08.820> do

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
have more than 100 health so once you do

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.729 
have more than 100 health so once you do
that<00:03:09.030> it's<00:03:09.360> also<00:03:09.570> going<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:09.840> switch<00:03:10.140> to<00:03:10.620> the

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
enemy equals nothing now that kind of

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.690 
enemy equals nothing now that kind of
doesn't<00:03:57.720> make<00:03:57.989> sense<00:03:58.230> because<00:03:58.769> when<00:03:59.549> it's

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
doesn't make sense because when it's

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.330 
doesn't make sense because when it's
false<00:04:00.120> is<00:04:00.980> basically<00:04:01.980> when<00:04:02.069> I'm<00:04:02.159> out<00:04:02.310> of

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
false is basically when I'm out of

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.059 
false is basically when I'm out of
stealth<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:02.939> that's<00:04:03.659> when<00:04:04.200> my<00:04:04.409> enemy<00:04:04.739> equals

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
stealth and that's when my enemy equals

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.119 
stealth and that's when my enemy equals
nothing<00:04:05.359> which<00:04:06.359> basically<00:04:07.170> means<00:04:07.590> that<00:04:07.890> he

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
nothing which basically means that he

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:09.440 
nothing which basically means that he
shouldn't<00:04:08.340> be<00:04:08.519> attacking<00:04:08.760> me<00:04:09.060> when<00:04:09.209> I'm<00:04:09.299> out

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
shouldn't be attacking me when I'm out

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.649 
shouldn't be attacking me when I'm out
of<00:04:09.480> stealth<00:04:10.310> now<00:04:11.310> something's<00:04:12.030> kind<00:04:12.180> of<00:04:12.329> funky

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 
of stealth now something's kind of funky

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:15.140 
of stealth now something's kind of funky
with<00:04:12.780> this<00:04:12.930> code<00:04:13.170> I<00:04:13.379> guess<00:04:14.340> when<00:04:14.609> I<00:04:14.639> put<00:04:14.909> the

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
with this code I guess when I put the

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.930 
with this code I guess when I put the
else<00:04:15.299> statement<00:04:15.769> that<00:04:16.769> it<00:04:17.039> basically<00:04:17.220> only

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
else statement that it basically only

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.990 
else statement that it basically only
does<00:04:18.329> that<00:04:18.859> like<00:04:19.859> it<00:04:19.979> only<00:04:20.160> makes<00:04:20.400> enemy<00:04:20.760> equal

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
does that like it only makes enemy equal

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.170 
does that like it only makes enemy equal
nothing<00:04:21.359> when<00:04:21.690> it's<00:04:21.840> actually<00:04:22.380> true<00:04:23.030> which<00:04:24.030> is

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
nothing when it's actually true which is

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.090 
nothing when it's actually true which is
kind<00:04:24.360> of<00:04:24.419> backwards<00:04:24.870> but<00:04:25.410> that's<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:25.919> way<00:04:26.070> it

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
kind of backwards but that's the way it

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.279 
kind of backwards but that's the way it
works<00:04:26.400> so<00:04:27.360> you<00:04:27.449> have<00:04:27.630> that<00:04:27.720> line<00:04:27.900> of<00:04:28.020> code<00:04:28.139> then

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
works so you have that line of code then

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:29.689 
works so you have that line of code then
you<00:04:28.350> have<00:04:28.470> else<00:04:28.710> and<00:04:29.039> then<00:04:29.190> you<00:04:29.340> have<00:04:29.520> the

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
you have else and then you have the

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:32.600 
you have else and then you have the
normal<00:04:30.050> assigning<00:04:31.050> enemy<00:04:31.440> thing<00:04:32.190> for<00:04:32.430> him<00:04:32.580> to

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
normal assigning enemy thing for him to

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.140 
normal assigning enemy thing for him to
attack<00:04:33.060> me<00:04:33.600> and<00:04:34.400> let<00:04:35.400> me<00:04:35.490> show<00:04:35.550> you<00:04:35.639> guys<00:04:35.820> one

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
attack me and let me show you guys one

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.659 
attack me and let me show you guys one
last<00:04:36.180> time<00:04:36.630> what<00:04:36.900> that<00:04:37.050> looks<00:04:37.260> like<00:04:37.460> so<00:04:38.460> he<00:04:38.580> is

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
last time what that looks like so he is

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.090 
last time what that looks like so he is
gonna<00:04:38.820> come<00:04:39.090> attack<00:04:39.479> me

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
gonna come attack me

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.060 
gonna come attack me
and<00:04:42.570> go<00:04:43.570> invisible<00:04:43.810> and<00:04:44.380> now<00:04:44.500> he<00:04:44.560> is<00:04:44.800> in<00:04:44.830> that

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
and go invisible and now he is in that

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.250 
and go invisible and now he is in that
second<00:04:45.460> stage<00:04:45.669> where<00:04:46.180> he<00:04:46.389> cannot<00:04:46.690> attack<00:04:47.050> me

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
second stage where he cannot attack me

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.190 
second stage where he cannot attack me
and<00:04:47.500> I'm<00:04:47.590> on<00:04:47.740> my<00:04:47.860> second<00:04:48.280> brain<00:04:48.550> page<00:04:49.200> well
