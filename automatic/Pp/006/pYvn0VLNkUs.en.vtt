00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
thought was a spread up pretty much a

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.560

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
better Oh today I think on you know we

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.780 
better Oh today I think on you know we
have<00:02:51.660> a<00:02:51.690> first<00:02:52.500> in<00:02:52.680> 10<00:02:52.920> first<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.430> ten<00:02:53.550> you

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
have a first in 10 first and ten you

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.160 
have a first in 10 first and ten you
know<00:02:53.880> part<00:02:54.120> of<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.240> part<00:02:54.510> of<00:02:54.540> practicing<00:02:55.050> today

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
know part of a part of practicing today

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.100 
know part of a part of practicing today
I<00:02:55.320> think<00:02:55.500> we<00:02:55.650> were<00:02:55.740> three<00:02:55.980> or<00:02:56.100> four<00:02:56.340> and

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
I think we were three or four and

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.420 
I think we were three or four and
yesterday<00:02:58.110> I<00:02:58.350> think<00:02:58.590> mine<00:02:58.740> like<00:02:58.950> two<00:02:59.100> or<00:02:59.250> four

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
yesterday I think mine like two or four

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.830 
yesterday I think mine like two or four
so<00:02:59.640> we're<00:03:00.090> just<00:03:00.120> getting<00:03:00.450> better<00:03:00.600> than

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
so we're just getting better than

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.000 
so we're just getting better than
