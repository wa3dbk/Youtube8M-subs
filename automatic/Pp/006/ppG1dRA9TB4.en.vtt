in these assassin creed games I have

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.850 
in these assassin creed games I have
another<00:02:52.360> big<00:02:52.510> fan<00:02:52.810> except<00:02:53.410> Brotherhood

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
another big fan except Brotherhood

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.500 
another big fan except Brotherhood
Brotherhood<00:02:54.550> was<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.090> only<00:02:55.180> one<00:02:55.360> that<00:02:55.390> I

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
Brotherhood was the only one that I

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.630 
Brotherhood was the only one that I
really<00:02:55.600> got<00:02:56.080> into<00:02:56.440> but<00:02:56.770> even<00:02:57.100> then<00:02:57.250> I<00:02:57.280> felt<00:02:57.580> my

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
really got into but even then I felt my

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.930 
really got into but even then I felt my
controls<00:02:58.030> could<00:02:58.870> have<00:02:58.960> been<00:02:59.080> better<00:02:59.320> and<00:02:59.680> um<00:03:00.490> a

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
controls could have been better and um a

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.730 
controls could have been better and um a
lot<00:03:01.570> of<00:03:01.720> this<00:03:01.840> story<00:03:02.110> was<00:03:02.290> a<00:03:02.320> little<00:03:02.530> bit<00:03:02.620> too

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
lot of this story was a little bit too

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.760 
lot of this story was a little bit too
convoluted<00:03:02.950> but<00:03:03.430> yeah<00:03:04.060> out<00:03:04.390> of<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:05.500> other

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
convoluted but yeah out of the other

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.650 
convoluted but yeah out of the other
assassin<00:03:06.370> creed<00:03:06.580> games<00:03:06.850> i<00:03:07.060> think<00:03:07.240> Brotherhood

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
assassin creed games i think Brotherhood

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.810 
assassin creed games i think Brotherhood
was<00:03:07.900> not<00:03:08.500> really<00:03:08.740> three<00:03:09.160> but<00:03:09.550> it<00:03:09.610> was<00:03:09.730> the

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
he asked me am I looking forward to it

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.110 
he asked me am I looking forward to it
but<00:05:37.270> now<00:05:37.360> that<00:05:37.390> it's<00:05:37.660> already<00:05:37.840> out<00:05:37.930> um<00:05:38.760> I'm<00:05:39.760> not

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
but now that it's already out um I'm not

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.529 
but now that it's already out um I'm not
really<00:05:40.180> that<00:05:40.900> far<00:05:41.169> in<00:05:41.260> Eleanor<00:05:41.710> well<00:05:42.039> maybe

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 
really that far in Eleanor well maybe

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:45.659 
really that far in Eleanor well maybe
I'd<00:05:43.539> say<00:05:43.840> I'm<00:05:43.930> pretty<00:05:43.960> far<00:05:44.470> but<00:05:44.770> not<00:05:44.950> not<00:05:45.430> too

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
I'd say I'm pretty far but not not too

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:47.580 
I'd say I'm pretty far but not not too
far<00:05:45.910> and<00:05:46.180> i<00:05:46.630> find<00:05:46.870> it<00:05:46.990> to<00:05:47.050> be<00:05:47.080> extremely

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
far and i find it to be extremely

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.090 
far and i find it to be extremely
repetitive<00:05:47.979> so<00:05:48.400> far<00:05:48.640> it's<00:05:48.850> like<00:05:49.229> every<00:05:50.229> every

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
repetitive so far it's like every every

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.490 
repetitive so far it's like every every
case<00:05:51.340> is<00:05:51.640> the<00:05:51.940> same<00:05:52.210> combination<00:05:52.990> its

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
case is the same combination its

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.870 
case is the same combination its
cutscene<00:05:54.010> crime<00:05:54.700> scene<00:05:55.030> cutscene

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
cutscene crime scene cutscene

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.870 
cutscene crime scene cutscene
interrogation<00:05:57.880> end<00:05:58.210> of<00:05:58.900> case<00:05:59.080> cutscene<00:05:59.590> and<00:05:59.880> i

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
interrogation end of case cutscene and i

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.310 
interrogation end of case cutscene and i
find<00:06:01.210> that<00:06:01.300> too<00:06:01.450> much<00:06:01.570> of<00:06:01.720> the<00:06:01.780> story<00:06:01.960> is<00:06:02.140> told

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
find that too much of the story is told

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.840 
find that too much of the story is told
through<00:06:02.470> cutscenes<00:06:02.919> not<00:06:03.220> enough<00:06:03.460> actually<00:06:03.789> in

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
through cutscenes not enough actually in

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.760 
through cutscenes not enough actually in
the<00:06:03.910> gameplay<00:06:04.360> and<00:06:04.840> I<00:06:05.110> feel<00:06:05.260> like<00:06:05.289> everything

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
the gameplay and I feel like everything

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.529 
the gameplay and I feel like everything
I<00:06:05.860> do<00:06:05.919> do<00:06:06.280> in<00:06:06.400> the<00:06:06.490> gameplay<00:06:06.880> is<00:06:07.090> just<00:06:07.300> getting

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
I do do in the gameplay is just getting

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:10.140 
I do do in the gameplay is just getting
to<00:06:07.630> me<00:06:07.750> getting<00:06:08.440> me<00:06:08.530> to<00:06:08.680> another<00:06:08.830> cutscene<00:06:09.150> so

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
to me getting me to another cutscene so

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.260 
to me getting me to another cutscene so
and<00:06:10.630> there<00:06:10.810> is<00:06:10.990> a<00:06:11.020> little<00:06:11.410> bit<00:06:11.530> too<00:06:11.680> much<00:06:11.860> GTA

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
and there is a little bit too much GTA

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.370 
and there is a little bit too much GTA
mixed<00:06:13.270> with<00:06:13.360> a<00:06:13.450> little<00:06:13.539> bit<00:06:13.780> too<00:06:13.990> much<00:06:14.140> heavy

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
mixed with a little bit too much heavy

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.400 
mixed with a little bit too much heavy
rain<00:06:14.650> wasn't<00:06:15.400> a<00:06:15.610> fan<00:06:15.789> of<00:06:15.820> GTA<00:06:16.210> 4<00:06:16.479> not<00:06:17.080> a<00:06:17.110> fan<00:06:17.380> of

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.410 
rain wasn't a fan of GTA 4 not a fan of

rain wasn't a fan of GTA 4 not a fan of
heavy<00:06:17.680> rain<00:06:17.919> so<00:06:18.550> you<00:06:18.610> take<00:06:18.850> two<00:06:19.090> games<00:06:19.330> in<00:06:19.510> it

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
heavy rain so you take two games in it

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.210 
heavy rain so you take two games in it
like<00:06:19.750> combine<00:06:20.200> them<00:06:20.320> into<00:06:20.440> one<00:06:20.530> game<00:06:20.890> you<00:06:20.919> get

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.220 
like combine them into one game you get

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.400 
like combine them into one game you get
a<00:06:21.280> game<00:06:21.490> that<00:06:21.729> I<00:06:21.940> still<00:06:22.390> don't<00:06:22.810> feel<00:06:22.900> is<00:06:23.350> that

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.410 
a game that I still don't feel is that

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.590 
a game that I still don't feel is that
