00:00:09.195 --> 00:00:12.195
Call it the rites of spring.

00:00:13.421 --> 00:00:16.811
Need a tag? Need to see your fishing licenses guys.

00:00:16.811 --> 00:00:19.087
Please... You get the right colors?

00:00:19.087 --> 00:00:21.269
Guys need tags? 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:25.403
About 5 years ago I fell in down under the 
 bridge and I was in my waders. 

00:00:25.403 --> 00:00:29.907
And my waders started filling up and I was floating down the stream 

00:00:29.907 --> 00:00:35.434
and trying to get all my stuff together and ever 
 since then my friends called me Trout... 

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:37.663
so that's my nickname... Trout.

00:00:37.663 --> 00:00:40.403
I stepped off and went clear under and came up sputtering 

00:00:40.403 --> 00:00:45.279
and a guy standing there said that's a 
 deeper hole there than it looks. (laughter)

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:47.415
Good homemade stuff here.

00:00:47.415 --> 00:00:53.034
Fell in twice last year. I fell in last year and couldn't get up.

00:01:00.883 --> 00:01:05.620
(SIREN SOUNDS - fish splashing)

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:14.397
(MUSIC)

00:01:14.397 --> 00:01:21.316
First one... drop in the bucket, go back to fishing again.

00:01:22.059 --> 00:01:24.753
This is our meeting spot every year March first. 

00:01:24.753 --> 00:01:30.279
My boss knows not to plan nothing cause I'll be gone... guaranteed. 

00:01:32.044 --> 00:01:34.087
Number two.

00:01:34.087 --> 00:01:37.384
So far so good. 

00:01:37.384 --> 00:01:41.800
He's up there with my biggest. I caught 
 one that was 26 inches long. 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.830
Yeah, pretty good. No big ones this year.

00:01:51.688 --> 00:01:55.310
I stood here for about two and a half hours waiting for the buzzer.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.910
Is it worth it? Oh, yeah.

00:02:03.112 --> 00:02:06.920
That is one good looking trout.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:59.030
(MUSIC)
