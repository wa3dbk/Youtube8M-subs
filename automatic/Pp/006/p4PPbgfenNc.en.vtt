now in order to have shared folders you

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.609 
now in order to have shared folders you
first<00:00:16.379> have<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:17.210> install<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.930> guest

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619

additions and how you get to that is

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.590 
additions and how you get to that is
that<00:00:22.140> if<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.529> don't<00:00:22.680> see<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.609> toolbar<00:00:24.119> up<00:00:24.300> top
