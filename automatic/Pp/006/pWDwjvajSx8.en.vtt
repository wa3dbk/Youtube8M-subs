00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:07.080
 Hello everyone and today I want to do 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.200
 review on real tomahawk from 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.330
 assassin's creed 3 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.870
 This is a replica of the tomahawk from assassin's 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.230
 creed 3 and 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:24.359
 he comes in such a box 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:26.369
 flag and described tomahawk Yes well looks 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:32.070
 she is so shabby 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:34.050
 I think it is not specifically because he 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.640
 I could not fuck you so rumpled 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:42.570
 I think that it was made like this 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:47.120
 only to pretend he was walking 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.890
 from a distance there, well, in general, she box 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:57.899
 only one side drawing from the other 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:58.550
 sides immediately drawing also is such 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.969
 side 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:09.479
 below let's see what's inside 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:12.170
 inside the tomahawk here he helped so he 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:18.920
 I was packed I already unpacked and therefore 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:20.850
 he lay here like that tied and by the way 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.310
 what is it 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.310
 its blades are made of stainless steel 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:33.570
 the basis of all this is made of wood 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:37.650
 here are these two pieces of suede but it's me 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:42.409
 marlin fire feathers and write in 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.409
 comments cheat feathers 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:56.670
 in fact, he is light and yet 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:02:03.659
 blade sharp i would say well donâ€™t know 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:06.049
 ok ok you can cut yourself on it 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.300
 really if needed somehow 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:16.560
 undermining it will be all very very 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:26.849
 cool on both sides to look he very 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:32.150
 cool and still looks very 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:35.780
 nothing mind is like a 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.780
 helping conor 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.070
 in my opinion he looks very cool and 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:51.920
 he is very light 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:03:02.440
 as need to be a tomahawk really 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:03:06.860
 he poked for cosplay and I am very sharp 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:10.460
 can still chop if you want 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.560
 from scaring Gopnik and all sorts of nonsense and you 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:16.340
 Of course you can walk with this instrument 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:20.320
 killing and very will whip and 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:24.050
 in my opinion nothing more to review 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:27.020
 my opinion about this tomahawks is really 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:32.060
 really looks really cool 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:36.230
 like he has no use at all 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.330
 really useless thing and it can 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.990
 buy there only over assassin's 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:45.860
 creed I don't know who else will need it 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:50.660
 perhaps nothing special about him and 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:57.020
 and I'll kill you even regretted what I gave for him 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:04:04.000
 I gave that kind of money for him 5000 something 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:04.000
 and so on that, see you soon
