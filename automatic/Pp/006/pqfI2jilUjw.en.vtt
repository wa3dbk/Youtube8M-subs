00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.419
 t 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.330
 or the one that tried the guys from youtube my 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.860
 name is the climber and good guys 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.110
 Well I have a new video in this 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.790
 case then it is the rest of level 3 for what 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.150
 that it's clear android that we need a 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.250
 emulator that is the pp is the psg havana 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.570
 is to leave here on the screen because the 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.090
 open that I do not remember and I do not want 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.440
 tell them a name mark but good 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.660
 we start with this you can see that what 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.910
 we are executing then everything totally 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.379
 good and good an advantage of this 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.080
 emulator is that you do not need many 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.480
 resources with a toÃ±i cahiers scarf and 500 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.860
 of ram will go perfectly 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.600
 mention also that if you are interested 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.270
 download this the links are going to be in 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.860
 facebook on my facebook page because 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.780
 being would be copyright since both the 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.520
 game like application where you pay the 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.220
 grab now that the game is the game 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.690
 he made her a pirate in theory and 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.159
 emulator they are paid to google play 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.570
 but you know if you want to load it 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.490
 download it from my facebook page 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.659
 there we are playing because what is 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.040
 since he lives 3 it is worth mentioning that 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.270
 buttons I have removed but more 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.560
 go ahead and mention how it is that 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.510
 they put the buttons because we can 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.610
 remove we can put them we can 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.200
 make them bigger or smaller than 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.870
 better than remembering our childhood with 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.330
 this game that the truth for me 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.370
 and is one of those that currently because 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.620
 yes it competes with some xbox games is 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.830
 sitting down obviously will not be something 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.090
 well so comparative but I mean 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.470
 here is one of the best games that you 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.750
 have previously done the 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.550
 consoles and the sound goes perfectly 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.380
 how can you see clear thinking 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.420
 cell type because it really has 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.280
 a cell phone very very low range 7 to see 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.570
 with a little bit of the but you can see if 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.700
 here we have the introduction video 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.290
 without any problem I will also 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.450
 imagine with few words how it is that 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.369
 the application is installed because I know 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.840
 that many are going to tell me today how 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.420
 configure application etc. and so on 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.070
 Well, you're just going to download the 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.780
 application and the files that I leave you 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.170
 well on the facebook page because 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.720
 inks I can leave and you're going to open it and you 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.280
 is going to put a notice that is the folder 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.590
 that I 'm going to let you put to download 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.510
 you look for beats and there is a 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.730
 file that is called billos and after you 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.650
 will ask for an iso file that is the game of 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.720
 things reside three that equally then 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.490
 when you download it, it will be there 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.160
 is a game that weighs around the 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.420
 300 and 30 megabytes do not weigh much but 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.400
 well the truth is that it comes very well 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.470
 if you like to remember all the 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.870
 Old times of what is play 1 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.850
 here we just saw the kind of video already 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.380
 I remind you that the configurations 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.970
 button configurations you 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.920
 boissier now how are they made 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.050
 well let's go let's let this 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.230
 approach because I think you 're focusing 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.000
 well there it is and good and we're going to start 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.430
 in the gameplay and we see that the sound 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.890
 is totally perfect already remembering that 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.430
 you do not need a mega cell phone kill so 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.790
 high and good that has been the problem 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.110
 Do not put the buttons visible because 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.490
 us a little bit of work to find us 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.959
 but the truth is that it did not bother me that way 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.390
 much with the forgiveness screen of 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.520
 screen but you can see that we do not have 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.860
 no any kind of luck simply 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.260
 I do not know how to get up there and we're going to 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.560
 come down again when we are going to give here 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.270
 where x would you see it and with 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.459
 that of the xbox 360 I do not remember very well 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.350
 buttons but I remember that button down 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.000
 it was x the button on the left was 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.730
 square the button on the right was 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.040
 circle and the one above was triangle 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.930
 any kind of how you can see and 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.900
 well let's go to see how it is that 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.879
 It's also worth the fluidity of the game because 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.349
 I do not have much to say either in the 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.730
 application itself and in the game because 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.709
 it's just something very, very fast that 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.739
 is installed and after this because 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.849
 it is simply the application in general 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.930
 we can see that I'm talking no 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:04.280
 kind of the repeat everything goes very very fluid 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.959
 reminding them that the download are in 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.519
 facebook if you want to download it 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.379
 because there are always people who 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.599
 the same thing mentioned here in the 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:13.040
 video and they tell me hear the downloads then 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.560
 is that there are people who only come by 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.440
 the link goes away and is a bit annoying but 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.470
 Well, I'm not saying it here, good 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.270
 Well, I think that in a matter of game 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.669
 it's all as if the options and 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.680
 we'll see what this window gives us and load 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.699
 help setup and save we have 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.960
 this window of equality that is 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:32.030
 obviously to save the game 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.070
 let's go setup and let's go 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.720
 to the system so that they see a little of my 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.190
 configurations that the truth the 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.110
 application is very very simple and is for 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.400
 what they left their application because 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.129
 there are also many emulators to play 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.929
 1 but in this case I prefer this one 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:46.580
 let's see what we have deconfiguration 

00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:49.339
 my settings like that had already 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:52.519
 said gamepad is the type that I have the 

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:54.499
 digital and I'm going to go elsewhere and here 

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:55.639
 to put the buttons of favor and the 

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:57.860
 I have found but they are very small 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.989
 because with cell is more is a bit 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.589
 big they look very small can give you 

00:04:59.989 --> 00:05:04.279
 options 

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:09.200
 again configurations ingame peace and 

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:13.190
 I'm going to give it in size I think 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.000
 I'm going to leave it that good because it's just 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.040
 in these guys 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.420
 I repeat that we see the configuration and you 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.460
 I repeat that if you want if you are interested in 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.260
 aplicas and data of android but you 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.700
 go through the facebook page and through 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.560
 my social networks there are many 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.220
 apps so good guys see you in 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.220
 the next video
