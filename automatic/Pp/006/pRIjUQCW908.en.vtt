 we are all day giving to the head 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.210
 to see what we find for you 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.189
 be useful easy to do and good for the 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.400
 pocket what we do today will go 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:22.859
 to love we are going to prepare chili powder 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.189
 or chile seasoning that is that that 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.480
 seasoning that gives that special flavor to 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.730
 all the dishes of the tex-mex kitchen 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.890
 that you like them as much as they can be 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.750
 fajitas the tacos the chile con carne and 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.330
 good all the meats in general about 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.520
 all the barbecue are going to do the 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.560
 style of hearts hearts was the Lord who 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.600
 he prepared it for the first time there by texas 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.210
 a long time ago and it is one of the 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.610
 brands plus the preferred one the more so 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.120
 say important you can buy it in 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.550
 the stores but it is but you know it is 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.530
 a little more expensive than homemade and 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.240
 It is also not easy to find in 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.430
 according to which cities and what country is 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.870
 that we are going to prepare it here in our 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.119
 house to be able to enjoy it when 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.060
 we want to agree forward here they are 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.240
 the ingredients 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.360
 two tablespoons of garlic powder two 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.329
 tablespoons of ground cumin a 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.119
 spoonful of ground cayenne osea paprika 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:24.080
 spicy a spoonful of ground paprika 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:28.009
 that is a sweet paprika and a spoonful 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:31.100
 of ground oregano that's all that 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.289
 we need nothing else it seems easy 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.720
 Nothing seems easier to me 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:38.689
 because we're going to start mixing the 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.520
 ingredients in a container where the 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.520
 we can go well shaken 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.980
 you can also mix it on a plate 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.910
 with a fork but it takes more time 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:55.650
 and I would swear that the mixture is not 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.200
 equally homogeneous 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:02.520
 now we put the cap to him so that 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:07.560
 is tightly closed and has to choose rhythm 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:11.430
 of rock rhythm of salsa or if you are like that more 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.080
 romantic bossanova rhythm and inside 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.700
 of a little bit of bossa nova and the music 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:20.940
 your favorite one we already have to see if already 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.860
 We have our chile seasonings or 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.860
 chili powder prepared 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.190
 well what are you two now 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.680
 alternatives one of them is to save it 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.570
 as it is and the other one that I suppose 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.550
 what you have decided to do is 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.620
 move it to a smaller pot 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.800
 like that for example not one of those from 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.140
 normal spices and well closed and 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.210
 tight you will like it like any 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.340
 another species or that the cabinet of the 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.120
 species and that they get along well with 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.460
 others 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.460
 I hope you enjoy it until later
