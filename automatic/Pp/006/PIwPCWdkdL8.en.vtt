00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
easier than the zagg you don't even have

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.630 
easier than the zagg you don't even have
to<00:01:03.840> spray<00:01:04.199> anything<00:01:04.439> on<00:01:04.769> these<00:01:04.949> just<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.460> put

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
to spray anything on these just to put

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.060

them<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:05.909> there<00:01:06.810> really<00:01:07.080> easy<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.040> can

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
them on there really easy and you can

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.740 
them on there really easy and you can
actually<00:01:08.340> take<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.850> off<00:01:09.000> multiple<00:01:09.479> times

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
actually take it off multiple times

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.800 
actually take it off multiple times
without<00:01:10.229> screwing<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.220> screen<00:01:11.610> shield<00:01:11.820> up

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
without screwing the screen shield up

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.230 
without screwing the screen shield up
before<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.979> know<00:01:14.100> make<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.549> perfect<00:01:15.030> and
