00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.000
We are with Opel Astra Sedan. 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The Astra rejoined the 1.6-liter diesel engine that has been hotly anticipated for a long time. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Let's see if the 136 HP engine that has been launched as the most powerful of its class will be able to thrive under the Astra's bonnet? 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Let's analyze it together...

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The design of the Astra Sedan that has been introduced in 2012 is similar to its Hatchback brother when viewed from the front. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The descending roof after the B column and the sedan form construction gives the car an appearance of demure. 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.000
The boot of the Astra Sedan, as you can guess, is bigger than the boot of the Hatchback.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The Hatchback offers 370-liter of loading capacity. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The Sedan offers 130-liter more; in other words the Sedan has 500-liter capacity. 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
But there is something here I don't like. 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You can open the boot of the Hatchback by pressing the logo but this application is non-existent in the Sedan. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000
To be able to reach inside the boot of the Sedan you either press the button on the center console or hold down the boot button on the key like this. 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.000
The interior of the Astra like its boot possesses enough spaciousness to satisfy the sedan customers. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Here, good knee room and headroom is offered. 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
But there is a small hitch here, the seat for the third person is situated a bit high and as the transmission tunnel is also a bit thick, 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I can't say that an adult can sit here in comfort. 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.000
I'm driving the Astra Sedan now. 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The Astra Sedan is similar to its Hatchback brother in the interior as in the exterior. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The Opel didn't change anything in its style of design. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The displays are legible but I don't think they have a modern design.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The multimedia's controls look a bit crowded but to get used to it and to utilize it is no problem. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The A/C controls can also be used easily. 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.500
For your small items there are lots of places in front and behind the gear knob and inside the armrest. 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I have told you that the living space in the rear is roomy and there is no problem in the front as well. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
You can execute comfortable and easy driving here. 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.000
Let's review the diesel engine of the Astra. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The diesel Astra's used to be sold only with 1.3-liter and 1.7 liter power units.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
1.3's performance for some people was considered weak. 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
1.7 due to tax disadvantages was not a logical choice.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.000
But now this 1.6-liter diesel engine, which develops 136 HP and 320 Nm of torque, has very challenging figures.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.500
For that matter due to these figures the Astra gains the title of the most powerful diesel of this class. 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
So much so that even the 1.6-liter diesel engine reformed by the Renault-Nissan alliance develops 130 HP.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
In other words it is 6 HP more powerful that even that. 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Well then, do the figures always enough to satisfy? 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Let me tell you this; if you don't drop under 1500 rpm this engine offers you very good traction no matter in which gear you drive. 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
For instance at the moment I'm at 3000 rpm and in 4th gear, I accelerate and it gives me a very good performance. 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I changed to 5th gear at 4000 rpm and driving at 150 km/h.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000
When I press the gas pedal the reaction I get is the feeling of how high the torque is. 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
So the subject of performance surely has been clarified.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Let me mention what kind of character this car exhibits in the matter of frugality.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I have been driving this car for 5 days and covered 260 km. 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
The trip computer shows me 6.8-liter fuel consumption average value.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Of course this is not a very low consumption value. 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
But when you consider the driving conditions, the power of the engine and its performance I think it is an acceptable good value. 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:52.000
In my opinion the Astra's suspensions are good. It absorbs the impacts well and do not produce noise. 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:02.000
The steering's weight balance is not bad, I like it, but it does not react fast to the commands you give therefore I can call it a bit sluggish.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
The Astra Sedan with 136 HP diesel engine is the holder of the ruling title of this class. 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
In the subject of performance and comfort it is good enough to make its owner happy. 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:23.000
But it has one disadvantage; as you know in our country the most desirable combination is diesel engine and automatic gearbox. 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
But unfortunately the Astra can only offer this engine with a manual gearbox.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
See you...
