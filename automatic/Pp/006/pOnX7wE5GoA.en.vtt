Hello, my name is Irina Damnjanovic and I'll present you my flipped classroom.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.500
Some call it inverted classroom, too.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.960
In order to understand flipped let's see what is usually meant by traditional

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:17.240
On the first place it is lecture. Delivering information   to the students with more or less interaction included.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:28.880
What is left for homework is exercise or learning how to retell the text book.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.720
With flipped learning things are quite different and we do not  retell the text book.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.040
Live lecture becomes video lecture which is being watched at home. It'is something similar to what you are watching right now.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.240
During class period, now we have time for plenty of activities that position student in the center of learning.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.760
This concept that is well known as flipped classroom, flipped learning or inverted learning.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.080
As I already mentioned video lecture is similar to this one.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.080
And what are the advantages of using it?

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:06.480
First advantage is that student can watch a video lecture when he wishes to, when he is focused on the topic.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.160
Second one is that this lecture lasts less.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.560
For a typical one class period lecture  a 5 to 10 minute video can do.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.680
So , I can pause the teacher! I can stop the  teacher!  I can rewind. I can replay.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.480
And these are absolutely impossible with live lecture.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:32.040
And above all it's fun! YouTube is the media kids are familiar with.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.920
What ever it may seem to us, let' use is for a good cause.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.600
What was it like at the beginning?

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.080
I used to send an email with a link and some questions to my students.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.960
Then, later  when students get used to it...

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.060
...instead of answering questions they are expected to write a short summary,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.040
and post a question of their own.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.120
Just to assure you that I am not the one who made this all up,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.840
the flipped learning concept is well know world wide and this is my certificate for it.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.800
All this opens new approaches to teaching and learning.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:28.080
And that is learning that combines face to face, online, collaborative and self paced learning.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.600
And then we have blended learning which we are heading to.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.760
So at the end, let me welcome you to my flipped classroom.
