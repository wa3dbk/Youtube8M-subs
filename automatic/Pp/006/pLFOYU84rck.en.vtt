different colors look a little bit like

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.199 
different colors look a little bit like
an<00:02:14.290> ipod<00:02:14.560> touch<00:02:14.680> 5th<00:02:14.890> generation<00:02:15.180> but<00:02:16.180> a

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
an ipod touch 5th generation but a

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.150 
an ipod touch 5th generation but a
little<00:02:16.450> bit<00:02:16.540> thicker<00:02:16.750> with<00:02:17.440> a<00:02:17.470> plastic<00:02:17.739> back

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
little bit thicker with a plastic back

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.400 
little bit thicker with a plastic back
and<00:02:18.520> so<00:02:19.000> of<00:02:19.120> course<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.510> touch<00:02:19.930> doesn't<00:02:20.110> have

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
and so of course the touch doesn't have

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.020 
and so of course the touch doesn't have
that<00:02:20.560> but<00:02:20.739> that's<00:02:21.580> going<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:21.880> be<00:02:21.940> interesting

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
that but that's going to be interesting
