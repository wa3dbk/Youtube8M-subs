some bubbling but was seemingly out of
nowhere<00:01:18.250> this<00:01:19.250> happened<00:01:19.580> a<00:01:19.640> few<00:01:19.670> years<00:01:19.880> after

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250

restoration<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.630> first<00:02:41.900> thing<00:02:42.170> that<00:02:42.410> the

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
restoration the first thing that the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.050 
restoration the first thing that the
first<00:02:42.830> problem<00:02:43.220> that<00:02:43.310> I'm<00:02:43.400> tackling<00:02:43.760> you<00:02:43.910> can

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
first problem that I'm tackling you can

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.559 
first problem that I'm tackling you can
probably<00:02:44.240> see<00:02:44.480> right<00:02:44.630> here<00:02:44.780> is<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.050> qaol<00:02:45.230> qaol

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
probably see right here is the qaol qaol

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.660 
probably see right here is the qaol qaol
did<00:02:47.569> leak<00:02:47.810> it's<00:02:48.680> leaked<00:02:48.890> ever<00:02:49.099> since<00:02:49.370> I've<00:02:49.520> had

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
did leak it's leaked ever since I've had

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.200 
did leak it's leaked ever since I've had
it<00:02:50.350> and<00:02:51.350> I'm<00:02:51.860> in<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.010> process<00:02:52.190> of<00:02:52.550> removing<00:02:52.910> it

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
it and I'm in the process of removing it

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.449 
it and I'm in the process of removing it
but

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
but

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.309 
but
whoever<00:02:54.909> this<00:02:55.329> car<00:02:55.569> this<00:02:55.810> call<00:02:56.019> has<00:02:56.170> been

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
whoever this car this call has been

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.410 
whoever this car this call has been
repaired<00:02:56.680> before<00:02:57.159> and<00:02:57.430> you<00:02:57.819> can<00:02:57.970> see<00:02:58.180> there's

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
repaired before and you can see there's

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.750 
repaired before and you can see there's
some<00:02:59.159> was<00:03:00.159> a<00:03:00.189> lot<00:03:00.430> of<00:03:00.459> brass<00:03:00.790> in<00:03:01.090> there<00:03:01.329> and

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
some was a lot of brass in there and

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.030 
some was a lot of brass in there and
whoever<00:03:03.760> did<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.060> repair<00:03:04.420> before<00:03:05.040> basically

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
whoever did the repair before basically

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.910 
whoever did the repair before basically
uh<00:03:06.870> it's<00:03:07.870> kind<00:03:08.079> of<00:03:08.110> hard<00:03:08.260> to<00:03:08.349> see<00:03:08.530> on<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.799> video

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
uh it's kind of hard to see on the video

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.860 
uh it's kind of hard to see on the video
but<00:03:09.900> seal<00:03:10.900> this<00:03:11.230> seam<00:03:11.620> between<00:03:12.549> the<00:03:12.819> cowl<00:03:13.599> and

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
but seal this seam between the cowl and

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.059 
but seal this seam between the cowl and
the<00:03:14.049> dashboard<00:03:14.950> steel<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:16.120> I<00:03:16.810> have<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.620> go<00:03:17.769> try

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
the dashboard steel and I have to go try

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.399 
the dashboard steel and I have to go try
to<00:03:18.099> cut<00:03:18.519> between<00:03:18.790> those<00:03:19.180> two<00:03:19.359> pieces<00:03:19.720> of<00:03:19.750> steel

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 
to cut between those two pieces of steel

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.920 
to cut between those two pieces of steel
which<00:03:20.769> is<00:03:20.879> next<00:03:21.879> to<00:03:21.970> impossible<00:03:22.000> you<00:03:22.659> probably

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
which is next to impossible you probably

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:31.349 
which is next to impossible you probably
see<00:03:23.109> it<00:03:23.200> pretty<00:03:23.379> well<00:03:29.879> you<00:03:30.879> see<00:03:31.030> that<00:03:31.209> right

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
see it pretty well you see that right

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.360 
see it pretty well you see that right
there<00:03:31.440> where<00:03:32.440> that's<00:03:32.590> nice<00:03:32.799> and<00:03:33.010> thick<00:03:33.040> that's

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
there where that's nice and thick that's

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.199 
there where that's nice and thick that's
because<00:03:33.760> they<00:03:34.590> welded<00:03:35.590> the<00:03:35.799> end<00:03:36.220> seam<00:03:36.819> instead

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
because they welded the end seam instead

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.490 
because they welded the end seam instead
of<00:03:37.299> just<00:03:37.420> doing<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.690> spot<00:03:37.959> welds<00:03:38.290> like<00:03:38.409> the

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
of just doing the spot welds like the

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.920 
of just doing the spot welds like the
factory<00:03:38.799> did<00:03:38.980> so<00:03:39.310> I<00:03:39.609> got<00:03:40.180> a<00:03:40.209> lot<00:03:40.359> of<00:03:40.480> cutting<00:03:40.720> to

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
factory did so I got a lot of cutting to

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.069 
factory did so I got a lot of cutting to
do<00:03:41.049> on<00:03:41.170> this<00:03:41.319> cowl<00:03:45.629> got<00:03:46.629> the<00:03:46.720> motor<00:03:46.900> out

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
do on this cowl got the motor out

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.750 
do on this cowl got the motor out
obviously<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.680> transmission<00:03:47.859> still<00:03:48.489> in<00:03:48.609> the

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
obviously the transmission still in the

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.220 
obviously the transmission still in the
exhaust<00:03:49.060> is<00:03:49.269> still<00:03:49.450> in<00:03:49.540> all<00:03:49.720> that's<00:03:49.930> coming

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
exhaust is still in all that's coming

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.369 
exhaust is still in all that's coming
out<00:03:50.700> gonna<00:03:51.700> redo<00:03:52.000> this<00:03:52.209> entire<00:03:52.420> firewall

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
out gonna redo this entire firewall

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.720 
out gonna redo this entire firewall
primer<00:03:54.280> paint<00:03:54.730> make<00:03:55.689> it<00:03:55.840> nice<00:03:56.019> I<00:03:56.430> want<00:03:57.430> to<00:03:57.489> redo

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
primer paint make it nice I want to redo

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.349 
primer paint make it nice I want to redo
the<00:03:57.909> entire<00:03:58.180> underneath<00:03:58.690> of<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:58.900> car<00:04:00.150> it's<00:04:01.150> in

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
the entire underneath of the car it's in

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.599 
the entire underneath of the car it's in
relatives<00:04:01.840> relatively<00:04:02.530> rust<00:04:02.739> free<00:04:02.980> just<00:04:03.459> some

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
relatives relatively rust free just some

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:04.830 
relatives relatively rust free just some
surface<00:04:03.970> rust<00:04:04.150> here<00:04:04.359> and<00:04:04.510> there<00:04:04.629> you<00:04:04.750> can

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
surface rust here and there you can

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.300 
surface rust here and there you can
probably<00:04:04.989> see<00:04:05.169> some<00:04:05.379> surface<00:04:05.739> rust<00:04:05.949> right<00:04:06.160> in

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
probably see some surface rust right in

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.110 
probably see some surface rust right in
here<00:04:06.629> but<00:04:07.629> none<00:04:07.840> of<00:04:07.870> that<00:04:07.959> is<00:04:08.199> true<00:04:08.230> so<00:04:08.859> I<00:04:08.889> think

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
here but none of that is true so I think

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.369 
here but none of that is true so I think
there's<00:04:10.120> gonna<00:04:10.269> be<00:04:10.359> very<00:04:10.659> little<00:04:11.019> steel<00:04:11.230> that

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 
there's gonna be very little steel that

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:13.170 
there's gonna be very little steel that
I<00:04:11.440> have<00:04:11.560> to<00:04:11.680> replace<00:04:11.919> which<00:04:12.549> is<00:04:12.730> a<00:04:12.760> very<00:04:13.120> good

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
I have to replace which is a very good

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.270 
I have to replace which is a very good
thing<00:04:15.239> and<00:04:16.239> underneath<00:04:16.989> it's<00:04:17.229> it's<00:04:17.919> seriously

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
thing and underneath it's it's seriously

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.710 
thing and underneath it's it's seriously
almost<00:04:18.549> spotless<00:04:18.909> I<00:04:19.209> wish<00:04:19.329> I<00:04:19.419> could<00:04:19.539> show<00:04:19.690> you

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
almost spotless I wish I could show you

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.750 
almost spotless I wish I could show you
with<00:04:20.260> the<00:04:20.380> camera<00:04:20.409> here<00:04:20.889> but<00:04:21.159> I<00:04:21.370> think<00:04:21.579> that

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
with the camera here but I think that

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.350 
with the camera here but I think that
might<00:04:22.030> be<00:04:22.150> a<00:04:22.180> bad<00:04:22.360> idea<00:04:23.550> in<00:04:24.550> tears<00:04:24.849> not<00:04:25.060> bad<00:04:25.330> I

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
might be a bad idea in tears not bad I

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.909 
might be a bad idea in tears not bad I
think<00:04:25.870> I'll<00:04:25.990> probably<00:04:26.139> try<00:04:27.099> to<00:04:28.169> rescue<00:04:29.169> that

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.260 

I'm<00:04:32.919> gonna<00:04:33.070> repaint<00:04:33.490> the<00:04:33.669> entire<00:04:33.970> interior

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
I'm gonna repaint the entire interior

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.000 
I'm gonna repaint the entire interior
and<00:04:34.510> I<00:04:34.539> will<00:04:34.750> need<00:04:34.930> new<00:04:35.050> door<00:04:35.349> panels<00:04:35.740> because

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
and I will need new door panels because

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.890 
and I will need new door panels because
when<00:04:36.190> I<00:04:36.250> was<00:04:36.370> a<00:04:36.400> young<00:04:36.639> and<00:04:36.849> I<00:04:36.909> put<00:04:37.180> those

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
when I was a young and I put those

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.710 
when I was a young and I put those
little<00:04:38.139> speakers<00:04:38.680> in<00:04:39.370> that's<00:04:39.639> in<00:04:40.060> the<00:04:40.240> side

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
little speakers in that's in the side

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.620 
little speakers in that's in the side
panels<00:04:41.139> which<00:04:41.260> was<00:04:41.440> kind<00:04:41.650> of<00:04:41.710> dumb<00:04:42.270> it<00:04:43.270> sounded

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
panels which was kind of dumb it sounded

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.460 
panels which was kind of dumb it sounded
good<00:04:43.750> but<00:04:43.860> what<00:04:44.860> can<00:04:44.949> I<00:04:45.039> say<00:04:45.220> I<00:04:45.250> was<00:04:45.400> young<00:04:45.639> I

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
good but what can I say I was young I

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.600 
good but what can I say I was young I
might<00:04:47.470> need<00:04:47.620> to<00:04:47.710> pick<00:04:47.860> myself<00:04:48.039> up<00:04:48.370> a<00:04:48.490> new

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
might need to pick myself up a new
