00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.439
 aqua ford welcomes you to 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.140
 modern world 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.000
 drinking water is very rarely clean 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.070
 for this reason we are forced 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.789
 use different input tools 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.410
 cleaning the most modern methods 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.570
 water purification is reverse osmosis 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.699
 reverse osmosis is a filtration method under 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.460
 pressure through a special membrane 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:41.690
 permeable to water molecules and completely 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.489
 solute retention 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.760
 using reverse osmosis allows 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.510
 purify water from all harmful impurities 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.049
 bacteria and viruses 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.479
 and also they have chat and so practically 

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:56.360
 the perfect way to purify water widely 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.440
 used in the modern world 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.049
 modern technology allowed 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.600
 reduce the size and cost of the membrane 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:05.850
 so much so that reverse osmosis has become 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.340
 available not only in industry but also 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.259
 on the usual kitchen 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.700
 however traditional household membrane 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.130
 filters have a number of significant 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.450
 deficiencies 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.700
 have to use cumulative 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.219
 clean water tank 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.939
 superior pressure filter itself 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:23.100
 plumbing 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.560
 must be at least three and a half 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.439
 atmospheres a lot of water 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.420
 drains into the sewer 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.619
 plenty of control valves and tubes 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.759
 makes a filter 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.890
 very cumbersome so is there a way out 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.759
 aquaphor presents 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.159
 reverse osmosis water purifier 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.359
 new generation innovation system 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.319
 water treatment 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:47.030
 Aquaphor Morion is different from ordinary 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:49.499
 reverse osmosis filters 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.069
 highly efficient automation system and 

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:54.899
 cumulative capacity of the new type 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:56.969
 the main difference between aquaphor morion and 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.280
 conventional systems consists of a special 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.430
 storage tank designs 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.470
 ordinary tank has two cavities 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.940
 separated by an elastic partition 1 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.990
 clean water cavity 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.050
 the other is airtight 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:15.150
 when the tank is filled, the air is compressed 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.660
 if you open the tap clean compressed 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.220
 the air pushes the stored water into 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.830
 filter tank aquafor 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.080
 the volume is divided by an elastic partition 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.010
 on two cavities accumulative and 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.040
 manager 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.320
 in the accumulator is clean water 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.530
 control cavity through the block 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.540
 automation connected to the water supply in 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.150
 clean water filter time 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.840
 fills the cumulative cavity displacing 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.640
 the water from the manager at 3 our when opening 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.950
 tap tap water starts 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.489
 enter the control cavity and 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.380
 pushes clean water in the usual 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.420
 back osmotic filter when 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.209
 maximum accumulative 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.830
 one third of the tank is air that 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.380
 leads to an increase in size 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:06.209
 enter water tanks system Aquaphor 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:08.489
 morion the whole volume is occupied by clean water by 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.829
 as far as water pressure is normal 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.440
 accumulative tank grows leading to 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.570
 system efficiency drop rate 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.600
 filtering falls a quantity 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.760
 discharged water drainage grows in case 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.390
 input water tank system Aquaphor 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.180
 morion 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.340
 water from the control cavity does not drain 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.590
 creating backpressure while doing 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.980
 tank filling speed remains 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.209
 constantly high why do you choose 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.269
 aquaphor morion 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:39.000
 compact aquaphor morion takes in 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.489
 three times less space in the kitchen while 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.660
 set of 1 liter of clean water system 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:47.280
 Akvafor Morion 10 minutes normal 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.890
 reverse osmosis system 20 minutes 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.190
 water consumption per liter 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:56.020
 clean water Akvafor Morion 5 liters 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.480
 10 liters standard system 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.360
 while saving water up to 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.850
 nine tons per year thanks to less 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.190
 load on the block when filtering term 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.650
 membrane service and filter modules 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.720
 Aquaphor Morion 2 times more 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.820
 and maintenance costs doubled 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.060
 less than for a regular system 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.680
 minimum water pressure in the water pipe 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.470
 necessary for the operation of the aquaphor system 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.630
 Morion and a half atmosphere for work 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.840
 conventional systems three and a half atmospheres 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.930
 and the amount of accumulated water in the tank aquaphor 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.540
 Morion is always at least five liters and 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.310
 conventional system depends on the pressure in 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.740
 plumbing 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.890
