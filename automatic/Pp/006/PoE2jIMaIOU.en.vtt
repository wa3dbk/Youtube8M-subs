yet no damn to help it yeah there there
we<00:04:35.130> go<00:04:35.389> so<00:04:36.389> you<00:04:36.479> can<00:04:36.600> play<00:04:36.780> like<00:04:36.930> that<00:04:37.139> pig<00:04:37.910> it's

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
we go so you can play like that pig it's

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.300 
we go so you can play like that pig it's
really<00:04:39.240> difficult<00:04:39.419> and<00:04:39.930> like<00:04:40.560> you<00:04:40.800> just<00:04:41.009> ain't

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
really difficult and like you just ain't

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.990 
really difficult and like you just ain't
prego<00:04:41.759> about<00:04:42.300> it<00:04:42.449> too<00:04:42.600> much<00:04:42.630> and<00:04:43.310> I<00:04:44.310> guess<00:04:44.639> the

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
prego about it too much and I guess the

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.180 
prego about it too much and I guess the
best<00:04:45.150> way<00:04:45.360> is<00:04:45.539> to<00:04:45.570> put<00:04:46.050> in<00:04:46.169> your<00:04:46.229> mouth<00:04:46.350> that's

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
best way is to put in your mouth that's

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.659 
best way is to put in your mouth that's
the<00:04:47.310> most<00:04:47.430> efficient<00:04:47.880> way<00:04:49.280> isn't<00:04:50.280> always<00:04:50.490> a

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
the most efficient way isn't always a

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.279 
the most efficient way isn't always a
solution<00:04:50.940> put<00:04:51.300> it<00:04:51.360> in<00:04:51.449> your<00:04:51.509> mouth<00:04:51.630> putting
