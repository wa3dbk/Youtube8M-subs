conference<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:08.970> between<00:02:09.300> Sony<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.989> Microsoft

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
conference is between Sony and Microsoft

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.880 
conference is between Sony and Microsoft
they<00:02:11.489> were<00:02:11.550> fairly<00:02:11.910> interchangeable<00:02:12.720> I

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
they were fairly interchangeable I

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.700 
they were fairly interchangeable I
think<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.490> Microsoft<00:02:15.440> played<00:02:16.440> their

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
think that Microsoft played their

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.350 
think that Microsoft played their
conference<00:02:17.220> a<00:02:17.280> little<00:02:17.550> bit<00:02:17.670> safer<00:02:18.209> I

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
conference a little bit safer I

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.070 
conference a little bit safer I
mentioned<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:18.930> in<00:02:19.140> my<00:02:19.319> analysis<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.370> the

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
mentioned that in my analysis of the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.210 
mentioned that in my analysis of the
microsoft<00:02:22.080> press<00:02:22.260> conference<00:02:22.770> I<00:02:22.890> think<00:02:23.160> that

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
microsoft press conference I think that

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.770 
microsoft press conference I think that
they<00:02:23.400> played<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.819> lot<00:02:23.970> safer<00:02:24.450> than<00:02:24.480> maybe

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
they played it a lot safer than maybe

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.920 
they played it a lot safer than maybe
what<00:02:24.930> they<00:02:25.170> could<00:02:25.470> have<00:02:25.880> and<00:02:26.880> I<00:02:27.030> was<00:02:27.180> kind<00:02:27.840> of

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
what they could have and I was kind of

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.870 
what they could have and I was kind of
hoping<00:02:28.020> for<00:02:28.470> a<00:02:28.530> few<00:02:28.860> larger<00:02:29.250> announcements

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
hoping for a few larger announcements

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.640 
hoping for a few larger announcements
like<00:02:30.090> surprise<00:02:30.600> announcements<00:02:31.080> from<00:02:31.350> both

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
like surprise announcements from both

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.550 
like surprise announcements from both
teams<00:02:31.950> i<00:02:32.340> don't<00:02:32.550> feel<00:02:32.730> I've<00:02:33.090> of<00:02:33.360> team<00:02:33.600> popped

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
teams i don't feel I've of team popped

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.610 
teams i don't feel I've of team popped
in<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.010> said<00:02:35.250> hey<00:02:35.570> this<00:02:36.570> is<00:02:36.780> surprising<00:02:37.410> so<00:02:37.590> I

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
in and said hey this is surprising so I

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.550 
in and said hey this is surprising so I
don't<00:02:37.890> think<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.340> necessarily<00:02:39.320> any<00:02:40.320> way

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
don't think that necessarily any way

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.860 
don't think that necessarily any way

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
patterns based upon III I think that

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.890 
patterns based upon III I think that
pretty<00:02:49.709> much<00:02:49.910> apart<00:02:50.910> from<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.150> few<00:02:51.180> surprises

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
that extra level now obviously there are

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.550 
that extra level now obviously there are
certain<00:03:54.120> limits<00:03:54.480> of<00:03:54.690> what<00:03:54.840> you<00:03:54.959> can<00:03:55.110> do<00:03:55.320> when

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
you're basically upscaling in the game

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.020 
you're basically upscaling in the game

microsoft and nintendo customers being
lured<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:15.390> the<00:04:15.420> sony<00:04:15.840> side<00:04:16.200> I<00:04:16.579> think<00:04:17.579> that's

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
lured to the sony side I think that's

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.140 
lured to the sony side I think that's
kind<00:04:18.060> of<00:04:18.180> natural<00:04:18.720> I<00:04:18.930> mean<00:04:19.940> one<00:04:20.940> of<00:04:20.970> the

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
kind of natural I mean one of the

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.730 
kind of natural I mean one of the
arguments<00:04:21.510> have<00:04:21.840> made<00:04:22.019> several<00:04:22.229> times<00:04:22.500> over

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
arguments have made several times over

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.589 
arguments have made several times over
is<00:04:23.039> if<00:04:23.280> you<00:04:23.669> are<00:04:23.849> going<00:04:24.060> to<00:04:24.180> jump<00:04:24.419> on<00:04:24.570> a

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
is if you are going to jump on a

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:27.260 
is if you are going to jump on a
next-generation<00:04:25.050> console<00:04:25.710> and<00:04:25.890> to<00:04:26.010> be<00:04:26.130> honest

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
next-generation console and to be honest

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.210 
next-generation console and to be honest
I<00:04:27.330> think<00:04:27.930> that<00:04:27.990> if<00:04:28.259> you've<00:04:28.410> got<00:04:28.620> a<00:04:28.650> high-spec

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
I think that if you've got a high-spec

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.390 
I think that if you've got a high-spec
PC<00:04:30.440> and<00:04:31.849> your<00:04:32.849> xbox<00:04:33.360> 360<00:04:33.930> or<00:04:34.020> ps3<00:04:34.289> owner<00:04:34.889> it's

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
PC and your xbox 360 or ps3 owner it's

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.270 
PC and your xbox 360 or ps3 owner it's
maybe<00:04:36.300> just<00:04:36.780> about<00:04:37.080> worth<00:04:37.379> buying<00:04:37.710> a<00:04:37.889> next-gen

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
maybe just about worth buying a next-gen

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.520 
maybe just about worth buying a next-gen
console<00:04:38.699> now<00:04:38.879> but<00:04:39.210> I<00:04:39.509> didn't<00:04:40.020> really<00:04:40.169> think<00:04:40.379> it

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
console now but I didn't really think it

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.249 
console now but I didn't really think it
was<00:04:40.590> at<00:04:40.889> launch<00:04:41.190> and<00:04:41.550> I<00:04:41.699> only<00:04:42.360> bought<00:04:42.720> one<00:04:42.780> the

console<00:04:49.110> is<00:04:49.229> definitely<00:04:49.830> worth<00:04:50.099> it<00:04:50.340> however

in<00:04:51.419> my<00:04:52.050> opinion<00:04:52.080> it's<00:04:52.800> still<00:04:53.250> kind<00:04:53.970> of<00:04:54.060> 5050<00:04:54.599> of

in my opinion it's still kind of 5050 of

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.140 
in my opinion it's still kind of 5050 of
whether<00:04:55.080> you<00:04:55.259> should<00:04:55.319> own<00:04:55.620> both<00:04:55.949> yet<00:04:56.280> because

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
whether you should own both yet because

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.510 
whether you should own both yet because
let's<00:04:57.389> even<00:04:57.569> assume<00:04:57.720> you're<00:04:58.229> only<00:04:58.560> Xbox<00:04:59.280> one

but at the moment I don't necessarily

take with a hundred percent accuracy at

take with a hundred percent accuracy at

least to predict the future I mean

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.140 
least to predict the future I mean
obviously<00:05:55.500> now<00:05:55.979> seven<00:05:56.370> million<00:05:56.610> versus<00:05:56.940> five

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150
