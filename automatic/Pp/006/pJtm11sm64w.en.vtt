00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:17.090
 tutorial I'm going to show you how 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:19.820
 we started the skinny the clockwork with 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:24.619
 with luck but 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:31.700
 from phone from the phone 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:37.060
 time but this recovery is not alone 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:41.920
 it's only for the motogp 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:43.110
 since if they do it to another phone what 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.840
 would do 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:52.590
 canary this is not the worm that 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.510
 briquet oo blog depending on what happened 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.510
 on the blog 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.960
 we need the application to saifi 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.050
 eiffage flowers 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:10.680

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:13.710
 and has downloaded and good will have the 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.520
 previous name but you will have to 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.830
 put the point that we coordinate 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.610
 ah 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.610
 and good 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.000
 and have absolute 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:32.430
 download to professional recovery and 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.430
 have permits but once 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:40.920
 we are going to pick you up but good 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:45.010
 The first thing is that if they have another 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.710
 router administrator to start since 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:53.159
 do not be until production we're going to 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:55.050
 supervise his or the one of port of adÃ©n 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.640
 here they come 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.090
 sean o'hair mod 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.179
 that exist 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.210
 that is, it is in the other because it does not 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:12.910
 It works very well but that's not true 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:15.569
 if it works very well and that gives me a lot 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.569
 support for 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:25.040
 good 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.040
 let's go to a film if you have a manager 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:33.790
 and we look for what he wants to say 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.390
 I want to say phrase core 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.630
 file with to my location 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.500
 I see him on youtube 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.130
 be floating 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.130
 and ready 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:51.879
 For this 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.900
 full 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.610
 Y 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.569
 is with which it becomes installed 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.680
 well here we say but I'm 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.740
 riding 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.460
 what 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:21.100
 the record and flower as with his that 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.870
 that's how it works but we're going for what 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.810
 were the cons after the new ones by the 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:29.030
 right 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.030
 we do not select power yes 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.960
 good 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.960
 and good 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.570
 and so they went to scare or to give 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.870
 following 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.700
 and for example I'm in the folders 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.640
 it works 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.239
 It is better than using keys 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.239
 judge him 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:04.230
 the volume and here we go 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:04.230
 everyone does not get stuck, responds instantly 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.500
 and this is the workman flop with white
