00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:08.780
 so that he puts me 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.780
 so the head 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.090
 the thing is printed more sport in 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.180
 chocolate disc titles like the 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.130
 fold name more to others 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.119
 make the toughest speeches that 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.119
 map dedicating 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.390
 [Music] 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.949
 I have imagine how you 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.990
 as a military man we see ourselves as a 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:39.049
 drummer 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.049
 [Music] 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.650
 now 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:48.320
 [Music] 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.320
 is important as sugar is delicious 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.610
 5 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.610
 I feel like he has me 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:10.030
 [Music] 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.030
 do not 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.740
 together intensity 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.390
 and enthusiasm 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.840
 in his office the earth falls 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.840
 costs 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.610
 and we have to do something to channel 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:02:01.639
 that energy 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:02:01.639
 [Music] 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.140
 as he has gravity as a drummer 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.500
 country
