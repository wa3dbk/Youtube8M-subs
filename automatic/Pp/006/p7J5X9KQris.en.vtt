00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:21.639 
kind of sounds as if the sharingan users

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:24.400 
kind of sounds as if the sharingan users
words<00:06:22.639> like<00:06:23.000> over<00:06:23.360> use<00:06:23.509> your<00:06:23.660> eyes<00:06:23.780> and<00:06:24.169> they

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:26.539 
came there it's a valley of judgement in

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:27.969 
came there it's a valley of judgement in
order<00:06:26.780> to<00:06:26.900> survive<00:06:27.229> like<00:06:27.440> that's<00:06:27.710> where<00:06:27.889> they

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:27.979 
order to survive like that's where they

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:29.620 
order to survive like that's where they
went<00:06:28.130> you<00:06:28.370> know<00:06:28.430> all<00:06:28.729> the<00:06:28.789> Sharingan<00:06:29.150> users<00:06:29.419> if

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630 
went you know all the Sharingan users if

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:30.939 
went you know all the Sharingan users if
they<00:06:29.810> use<00:06:30.020> their<00:06:30.139> eyes<00:06:30.289> too<00:06:30.530> much<00:06:30.680> you<00:06:30.860> know

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:30.949 
they use their eyes too much you know

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:32.890 
they use their eyes too much you know
how<00:06:31.039> it<00:06:31.160> deteriorates<00:06:31.639> and<00:06:31.880> then<00:06:32.600> they<00:06:32.780> all

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
how it deteriorates and then they all

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.480 
how it deteriorates and then they all
went<00:06:33.110> there<00:06:33.350> like<00:06:33.650> that's<00:06:34.100> what<00:06:34.220> it<00:06:34.310> sounds

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.490 
went there like that's what it sounds

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:35.830 
went there like that's what it sounds
like<00:06:34.550> to<00:06:34.699> me<00:06:34.729> like<00:06:34.850> when<00:06:35.180> Sharingan<00:06:35.570> eaters

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 
like to me like when Sharingan eaters

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.719 
like to me like when Sharingan eaters
there<00:06:36.020> and<00:06:36.199> yeah<00:06:36.500> Khan<00:06:36.710> users<00:06:37.160> I<00:06:37.340> don't<00:06:37.520> think

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:37.729 
there and yeah Khan users I don't think

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:39.909 
there and yeah Khan users I don't think
I<00:06:38.210> think<00:06:38.990> the<00:06:39.050> background<00:06:39.440> is<00:06:39.560> strong<00:06:39.770> enough

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 
I think the background is strong enough

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:42.730 
I think the background is strong enough
parently<00:06:40.370> to<00:06:40.930> survive<00:06:41.930> deterioration<00:06:42.530> like

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
parently to survive deterioration like

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.920 
parently to survive deterioration like
it<00:06:42.830> doesn't<00:06:43.039> deteriorate<00:06:43.160> yes<00:06:44.000> if<00:06:44.539> you<00:06:44.720> over

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:44.930 
it doesn't deteriorate yes if you over

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.140 
it doesn't deteriorate yes if you over
usually<00:06:45.199> at<00:06:45.289> times<00:06:45.530> and<00:06:45.860> it<00:06:46.100> stresses<00:06:46.789> to<00:06:47.060> me

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.150 
usually at times and it stresses to me

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.629 
usually at times and it stresses to me
kind<00:06:47.360> of<00:06:47.479> that<00:06:47.930> if<00:06:48.050> you<00:06:48.169> overuse<00:06:48.680> it<00:06:48.889> and

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:49.639 
kind of that if you overuse it and

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:51.550 
kind of that if you overuse it and
suddenly<00:06:50.180> go<00:06:50.270> for<00:06:50.419> use<00:06:50.539> it<00:06:50.690> that<00:06:51.080> mean<00:06:51.229> there's

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 
suddenly go for use it that mean there's

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.020 
suddenly go for use it that mean there's
some<00:06:51.710> kind<00:06:51.919> of<00:06:51.949> stamina<00:06:52.220> you<00:06:52.490> can<00:06:52.610> have<00:06:52.760> and

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.030 
some kind of stamina you can have and

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.400 
some kind of stamina you can have and
you<00:06:53.060> can<00:06:53.210> Builder<00:06:53.419> stamina<00:06:53.780> as<00:06:53.900> more<00:06:54.169> and<00:06:54.289> more

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:54.410 
you can Builder stamina as more and more

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.279 
you can Builder stamina as more and more
you<00:06:54.530> use<00:06:54.740> it<00:06:54.889> that<00:06:55.750> eventually<00:06:56.750> there<00:06:56.900> I'm

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:57.289 
you use it that eventually there I'm

00:06:57.289 --> 00:06:58.480 
you use it that eventually there I'm
guessing<00:06:57.440> assuming<00:06:57.889> there's<00:06:58.190> a<00:06:58.220> point<00:06:58.460> in

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:58.490 
guessing assuming there's a point in

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.879 
guessing assuming there's a point in
time<00:06:58.639> where<00:06:58.880> take<00:06:59.240> a<00:06:59.270> lot<00:06:59.600> of<00:06:59.810> usage<00:07:00.289> of<00:07:00.470> the

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:00.889 
time where take a lot of usage of the

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:03.730 
time where take a lot of usage of the
back<00:07:01.039> on<00:07:01.250> order<00:07:01.490> for<00:07:01.760> it<00:07:01.850> to<00:07:01.880> become<00:07:02.740> not

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:03.740 
back on order for it to become not

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.610 
back on order for it to become not
unusable<00:07:04.280> but<00:07:04.729> need<00:07:04.970> forward<00:07:05.570> to<00:07:05.690> recover<00:07:06.080> so

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:06.620 
unusable but need forward to recover so

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.620 
unusable but need forward to recover so
and<00:07:06.800> that's<00:07:06.919> interesting<00:07:07.520> seeing<00:07:07.910> that<00:07:08.060> you

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:08.630 
and that's interesting seeing that you

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:09.850 
and that's interesting seeing that you
can<00:07:08.750> use<00:07:08.870> a<00:07:08.900> background<00:07:09.080> for<00:07:09.320> a<00:07:09.380> long<00:07:09.590> time

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:09.860 
can use a background for a long time

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.860 
can use a background for a long time
assuming<00:07:10.460> that<00:07:10.490> you<00:07:10.970> do<00:07:11.150> train<00:07:11.360> a<00:07:11.389> long<00:07:11.630> time

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:11.870 
assuming that you do train a long time

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.860 
assuming that you do train a long time
Neji<00:07:12.650> excuse<00:07:13.009> to<00:07:13.130> back<00:07:13.280> on<00:07:13.520> with<00:07:13.880> with<00:07:14.389> Hinata

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.620 
Neji excuse to back on with with Hinata
for<00:07:15.289> a<00:07:15.320> long<00:07:15.500> time<00:07:15.770> so<00:07:16.310> I<00:07:16.699> mean<00:07:17.389> that's<00:07:17.510> crazy

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:17.630 
for a long time so I mean that's crazy

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.040 
for a long time so I mean that's crazy
like<00:07:18.020> Neji<00:07:18.560> has<00:07:18.710> some<00:07:19.070> crazy<00:07:19.870> training<00:07:20.870> he

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.050 
like Neji has some crazy training he

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.230 
like Neji has some crazy training he
trains<00:07:21.260> a<00:07:21.349> lot<00:07:21.440> and<00:07:21.740> no<00:07:21.979> doubt<00:07:22.190> that<00:07:22.520> he<00:07:22.940> trains

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.240 
trains a lot and no doubt that he trains

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.370 
trains a lot and no doubt that he trains
lap<00:07:23.419> because<00:07:23.630> he's<00:07:23.750> one<00:07:23.930> of<00:07:23.960> those<00:07:24.050> serious

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:24.380 
lap because he's one of those serious

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.070 
lap because he's one of those serious
types<00:07:24.650> so<00:07:25.220> that's<00:07:25.789> that<00:07:26.000> that's<00:07:26.270> the<00:07:26.720> episode

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:27.080 
types so that's that that's the episode

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.920 
types so that's that that's the episode
it<00:07:27.830> was<00:07:27.949> somewhat<00:07:28.190> interesting<00:07:28.639> I<00:07:28.729> mean

I<00:07:50.120> might<00:07:50.270> sound<00:07:50.419> a<00:07:50.449> little<00:07:50.479> different<00:07:50.900> but

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:51.620 
I might sound a little different but

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.350 
I might sound a little different but
actually<00:07:51.919> change<00:07:52.250> some<00:07:52.610> settings<00:07:52.789> up<00:07:53.150> so<00:07:53.330> I

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.360 
actually change some settings up so I

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.890 
actually change some settings up so I
might<00:07:53.539> sound<00:07:53.720> a<00:07:53.750> little<00:07:53.780> fan<00:07:54.080> but<00:07:54.830> whatever

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:55.900 
might sound a little fan but whatever
