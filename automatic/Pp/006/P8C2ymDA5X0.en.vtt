00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 the wording of the only municipality in NRW was that the super 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.690
 apparently very windy 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.269
 but fun 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:10.900
 That was fun, that's probably the most important thing 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.599
 well 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.190
 that was exhausting 3 30 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.009
 had to walk normally 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:18.730
 Women that he was very windy 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.150
 St but good Sartoris said 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.669
 Natascha children's choir improved 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.609
 how much they naturally enjoy the very forward JAL very good all the operation he hands 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:29.220
 here 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.380
 on the track but he also on paintings the marathon man so what 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:34.539
 actually their main goal 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:38.729
 this unique marathon in the fall but I've noticed that since then 

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:39.990
 but stay 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.300
 they have one who has lost the difficulty and you need too 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.700
 Speeds in Manhattan that's why these couples 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.340
 2 denied the consequences now 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.159
 OK 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:52.790
 and who sees what the goals for the marathon 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.940
 finally my Pelcz actually 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.980
 Phase two provide 26 1 20 transmitters offer 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.660
 and what is the more with the one with the train will be back targets 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.850
 he'll still have all trouble over ten thousand the German record 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:08.830
 becomes clear 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.930
 but that wants to be blessed because he stressfulness honesty networks very much 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.680
 I had to be content with Duran earlier 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.250
 yes next year is of course an important year with the olympics 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.330
 play 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.500
 If you have any goals, you can achieve that 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.520
 underneath, these are not already sleeping 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.330
 because she's doing the marathon 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.320
 on the marathon 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.369
 Naturally 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.429
 And how is that in Germany with the nomination of new water? 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:35.540
 Percent currently you have to run then 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.570
 under two hours 30 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.600
 but if Annett and his ranger look for nothing at the 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.260
 Olympic Games 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.350
 okay they were a few times one of the big tournaments 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.659
 and the arena praised their goal about their future on the way to or 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.659
 it's still back, after all, athletics 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.790
 I use the athletes in the Stade Rennes out completely but that does 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.800
 fun and brings variety and Steinwerder so far in the marathon 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.770
 will bring 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.960
 every person is different in preparing differently 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.369
 but fun at the sport yet Emanuel 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.749
 of course play 

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:11.949
 for Apollo this provides a Kettcar
