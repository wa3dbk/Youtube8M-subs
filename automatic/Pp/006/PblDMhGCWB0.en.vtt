 through a release code the 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.020
 necessary code to free it what 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:10.730

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.100

 live.com or by whatsapp but in 6 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.749
 26 22 73 52 in the description of this 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.939
 video below you have the website 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:22.400
 where you can check the prices and 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.019
 delivery times and once we have 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.659
 the release code what we will have 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:31.310
 what to do to free it is to turn it on 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:33.140
 without any card without inside well in 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.570
 this moment is totally safe not 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.820
 causes any type of non- invalid failure 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.820
 the guarantee or delete any data 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.970
 we remember that we can not do 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.040
 responsible for the release if our 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.230
 phone is blocked by email by the 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.360
 operator for theft loss of payment no 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.440
 contact us in this case because no 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.440
 we can help you 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.660
 well once we are on the screen 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.430
 we will have to open the keyboard 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.680
 as if we were dialing a number of 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.520
 phone to call and we mark the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.150
 next sequence 2945 pad 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.550
 asterisk 510 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.740
 and this hidden menu appears in which 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.220
 we must press the first option 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.540
 blocking network as you see here then we 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.840
 ask for a release code 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.190
 this is the code we provide 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.160
 click on the white square to 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.299
 let us do the keyboard and we mark the 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.530
 code 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.750
 logically this color I'm marking 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.310
 it only serves to free this phone 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.310
 each phone carries a different code 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.259
 click on unlock 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.100
 and as you can see, it unlocks us 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.050
 network has been done correctly now 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.910
 the phone restarts 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.410
 and once on, it will be ready 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.410
 to be used with any operator
