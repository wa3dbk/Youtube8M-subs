00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
telling the truth as he saw it and he

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.200 
telling the truth as he saw it and he
didn't<00:00:59.900> maneuver<00:01:00.890> too<00:01:01.130> much<00:01:01.400> or<00:01:01.850> he<00:01:02.000> wasn't

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
didn't maneuver too much or he wasn't

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.920 
didn't maneuver too much or he wasn't
rhetorically<00:01:03.309> particularly<00:01:04.309> elusive<00:01:04.930> about

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
rhetorically particularly elusive about

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.170 
rhetorically particularly elusive about
what<00:01:06.110> he<00:01:06.200> wanted<00:01:06.500> to<00:01:06.740> express<00:01:07.400> and<00:01:07.790> he<00:01:07.880> didn't

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
what he wanted to express and he didn't

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.390 
what he wanted to express and he didn't
apologize<00:01:08.270> in<00:01:09.080> fact<00:01:09.740> I<00:01:09.920> thought<00:01:10.130> he<00:01:10.250> could

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
apologize in fact I thought he could

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.010 
apologize in fact I thought he could
have<00:01:10.490> apologized<00:01:11.150> a<00:01:11.270> bit<00:01:11.450> and<00:01:11.570> he<00:01:11.660> didn't<00:01:11.930> do

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
have apologized a bit and he didn't do

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.210 
have apologized a bit and he didn't do
so<00:01:12.230> I<00:01:12.790> think<00:01:13.790> he<00:01:13.910> went<00:01:14.180> as<00:01:14.780> far<00:01:15.230> as<00:01:15.500> one<00:01:15.770> can<00:01:15.980> go

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
so I think he went as far as one can go

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.940 
so I think he went as far as one can go
with<00:01:16.490> one<00:01:16.790> speech<00:01:17.360> in<00:01:17.740> reframing<00:01:18.740> the

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
with one speech in reframing the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.550 
with one speech in reframing the
relationship<00:01:19.700> between<00:01:19.960> the<00:01:20.960> west<00:01:21.290> and

two worlds so to speak so it's a

the way the speech was delivered the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.500 
the way the speech was delivered the

think this was all intentional on the
