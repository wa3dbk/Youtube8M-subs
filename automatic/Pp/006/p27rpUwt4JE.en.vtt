00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
ironically however it is the continued

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.429 
ironically however it is the continued
dieting<00:02:35.239> that<00:02:35.359> makes<00:02:35.540> future<00:02:35.959> binge<00:02:36.230> eating

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:36.439 
dieting that makes future binge eating

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:38.649 
dieting that makes future binge eating
even<00:02:36.799> more<00:02:37.040> likely<00:02:37.310> than<00:02:37.609> it<00:02:37.730> was<00:02:37.879> before<00:02:38.120> and

even more likely than it was before and

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:42.330 
even more likely than it was before and
so<00:02:39.260> therefore<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.889> cycle<00:02:40.340> is<00:02:40.579> intensified

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340
