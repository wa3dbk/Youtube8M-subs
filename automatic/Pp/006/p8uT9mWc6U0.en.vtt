mortality from rheumatic fever there is
some<00:00:32.189> suggestion<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.940> there's<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.210> reamer

gence of the disease and they don't

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.360 
gence of the disease and they don't
really<00:00:37.020> know<00:00:37.230> why<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.440> might<00:00:37.950> be<00:00:38.129> happening

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
really know why that might be happening

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.420 
really know why that might be happening
but<00:00:39.360> still<00:00:39.660> it's<00:00:39.809> pretty<00:00:40.079> low<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.680> we<00:00:41.280> don't

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
but still it's pretty low and we don't

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.119 
but still it's pretty low and we don't
have<00:00:41.579> people<00:00:41.790> dying<00:00:42.180> from<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:43.129> worldwide

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
have people dying from it worldwide

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.220 
have people dying from it worldwide
though<00:00:44.640> we<00:00:44.940> have<00:00:45.149> close<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.660> half<00:00:45.899> million

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
though we have close to a half million

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.020 
though we have close to a half million
cases<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:47.219> year<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:48.289> 203<00:00:49.289> through<00:00:50.030> 233

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
cases a year and 203 through 233

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.200 
cases a year and 203 through 233
thousand<00:00:51.449> deaths<00:00:51.690> worldwide<00:00:52.559> per<00:00:53.160> year<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:54.090> it

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
thousand deaths worldwide per year so it

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.850 
thousand deaths worldwide per year so it
still<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> significant<00:00:55.320> problem

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
still is a significant problem

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.139 
still is a significant problem
especially<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.850> developing<00:00:57.390> nations<00:00:59.059> so<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
especially in developing nations so the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.540 
especially in developing nations so the
presentation<00:01:00.660> will<00:01:00.989> hopefully<00:01:01.320> look<00:01:01.890> like<00:01:02.160> a

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
presentation will hopefully look like a

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.600 
presentation will hopefully look like a
strep<00:01:03.359> throat<00:01:03.799> meaning<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:04.949> we'll<00:01:05.159> catch<00:01:05.400> it

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
strep throat meaning that we'll catch it

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.649 
strep throat meaning that we'll catch it
before<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:06.030> ever<00:01:06.150> becomes<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:07.250> rheumatic<00:01:08.250> fever

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
before it ever becomes a rheumatic fever

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.120 
before it ever becomes a rheumatic fever
so<00:01:09.659> we<00:01:09.960> have<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:11.090> exudate<00:01:12.090> on<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:13.130> tonsils

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
so we have this exudate on the tonsils

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.310 
so we have this exudate on the tonsils
here<00:01:14.369> it's<00:01:15.360> going<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.840> look<00:01:15.990> like<00:01:16.140> an

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
here it's going to just look like an

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.830 
here it's going to just look like an
exudate<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.860> ferren's<00:01:17.250> itis<00:01:17.960> and<00:01:20.390> this<00:01:21.390> could

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
exudate of ferren's itis and this could

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.109 
exudate of ferren's itis and this could
be<00:01:22.070> you<00:01:23.070> know<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.310> picture<00:01:23.700> could<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:24.090> a

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
be you know this picture could be a

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.990 
be you know this picture could be a
picture<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.689> mono<00:01:25.850> or<00:01:26.930> in<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.259> rare<00:01:28.530> cases<00:01:28.740> a

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
picture of mono or in in rare cases a

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.870 
picture of mono or in in rare cases a
Viral<00:01:30.000> pharyngitis<00:01:30.950> but<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.070> most<00:01:32.220> cases<00:01:32.520> if

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
Viral pharyngitis but in most cases if

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.300 
Viral pharyngitis but in most cases if
you<00:01:33.000> have<00:01:33.180> an<00:01:33.780> exudative<00:01:34.500> pharyngitis<00:01:34.530> like

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
you have an exudative pharyngitis like

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.649 
you have an exudative pharyngitis like
this<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.909> first<00:01:36.180> thing<00:01:36.360> you're<00:01:36.479> going<00:01:36.600> to

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
this the first thing you're going to

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.359 
this the first thing you're going to
think<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.409> going<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.460> be<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:39.090> strep<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:40.680> we're

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
think of is going to be a strep so we're

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.789 
think of is going to be a strep so we're
going<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.579> be<00:01:41.729> treating<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.380> when<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.500> still

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
going to be treating this when it still

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.609 
going to be treating this when it still
is<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.630> pharyngitis<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.079> before<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.530> ever

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
is a pharyngitis and before it ever

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.929 
is a pharyngitis and before it ever
becomes<00:01:47.130> in<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.700> rheumatic<00:01:48.299> fever<00:01:49.579> so<00:01:50.579> but<00:01:50.820> if

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
becomes in a rheumatic fever so but if

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.850 
becomes in a rheumatic fever so but if
it<00:01:51.090> does<00:01:51.299> progress<00:01:51.750> beyond<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.290> stage<00:01:52.560> and

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
it does progress beyond this stage and

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.660 
it does progress beyond this stage and
becomes<00:01:53.790> rheumatic<00:01:54.299> fever<00:01:54.380> then<00:01:55.380> we<00:01:55.649> have<00:01:55.950> the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
becomes rheumatic fever then we have the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.219 
becomes rheumatic fever then we have the
jones<00:01:57.000> criteria<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:58.740> help<00:01:58.920> us<00:01:59.070> identify<00:02:00.229> what

question<00:03:10.730> you<00:03:10.970> might<00:03:11.120> see<00:03:11.450> I<00:03:11.890> you<00:03:12.890> know<00:03:13.010> an

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
question you might see I you know an

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.720 
question you might see I you know an
arthralgia<00:03:13.820> and<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:15.590> you<00:03:15.800> might<00:03:16.130> mistake<00:03:16.280> it

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
arthralgia and and you might mistake it

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.940 
arthralgia and and you might mistake it
for<00:03:16.760> being<00:03:17.090> a<00:03:17.390> major<00:03:18.290> criteria<00:03:20.440> so<00:03:21.440> how<00:03:21.890> to

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
for being a major criteria so how to

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.090 
for being a major criteria so how to
treat<00:03:22.220> it<00:03:22.250> if<00:03:22.820> it's<00:03:23.000> a<00:03:23.090> child<00:03:23.390> to<00:03:23.570> give<00:03:23.750> them

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
treat it if it's a child to give them

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.660 
treat it if it's a child to give them
250<00:03:25.100> milligrams<00:03:25.340> penicillin<00:03:26.590> for<00:03:27.590> 10<00:03:27.770> days<00:03:27.950> if

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
250 milligrams penicillin for 10 days if

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.520 
250 milligrams penicillin for 10 days if
it's<00:03:28.850> an<00:03:29.000> adult<00:03:29.330> you<00:03:29.750> give<00:03:29.930> them<00:03:30.050> 500

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
it's an adult you give them 500

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.170 
it's an adult you give them 500
milligrams<00:03:32.140> so<00:03:33.340> I'm<00:03:34.340> sure<00:03:34.580> that<00:03:34.610> there's<00:03:34.910> some

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
milligrams so I'm sure that there's some

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.490
