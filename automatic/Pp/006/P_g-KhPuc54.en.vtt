though<00:05:31.610> my<00:05:31.790> grill<00:05:32.060> is<00:05:32.180> at<00:05:32.300> 300<00:05:32.750> degrees<00:05:33.550> it's

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
though my grill is at 300 degrees it's

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.340 
though my grill is at 300 degrees it's
not<00:05:34.730> like<00:05:34.880> a<00:05:34.910> convection<00:05:35.300> oven<00:05:35.630> so<00:05:36.080> it's<00:05:36.230> not

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
not like a convection oven so it's not

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.320 
not like a convection oven so it's not
really<00:05:36.560> cooking<00:05:36.980> evenly<00:05:37.430> so<00:05:37.670> what<00:05:38.090> I<00:05:38.120> had<00:05:38.270> to

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
really cooking evenly so what I had to

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.350 
really cooking evenly so what I had to
do<00:05:38.420> is<00:05:38.540> I<00:05:38.600> had<00:05:38.690> to<00:05:38.780> rotate<00:05:38.990> the<00:05:39.500> planks<00:05:40.360> 180

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
do is I had to rotate the planks 180

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.480 
do is I had to rotate the planks 180
degrees<00:05:41.780> because<00:05:42.650> this<00:05:42.800> side<00:05:43.220> that<00:05:43.370> was

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
degrees because this side that was

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:44.770 
degrees because this side that was
closest<00:05:43.850> to<00:05:43.880> the<00:05:44.000> center<00:05:44.300> was<00:05:44.450> cooking<00:05:44.720> a

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
closest to the center was cooking a

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.110 
closest to the center was cooking a
little<00:05:44.960> faster<00:05:45.380> so<00:05:46.160> after<00:05:46.580> about<00:05:46.700> 15<00:05:47.090> minutes

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
little faster so after about 15 minutes

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.880 
little faster so after about 15 minutes
I<00:05:47.420> just<00:05:47.570> gave<00:05:47.720> him<00:05:47.780> a<00:05:47.840> little<00:05:47.870> rotate<00:05:48.380> I'm

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:48.890 
I just gave him a little rotate I'm

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:49.990 
I just gave him a little rotate I'm
gonna<00:05:49.040> close<00:05:49.250> the<00:05:49.370> lid<00:05:49.520> they<00:05:49.640> should<00:05:49.790> be<00:05:49.850> ready
