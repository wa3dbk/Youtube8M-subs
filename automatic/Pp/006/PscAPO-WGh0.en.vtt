00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560 

I<00:00:00.439> put<00:00:01.439> a<00:00:01.469> thick<00:00:01.680> coil<00:00:01.920> pin<00:00:02.159> on<00:00:02.340> this<00:00:02.490> big<00:00:03.389> wave

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
I put a thick coil pin on this big wave

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.700 
I put a thick coil pin on this big wave
gun<00:00:03.810> and<00:00:04.339> a<00:00:05.690> thick<00:00:06.690> pin<00:00:06.899> works<00:00:07.140> really<00:00:07.410> good

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
gun and a thick pin works really good

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.070 
gun and a thick pin works really good
with<00:00:08.189> this<00:00:08.429> design<00:00:08.910> with<00:00:09.240> all<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.480> concave<00:00:09.900> in

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
with this design with all the concave in

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.310 
with this design with all the concave in
the<00:00:10.170> tail<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:11.360> thick<00:00:12.360> fins<00:00:12.599> have<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.840> history

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
the tail and thick fins have a history

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.460 
the tail and thick fins have a history
on<00:00:13.969> big<00:00:14.969> wave<00:00:15.150> guns<00:00:15.420> dating<00:00:15.750> back<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.109> 50s

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
on big wave guns dating back to the 50s

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.609 
on big wave guns dating back to the 50s
and<00:00:16.710> into<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.160> 70s<00:00:17.640> so<00:00:18.330> that's<00:00:19.199> what<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.500> chose

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
and into the 70s so that's what I chose

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.030 
and into the 70s so that's what I chose
to<00:00:20.070> put<00:00:20.250> on<00:00:20.369> this<00:00:20.520> board

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.040 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.720 

I<00:00:23.750> started<00:00:24.750> by<00:00:24.840> making<00:00:24.870> a<00:00:25.200> thin<00:00:25.380> panel<00:00:25.770> with

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
I started by making a thin panel with

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.240 
I started by making a thin panel with
ten<00:00:27.030> layers<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.600> eight<00:00:28.320> ounce<00:00:28.530> Bowl<00:00:28.770> an<00:00:29.010> and

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
ten layers of eight ounce Bowl an and

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.000 
ten layers of eight ounce Bowl an and
amber<00:00:29.910> resin<00:00:33.110> I'll<00:00:34.110> be<00:00:34.320> sandwiching<00:00:34.830> this

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
amber resin I'll be sandwiching this

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.200 
amber resin I'll be sandwiching this
between<00:00:35.340> two<00:00:35.970> pieces<00:00:36.150> of<00:00:36.330> Redwood<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:38.210> it'll

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
between two pieces of Redwood and it'll

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.570 
between two pieces of Redwood and it'll
make<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.840> one-inch<00:00:40.650> thick<00:00:41.330> thin<00:00:42.330> blank<00:00:42.600> I

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:43.580 
make a one-inch thick thin blank I

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
make a one-inch thick thin blank I
consider<00:00:44.580> this<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.790> prime<00:00:45.090> cut<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.390> this

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
consider this the prime cut of this

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.939 
consider this the prime cut of this
beautiful<00:00:45.840> quarter<00:00:46.230> saw<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.470> redwood<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.830> I

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
beautiful quarter saw in redwood that I

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:49.369 
beautiful quarter saw in redwood that I
have<00:00:47.160> I've<00:00:47.760> had<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.000> for<00:00:48.120> years<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.540> I'll<00:00:49.230> use

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
have I've had it for years and I'll use

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.080 
have I've had it for years and I'll use
those<00:00:49.530> other<00:00:49.710> scraps<00:00:50.070> on<00:00:50.280> other<00:00:50.430> projects<00:00:50.970> but

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
those other scraps on other projects but

00:00:51.090 --> 00:01:01.979 
those other scraps on other projects but
for<00:00:51.860> this<00:00:52.860> one<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:53.220> a<00:00:53.309> single<00:00:53.610> piece

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.360 

so<00:01:02.989> I<00:01:03.020> make<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.379> sandwich<00:01:03.800> and<00:01:03.950> then<00:01:04.040> I<00:01:04.070> cut<00:01:04.339> it

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
so I make the sandwich and then I cut it

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.350 
so I make the sandwich and then I cut it
out<00:01:04.610> and<00:01:04.850> then<00:01:05.409> after<00:01:06.409> I<00:01:06.440> tuned<00:01:06.680> it<00:01:06.830> up<00:01:07.119> we<00:01:08.119> have

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
out and then after I tuned it up we have

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.320 
out and then after I tuned it up we have
a<00:01:09.130> one-inch<00:01:10.130> thick<00:01:10.490> thin<00:01:10.880> blank

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
a one-inch thick thin blank

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.870 
a one-inch thick thin blank
that<00:01:11.780> has<00:01:12.770> to<00:01:12.950> be<00:01:13.000> tapered<00:01:14.000> oil<00:01:15.610> when<00:01:16.610> the<00:01:16.640> fin

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
that has to be tapered oil when the fin

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.370 
that has to be tapered oil when the fin
gets<00:01:17.180> boiled<00:01:17.390> is<00:01:17.600> going<00:01:17.750> to<00:01:17.810> require<00:01:18.050> a<00:01:18.110> lot<00:01:18.350> of

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
gets boiled is going to require a lot of

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.840 
gets boiled is going to require a lot of
tapering<00:01:18.890> so<00:01:19.580> I<00:01:19.610> made<00:01:19.970> this<00:01:20.259> tapering<00:01:21.259> jig<00:01:21.320> and

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
tapering so I made this tapering jig and

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.880 
tapering so I made this tapering jig and
what<00:01:22.850> it<00:01:22.940> is<00:01:23.090> is<00:01:23.270> it's<00:01:23.450> a<00:01:23.540> sled<00:01:23.930> that<00:01:24.619> goes

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
what it is is it's a sled that goes

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.469 
what it is is it's a sled that goes
through<00:01:25.640> a<00:01:25.670> surface<00:01:25.909> sander<00:01:26.479> and<00:01:27.369> does<00:01:28.479> the

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
through a surface sander and does the

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.800 
through a surface sander and does the
bulk<00:01:29.690> of<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:29.960> work<00:01:30.170> with<00:01:30.950> a<00:01:31.600> really<00:01:32.600> great

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
bulk of the work with a really great

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.650 
bulk of the work with a really great
precision<00:01:33.200> so<00:01:34.100> it<00:01:34.820> really<00:01:35.180> did<00:01:35.360> work<00:01:35.539> out

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
precision so it really did work out

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:43.219 
precision so it really did work out
knives

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.410 

here's<00:01:44.229> another<00:01:44.350> look<00:01:44.710> at<00:01:44.799> that<00:01:44.830> sled<00:01:45.280> it's<00:01:46.240> a

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
here's another look at that sled it's a

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
here's another look at that sled it's a
really<00:01:46.780> simple<00:01:57.509> when<00:01:58.509> the<00:01:58.600> fins<00:01:58.810> done<00:01:59.110> it<00:01:59.320> will

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
really simple when the fins done it will

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.660 
really simple when the fins done it will
be<00:01:59.560> just<00:01:59.830> under<00:02:00.040> one<00:02:00.610> inch<00:02:00.640> at<00:02:00.940> the<00:02:01.060> base<00:02:01.270> and

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
be just under one inch at the base and

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.800 
be just under one inch at the base and
about<00:02:03.670> a<00:02:03.700> quarter<00:02:04.090> inch<00:02:04.119> little<00:02:04.509> over<00:02:04.750> a

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
about a quarter inch little over a

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.029 
about a quarter inch little over a
quarter<00:02:04.990> inch<00:02:05.259> at<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:06.040> tip<00:02:07.530> if<00:02:08.530> if<00:02:08.800> in<00:02:08.950> were

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
quarter inch at the tip if if in were

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.710 
quarter inch at the tip if if in were
made<00:02:09.220> of<00:02:09.340> solid<00:02:09.640> glass<00:02:09.729> it<00:02:10.060> way<00:02:10.179> a<00:02:10.209> lot<00:02:10.450> more

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
made of solid glass it way a lot more

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.600 
made of solid glass it way a lot more
that<00:02:11.560> glass<00:02:11.980> in<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.310> center<00:02:12.520> of<00:02:12.819> the<00:02:12.940> panel<00:02:13.360> is

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
that glass in the center of the panel is

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.520 
that glass in the center of the panel is
nice<00:02:15.610> of<00:02:15.820> sand<00:02:16.060> too<00:02:16.269> but<00:02:16.510> also<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:17.140> function

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
nice of sand too but also the function

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.680 
nice of sand too but also the function
of<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:17.769> is<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:18.880> have<00:02:18.940> a<00:02:19.030> place<00:02:19.239> for<00:02:19.269> the<00:02:19.480> glass

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
of it is to have a place for the glass

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.259 
of it is to have a place for the glass
to<00:02:19.720> die<00:02:20.050> into<00:02:20.350> when<00:02:20.500> you<00:02:20.590> glass<00:02:20.830> it<00:02:21.120> in<00:02:22.120> this

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
to die into when you glass it in this

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.699 
to die into when you glass it in this
case<00:02:22.480> it's<00:02:22.690> not<00:02:22.780> meant<00:02:23.019> to<00:02:23.080> look<00:02:23.230> like<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.410> bead

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
case it's not meant to look like a bead

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.810 
case it's not meant to look like a bead
but<00:02:24.810> more<00:02:25.810> like<00:02:25.959> a<00:02:25.989> thick<00:02:26.260> pin<00:02:26.470> line<00:02:26.709> with<00:02:27.519> this

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
but more like a thick pin line with this

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.140 
but more like a thick pin line with this
the<00:02:28.300> strength<00:02:28.570> advantages<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:30.760> always<00:02:30.940> want

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
the strength advantages you always want

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.080 
the strength advantages you always want
to<00:02:31.180> seal<00:02:31.450> redwood<00:02:31.989> before<00:02:32.320> your<00:02:32.470> glass<00:02:32.680> it

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
to seal redwood before your glass it

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.920 
to seal redwood before your glass it
because<00:02:34.090> it<00:02:34.209> can<00:02:34.360> Lyster<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:37.269> temporary<00:02:37.720> base

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
because it can Lyster the temporary base

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.360 
because it can Lyster the temporary base
