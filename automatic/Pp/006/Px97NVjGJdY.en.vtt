00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:04.370
 welcome to local that 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.970
 Aachen nice that they look in 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.340
 you already had the feeling 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.080
 that you are wrong on the highway 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.340
 so they have been flashed 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.049
 did not drive so fast 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.269
 that 's the point in our first one 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.289
 contribution and then we have among others 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.279
 even these topics for you 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.800
 pretty warm for the season 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.509
 unpack plants again quite nicely 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.679
 many customers want 90 years 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:27.739
 work on 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:32.449
 pretty much what is happening don carlo behind the 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:35.089
 There are backdrops on a 4 at Düren 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:36.409
 currently a construction site on both sides 

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:36.980
 And that makes the car drivers 

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:39.050
 create 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.640
 There have been some serious accidents there 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.129
 and that's why the circle is in the foreground 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.000
 Shortly two lightning should be set up 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.370
 reported about it 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.589
 but these are supposedly so 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.540
 active that they strike even then 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:51.860
 if there is no reason so 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.580
 the car driver is not that fast 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.500
 drove 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.449
 a driving instructor has that anyway 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.689
 We have accompanied him today 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.250
 to learn the whole story 

00:00:58.689 --> 00:01:01.939
 René Schlegel takes us on one 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.159
 jaunt 

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:07.040
 It goes on the highway 4 at Düren 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.570
 to build directly into a danger point 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.729
 have already been here in the past 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.979
 The circle was taken care of by serious accidents 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.470
 That's why Düren reacted and before four 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.799
 weeks on both carriageway sides 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.799
 set up a speed trap 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.100
 I also think it's good that something 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.920
 it also has to be ensured 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:35.080
 be that the whole system too 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:38.450
 works and that is exactly the question 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.760
 34,000 100 times hit the radar columns 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.990
 in a month to rené 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.970
 Schlegel has flashed it 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.550
 last week direction aachen 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.930
 allowed top speed there 100 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.670
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.410
 the driving instructor and his driving pupil 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.900
 Michelle counters were on their own 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:02:03.560
 but only 75 kilometers fast 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:06.050
 and still in the moment 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.250
 direction camera we have looked 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.170
 have talked about that 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.550
 situation and we talk about that 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.670
 Radar systems that you as a beginner 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.080
 take care of trial period extension 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.120
 and so on and so on if you like that 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.280
 fast is yes and there I show mine 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.280
 That's what we students look at and we both look 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.050
 then, at the moment solves the out 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.269
 and that's the proof of a sting 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.220
 sharp photo of the circle a düren 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.690
 Statement on this case from the camera 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.670
 was not possible today in writing 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.799
 the authority explains the flashing light 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.620
 attack with a test run of the device 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:39.350
 a flash just to control the 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.000
 radar pillar the car is not meant at all 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:48.950
 in the case of her, this is her 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:51.660
 Argumentation little comprehensible that 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.240
 data are stored by citizens 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.410
 or citizens are photographed there 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.760
 although they behaved correctly 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.620
 of course there is no fairbarn or 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.330
 fine for the driving instructor and his 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.340
 Carefully driving schoolgirl 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.650
 that brings the circular düren in this 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.690
 but no money saves him too 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.950
 work because the authority has anyway 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.070
 a lot to do 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.170
 at more than 34,000 100 flashed 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:22.460
 car drivers in a month they are now 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.460
 must handle purple is yet to come
