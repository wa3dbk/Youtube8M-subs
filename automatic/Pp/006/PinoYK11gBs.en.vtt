meter diameter and we had also boards at
the<00:01:56.850> nozzles<00:01:57.299> with<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.600> couple<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.049> millimeters

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
the nozzles with a couple of millimeters

the nozzles with a couple of millimeters
in<00:01:58.799> diameter<00:01:59.040> only<00:01:59.840> no<00:02:00.840> worries<00:02:01.229> as<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.799> see

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
in diameter only no worries as you see

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.730 
in diameter only no worries as you see
on<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.159> mash<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.700> was<00:02:02.850> just<00:02:03.090> solved<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
on the mash it was just solved the

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.959 
on the mash it was just solved the
results<00:02:04.740> showing<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.369> water<00:02:05.579> vapor

results showing the water vapor

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.119 
results showing the water vapor
concentration<00:02:06.899> offer<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.590> cause<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:07.890> the

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
concentration offer the cause of the

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.410 
concentration offer the cause of the
problem<00:02:08.310> on<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.789> silver<00:02:09.270> tray<00:02:09.300> the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
problem on a silver tray the

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.839 
problem on a silver tray the
gasps<00:02:10.660> simply<00:02:11.440> push<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:11.980> water<00:02:12.160> vapor<00:02:12.550> off

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
gasps simply push the water vapor off

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.150 
gasps simply push the water vapor off
the<00:02:13.090> field<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.840> outer<00:02:14.110> walls<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.980> the

the field to the outer walls of the
upper<00:02:15.430> chamber<00:02:15.849> and<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.239> cooling<00:02:16.630> tower<00:02:16.800> it

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
upper chamber and the cooling tower it

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.130 
upper chamber and the cooling tower it
was<00:02:18.069> so<00:02:18.280> because<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.819> nozzles<00:02:19.270> just<00:02:19.780> spray

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
was so because the nozzles just spray

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.740 
was so because the nozzles just spray
into<00:02:20.470> a<00:02:20.739> dead<00:02:20.950> area<00:02:21.190> into<00:02:22.090> a<00:02:22.120> separation

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
into a dead area into a separation

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.930 
into a dead area into a separation
bubble<00:02:23.140> far<00:02:23.500> away<00:02:23.770> from<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:24.220> main<00:02:24.370> gas<00:02:24.670> flow

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
bubble far away from the main gas flow

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.930 
bubble far away from the main gas flow
of<00:02:25.900> course<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.739> flue<00:02:26.950> gas<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:27.760> water

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
of course the flue gas and the water

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.330 
of course the flue gas and the water
vapor<00:02:28.300> mixed<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:29.230> cooling<00:02:29.620> also<00:02:30.010> happen

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
vapor mixed the cooling also happen

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.460 
vapor mixed the cooling also happen
anyway<00:02:30.760> because<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.510> quantity<00:02:31.989> of<00:02:32.020> the<00:02:32.260> water

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
anyway because the quantity of the water

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.699 
anyway because the quantity of the water
was<00:02:32.980> controlled<00:02:33.550> to<00:02:33.670> keep<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.080> 220<00:02:35.080> degrees<00:02:35.440> C

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
was controlled to keep the 220 degrees C

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.350 
was controlled to keep the 220 degrees C
at<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.040> bottom<00:02:36.310> of<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.550> tower<00:02:36.730> no<00:02:37.120> matter

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
at the bottom of the tower no matter

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.170 
at the bottom of the tower no matter
what<00:02:37.690> but<00:02:38.410> this<00:02:38.590> mixing<00:02:39.100> and<00:02:39.310> so<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:39.970> water

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
what but this mixing and so the water

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.210 
what but this mixing and so the water
cooling<00:02:40.780> were<00:02:41.019> just<00:02:41.260> not<00:02:41.410> effective<00:02:41.950> enough

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
cooling were just not effective enough

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.000 
cooling were just not effective enough
the<00:02:42.819> unnecessary<00:02:43.060> water<00:02:43.690> content<00:02:44.319> got<00:02:44.769> to<00:02:44.920> the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
the unnecessary water content got to the

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.309 
the unnecessary water content got to the
bottom<00:02:45.160> of<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.580> cooling<00:02:45.970> tower<00:02:46.000> and<00:02:46.510> combined

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
bottom of the cooling tower and combined

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.320 
bottom of the cooling tower and combined
with<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.620> dissolved<00:02:48.160> chemicals<00:02:48.670> it<00:02:49.030> just

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
with the dissolved chemicals it just

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.080 
with the dissolved chemicals it just
drew<00:02:49.569> in<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.750> metal<00:02:50.200> structure<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:51.610> solution

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
drew in the metal structure the solution

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.479 
drew in the metal structure the solution
was<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.660> make<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.380> flue<00:02:53.590> gas<00:02:53.799> and<00:02:54.069> water<00:02:54.250> vapor

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
was to make the flue gas and water vapor

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.330 
was to make the flue gas and water vapor
mix<00:02:55.120> better<00:02:55.390> so<00:02:56.049> the<00:02:56.200> same<00:02:56.440> cooling<00:02:56.920> can<00:02:57.190> be

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
mix better so the same cooling can be

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.009 
mix better so the same cooling can be
reached<00:02:57.610> with<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:57.880> appropriate<00:02:58.269> and<00:02:58.660> smaller

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
reached with the appropriate and smaller

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.800 
reached with the appropriate and smaller
amounts<00:02:59.530> of<00:02:59.650> water<00:03:00.239> how<00:03:01.239> did<00:03:01.269> we<00:03:01.630> do<00:03:01.780> that

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
amounts of water how did we do that

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.280 
amounts of water how did we do that
easily<00:03:02.170> with<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.739> CFD<00:03:03.250> simulation<00:03:03.630> well<00:03:04.630> this

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
easily with the CFD simulation well this

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.470 
easily with the CFD simulation well this
