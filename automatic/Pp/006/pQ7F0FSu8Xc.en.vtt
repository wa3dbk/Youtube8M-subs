00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
20% protein they actually give meat a

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.580 
20% protein they actually give meat a
run<00:00:45.059> for<00:00:45.270> its<00:00:45.390> money<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.809> protein<00:00:46.260> steaks

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
run for its money in the protein steaks

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
all the calories in nuts are digested it

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.289 
all the calories in nuts are digested it
looks<00:01:07.350> like<00:01:07.560> some<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.040> fat<00:01:08.299> passes

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
looks like some of the fat passes

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.789 
looks like some of the fat passes
straight<00:01:09.570> through<00:01:09.689> your<00:01:10.229> system

afternoon<00:01:16.790> it<00:01:17.790> looks<00:01:17.970> like<00:01:18.150> between<00:01:18.420> five<00:01:18.780> and

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
afternoon it looks like between five and

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.780 
afternoon it looks like between five and
fifteen<00:01:19.530> percent<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.100> energy<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.640> that

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
fifteen percent of the energy in that

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.330 
fifteen percent of the energy in that
snack<00:01:21.060> passes<00:01:22.049> through<00:01:22.380> your<00:01:22.560> system<00:01:23.040> that's

fantastic

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
fantastic

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.630 
fantastic
the<00:01:24.479> third<00:01:24.810> very<00:01:25.380> important<00:01:26.009> reason<00:01:26.490> is

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
the third very important reason is

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.179 
the third very important reason is
because<00:01:27.150> nuts<00:01:27.659> are<00:01:27.869> hard<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.290> digest<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.979> mean

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
because nuts are hard to digest I mean

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.399 
because nuts are hard to digest I mean
take<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> look<00:01:29.490> at<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:29.759> they're<00:01:30.420> hard<00:01:30.960> they're

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
take a look at this they're hard they're

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.770 
take a look at this they're hard they're
whole<00:01:31.979> foods<00:01:32.400> it's<00:01:32.700> physically<00:01:33.329> hard<00:01:33.360> to

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
whole foods it's physically hard to

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.719 
whole foods it's physically hard to
digest<00:01:33.990> your<00:01:34.500> digestive<00:01:35.100> system<00:01:35.159> your

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
digest your digestive system your

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.760 
digest your digestive system your
absorption<00:01:36.000> has<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.689> work<00:01:36.869> really<00:01:37.200> hard<00:01:37.500> and

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
absorption has to work really hard and

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.160 
absorption has to work really hard and
that's<00:01:38.220> why<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.460> seems<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.600> about<00:01:39.869> ten

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
that's why it seems that about ten

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.319 
that's why it seems that about ten
percent<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.710> energy<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.700> nuts<00:01:42.090> is

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
percent of the energy in nuts is

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.630 
percent of the energy in nuts is
actually<00:01:42.689> used<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.409> digest<00:01:44.220> them<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:44.549> it

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
actually used to digest them so it

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.520 
actually used to digest them so it

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
sounds weird but that's how it works so

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.950 
sounds weird but that's how it works so
the<00:01:56.490> three<00:01:56.729> reasons<00:01:56.939> they<00:01:57.360> make<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.750> feel

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
the three reasons they make you feel

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.469 
the three reasons they make you feel
full<00:01:58.310> secondly<00:01:59.310> not<00:01:59.820> all<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.090> fat<00:02:00.299> is

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
full secondly not all the fat is

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.999 
full secondly not all the fat is
absorbed<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.110> goes<00:02:01.350> through<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.829> system

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
absorbed it goes through the system

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.030 
absorbed it goes through the system
thirdly<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:03.149> increases<00:02:03.780> metabolic<00:02:04.049> rate<00:02:04.680> just

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
thirdly it increases metabolic rate just

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.130 
thirdly it increases metabolic rate just
slightly<00:02:05.579> but<00:02:06.060> if<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.270> regularly<00:02:06.719> eat<00:02:06.899> nuts
