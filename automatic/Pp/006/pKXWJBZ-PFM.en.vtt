00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
a technical point of view and they can't

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.620 
a technical point of view and they can't
be<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.189> that's<00:01:23.460> fine<00:01:23.670> but<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.180> really<00:01:24.270> think

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
be in that's fine but I really think

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.359 
be in that's fine but I really think
that<00:01:24.750> something<00:01:25.350> similar<00:01:25.799> needs<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.100> be<00:01:26.250> in

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
that something similar needs to be in

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.399 
that something similar needs to be in
and<00:01:26.610> I've<00:01:26.759> thought<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.210> system<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.840> in<00:01:28.200> a

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
and I've thought of a system that in a

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.679 
and I've thought of a system that in a
house<00:01:28.590> on<00:01:28.890> China<00:01:29.189> some<00:01:29.610> random<00:01:30.030> house<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.570> the

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
that this house is out there and people

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.550 
that this house is out there and people
start<00:02:32.400> scavenging<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.180> certain<00:02:33.570> area<00:02:34.050> I<00:02:34.320> just

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
start scavenging a certain area I just

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.930 
start scavenging a certain area I just
really<00:02:34.830> think<00:02:34.950> it'll<00:02:35.190> add<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.310> lot<00:02:35.520> to<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.790> game

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
really think it'll add a lot to the game

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.450 
really think it'll add a lot to the game
and<00:02:36.240> force<00:02:36.990> more<00:02:37.410> traffic<00:02:37.710> around<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.250> map

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
and force more traffic around the map

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.790 
and force more traffic around the map
rather<00:02:38.730> than<00:02:39.000> these<00:02:39.240> high<00:02:39.600> interest<00:02:40.320> areas

and you can set to respawn I really
think<00:02:53.490> there<00:02:53.730> should<00:02:53.910> be<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.030> system<00:02:54.390> within

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
think there should be a system within

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.140 
think there should be a system within
the<00:02:54.780> dayz<00:02:54.990> standalone<00:02:55.170> where<00:02:55.980> say<00:02:56.490> you<00:02:56.970> get<00:02:57.120> a

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
the dayz standalone where say you get a

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.150 
the dayz standalone where say you get a
bad<00:02:57.360> spawn<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:57.930> your<00:02:58.050> income<00:02:58.170> anchor<00:02:58.650> we<00:02:59.010> all

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
bad spawn and your income anchor we all

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.490 
bad spawn and your income anchor we all
know<00:02:59.280> what<00:02:59.400> that's<00:02:59.550> like<00:02:59.640> fucking<00:03:00.120> kamenka

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
know what that's like fucking kamenka

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.780 
know what that's like fucking kamenka
but<00:03:01.500> you're<00:03:01.830> down<00:03:01.980> in<00:03:02.010> kamenka<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.730> you

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
but you're down in kamenka and you

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:03.680 
but you're down in kamenka and you
decide<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.180> want<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.420> commit<00:03:03.660> suicide

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
decide you want to commit suicide

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.240 
decide you want to commit suicide
because<00:03:04.200> it's<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.440> bad<00:03:04.590> spawn<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.160> your

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
because it's a bad spawn and your

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.440 
because it's a bad spawn and your
friends<00:03:05.490> are<00:03:05.580> all<00:03:05.670> up<00:03:05.820> north<00:03:06.030> or<00:03:06.210> whatever

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
friends are all up north or whatever

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.670 
friends are all up north or whatever
that's<00:03:06.810> probably<00:03:07.140> going<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.350> happen<00:03:07.590> anyway

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
that's probably going to happen anyway

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.280 
that's probably going to happen anyway
that's<00:03:08.100> unavoidable<00:03:08.340> but<00:03:08.970> I<00:03:09.240> really<00:03:09.870> like<00:03:10.080> the

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
that's unavoidable but I really like the

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.780 
that's unavoidable but I really like the
thought<00:03:10.530> that<00:03:10.560> maybe<00:03:11.250> there<00:03:11.460> aren't<00:03:11.580> any

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
thought that maybe there aren't any

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.190 
thought that maybe there aren't any
zombies<00:03:12.090> around<00:03:12.210> so<00:03:12.480> you<00:03:12.570> can't<00:03:12.780> run<00:03:12.930> into<00:03:13.080> a

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
zombies around so you can't run into a

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.740 
zombies around so you can't run into a
horde<00:03:13.500> that<00:03:13.860> you<00:03:14.220> find<00:03:14.460> a<00:03:14.550> Makarov<00:03:14.910> with<00:03:15.270> a<00:03:15.300> few

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
horde that you find a Makarov with a few

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.960 
horde that you find a Makarov with a few
bullets<00:03:16.140> you<00:03:16.470> then<00:03:16.650> are<00:03:16.890> able<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:17.400> select<00:03:17.640> an

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
bullets you then are able to select an

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.490 
bullets you then are able to select an
option<00:03:18.090> where<00:03:18.450> you<00:03:18.540> put<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.750> Mac<00:03:18.990> or<00:03:19.020> after<00:03:19.380> your

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
option where you put a Mac or after your

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.310 
option where you put a Mac or after your
head<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:19.890> blow<00:03:20.100> your<00:03:20.310> own<00:03:20.340> brains<00:03:20.760> out<00:03:21.090> and

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
head and blow your own brains out and

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.020 
head and blow your own brains out and
maybe<00:03:22.320> there's<00:03:22.920> a<00:03:22.980> similar<00:03:23.340> system<00:03:23.520> with<00:03:23.820> pain

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
maybe there's a similar system with pain

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.150 
maybe there's a similar system with pain
pills<00:03:24.330> maybe<00:03:24.570> you<00:03:24.810> can<00:03:24.960> take<00:03:25.170> six<00:03:25.650> pain<00:03:25.890> pills

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
pills maybe you can take six pain pills

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.100 
pills maybe you can take six pain pills
in<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.430> go<00:03:26.610> and<00:03:26.880> then<00:03:27.000> you<00:03:27.180> pass<00:03:27.450> out<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:27.900> die

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
in a go and then you pass out and die

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.050 
in a go and then you pass out and die
maybe<00:03:28.650> you<00:03:28.950> can<00:03:29.100> use<00:03:29.310> your<00:03:29.460> hunting<00:03:29.760> knife<00:03:29.910> to

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
maybe you can use your hunting knife to

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.010 
maybe you can use your hunting knife to
slit<00:03:30.240> your<00:03:30.300> wrists<00:03:30.540> once<00:03:30.720> again<00:03:30.900> I'm<00:03:30.990> not

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
slit your wrists once again I'm not

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.320 
slit your wrists once again I'm not
trying<00:03:31.410> to<00:03:31.500> glorify<00:03:31.680> committing<00:03:32.550> suicide<00:03:33.000> but

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
trying to glorify committing suicide but

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.060 
trying to glorify committing suicide but
maybe<00:03:33.570> if<00:03:33.780> you<00:03:33.810> added<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.710> ultimate

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
maybe if you added the ultimate

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.070 
maybe if you added the ultimate
humiliation<00:03:35.340> that<00:03:35.790> someone<00:03:36.270> is<00:03:36.540> killing

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
humiliation that someone is killing

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.130 
humiliation that someone is killing
themselves<00:03:37.410> and<00:03:38.100> leaving<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:38.910> body<00:03:39.120> on<00:03:39.450> the

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
themselves and leaving a body on the

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.930 
themselves and leaving a body on the
Turner's<00:03:40.500> map<00:03:40.800> that<00:03:41.040> people<00:03:41.310> can<00:03:41.460> then<00:03:41.580> run<00:03:41.790> up

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
Turner's map that people can then run up

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.360 
Turner's map that people can then run up
to<00:03:42.150> and<00:03:42.480> you<00:03:42.960> know<00:03:43.080> investigate<00:03:43.800> and<00:03:44.010> it<00:03:44.100> says

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
to and you know investigate and it says

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.510 
to and you know investigate and it says
you<00:03:44.790> know<00:03:44.910> sniper<00:03:45.330> 66<00:03:46.320> has<00:03:46.620> killed<00:03:47.280> himself

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
you know sniper 66 has killed himself

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.310 
you know sniper 66 has killed himself
maybe<00:03:48.090> it<00:03:48.240> would<00:03:48.360> add<00:03:48.510> a<00:03:48.540> certain<00:03:48.900> level<00:03:49.170> of

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
maybe it would add a certain level of

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.170 
maybe it would add a certain level of
humiliation<00:03:50.040> that<00:03:50.250> people<00:03:50.700> will<00:03:50.880> stop

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
humiliation that people will stop

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.180 
humiliation that people will stop
committing<00:03:51.420> suicide<00:03:52.020> as<00:03:52.200> much<00:03:52.380> and<00:03:52.620> even<00:03:52.890> if

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
committing suicide as much and even if

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.070 
committing suicide as much and even if
it<00:03:53.280> doesn't<00:03:53.430> do<00:03:53.640> that<00:03:53.790> adds<00:03:54.120> a<00:03:54.270> new<00:03:54.630> level<00:03:54.990> of

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
it doesn't do that adds a new level of

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.010 
it doesn't do that adds a new level of
human<00:03:55.620> drama<00:03:55.950> to<00:03:56.420> respawning<00:03:57.420> I<00:03:57.570> just<00:03:57.870> like

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
human drama to respawning I just like

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.870 
human drama to respawning I just like
the<00:03:58.170> idea<00:03:58.500> of<00:03:58.560> people<00:03:58.950> having<00:03:59.130> to<00:03:59.340> scavenge

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
the idea of people having to scavenge

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.820 
the idea of people having to scavenge
ways<00:04:00.150> to<00:04:00.600> commit<00:04:00.870> suicide<00:04:01.320> because<00:04:01.440> we've<00:04:01.650> all

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
ways to commit suicide because we've all

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.490 
ways to commit suicide because we've all
seen<00:04:02.040> situations<00:04:02.340> in<00:04:03.180> Zombie<00:04:03.750> Survival<00:04:03.930> films

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
seen situations in Zombie Survival films

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.440 
seen situations in Zombie Survival films
and<00:04:04.770> stuff<00:04:05.250> like<00:04:05.520> The<00:04:05.670> Walking<00:04:05.820> Dead<00:04:06.060> where

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
and stuff like The Walking Dead where

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.360 
and stuff like The Walking Dead where
people<00:04:06.810> are<00:04:06.930> faced<00:04:07.140> with<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.770> horrible<00:04:08.190> life

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
people are faced with the horrible life

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.650 
people are faced with the horrible life
that<00:04:08.610> they<00:04:08.700> now<00:04:08.940> have<00:04:09.150> to<00:04:09.270> live<00:04:09.420> in<00:04:09.540> this

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
that they now have to live in this

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.630 
that they now have to live in this
zombie<00:04:09.990> apocalypse<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:10.620> they<00:04:10.830> they<00:04:11.160> opt<00:04:11.370> out

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
zombie apocalypse and they they opt out

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.580 
zombie apocalypse and they they opt out
they<00:04:11.850> kill<00:04:12.090> themselves<00:04:12.270> and<00:04:12.900> I<00:04:13.080> think<00:04:13.470> it

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
they kill themselves and I think it

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.250 
they kill themselves and I think it
totally<00:04:13.920> fits<00:04:14.100> in<00:04:14.370> with<00:04:14.610> the<00:04:14.790> dark<00:04:15.390> survival

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
totally fits in with the dark survival

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.680 
totally fits in with the dark survival
theme<00:04:16.680> that<00:04:17.010> Daisy's<00:04:17.430> going<00:04:17.760> with<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:18.180> little

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
theme that Daisy's going with a little

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.390 
theme that Daisy's going with a little
idea<00:04:18.989> I<00:04:19.109> thought<00:04:19.350> of<00:04:19.530> to<00:04:19.709> maybe<00:04:19.920> stop<00:04:20.250> the

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
idea I thought of to maybe stop the

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.130 
idea I thought of to maybe stop the
shoot<00:04:20.580> on<00:04:20.640> sight<00:04:20.850> problem<00:04:21.299> is<00:04:21.480> to<00:04:21.660> broadcast

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
shoot on sight problem is to broadcast

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.380 
shoot on sight problem is to broadcast
more<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.650> items<00:04:22.979> that<00:04:23.250> people<00:04:23.280> have<00:04:23.790> on<00:04:24.090> them

going to see you with a car tire and go

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:44.969 
going to see you with a car tire and go
oh<00:04:42.820> he<00:04:43.389> knows<00:04:43.630> where<00:04:43.900> a<00:04:43.930> car<00:04:44.199> is<00:04:44.410> I'm<00:04:44.710> going<00:04:44.889> to

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
oh he knows where a car is I'm going to

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:46.230 
oh he knows where a car is I'm going to
follow<00:04:45.160> him<00:04:45.280> and<00:04:45.610> anything<00:04:45.850> that<00:04:46.000> encourages

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
follow him and anything that encourages

follow him and anything that encourages
that<00:04:46.660> stalk<00:04:47.169> and<00:04:47.620> be<00:04:48.039> stalked<00:04:48.460> type<00:04:49.030> of

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
that stalk and be stalked type of

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.270 
that stalk and be stalked type of
gameplay<00:04:49.419> is<00:04:49.960> only<00:04:50.199> beneficial<00:04:50.680> and<00:04:50.919> maybe

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
gameplay is only beneficial and maybe

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.980 
gameplay is only beneficial and maybe
it's<00:04:51.460> the<00:04:51.550> same<00:04:51.729> with<00:04:51.910> car<00:04:52.180> engines<00:04:52.690> and<00:04:52.870> any

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
it's the same with car engines and any

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.950 
it's the same with car engines and any
large<00:04:53.320> item<00:04:53.710> and<00:04:54.039> maybe<00:04:54.370> even<00:04:54.789> that<00:04:55.479> you<00:04:55.780> can

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
large item and maybe even that you can

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.260 
large item and maybe even that you can
only<00:04:56.110> carry<00:04:56.410> one<00:04:56.590> of<00:04:56.919> these<00:04:57.310> items<00:04:57.580> on<00:04:58.210> your

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
only carry one of these items on your

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.900 
only carry one of these items on your
back<00:04:58.840> and<00:04:59.110> that<00:04:59.169> means<00:04:59.710> that<00:05:00.130> maybe<00:05:00.550> there's

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
back and that means that maybe there's

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.090 
back and that means that maybe there's
an<00:05:01.030> incentive<00:05:01.360> to<00:05:01.810> get<00:05:02.080> people<00:05:02.139> hold<00:05:02.860> them

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
an incentive to get people hold them

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.400 
an incentive to get people hold them
hostage<00:05:03.310> and<00:05:03.880> make<00:05:04.330> them<00:05:04.570> become<00:05:04.750> these<00:05:05.110> pack

end of it they could just shoot you when

end of it they could just shoot you when
they've<00:05:11.289> gotten<00:05:11.620> what<00:05:11.650> they<00:05:11.800> wanted<00:05:12.160> out<00:05:12.310> of

they've gotten what they wanted out of

they've gotten what they wanted out of
you<00:05:12.520> but<00:05:12.760> you<00:05:13.000> know<00:05:13.090> anything<00:05:13.479> that<00:05:13.600> gives<00:05:13.720> you

you but you know anything that gives you

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.689 
you but you know anything that gives you
a<00:05:13.900> few<00:05:14.229> more<00:05:14.380> seconds<00:05:14.770> of<00:05:14.889> being<00:05:15.039> alive<00:05:15.400> rather

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:15.699 
a few more seconds of being alive rather

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:18.240 
a few more seconds of being alive rather

on<00:05:18.400> the<00:05:18.550> floor<00:05:18.789> this<00:05:19.479> idea<00:05:19.840> has<00:05:19.870> been<00:05:20.169> talked

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
on the floor this idea has been talked

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.350 
on the floor this idea has been talked
to<00:05:20.620> death<00:05:20.830> but<00:05:21.010> it's<00:05:21.160> still<00:05:21.340> in<00:05:21.610> my<00:05:21.789> opinion

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
to death but it's still in my opinion

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.120 
to death but it's still in my opinion
one<00:05:22.660> of<00:05:22.720> the<00:05:22.840> most<00:05:23.050> fun<00:05:23.440> things<00:05:23.770> to<00:05:23.979> think

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
one of the most fun things to think

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.680 
one of the most fun things to think
about<00:05:24.280> and<00:05:24.610> that's<00:05:24.699> the<00:05:24.910> concept<00:05:25.270> of<00:05:25.419> players

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
about and that's the concept of players

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.870 
about and that's the concept of players
turning<00:05:26.500> into<00:05:26.830> zombies<00:05:27.220> and<00:05:27.490> oh<00:05:27.610> the<00:05:27.759> general

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
turning into zombies and oh the general

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.490 
turning into zombies and oh the general
consensus<00:05:28.240> is<00:05:28.599> by<00:05:28.870> the<00:05:28.930> community<00:05:29.169> and

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
consensus is by the community and

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.020 
consensus is by the community and
probably<00:05:29.770> rocket<00:05:30.190> that<00:05:30.340> it'll<00:05:30.729> never<00:05:30.910> be

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
probably rocket that it'll never be

probably rocket that it'll never be
implementing<00:05:31.630> I<00:05:31.750> don't<00:05:32.020> mean<00:05:32.229> players

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
implementing I don't mean players

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.379 
implementing I don't mean players
controlling<00:05:33.400> the<00:05:33.490> zombies<00:05:33.849> I<00:05:34.000> just<00:05:34.210> mean<00:05:34.360> that

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
controlling the zombies I just mean that

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:36.360 
controlling the zombies I just mean that
you<00:05:34.810> are<00:05:35.020> eventually<00:05:35.289> going<00:05:35.650> to<00:05:35.830> turn<00:05:36.039> into<00:05:36.250> a

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
you are eventually going to turn into a

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.159 
you are eventually going to turn into a
zombie<00:05:36.400> there<00:05:37.360> are<00:05:37.419> probably<00:05:37.630> better<00:05:37.780> ideas

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
zombie there are probably better ideas

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:39.870 
zombie there are probably better ideas
for<00:05:38.349> it<00:05:38.410> to<00:05:38.500> be<00:05:38.590> implemented<00:05:38.919> but<00:05:39.190> my<00:05:39.370> idea<00:05:39.639> is

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
for it to be implemented but my idea is

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.300 
for it to be implemented but my idea is
much<00:05:40.630> like<00:05:40.870> the<00:05:41.050> dayz<00:05:41.289> mod<00:05:41.650> you<00:05:41.919> get<00:05:42.160> the

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
much like the dayz mod you get the

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.640 
much like the dayz mod you get the
infection<00:05:42.460> but<00:05:43.150> somewhere<00:05:43.900> between<00:05:43.930> 30

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
infection but somewhere between 30

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.920 
infection but somewhere between 30
minutes<00:05:45.130> and<00:05:45.310> six<00:05:45.940> hours<00:05:46.300> or<00:05:46.510> something<00:05:46.840> like

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
minutes and six hours or something like

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.540 
minutes and six hours or something like
that<00:05:46.990> you<00:05:47.440> know<00:05:47.470> you're<00:05:47.830> going<00:05:48.010> to<00:05:48.130> turn<00:05:48.370> into

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
that you know you're going to turn into

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.129 
that you know you're going to turn into
a<00:05:48.639> zombie<00:05:48.729> and<00:05:49.030> there<00:05:49.240> are<00:05:49.330> ways<00:05:49.510> you<00:05:49.539> can<00:05:49.870> face

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:50.139 
a zombie and there are ways you can face
