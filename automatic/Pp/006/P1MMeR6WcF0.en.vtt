00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
good but let's go ahead and try this

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.570 
good but let's go ahead and try this
other<00:02:43.540> sponge<00:02:44.140> which<00:02:44.500> happens<00:02:45.069> to<00:02:45.130> be<00:02:45.220> shaped

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
other sponge which happens to be shaped

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.890 
other sponge which happens to be shaped

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
slightly different so yeah ok so we're

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.479 
slightly different so yeah ok so we're
going<00:02:49.989> to<00:02:50.079> go<00:02:50.110> ahead<00:02:50.200> in<00:02:50.709> there<00:02:50.980> I'm<00:02:51.220> going<00:02:51.430> to

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
going to go ahead in there I'm going to

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.309 
going to go ahead in there I'm going to
use<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:52.030> back<00:02:52.209> end<00:02:52.510> first<00:02:54.180> just<00:02:55.180> kind<00:02:55.420> of<00:02:55.510> get

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
use the back end first just kind of get

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.280 
use the back end first just kind of get
it<00:02:56.440> on<00:02:56.590> there<00:02:56.860> I<00:02:57.190> feel<00:02:58.150> like<00:02:58.269> it's<00:02:58.480> firmer<00:02:58.870> I

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
it on there I feel like it's firmer I

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.530 
it on there I feel like it's firmer I
feel<00:02:59.739> like<00:02:59.860> the<00:03:00.069> sponge<00:03:00.400> itself<00:03:00.670> is<00:03:01.180> a<00:03:01.209> little

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
feel like the sponge itself is a little

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.729 
feel like the sponge itself is a little
bit<00:03:01.690> firmer<00:03:02.230> which<00:03:03.130> is<00:03:03.280> kind<00:03:03.579> of<00:03:03.640> nice<00:03:03.849> and

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
bit firmer which is kind of nice and

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.370 
bit firmer which is kind of nice and
then<00:03:05.739> I'm<00:03:06.400> going<00:03:06.549> to<00:03:06.610> use<00:03:06.849> this<00:03:07.090> other<00:03:07.780> side<00:03:08.049> to

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
then I'm going to use this other side to

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.559 
then I'm going to use this other side to
kind<00:03:08.620> of<00:03:08.680> get<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.010> makeup<00:03:09.430> exactly<00:03:10.360> where<00:03:10.540> I

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569

I<00:03:23.720> don't<00:03:24.720> know<00:03:24.810> I<00:03:24.840> think<00:03:25.080> I<00:03:25.320> like<00:03:25.500> this<00:03:25.560> movie

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
I don't know I think I like this movie

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.940 
I don't know I think I like this movie
thing<00:03:26.400> because<00:03:26.880> it's<00:03:27.840> like<00:03:28.050> eight<00:03:28.500> bucks<00:03:30.950> vs.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
thing because it's like eight bucks vs.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:40.370 
thing because it's like eight bucks vs.
a<00:03:31.980> lot<00:03:32.310> more<00:03:33.320> so<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:37.590> then<00:03:37.920> um<00:03:39.200> yeah<00:03:40.200> that's

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
a lot more so and then um yeah that's

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.110 
a lot more so and then um yeah that's
just<00:03:40.710> really<00:03:40.860> for<00:03:41.130> that<00:03:41.160> area<00:03:41.490> but<00:03:41.730> again<00:03:41.970> you

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
just really for that area but again you

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.170 
just really for that area but again you
can<00:03:42.270> use<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.660> end<00:03:42.870> of<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.710> sponge<00:03:43.980> to<00:03:44.310> kind<00:03:44.550> of

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.520 

and<00:03:48.180> then<00:03:49.170> this<00:03:49.350> sponge<00:03:49.620> can<00:03:49.860> be<00:03:49.950> used<00:03:50.160> with

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
and then this sponge can be used with

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.410 
and then this sponge can be used with
the<00:03:52.530> spray<00:03:52.950> glacier<00:03:53.520> water<00:03:53.730> if<00:03:54.000> you<00:03:54.150> want<00:03:54.300> to

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
the spray glacier water if you want to

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.300 
the spray glacier water if you want to
do<00:03:54.540> touch-ups<00:03:54.870> it's<00:03:55.650> that's<00:03:55.950> what<00:03:56.160> it's

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
do touch-ups it's that's what it's

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.660 
do touch-ups it's that's what it's
really<00:03:56.460> great<00:03:56.760> for<00:03:56.820> I'd<00:03:57.270> say<00:04:01.040> okay<00:04:02.040> so<00:04:02.490> then

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
really great for I'd say okay so then

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.040 
really great for I'd say okay so then
after<00:04:02.910> this<00:04:03.210> you<00:04:03.450> can<00:04:03.570> just<00:04:03.720> set<00:04:03.870> it<00:04:03.900> with

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
after this you can just set it with

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.390 
after this you can just set it with
powder<00:04:04.110> but<00:04:06.320> that<00:04:07.320> was<00:04:07.470> my<00:04:07.590> comparison<00:04:08.250> of<00:04:08.340> the

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
powder but that was my comparison of the

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.080 
powder but that was my comparison of the
two<00:04:08.520> and<00:04:09.030> I'd<00:04:09.690> say<00:04:09.960> that<00:04:10.440> I<00:04:10.860> don't<00:04:11.370> know<00:04:11.820> I'd

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
two and I'd say that I don't know I'd

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.360 
two and I'd say that I don't know I'd
say<00:04:12.620> the<00:04:13.620> Beauty<00:04:14.040> Blender<00:04:14.250> I<00:04:16.190> don't<00:04:17.190> know<00:04:17.340> I

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
say the Beauty Blender I don't know I

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.039 
say the Beauty Blender I don't know I
think<00:04:17.580> I<00:04:17.880> think<00:04:18.150> I'd<00:04:18.269> prefer<00:04:18.299> this<00:04:18.840> one

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
think I think I'd prefer this one

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.440 
think I think I'd prefer this one
because<00:04:19.260> it's<00:04:20.190> firmer<00:04:20.760> you<00:04:20.970> could<00:04:21.120> do<00:04:21.209> a<00:04:21.239> lot

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
because it's firmer you could do a lot

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.510 
because it's firmer you could do a lot
more<00:04:21.510> with<00:04:21.870> it<00:04:21.900> you<00:04:22.169> can<00:04:22.200> even<00:04:22.620> use<00:04:22.890> the<00:04:23.070> ends

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
more with it you can even use the ends

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.460 
more with it you can even use the ends
if<00:04:23.640> you<00:04:23.760> wanted<00:04:24.060> to<00:04:24.180> do<00:04:24.330> any<00:04:24.540> rolling<00:04:24.990> motions
