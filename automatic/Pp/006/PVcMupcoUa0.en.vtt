move if you hold shift &amp; S on the

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:00.870 
move if you hold shift &amp; S on the
keyboard<00:02:54.440> it<00:02:54.650> will<00:02:54.980> duplicate<00:02:55.519> it

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.600 

so<00:03:01.450> what<00:03:01.570> I'm<00:03:01.660> going<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:01.840> do<00:03:02.020> here<00:03:02.050> is

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
so what I'm going to do here is

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
so what I'm going to do here is
duplicate<00:03:03.610> these<00:03:03.760> over<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:04.330> over<00:03:04.420> again

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
duplicate these over and over again

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:11.880 
duplicate these over and over again
until<00:03:04.840> I<00:03:05.230> reach<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.740> bottom<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:11.170> hopefully<00:03:11.590> I

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
until I reach the bottom and hopefully I

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.650 
until I reach the bottom and hopefully I
space<00:03:12.250> these<00:03:12.490> just<00:03:13.120> about<00:03:13.390> right<00:03:13.740> so<00:03:14.740> it's<00:03:15.660> yep

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
space these just about right so it's yep

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.290 
space these just about right so it's yep
it<00:03:16.900> should<00:03:17.230> be<00:03:17.260> good<00:03:17.560> right<00:03:18.100> there<00:03:19.620> ok<00:03:21.300> I'm

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
it should be good right there ok I'm

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.760 
it should be good right there ok I'm
going<00:03:22.420> to<00:03:22.480> shift<00:03:22.750> s<00:03:22.960> it<00:03:23.140> one<00:03:23.260> more<00:03:23.410> time<00:03:23.590> and

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
going to shift s it one more time and

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.280 
going to shift s it one more time and
bring<00:03:23.920> it<00:03:24.070> back<00:03:24.100> up<00:03:24.490> to<00:03:24.610> the<00:03:24.640> top<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:25.290> this

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
bring it back up to the top and this

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.140 
bring it back up to the top and this
time<00:03:26.560> I'm<00:03:26.740> going<00:03:26.860> to<00:03:26.920> check<00:03:27.190> at<00:03:27.370> it<00:03:27.520> and<00:03:27.670> then

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
time I'm going to check at it and then

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:36.480 
time I'm going to check at it and then
turn<00:03:28.480> it<00:03:31.500> uncheck<00:03:32.500> to<00:03:32.620> edit<00:03:32.920> go<00:03:33.490> to<00:03:33.550> move<00:03:35.490> so

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
turn it uncheck to edit go to move so

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.680 
turn it uncheck to edit go to move so
what<00:03:36.640> I'm<00:03:36.730> going<00:03:36.820> to<00:03:36.880> do<00:03:37.030> is<00:03:37.180> build<00:03:37.360> a<00:03:37.450> chain

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
what I'm going to do is build a chain

00:03:37.690 --> 00:04:01.580 
what I'm going to do is build a chain
yep<00:03:38.110> so<00:03:38.710> shift<00:03:39.010> us<00:03:41.790> shift<00:03:42.790> s

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.160

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
okay check at it now there's a

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.729 
okay check at it now there's a
difference<00:04:10.510> here<00:04:10.720> I<00:04:10.900> do<00:04:10.959> not<00:04:11.260> have<00:04:11.470> to<00:04:11.590> use

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
difference here I do not have to use

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.300 
difference here I do not have to use

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
that MZ rgr be grabber for this there's

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.190 
that MZ rgr be grabber for this there's
another<00:04:15.610> way<00:04:15.790> to<00:04:15.849> do<00:04:16.030> it<00:04:16.180> that's<00:04:16.480> why<00:04:16.660> I<00:04:16.690> wanted

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
another way to do it that's why I wanted

to make this one it shows you how to
make<00:04:19.389> a<00:04:19.450> tileable<00:04:19.959> alpha<00:04:20.850> 2<00:04:21.850> you<00:04:22.690> can<00:04:22.750> start

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
make a tileable alpha 2 you can start

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.670 
make a tileable alpha 2 you can start
now<00:04:23.200> exploring<00:04:23.950> the<00:04:24.160> Alpha<00:04:24.460> palette<00:04:25.080> in<00:04:26.080> here

one where I make that that whole palette
now<00:05:15.700> you'll<00:05:16.150> see<00:05:16.210> a<00:05:16.360> different<00:05:16.570> story<00:05:17.020> with

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
now you'll see a different story with

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.920 
now you'll see a different story with
this<00:05:17.440> alpha<00:05:17.830> if<00:05:18.700> I<00:05:18.820> click<00:05:18.880> and<00:05:19.210> drag<00:05:19.330> it<00:05:19.510> out<00:05:19.630> it

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
this alpha if I click and drag it out it

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.860 
this alpha if I click and drag it out it
looks<00:05:20.440> like<00:05:20.620> this<00:05:20.860> so<00:05:21.850> how<00:05:22.090> do<00:05:22.150> I<00:05:22.300> produce<00:05:22.570> a

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
looks like this so how do I produce a

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:29.370 
looks like this so how do I produce a
chain<00:05:23.140> from<00:05:23.380> this<00:05:23.880> if<00:05:24.880> I<00:05:24.970> use<00:05:25.150> dot<00:05:27.870> it<00:05:28.870> produces

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
chain from this if I use dot it produces

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.890 
chain from this if I use dot it produces
something<00:05:29.590> that<00:05:29.830> was<00:05:29.950> awful<00:05:30.900> absolutely

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
something that was awful absolutely

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.719 
something that was awful absolutely
awful<00:05:32.370> well<00:05:33.370> what<00:05:34.150> happens<00:05:34.660> is<00:05:35.250> these<00:05:36.250> brushes

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
awful well what happens is these brushes

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.830 
awful well what happens is these brushes
the<00:05:37.270> ones<00:05:37.479> that<00:05:37.840> need<00:05:38.710> to<00:05:38.830> be<00:05:38.860> titled<00:05:39.720> need<00:05:40.720> to

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
the ones that need to be titled need to

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.710 
the ones that need to be titled need to
have<00:05:41.080> a<00:05:41.110> different<00:05:41.800> thing<00:05:42.250> on<00:05:42.460> and<00:05:42.729> under

have a different thing on and under

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.760 
have a different thing on and under
stroke<00:05:44.350> you'll<00:05:45.190> find<00:05:45.520> there's<00:05:45.729> a<00:05:45.789> roll<00:05:46.770> okay

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.300 
as it ends the frame it's going to go
again<00:05:54.820> if<00:05:55.030> it's<00:05:55.930> too<00:05:56.229> it's<00:05:56.560> going<00:05:56.710> to<00:05:56.740> go<00:05:56.919> twice

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
again if it's too it's going to go twice

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.300 
again if it's too it's going to go twice
the<00:05:57.700> amount<00:05:58.380> so<00:05:59.380> we're<00:05:59.680> going<00:05:59.770> to<00:05:59.860> keep<00:06:00.039> it<00:06:00.160> at

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
the amount so we're going to keep it at

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:07.200 
the amount so we're going to keep it at
one<00:06:01.860> that<00:06:02.860> means<00:06:03.160> i<00:06:03.460> can<00:06:03.639> go<00:06:03.760> in<00:06:03.910> here<00:06:04.240> and<00:06:06.210> make

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
one that means i can go in here and make

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
one that means i can go in here and make
chain

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.230 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:20.510 

and<00:06:13.740> this<00:06:13.980> is<00:06:14.130> very<00:06:14.400> addicting<00:06:14.880> to<00:06:15.000> do

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.320 

now<00:06:21.289> let<00:06:22.289> me<00:06:22.319> go<00:06:22.620> into<00:06:23.099> the<00:06:23.250> fact<00:06:23.520> that<00:06:23.699> there

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330 
now let me go into the fact that there

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.600 
now let me go into the fact that there
is<00:06:24.360> the<00:06:24.690> other<00:06:24.870> ones<00:06:25.169> out<00:06:25.379> here<00:06:25.440> let's<00:06:26.400> say<00:06:26.550> I

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
is the other ones out here let's say I

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.879 
is the other ones out here let's say I
need<00:06:26.699> to<00:06:26.910> make<00:06:27.060> that<00:06:27.240> chain<00:06:27.629> that<00:06:28.139> is<00:06:28.470> very

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:28.889 
need to make that chain that is very

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:37.570 
need to make that chain that is very
elongated<00:06:29.810> okay<00:06:30.810> well<00:06:31.620> I<00:06:31.860> could<00:06:32.159> turn<00:06:32.370> this<00:06:32.610> 22

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.830 

now<00:06:38.580> you<00:06:38.699> see<00:06:38.879> i<00:06:38.909> have<00:06:39.000> a<00:06:39.120> whole<00:06:39.419> different

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 
now you see i have a whole different

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:45.140 
now you see i have a whole different
look<00:06:39.990> to<00:06:40.050> the<00:06:40.259> chain<00:06:42.409> so<00:06:43.409> well<00:06:44.280> that's<00:06:44.520> 4.5

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150 
look to the chain so well that's 4.5

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.939 
look to the chain so well that's 4.5
still<00:06:45.449> okay<00:06:46.050> i<00:06:46.080> was<00:06:46.259> wondering<00:06:46.560> why<00:06:46.620> it<00:06:46.650> was<00:06:46.830> so

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:46.949 
still okay i was wondering why it was so

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:50.839 
still okay i was wondering why it was so
bad<00:06:47.159> so<00:06:47.610> too<00:06:48.470> and<00:06:49.470> now<00:06:49.860> I<00:06:49.889> got<00:06:50.099> that<00:06:50.310> one<00:06:50.550> chain

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:50.849 
bad so too and now I got that one chain

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:56.510 
bad so too and now I got that one chain
that<00:06:51.180> has<00:06:51.419> a<00:06:52.190> longer<00:06:53.190> linked<00:06:55.069> so<00:06:56.069> just<00:06:56.400> by

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 
that has a longer linked so just by

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.379 
that has a longer linked so just by
using<00:06:56.970> roll<00:06:58.729> you<00:06:59.729> can<00:06:59.789> see<00:07:00.060> that<00:07:00.090> I<00:07:00.270> can

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:00.389 
using roll you can see that I can

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:01.999 
using roll you can see that I can
produce<00:07:00.750> a<00:07:01.050> lot<00:07:01.229> of<00:07:01.259> different<00:07:01.680> types<00:07:01.860> of

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:02.009 
produce a lot of different types of

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:07.999 
produce a lot of different types of
chain<00:07:02.750> that's<00:07:03.750> what's<00:07:03.990> important<00:07:06.680> alright<00:07:07.680> so

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:08.009 
chain that's what's important alright so

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:10.879 
chain that's what's important alright so
now<00:07:08.190> that<00:07:08.430> we've<00:07:08.639> had<00:07:08.669> a<00:07:08.940> complex<00:07:09.659> alpha<00:07:10.139> being

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:10.889 
now that we've had a complex alpha being

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:14.469 
now that we've had a complex alpha being
produced<00:07:11.360> how<00:07:12.360> do<00:07:12.419> we<00:07:12.599> save<00:07:13.110> this<00:07:13.560> as<00:07:13.830> a<00:07:13.860> brush

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:14.479 
produced how do we save this as a brush

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:17.629 
produced how do we save this as a brush
so<00:07:15.479> I<00:07:15.509> always<00:07:15.990> have<00:07:16.259> it<00:07:16.469> here's<00:07:16.979> my<00:07:17.039> standard

00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:17.639 
so I always have it here's my standard

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:20.629 
so I always have it here's my standard
brush<00:07:17.880> here's<00:07:18.449> my<00:07:18.719> stroke<00:07:19.110> here's<00:07:19.889> my<00:07:20.129> alpha

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 
brush here's my stroke here's my alpha

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:23.270 
brush here's my stroke here's my alpha
and<00:07:20.819> I<00:07:21.300> have<00:07:21.509> roll<00:07:21.780> on<00:07:22.020> I<00:07:22.289> want<00:07:22.800> to<00:07:22.860> take<00:07:23.039> all

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 
and I have roll on I want to take all

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.809 
and I have roll on I want to take all
that<00:07:23.759> and<00:07:24.120> turn<00:07:24.930> it<00:07:25.139> into<00:07:25.289> a<00:07:25.469> brush<00:07:25.830> and<00:07:26.069> mount

00:07:26.809 --> 00:07:26.819 
that and turn it into a brush and mount

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:30.200 
that and turn it into a brush and mount
it<00:07:26.969> inside<00:07:27.509> here<00:07:28.110> in<00:07:28.289> my<00:07:28.469> brush<00:07:28.860> collection<00:07:29.219> ok

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:30.210 
it inside here in my brush collection ok

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.889 
it inside here in my brush collection ok
so<00:07:30.930> that's<00:07:31.139> in<00:07:31.349> the<00:07:31.409> next<00:07:31.650> video
