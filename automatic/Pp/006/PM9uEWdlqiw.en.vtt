00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.950
 turn them off you have to pay for it 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:09.590
 the piece of spider is not there yet of the 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:13.190
 movie that disturbing with the 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.830
 cicciolina come i came i came to you 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.210
 barberá put venom quote you a joke 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.210
 let's see a couple of ducklings 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:31.110
 if you made love to the camera for a 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.380
 art 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:40.100
 spider-man if you go I look at you like the 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.100
 chopped that this does not happen in the boludo 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:56.350
 to see how the fuck ends 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:59.680
 and that does not separation 6 and the players 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.840
 they grow said the wave your good did 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.950
 another pass in the core and chanel this happens 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.900
 only in sake chanes already in dad 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:14.240
 I'm going to stick a little test myself 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:16.159
 it's just I do not think so 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.290
 amazing 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:22.910
 if it was not so muff and another hand 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.910
 partly it sheltered him to the look 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.040
 for you 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.950
 in December of 1994 marvel comics edited 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.740
 a mini - series of four numbers called 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.720
 - separation essay and I thought that 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.640
 this game referred to said 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.590
 miniseries since it was called the same but 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.120
 after reading these comics and getting bored 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.280
 because it's from the empty period 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.290
 cranial noventures in which 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.570
 they saw these daisies had a fart 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.560
 mentally I realized that I only shared 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.300
 characters 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.610
 this game is inspired by the events 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.150
 that are seen in another miniseries called the 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.550
 non lethal protector who is a beat'em 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.310
 up started in 95 and is considered the 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.900
 sequel to the maximum embody in this one 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.520
 we can choose between espanyol crank 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.320
 one to go boob the ones that 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.630
 cross and allows us to play two 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.520
 players had their version of super 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.290
 nintendo and was even ported for pc 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.660
 but I am telling you of the wishes 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.660
 genesis because it is what I have and I know 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.730
 re banking the game was received with 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.560
 mostly negative reviews that 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.660
 highlight the lack of variety in the 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.120
 enemies secondary characters and the 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.630
 streets but do not fuck in here a fuck no 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.760
 critics matter 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.070
 the songs / level and level were 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.950
 loose in a comic drawing of one of 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.230
 the characters and a text ball that 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.680
 is in another language because life 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.390
 pirate is so he does it 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.090
 but when we gave balls to the 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.950
 castings on a biste map we just squeeze 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.719
 the buttons until you can follow him 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.030
 splitting the guy to follow 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:03.219
 advancing these were the times of the 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.680
 16 bits we do not need a story 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:07.770
 very elaborate graphics or excuses to go 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.010
 to slap some 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.450
 looks as it looks dances like dances 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.100
 sentra that is good is not super 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.020
 remarkable but is more than good is 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.390
 energetic and accompanies the shake that should be 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.340
 have a beat'em up and if it does not cost you 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.530
 a lot of passing levels do not repeat 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.120
 infinitely as in other titles the 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.770
 first time I played them when it started 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.080
 I was a bit disappointed at the lack of 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.640
 detail in the graphics since we were coming 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.850
 of the maximum in carnage where the 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.800
 sprites were larger and more detailed 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.390
 but the little time was passed to me not only 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.040
 for the fun but for the 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.230
 animation in fluency that are a lot 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.660
 best levels are all different 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.390
 and it does not repeat a street scene one 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.730
 and again as it happens in other victims 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.550
 we have to throw pineapples kicks jumps 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.160
 jumps with kicks net to catch network 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.080
 to attract swing we climb the 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.360
 power of the two buttons and attract two 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.580
 enemies and crash those who feel very 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.890
 well it's not difficult and even at times 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.990
 it's easy and if you make good combos without 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.670
 lose in a certain amount of time the 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.890
 Dead enemies let loose hearts 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.110
 to replenish your life and sometimes you 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.060
 loose because if you win or things 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.950
 or not 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.170
 It does not have continuus but it has a system 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.290
 password that simplifies and saves the 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.790
 work at the time of retaking the play 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.639
 we have to call the cape america os 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.710
 ryder jockey and daredevil the enemies do not 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.419
 they repeat so much at the beginning it seems 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.070
 what if these kids and you're 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.440
 minardi were at the maximum in 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.210
 carnage and they moved the same but then 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.460
 these boys appear and apart from 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.910
 hit dt revolean grenades and shoot 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.020
 in the distance 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.490
 he also dances this also dances 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.350
 the voice those bosses vary between 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:47.340
 kids from the jury that would be the 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.380
 jury and the blind are 5 and 5 of 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.940
 jury are not superhuman but are 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.100
 mercenaries armed to the teeth 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.440
 that are going to put breakwater at the end of 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.330
 some levels sometimes come alone already 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.590
 Sometimes they come in pairs they are not very 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.770
 difficult but they become a bit 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:04.170
 tedious the blind are a kind 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.450
 of human hybrid someone or a human 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.890
 enchastrado of an alien and are a little 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.480
 more fucked up than the previous ones 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.150
 they always have a pattern to follow and there 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.830
 have the patience to beat them at 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.200
 end of the game you have to go to 10 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.320
 voices that come as a couple and then 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:22.530
 appears carnage the final boss who is 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.030
 pesadito rather then better is 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.190
 than the maximum in carnage but if you 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.040
 I assure you it is more fluid more fun 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.960
 has more variety is more tuned the 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.550
 password system helps restart and you 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.110
 allows us to play from sides something that we know 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.569
 what makes beat'em apps 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.610
 infinitely more enjoyable 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:40.559
 pajín to the critics hater and his 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.050

 of gaming in the history chanel 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:49.439
 If you ask me a score I'll give you a 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:54.469
 solid 88 vinegars endure the binary 

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:54.469
 subway vinegar 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.380
