00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
explanation with that because the show

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.219 
explanation with that because the show
is<00:01:16.470> more<00:01:16.500> about<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.040> people<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:18.229> human

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
is more about the people that human

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.200 
is more about the people that human
characters<00:01:19.619> are<00:01:19.770> alive<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.100> all<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.909> them<00:01:21.060> B's

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
characters are alive so all of them B's

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.810 
characters are alive so all of them B's
kind<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.450> fade<00:01:21.689> into<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.020> grey<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:23.250> know<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.430> just

kind of fade into a grey you know I just

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.060

I'm<00:02:29.959> going<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.200> take<00:02:30.490> spirit<00:02:31.490> gum<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:31.910> I'm

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
I'm going to take spirit gum and I'm

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.540 
I'm going to take spirit gum and I'm
going<00:02:32.600> to<00:02:32.810> apply<00:02:33.260> it<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.740> edges<00:02:33.920> where<00:02:34.520> the

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
going to apply it to the edges where the

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.000 
going to apply it to the edges where the
lines<00:02:34.850> are<00:02:35.090> so<00:02:35.330> I<00:02:35.360> know<00:02:35.480> where<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:36.560> glue<00:02:36.770> will

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
lines are so I know where the glue will

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.940 
lines are so I know where the glue will
be<00:02:37.220> needed<00:02:37.520> to<00:02:37.550> hold<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.120> mask<00:02:38.330> down<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:39.650> once

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
be needed to hold the mask down and once

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.770 
be needed to hold the mask down and once
I'm<00:02:40.160> done<00:02:40.310> with<00:02:40.370> that<00:02:40.730> I'm<00:02:41.090> going<00:02:41.360> to<00:02:41.510> go<00:02:41.690> ahead

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
I'm done with that I'm going to go ahead

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.910 
I'm done with that I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:42.400> use<00:02:43.400> a<00:02:43.670> spatula<00:02:44.120> to<00:02:44.690> tap<00:02:44.989> on<00:02:45.320> the<00:02:45.560> spirit

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
and use a spatula to tap on the spirit

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
gum to make it tacky I like using this

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.630 
gum to make it tacky I like using this
instead<00:02:48.410> of<00:02:48.500> my<00:02:48.650> fingers<00:02:49.040> because<00:02:49.280> it's<00:02:49.550> a

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
instead of my fingers because it's a

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.630 
instead of my fingers because it's a
little<00:02:49.820> less<00:02:50.120> messy<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:51.500> once<00:02:52.310> you're<00:02:52.459> doing

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
little less messy and once you're doing

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.540 
little less messy and once you're doing
that<00:02:53.030> you<00:02:53.600> can<00:02:53.780> move<00:02:53.959> on<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.680> sticking<00:02:55.340> the

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
that you can move on to sticking the

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.850 
that you can move on to sticking the
mask<00:02:55.760> on<00:02:56.030> to<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.300> face<00:02:56.510> so<00:02:56.810> I'm<00:02:57.290> applying<00:02:57.560> the

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
mask on to the face so I'm applying the

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.380 
mask on to the face so I'm applying the
massiveness<00:02:58.190> pressing<00:02:58.670> it<00:02:58.760> down<00:02:58.970> I<00:02:59.000> want<00:02:59.270> to

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
massiveness pressing it down I want to

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.680 
massiveness pressing it down I want to
where<00:02:59.630> I<00:02:59.660> do<00:02:59.750> the<00:02:59.959> spirit<00:03:00.380> gum<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:01.330> if<00:03:02.330> any

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
where I do the spirit gum and if any

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.900 
where I do the spirit gum and if any
areas<00:03:03.110> are<00:03:03.290> still<00:03:03.620> lifting<00:03:04.040> which<00:03:04.310> is<00:03:04.520> usually

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
areas are still lifting which is usually

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.600 
areas are still lifting which is usually
around<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:05.510> edges<00:03:05.930> I'll<00:03:06.290> put<00:03:06.950> a<00:03:07.190> little<00:03:07.430> more

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
around the edges I'll put a little more

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.090 
around the edges I'll put a little more
spirit<00:03:08.420> gums<00:03:08.630> to<00:03:08.930> make<00:03:09.080> sure<00:03:09.260> that<00:03:09.410> it<00:03:09.590> sticks

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
spirit gums to make sure that it sticks

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.100 
spirit gums to make sure that it sticks
down<00:03:10.370> nice<00:03:10.700> and<00:03:10.730> securely<00:03:11.480> you<00:03:11.750> don't<00:03:11.930> want

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
down nice and securely you don't want

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.340 
down nice and securely you don't want
anything<00:03:12.290> flopping<00:03:12.920> around<00:03:13.840> now<00:03:14.840> that<00:03:15.110> that's

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
anything flopping around now that that's

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.039 
anything flopping around now that that's
on<00:03:15.709> applying<00:03:16.370> modeling<00:03:17.060> wax<00:03:17.299> to<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.690> edges<00:03:18.019> of

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
on applying modeling wax to the edges of

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.710 
on applying modeling wax to the edges of
the<00:03:18.440> prosthetic<00:03:18.830> and<00:03:19.220> onto<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.549> skin<00:03:19.820> I<00:03:20.090> find

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
the prosthetic and onto the skin I find

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.300 
the prosthetic and onto the skin I find
that<00:03:20.810> this<00:03:20.959> really<00:03:21.019> helps<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:21.680> blood<00:03:21.830> and<00:03:22.190> a

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
that this really helps the blood and a

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.560 
that this really helps the blood and a
little<00:03:22.549> bit<00:03:22.670> more<00:03:22.910> and<00:03:23.060> makes<00:03:23.209> it<00:03:23.360> a<00:03:23.420> little

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
little bit more and makes it a little

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.009 
little bit more and makes it a little
bit<00:03:23.690> more<00:03:23.810> realistic<00:03:24.170> looking<00:03:25.209> so<00:03:26.209> once<00:03:26.480> I<00:03:26.810> put

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
bit more realistic looking so once I put

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.690 
bit more realistic looking so once I put
on<00:03:27.080> the<00:03:27.260> modeling<00:03:27.650> wax<00:03:27.890> I'm<00:03:28.160> going<00:03:28.340> to<00:03:28.430> seal<00:03:28.670> it

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
on the modeling wax I'm going to seal it

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.530 
on the modeling wax I'm going to seal it
all<00:03:29.060> with<00:03:29.480> liquid<00:03:29.959> latex<00:03:30.440> and<00:03:30.820> I<00:03:31.820> just<00:03:32.239> apply

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
all with liquid latex and I just apply

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.509 
all with liquid latex and I just apply
it<00:03:32.600> with<00:03:32.750> a<00:03:32.780> cheap<00:03:33.230> disposable<00:03:33.620> brush<00:03:34.340> from

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
it with a cheap disposable brush from

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.840 
it with a cheap disposable brush from
the<00:03:34.720> art<00:03:35.720> store<00:03:36.230> and<00:03:36.560> this<00:03:37.130> is<00:03:37.280> going<00:03:37.549> to<00:03:37.670> help

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
the art store and this is going to help

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.440 
the art store and this is going to help
seal<00:03:38.329> the<00:03:38.600> modeling<00:03:39.049> wax<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:40.070> also<00:03:40.549> kind<00:03:41.390> of

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
seal the modeling wax and also kind of

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.440 
seal the modeling wax and also kind of
create<00:03:41.750> more<00:03:41.930> texture<00:03:42.380> and<00:03:42.620> a<00:03:42.709> skin<00:03:42.980> like<00:03:43.450> edge

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
create more texture and a skin like edge

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.780 
create more texture and a skin like edge
to<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:45.320> mask<00:03:47.290> so<00:03:48.290> once<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.799> latex<00:03:49.190> is<00:03:49.400> on<00:03:49.610> you

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
to the mask so once the latex is on you

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.060 
to the mask so once the latex is on you
can<00:03:49.970> go<00:03:50.150> ahead<00:03:50.329> and<00:03:50.570> start<00:03:51.049> getting<00:03:51.320> a<00:03:51.739> paint

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
can go ahead and start getting a paint

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.819 
can go ahead and start getting a paint
on<00:03:52.340> so<00:03:53.269> I'm<00:03:53.510> actually<00:03:53.750> mixing<00:03:54.380> a<00:03:54.440> couple<00:03:54.769> of

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
on so I'm actually mixing a couple of

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.300 
on so I'm actually mixing a couple of
different<00:03:55.100> grease<00:03:55.370> paints<00:03:56.320> using<00:03:57.320> their<00:03:57.680> the

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
different grease paints using their the

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.910 
different grease paints using their the
graftobian<00:03:59.000> FX<00:03:59.690> wheels<00:03:59.959> I'm<00:04:00.200> doing<00:04:00.560> a<00:04:00.650> nude

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
graftobian FX wheels I'm doing a nude

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.770 
graftobian FX wheels I'm doing a nude
color<00:04:01.310> mix<00:04:01.610> for<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:01.850> black<00:04:02.120> to<00:04:02.390> create<00:04:02.630> this

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
color mix for the black to create this

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.850 
color mix for the black to create this
gray<00:04:03.680> pallor<00:04:04.660> mixed<00:04:05.660> with<00:04:05.870> little<00:04:06.200> areas<00:04:06.620> of

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
gray pallor mixed with little areas of

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.370 
gray pallor mixed with little areas of
cream<00:04:07.459> so<00:04:08.269> that<00:04:08.420> way<00:04:08.570> I<00:04:08.600> has<00:04:08.870> a<00:04:08.900> little<00:04:09.170> bit<00:04:09.260> of

cream so that way I has a little bit of
a<00:04:09.500> 3d<00:04:10.010> effect<00:04:10.269> so<00:04:11.269> once<00:04:11.840> that's<00:04:12.079> on<00:04:12.440> now<00:04:12.860> it's

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
a 3d effect so once that's on now it's

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.640 
a 3d effect so once that's on now it's

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
I'm starting out by

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.390 
I'm starting out by
shading<00:04:18.820> in<00:04:19.000> the<00:04:19.450> areas<00:04:20.080> that<00:04:20.110> are<00:04:20.560> deeper

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
shading in the areas that are deeper

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.280 
shading in the areas that are deeper
with<00:04:21.880> a<00:04:21.910> darker<00:04:22.330> color<00:04:22.360> to<00:04:22.720> make<00:04:22.870> it<00:04:22.990> seem<00:04:23.170> like

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
with a darker color to make it seem like

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.110 
with a darker color to make it seem like
they<00:04:23.470> are<00:04:23.650> really<00:04:23.890> deep<00:04:24.280> and<00:04:24.550> that<00:04:24.670> includes

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
they are really deep and that includes

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.390 
they are really deep and that includes
the<00:04:25.900> eyeball<00:04:26.320> sockets<00:04:26.830> and<00:04:26.950> this<00:04:27.070> is<00:04:27.190> where

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
the eyeball sockets and this is where

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.510 
the eyeball sockets and this is where
the<00:04:28.060> flesh<00:04:28.390> has<00:04:28.630> decayed<00:04:29.110> and<00:04:29.680> therefore<00:04:30.370> it's

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
the flesh has decayed and therefore it's

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.870 
the flesh has decayed and therefore it's
a<00:04:30.610> darker<00:04:31.030> shadow<00:04:31.270> color<00:04:31.720> there<00:04:32.080> and<00:04:32.730> I'm<00:04:33.730> me

either

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.639 
either
and<00:06:52.800> once<00:06:53.550> that's<00:06:53.819> all<00:06:54.089> done<00:06:54.119> now<00:06:54.539> I<00:06:54.959> can<00:06:55.439> just

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:55.649 
and once that's all done now I can just

00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:57.469 
and once that's all done now I can just
add<00:06:56.309> a<00:06:56.369> little<00:06:56.580> bit<00:06:56.699> more<00:06:56.939> black<00:06:57.119> so<00:06:57.360> the<00:06:57.449> eye

00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479 
add a little bit more black so the eye

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:01.670 
add a little bit more black so the eye
ball<00:06:57.899> sockets<00:06:59.119> touch<00:07:00.119> up<00:07:00.360> here<00:07:00.930> and<00:07:01.139> there<00:07:01.379> and

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 
ball sockets touch up here and there and

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.619 
ball sockets touch up here and there and
now<00:07:01.740> it's<00:07:02.039> time<00:07:02.249> for<00:07:02.279> the<00:07:02.610> blood<00:07:02.999> the<00:07:03.300> liquid

00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:03.629 
now it's time for the blood the liquid

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:06.019 
now it's time for the blood the liquid
stage<00:07:04.199> of<00:07:04.379> blood<00:07:04.559> I'm<00:07:05.069> plying<00:07:05.309> it<00:07:05.550> with<00:07:05.729> a

00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:06.029 
stage of blood I'm plying it with a

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:08.480 
stage of blood I'm plying it with a
dropper<00:07:06.809> so<00:07:07.080> that<00:07:07.680> way<00:07:07.830> it<00:07:07.979> kind<00:07:08.129> of<00:07:08.249> gives

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:08.490 
dropper so that way it kind of gives

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.339 
dropper so that way it kind of gives
that<00:07:08.580> mimicking<00:07:09.270> of<00:07:09.449> the<00:07:09.539> dropping<00:07:09.990> effect

00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:10.349 
that mimicking of the dropping effect

00:07:10.349 --> 00:07:11.779 
that mimicking of the dropping effect
and<00:07:10.559> it's<00:07:10.649> a<00:07:10.709> little<00:07:11.009> bit<00:07:11.099> more<00:07:11.279> clean<00:07:11.550> this

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:11.789 
and it's a little bit more clean this

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:15.799 
and it's a little bit more clean this
way<00:07:12.080> now<00:07:13.080> I<00:07:13.919> am<00:07:14.669> catching<00:07:15.149> the<00:07:15.240> excess<00:07:15.599> with<00:07:15.779> a

00:07:15.799 --> 00:07:15.809 
way now I am catching the excess with a

00:07:15.809 --> 00:07:17.299 
way now I am catching the excess with a
paper<00:07:16.080> towel<00:07:16.289> so<00:07:16.499> that<00:07:16.769> way<00:07:16.860> doesn't<00:07:17.129> get<00:07:17.219> all

00:07:17.299 --> 00:07:17.309 
paper towel so that way doesn't get all

00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:18.019 
paper towel so that way doesn't get all
over<00:07:17.430> the<00:07:17.550> place

00:07:18.019 --> 00:07:18.029 
over the place

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:19.790 
over the place
but<00:07:18.389> this<00:07:18.539> tear<00:07:18.779> drop<00:07:19.050> er<00:07:19.199> is<00:07:19.319> really<00:07:19.769> a

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 
but this tear drop er is really a

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.829 
but this tear drop er is really a
convenient<00:07:20.430> tool<00:07:20.610> for<00:07:21.029> applying<00:07:21.360> blood<00:07:21.719> on
