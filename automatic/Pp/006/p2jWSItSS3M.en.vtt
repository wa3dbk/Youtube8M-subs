00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.430
 about peel zest 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.980
 of orange this is a chipotle chili is 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.500
 optional good but two if not me 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.430
 encounter do not worry it's optional already 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.129
 I have good salt and pepper very well 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.720
 are going to be now the first step we are going to 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.720
 cut the chicken into small pieces 

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:13.999
 once we have cut the chicken in 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:15.799
 small squares I want to show you my likes 

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:18.170
 prepare to count them like that because I assure myself 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:21.109
 that they prepare much faster like this 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.030
 credits the next step is to mix the 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:24.799
 rest of the ingredients I'm going to wash 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.689
 washing first to do is the 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.190
 next step if we go to chipotle chile 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:32.290
 what we have to do is open it 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.920
 and remove the seeds he is of 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.930
 There were few seeds 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.409
 because there are once already the fastest 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:45.770
 I'm going to cut into tiny pieces 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.780
 with chipotle chili remember that this 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.049
 ingredient is optional now only a 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:54.049
 little bit more than another little chinito 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.880
 once I have my chile and the credit the 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.679
 next step is to mix the 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.500
 ingredients as I told you in a 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:02.500
 vessel is when we are going to add 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.430
 and I have the orange peel 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.570
 from the orange juice 2 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.360
 and I'm going to add one 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.360
 with half a cup of orange marmalade 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.130
 and this we are going to add here all the 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.130
 mixture 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.940
 and we mix all this very well 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.040
 once mixed ingredients for 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.680
 already we can leave it to a 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.930
 side and we're going to focus on the chicken 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.750
 the next step is we are going to wash the 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.940
 chicken with salt and pepper is optional 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.890
 pepper if you want to add it and we're going 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.770
 to take to a pan I'm going to 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.840
 show this step 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:02.090
 I add pepper and salt 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.200
 I'm heating the pan I'm going to 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.110
 add oil 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.209
 this is about a tablespoon and 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.959
 Once the oil is hot, add the 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.959
 pan-fried chicken 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.500
 and we last the chicken for about 5 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.500
 minutes 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.510
 we remove 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.820
 the chicken on a plate has not paid the 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.670
 stove under fire at medium heat 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.130
 I love the return to the scenes and how it is 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:42.320

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.320
 our glace mixture before 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.379
 When the mixture begins to boil let 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.700
 to add the chicken again to the 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:53.599
 skillet 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.599

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.819

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.690

 half between 45 minutes 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.510
 this is ready and turn off the stove 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.550
