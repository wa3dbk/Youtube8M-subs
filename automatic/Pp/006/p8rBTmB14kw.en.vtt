okay<00:00:22.090> now<00:00:22.240> we're<00:00:22.390> gonna<00:00:22.449> start<00:00:22.810> this<00:00:22.930> lick<00:00:23.170> up

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
okay now we're gonna start this lick up

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.440 
okay now we're gonna start this lick up
at<00:00:23.410> the<00:00:23.500> 14th<00:00:23.950> fret<00:00:24.190> high<00:00:24.520> E<00:00:24.580> string<00:00:25.120> with<00:00:25.360> the

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:25.450 
at the 14th fret high E string with the

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.480 
at the 14th fret high E string with the
first<00:00:25.480> finger<00:00:25.810> played<00:00:26.530> using<00:00:26.860> a<00:00:26.950> Down<00:00:27.130> stroke

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
first finger played using a Down stroke

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.430 
first finger played using a Down stroke
hammering<00:00:28.060> onto<00:00:28.300> the<00:00:28.390> 15th<00:00:28.870> fret<00:00:29.080> with<00:00:29.350> the

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:29.440 
hammering onto the 15th fret with the

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.590 
hammering onto the 15th fret with the
2nd<00:00:29.800> finger<00:00:29.860> before<00:00:30.790> pulling<00:00:31.150> off<00:00:31.270> back<00:00:31.450> to

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
2nd finger before pulling off back to

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.479 
2nd finger before pulling off back to
the<00:00:31.690> 14th<00:00:32.140> fret<00:00:32.469> and<00:00:32.710> from<00:00:32.890> here<00:00:33.040> pulling<00:00:33.280> off

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
the 14th fret and from here pulling off

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:40.470 
the 14th fret and from here pulling off
to<00:00:33.610> the<00:00:33.700> open<00:00:34.000> string<00:00:38.880> so<00:00:39.880> if<00:00:39.940> we<00:00:40.060> set<00:00:40.240> up<00:00:40.270> an

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
to the open string so if we set up an

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:48.900 
to the open string so if we set up an
initial<00:00:40.690> practice<00:00:41.260> loop

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.979 

now<00:00:49.910> although<00:00:50.059> we<00:00:50.149> can<00:00:50.390> see<00:00:50.540> the<00:00:50.660> fingers<00:00:50.960> a

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
now although we can see the fingers a

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:52.900 
now although we can see the fingers a
fairly<00:00:51.350> angled<00:00:51.770> the<00:00:52.040> hand<00:00:52.219> is<00:00:52.340> also<00:00:52.489> fairly

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
fairly angled the hand is also fairly

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.700 
fairly angled the hand is also fairly
dropped<00:00:53.329> with<00:00:53.690> plenty<00:00:53.989> of<00:00:54.020> space<00:00:54.170> around<00:00:54.530> the

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
dropped with plenty of space around the

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.139 
dropped with plenty of space around the
crook<00:00:54.890> of<00:00:54.980> the<00:00:55.129> thumb<00:00:55.370> and<00:00:55.610> the<00:00:55.730> side<00:00:55.940> of<00:00:55.970> the

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
crook of the thumb and the side of the

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.240 
crook of the thumb and the side of the
first<00:00:56.360> finger<00:00:56.780> area<00:00:57.110> as<00:00:57.620> opposed<00:00:57.949> to<00:00:58.010> placing

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
first finger area as opposed to placing

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.860 
first finger area as opposed to placing
the<00:00:58.399> thumb<00:00:58.610> too<00:00:58.879> high<00:00:59.090> on<00:00:59.239> the<00:00:59.360> neck<00:00:59.390> in<00:00:59.750> which

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
the thumb too high on the neck in which

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.330 
the thumb too high on the neck in which
case<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:00.230> hand<00:01:00.410> may<00:01:00.559> move<00:01:00.739> into<00:01:00.949> the<00:01:01.129> back<00:01:01.309> of

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
case the hand may move into the back of

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.189 
case the hand may move into the back of
the<00:01:01.579> neck<00:01:01.790> and<00:01:02.000> generally<00:01:02.780> that's<00:01:02.930> going<00:01:03.140> to

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
the neck and generally that's going to

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:04.689 
the neck and generally that's going to
cause<00:01:03.350> limitations<00:01:04.009> as<00:01:04.159> we<00:01:04.280> try<00:01:04.460> and<00:01:04.489> move

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
cause limitations as we try and move

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.700 
cause limitations as we try and move
along<00:01:04.820> so<00:01:05.570> we<00:01:05.690> tried<00:01:05.900> to<00:01:05.930> set<00:01:06.200> up<00:01:06.350> a<00:01:06.440> fairly

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
along so we tried to set up a fairly

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.649 
along so we tried to set up a fairly
angled<00:01:07.220> jet<00:01:07.399> dropped<00:01:07.700> position<00:01:08.270> so<00:01:08.540> we<00:01:08.630> can

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
angled jet dropped position so we can

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:17.980 
angled jet dropped position so we can
easily<00:01:08.899> move<00:01:09.140> along<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:09.530> string<00:01:16.690> so<00:01:17.690> from<00:01:17.899> the

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
easily move along the string so from the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.389 
easily move along the string so from the
fourteenth<00:01:18.380> fret<00:01:18.590> we're<00:01:18.890> going<00:01:19.009> to<00:01:19.070> take<00:01:19.220> our

fourteenth fret we're going to take our

another<00:01:33.170> practice<00:01:33.590> repetition<00:01:33.800> loop<00:01:34.399> to<00:01:34.580> help

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
another practice repetition loop to help

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:47.670 
another practice repetition loop to help
memorize<00:01:35.119> that

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.160

resolve into the ninth fret g string
let's<00:02:08.720> take<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:08.959> look<00:02:09.110> at<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.259> example<00:02:09.679> play

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
let's take a look at the example play

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.490 
let's take a look at the example play
through<00:02:10.039> slowly
