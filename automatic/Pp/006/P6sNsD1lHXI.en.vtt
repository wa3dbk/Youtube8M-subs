depending<00:01:20.979> on<00:01:20.979> where<00:01:21.250> you<00:01:21.340> are<00:01:21.369> on<00:01:21.729> the<00:01:22.030> horn

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
depending on where you are on the horn

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.690 
depending on where you are on the horn
and<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:23.020> dynamic<00:01:23.440> range<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:23.830> mic<00:01:23.979> itself<00:01:24.369> how

and the dynamic range the mic itself how

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.639 
and the dynamic range the mic itself how

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
wide of a frequency band it will pick up

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.380 
wide of a frequency band it will pick up
later<00:01:27.190> to<00:01:27.340> must<00:01:27.490> be<00:01:27.610> talking<00:01:27.880> like<00:01:28.000> about<00:01:28.270> the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
later to must be talking like about the

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.570 
later to must be talking like about the
effects<00:01:28.659> of<00:01:28.780> what<00:01:28.929> not<00:01:29.050> that<00:01:29.320> will<00:01:29.710> also<00:01:30.069> come

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
effects of what not that will also come

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.100 
effects of what not that will also come
into<00:01:30.789> play<00:01:30.970> as<00:01:31.149> far<00:01:31.330> as<00:01:31.450> feedback<00:01:31.659> right<00:01:31.929> now<00:01:32.080> I

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
into play as far as feedback right now I

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.950 
into play as far as feedback right now I
have<00:01:32.319> everything<00:01:32.409> flattened<00:01:33.039> out<00:01:33.210> at<00:01:34.210> zero<00:01:34.600> on

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
have everything flattened out at zero on

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.450 
have everything flattened out at zero on
the<00:01:35.740> EQ<00:01:36.190> so<00:01:36.490> this<00:01:37.420> should<00:01:37.600> generally<00:01:37.960> be

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
the EQ so this should generally be

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.130 
the EQ so this should generally be
rather<00:01:39.460> I<00:01:39.819> wouldn't<00:01:40.450> have<00:01:40.539> what's<00:01:40.840> called<00:01:41.020> a

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
rather I wouldn't have what's called a

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.510 
rather I wouldn't have what's called a
natural<00:01:41.440> sound<00:01:41.649> but<00:01:41.770> basically<00:01:42.130> natural<00:01:42.429> to

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
natural sound but basically natural to

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:53.210 
natural sound but basically natural to
the<00:01:42.610> microphone

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.030 

say<00:01:54.090> you're<00:01:54.210> trying<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.680> amplify<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.740> horn

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
say you're trying to amplify the horn

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.830 
say you're trying to amplify the horn
loud<00:01:56.370> enough<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.970> combat<00:01:57.210> against<00:01:57.630> these

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
loud enough to combat against these

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.910 
loud enough to combat against these
other<00:01:58.050> instrumenting<00:01:58.800> before

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.830 

so<00:02:05.920> I<00:02:05.950> just<00:02:06.190> rolled<00:02:06.430> off<00:02:06.640> a<00:02:07.210> ton<00:02:07.720> of<00:02:07.750> low-end

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
so I just rolled off a ton of low-end

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.450 
so I just rolled off a ton of low-end
he's<00:02:10.840> a<00:02:10.869> this<00:02:11.320> is<00:02:11.440> very<00:02:11.530> simple<00:02:11.830> EQ<00:02:12.280> on<00:02:12.400> the

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
he's a this is very simple EQ on the

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.830 
he's a this is very simple EQ on the
channel<00:02:12.730> itself<00:02:12.790> which<00:02:13.210> is<00:02:13.300> high<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.660> lows

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
channel itself which is high and lows

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.300 
channel itself which is high and lows
which<00:02:14.020> basically<00:02:14.290> like<00:02:14.530> brings<00:02:14.860> that<00:02:15.070> brings

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
which basically like brings that brings

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.950 
which basically like brings that brings
up<00:02:15.490> it<00:02:15.610> brings<00:02:15.820> down<00:02:16.030> i<00:02:16.090> have<00:02:16.270> like<00:02:16.480> 80<00:02:16.690> hurts

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
up it brings down i have like 80 hurts

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.710 
up it brings down i have like 80 hurts
and<00:02:17.110> a<00:02:17.170> low<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:17.850> 12<00:02:18.850> k<00:02:19.060> on<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.240> high<00:02:19.390> i've

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
and a low and 12 k on the high i've

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.140 
and a low and 12 k on the high i've
rolled<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.740> hertz<00:02:21.490> almost<00:02:21.790> all<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.120> way

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
rolled the a hertz almost all the way

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.570 
rolled the a hertz almost all the way
off<00:02:22.420> in<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.810> high<00:02:23.680> end<00:02:23.890> I<00:02:24.100> brought<00:02:24.370> up<00:02:24.490> a

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
off in the high end I brought up a

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.920 
off in the high end I brought up a
little<00:02:24.940> bit<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:25.210> I<00:02:25.240> can<00:02:25.390> hear<00:02:25.570> a<00:02:25.600> different

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
little bit and I can hear a different

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.810 
little bit and I can hear a different
different<00:02:26.380> feedback<00:02:27.070> tone<00:02:27.430> here<00:02:27.670> when<00:02:27.790> I

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
different feedback tone here when I

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.340 
different feedback tone here when I
bring<00:02:28.060> up<00:02:28.210> the<00:02:28.390> high-end<00:02:30.270> start<00:02:31.270> to<00:02:31.450> there<00:02:32.260> you

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
bring up the high-end start to there you

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.580 
bring up the high-end start to there you
go<00:02:32.790> roll<00:02:33.790> that<00:02:33.910> back<00:02:34.120> now<00:02:34.450> also<00:02:34.630> say<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.230> placed

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
go roll that back now also say I placed

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.850 
go roll that back now also say I placed
the<00:02:35.800> horn<00:02:36.690> over<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.780> microphone<00:02:37.959> so<00:02:38.440> it's<00:02:38.709> all

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
the horn over the microphone so it's all

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.110 
the horn over the microphone so it's all
so<00:02:39.010> it<00:02:39.130> becomes<00:02:39.340> problematic<00:02:39.610> you're<00:02:39.940> getting

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
so it becomes problematic you're getting

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.750 
so it becomes problematic you're getting
different<00:02:40.270> types<00:02:40.510> of<00:02:40.630> feedback<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.980> we're

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
different types of feedback so we're

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.910 
different types of feedback so we're
trying<00:02:42.850> to<00:02:43.000> avoid<00:02:43.209> all<00:02:43.360> that<00:02:43.709> so<00:02:44.709> I'm<00:02:44.770> going<00:02:44.890> to

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
trying to avoid all that so I'm going to

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.449 
trying to avoid all that so I'm going to
bring<00:02:45.070> the<00:02:45.160> volume<00:02:45.670> little<00:02:46.000> down<00:02:47.130> eq<00:02:48.130> this<00:02:48.280> out

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
bring the volume little down eq this out

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:55.830 
bring the volume little down eq this out
so<00:02:48.880> it<00:02:48.970> sounds<00:02:49.330> good<00:02:49.510> again<00:02:49.840> and<00:02:50.260> here<00:02:50.709> we<00:02:50.770> go

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.040 

so<00:02:56.840> basically<00:02:57.110> you're<00:02:57.350> trying<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:58.480> if<00:02:59.480> you're

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
so basically you're trying to if you're

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.190 
so basically you're trying to if you're
going<00:03:00.410> for<00:03:00.680> you<00:03:01.430> know<00:03:01.550> an<00:03:02.330> extreme<00:03:02.750> volume<00:03:02.990> or

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
going for you know an extreme volume or

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.840 
going for you know an extreme volume or
as<00:03:03.710> much<00:03:03.860> volume<00:03:04.010> as<00:03:04.190> possible<00:03:04.580> we<00:03:04.640> want<00:03:04.700> to

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
as much volume as possible we want to

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.520 
as much volume as possible we want to
bring<00:03:04.970> this<00:03:05.090> up<00:03:05.300> and<00:03:05.510> then<00:03:05.570> that's<00:03:06.350> where<00:03:06.470> you

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
bring this up and then that's where you

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.400 
bring this up and then that's where you
start<00:03:06.590> to<00:03:06.860> sort<00:03:07.190> of<00:03:07.300> you<00:03:08.300> starting<00:03:08.660> to<00:03:08.780> combat

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
start to sort of you starting to combat

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.470 
start to sort of you starting to combat
the<00:03:09.590> feedback<00:03:10.100> issues<00:03:10.460> that<00:03:10.610> will<00:03:10.760> occur<00:03:11.030> with

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
the feedback issues that will occur with

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:21.259 
the feedback issues that will occur with
this<00:03:11.720> this<00:03:13.030> increased<00:03:14.030> volume

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.030 

again<00:03:22.269> with<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:22.480> feedback<00:03:22.870> issue<00:03:23.080> I<00:03:23.410> was

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
again with the feedback issue I was

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.699 
again with the feedback issue I was
utilizing<00:03:24.430> just<00:03:24.879> as<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.720> high-low<00:03:26.080> eq's<00:03:26.560> on

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
utilizing just as the high-low eq's on

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.259 
utilizing just as the high-low eq's on
the<00:03:26.830> actual<00:03:27.069> channel<00:03:27.459> of<00:03:27.580> this<00:03:27.730> mixing<00:03:28.000> board

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
the actual channel of this mixing board

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:33.300 
the actual channel of this mixing board
but<00:03:28.450> this<00:03:28.599> also<00:03:28.840> has<00:03:29.349> a<00:03:29.680> 5<00:03:30.640> band<00:03:30.970> EQ<00:03:32.250> what<00:03:33.250> you

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
but this also has a 5 band EQ what you

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.650 
but this also has a 5 band EQ what you
can<00:03:33.430> actually<00:03:33.519> hone<00:03:33.849> in<00:03:34.030> a<00:03:34.120> bit<00:03:34.239> more<00:03:34.450> on

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
can actually hone in a bit more on

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.500 
can actually hone in a bit more on
particular<00:03:35.290> frequencies<00:03:36.010> that<00:03:36.730> can<00:03:37.299> be<00:03:37.390> the

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
particular frequencies that can be the

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.800 
particular frequencies that can be the
problematic<00:03:37.930> or<00:03:37.959> not<00:03:38.110> and<00:03:38.400> while<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:40.450> sport

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
problematic or not and while the sport

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.780 
problematic or not and while the sport
has<00:03:40.930> seen<00:03:41.110> better<00:03:41.290> days<00:03:41.410> three<00:03:42.400> of<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.580> five

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
has seen better days three of the five

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.259 
has seen better days three of the five
faders<00:03:43.239> are<00:03:43.450> broken<00:03:44.230> so<00:03:44.260> for<00:03:45.099> me<00:03:45.220> to<00:03:45.459> bring<00:03:46.000> up

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
faders are broken so for me to bring up

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:47.699 
faders are broken so for me to bring up
and<00:03:46.450> down<00:03:46.569> certain<00:03:46.959> frequencies<00:03:47.319> I<00:03:47.379> have<00:03:47.530> to

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
and down certain frequencies I have to

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.660 
and down certain frequencies I have to
I'm<00:03:48.549> talking<00:03:49.090> to<00:03:49.150> this<00:03:49.709> this<00:03:50.709> is<00:03:50.860> uh<00:03:50.890> this<00:03:51.430> is

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
I'm talking to this this is uh this is

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.160 
I'm talking to this this is uh this is
kind<00:03:51.849> of<00:03:51.910> hot<00:03:52.120> summer<00:03:52.390> bring<00:03:52.630> down<00:03:52.810> from<00:03:53.079> the

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
3k 22 22 22 22 and a 12 k so it was less

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.089
