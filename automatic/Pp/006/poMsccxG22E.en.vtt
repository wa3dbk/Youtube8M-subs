00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
think having a new stadium would be

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:34.779 
think having a new stadium would be
great<00:00:33.710> it<00:00:33.859> would<00:00:33.920> just<00:00:34.039> be<00:00:34.190> so<00:00:34.370> motivational

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:34.789

for<00:00:35.239> all<00:00:35.539> the<00:00:35.749> athletes<00:00:36.140> to<00:00:36.320> go<00:00:36.469> out<00:00:36.620> there<00:00:36.890> and

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
for all the athletes to go out there and

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.520 
for all the athletes to go out there and
just<00:00:37.160> play<00:00:37.460> in<00:00:37.760> something<00:00:38.179> that's<00:00:38.300> new<00:00:38.659> it'll

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
just play in something that's new it'll

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.439 
just play in something that's new it'll
motivate<00:00:39.769> them<00:00:40.190> to<00:00:40.460> want<00:00:40.760> to<00:00:40.850> work<00:00:40.999> harder

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
motivate them to want to work harder

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.509

point<00:00:51.679> for<00:00:52.069> the<00:00:52.640> campus<00:00:53.059> itself<00:00:53.210> you<00:00:53.929> know

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
point for the campus itself you know

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.779 
point for the campus itself you know
people<00:00:54.469> want<00:00:54.559> to<00:00:54.710> get<00:00:54.829> behind<00:00:54.949> something<00:00:55.280> if

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
people want to get behind something if

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.610 
people want to get behind something if
you're<00:00:55.909> coming<00:00:56.059> to<00:00:56.239> a<00:00:56.269> campus<00:00:56.780> they<00:00:57.379> want<00:00:57.530> to

to me personally and it's done a lot for
me<00:01:58.609> I<00:01:58.820> think<00:01:59.179> the<00:01:59.420> stadium<00:01:59.869> project<00:02:00.079> is

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
me I think the stadium project is

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:03.370 
me I think the stadium project is
critical<00:02:00.950> it's<00:02:01.460> a<00:02:01.579> representation<00:02:01.999> of<00:02:02.659> the

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
critical it's a representation of the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.020 
critical it's a representation of the
school<00:02:03.679> from<00:02:03.950> a<00:02:04.039> teamwork<00:02:04.310> point<00:02:04.759> of<00:02:04.850> view

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
school from a teamwork point of view

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.330 
school from a teamwork point of view
it's<00:02:05.659> a<00:02:05.810> setter<00:02:06.049> point<00:02:06.380> for<00:02:06.590> students<00:02:07.039> I<00:02:07.189> mean

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
it's a setter point for students I mean

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.580 
it's a setter point for students I mean
it<00:02:07.460> drives<00:02:07.700> a<00:02:07.820> lot<00:02:07.939> of<00:02:08.090> camaraderie<00:02:08.440> so<00:02:09.440> the

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
it drives a lot of camaraderie so the

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.559 
it drives a lot of camaraderie so the
stadium<00:02:10.069> has<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:10.489> be<00:02:10.640> something<00:02:11.060> that<00:02:11.420> is<00:02:11.540> a

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
stadium has to be something that is a

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.690 
stadium has to be something that is a

teams I realize that all eyes are on our
athletic<00:03:43.459> programs<00:03:43.970> when<00:03:44.689> students<00:03:45.290> come<00:03:45.560> to

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
try and figure out who we are why they

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.350 
try and figure out who we are why they
should<00:03:48.530> come<00:03:48.680> to<00:03:48.860> our<00:03:48.890> campus<00:03:49.459> and<00:03:49.640> this<00:03:50.000> is<00:03:50.180> an

ever-changing ongoing evolving process
and<00:03:54.260> I<00:03:54.739> realized<00:03:55.159> it's<00:03:55.310> what<00:03:55.489> being<00:03:55.700> a<00:03:55.790> pioneer

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
their things sit down and forget about

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.860 
their things sit down and forget about
life<00:04:00.799> pioneers<00:04:01.730> are<00:04:01.939> always<00:04:02.239> trailblazing

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
life pioneers are always trailblazing

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.130

you<00:04:10.760> know<00:04:10.790> you<00:04:10.939> look<00:04:11.299> at<00:04:11.450> the<00:04:11.540> pioneers<00:04:12.110> and

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
you know you look at the pioneers and

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.050 
you know you look at the pioneers and
you<00:04:12.560> look<00:04:12.680> at<00:04:12.769> the<00:04:12.829> definition<00:04:13.010> a<00:04:13.459> pioneer<00:04:13.939> is

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
you look at the definition a pioneer is

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.120 
you look at the definition a pioneer is
somebody<00:04:14.390> that<00:04:14.450> blazes<00:04:14.959> away<00:04:15.230> leads<00:04:15.739> the<00:04:15.950> way

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
somebody that blazes away leads the way

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.249 
somebody that blazes away leads the way
and<00:04:16.459> so<00:04:16.789> I<00:04:16.820> look<00:04:17.180> at<00:04:17.239> this<00:04:17.389> campaign<00:04:17.900> as

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:18.259

and so I look at this campaign as
something<00:04:18.739> that<00:04:18.769> we<00:04:19.070> have<00:04:19.250> a<00:04:19.280> bunch<00:04:19.549> of<00:04:19.639> people

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:19.699 
something that we have a bunch of people

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
jumping on board at the very beginning

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.119 
jumping on board at the very beginning
that<00:04:22.289> they'll<00:04:22.409> have<00:04:22.560> a<00:04:22.590> sense<00:04:22.830> of<00:04:22.919> pride

00:04:23.119 --> 00:04:23.129 
that they'll have a sense of pride

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:25.550 
that they'll have a sense of pride
you'll<00:04:23.970> see<00:04:24.120> their<00:04:24.240> alma<00:04:24.539> mater<00:04:24.750> growing

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
you'll see their alma mater growing

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.029 
and gold I think it will just create an
overall<00:04:33.270> atmosphere<00:04:33.720> of<00:04:34.289> competitiveness

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039
