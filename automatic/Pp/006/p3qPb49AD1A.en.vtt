00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.030
 v 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.320
 Hello dear readers , I will always 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.700
 I asked for the answers 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.800
 not something for my readership pages 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.970
 exaggerated 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.830
 That's why we decided one 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.270
 small part of the letters to the readers simply 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.160
 ripe to answer because a beet 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.559
 as you know, more than a thousand was 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.580
 for example, readers should give it to me 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.230
 imply that at the 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.300
 description of an office exaggerating 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.480
 Then one would come along and be convinced 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.480
 yourself 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.180
 my office my chair my problem ok me 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.010
 admit that I have business here 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.970
 that was really just walls first 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.670
 connection 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.990
 By now I could also clearly 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.090
 to pass more convenient economic advice 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.470
 Now you may believe that 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.840
 Also in the portrayal of coach 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.920
 But I was convinced that I worked in the office 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.920
 one for ourselves 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.940
 Christian 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.600
 I wanted to go back 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:13.740
 I have to see you next month too 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.170
 again if you are rainer rossi now 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.730
 get heard to say I think it's really 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.730
 bad that I do a lot of money
