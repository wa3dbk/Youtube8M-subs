freedoms but I don't think that that we

freedoms but I don't think that that we

should just give out weapons to just
standing<00:02:55.370> but<00:02:55.549> I<00:02:55.670> think<00:02:55.849> it's<00:02:55.970> just<00:02:56.030> a

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
standing but I think it's just a

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.479
