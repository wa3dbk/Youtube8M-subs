00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.080

 door extensions has clipped you have 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.380
 many wondering what I 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.150
 thought of my extensions and where I 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.289
 had had so if you followed since a 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.000
 little bit of time you know I am 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.070
 an unconditional fan of extensions 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.779
 I tested more than seven sites 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.240
 extension to total whether for 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.040
 clip extensions or cold so 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.180
 this one comes from the site hair street 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.860
 points like so I put you the name 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.250
 here and the place of their site in bar 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.960
 info 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.520
 before I tell you about my extensions 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.010
 I'm talking to you a little bit about the site 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.469
 so this is a site that offers you 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.390
 extensions whether it's cold to hot 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.180
 and to whom you also have fringes 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.309
 to clips you really have everything 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.539
 everything to put your extensions all of which 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.969
 the material and you really have 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.649
 several categories of products 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.090
 three extensions to that you have two 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.539
 categories so the three-band 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.309
 sela 7 terminals it seems to me and what 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.199
 I liked on this site it is 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.970
 that there is a part that is very 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.610
 really care about your extensions 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.250
 how to put your extensions really 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.990
 finally everything to succeed to ask you 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.880
 all alone your extensions she is 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.950
 to maintain and that is if you have 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.630
 good maintenance prolongs more 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.740
 long life of your extensions and 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.520
 it's really important so 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.430
 maintain 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.280
 even if they are clips so I have 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.220
 received a kit 2 3 bands 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.509
 here it really does not really look 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.700
 that I have only three bands and that you have 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.970
 had of extension seen the mass of hair 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.070
 that I then have what you dish costs 49 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.340
 95 euros and the delivery is done 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.560
 colissimo I received so this is our 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.050
 species develops and expressions 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.430
 was hacked into a next like 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.080
 this is so I advise you to 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.610
 keep this pouch there I range 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.470
 always the extensions a dance the life 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.470
 which relates to dust and so on and 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.710
 she was hanging in there so 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.180
 so here's the ealing neighborhood for the 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.640
 color I can not tell you which 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.170
 that I received since I really 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.570
 struggled to find the right color 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.920
 the site my sent down a color chart 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.630
 with all the wicks they had 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.760
 in order to find the right color being 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.870
 given that I have a tie and dye must 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.850
 also know that they make weavings 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.320
 with ôta went there already but me 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.989
 that there was not no color either 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.150
 I really wanted some clips 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:25.590
 so I tested these extensions not bad 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.590
 of times you post a photo g 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.930
 have you posted two photos on 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.310
 instagram smoothed hair that never 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.650
 very much somewhere in there so that you 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.030
 see what it gives high school there you 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.150
 can see that it really looks like my 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.190
 hair to me and I find that one 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.990
 Looks like they're charming in 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.970
 size is to go considering that there is only 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.120
 three bands know not too high 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:51.060
 and since it's wary extensions 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.670
 but we can see the blond on the 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.810
 underneath so I curl them because 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.460
 that I find that it is much more 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.650
 nice curly that reads and I think it 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.060
 made more true and again it would have to 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.040
 I cut them a bit since see that 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.860
 would do a little as soon as drama was not 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.210
 too naughty too what I think 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.940
 of these extensions I find that this is the 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.140
 better than I tested for now 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.970
 so for several reasons sequels 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.730
 already I have hyper mega women's hair 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.500
 the clips fit very well he slides 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.870
 not while I experienced extortion 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.980
 the bars she had to hold badly but 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.290
 to meet the hair I had 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.050
 always afraid of losing my extensions 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.930
 second good plan that is not 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.950
 least is that only three 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.690
 bands 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.220
 we are first to go back super word 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.020
 head level and that's tip top 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.470
 when you are a driver of the convoy not the 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.290
 pliers 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.450
 if you put them well me the most 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.830
 high arrives at it and suddenly we do not see 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.330
 at all my clips and that I find that 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.830
 this man because wearing 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.930
 extensions when we see an eclipse 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.230
 really not pretty and that's not true of 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.060
 all and thirdly what I love 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.040
 also it is that there are only three bands 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.510
 there is really a lot of volume and seen 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.100
 it's natural hair it is 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.990
 really mix with your hair 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.720
 to you so that I think it's tip 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.610
 so top for maintenance extensions 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.620
 you have to know it's hyper it's enough 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.540
 just in France have like yours 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.740
 natural hair so if you can 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.420
 you protect them with a spray 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.860
 so protective at the moment of 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.180
 use it from the chain above that this 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.310
 is to let you in you 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.810
 high schools wanted to buckle to wash them 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.100
 wanted with your usual shampoo 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.660
 but I advise you anyway 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.670
 to use hair products 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.900
 because if you use 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.810
 products for greasy hair savoye 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.990
 tendency to tie your hair and a 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.430
 once the hair clip is damaged 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.870
 you can not fix it since 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.300
 it's the hair between death quotes 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.950
 who does not live anymore so you really have to 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.190
 take care as they were hair 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.420
 dry as the video on the extensions to 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.890
 clean you did you really have 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.840
 explain how to take care of them 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.240
 adept your extensions and there 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.790
 it's the same you really have to take 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.380
 care like natural hair so the 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.370
 post it's really very very simple 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.650
 if there are only three bands 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.900
 in five minutes it's done I'll make you 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.669
 a tutorial to show you how 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.320
 pass the break but you'll see it's 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.360
 super simple anyway on the site 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.490
 street short hair as there is 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.290
 lots of other youtube videos heuzé 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.120
 and blogger who explain to you the 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.800
 pause and what she thinks I do you 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.200
 put down the Rhine infosys has links 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.360
 need regret so to conclude 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:16.470
 it's really my favorite extensions 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.190
 here I love them they are natural 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.790
 are they not to touch 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:25.480
 fake I think that's your really true 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:27.010
 hair that mixes well here's me 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.240
 I just have to tell you this man especially 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.360
 for the price it's really an advantage 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.490
 not even 50 euros so you decided 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.110
 Expansion foot super expensive to know 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.270
 the extensions it's really not given 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.250
 there what is really accessible and 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.860
 customer service is really tip top 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:45.100
 since I really communicate 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.870
 with them before receiving my monkey 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.160
 of extension in order to have the right 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.450
 color so if you want to 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.260
 order but that you hesitate to 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.240
 color level 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.410
 do not hesitate send an email which I 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.380
 you would put the allure week in bar 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.960
 info send you to send to you by 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.980
 mail pictures of your hair so 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.730
 try to take in the light 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.770
 natural 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.900
 we are very happy with your 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.570
 color and he will advise us to 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.930
 maximum to find the right color of 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.240
 hair 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.470
 so be aware that cold extensions 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.420
 there is not much choice of 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.760
 colors the reason the basic colors 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.520
 in quotation marks so black dark brown 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.810
 and shown clear so it seems to me so for 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.000
 vegetables I had many more choices 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.590
 and you're even going to extensions but 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.990
 so that's it I think there is 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.919
 more choice since often not bad in 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:31.510
 this detail has sharpened all that and 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:33.700
 here I advise against 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.380
 color your extensions everything you 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.910
 can do it friends really the 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.620
 hair and once it will be damaged 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.630
 you really can not catch it 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.520
 even with the dom of sounds that you will make 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.919
 it will not be fast 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:48.000
 so here's this little video in 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:50.700
 big go for it is a site at the top service 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.500
 customers at ptom extension october good 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.910
 very good quality 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.210
 I wear them all day and 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:58.860
 it does not slip and frankly it's tip 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.210
 top so you can tie them 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.320
 hair with clip extensions for 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.770
 knowing we can make you tails 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:06.510
 of horse etc you watched on youtube 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.770
 there are a lot of videos tuto sweaty body 

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.530
 ponytails with extensions 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:12.240
 all this and that's you firing like 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.680
 it was stuffed hair so I you 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.600
 do not advise sleeping with 

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.190
 because it's going to damage them for 

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.540
 wash you can keep them on your 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.890
 head closed the decline is much more 

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.260
 easy than washed in the bathtub 

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:23.850
 all by itself for drying and well you 

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.050
 can do it with a hair dryer or 

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:27.780
 naturally I should do 

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:29.880
 naturally thought of advancing your 

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.710
 hair and that's it for this 

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.210

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:36.510
