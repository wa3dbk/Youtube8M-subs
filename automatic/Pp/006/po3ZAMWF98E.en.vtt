00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
hey there this is brian Tim with Tim

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.990 
hey there this is brian Tim with Tim
untuk<00:00:03.600> and<00:00:04.130> my<00:00:05.130> touch<00:00:05.279> screen<00:00:05.400> came<00:00:05.670> in<00:00:05.790> today

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
untuk and my touch screen came in today

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.900 
untuk and my touch screen came in today
so<00:00:06.440> went<00:00:07.440> ahead<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:07.859> put<00:00:08.160> it<00:00:08.250> onto<00:00:08.370> my<00:00:08.490> display

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
so went ahead and put it onto my display

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.690 
so went ahead and put it onto my display
which<00:00:09.870> is<00:00:09.900> easiest<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.440> do<00:00:10.650> with<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.550> computer

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
which is easiest to do with the computer

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.020 
which is easiest to do with the computer
on<00:00:11.940> with<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.330> display<00:00:12.690> on<00:00:12.980> which<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.160> actually

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
on with the display on which is actually

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.689 
on with the display on which is actually
makes<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.690> little<00:00:15.839> bit<00:00:16.190> harder<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.220> do<00:00:17.310> can't

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
makes it a little bit harder to do can't

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.310 
makes it a little bit harder to do can't
detach<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.359> display<00:00:18.630> from<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.900> motherboard

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
detach the display from the motherboard

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.840 
detach the display from the motherboard
in<00:00:19.500> one<00:00:19.680> more<00:00:19.830> so<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.310> know<00:00:20.400> in<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.609> way<00:00:20.730> it's

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
in one more so you know in that way it's

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.580 
in one more so you know in that way it's
harder<00:00:21.090> but<00:00:21.270> in<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.199> end<00:00:22.289> you'll<00:00:22.439> get<00:00:22.560> a

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
harder but in the end you'll get a

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.960 
harder but in the end you'll get a
better<00:00:22.710> result<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.160> get<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.310> better<00:00:23.490> placement

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
better result you get a better placement

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.000 
better result you get a better placement
of<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.960> touchscreen<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.619> won't<00:00:25.800> do<00:00:25.920> what

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
of the touchscreen and you won't do what

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.130 
of the touchscreen and you won't do what
I<00:00:26.070> did<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.519> like<00:00:26.789> obscure<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.480> couple<00:00:27.840> pixels

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
I did and like obscure a couple pixels

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.929 
I did and like obscure a couple pixels
in<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.320> bottom<00:00:28.590> road<00:00:28.769> here<00:00:28.949> which<00:00:29.699> when<00:00:29.849> you

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
in the bottom road here which when you

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.429 
in the bottom road here which when you
tilt<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.179> display<00:00:30.510> up<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.750> can<00:00:30.869> see<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.289> it's

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
tilt the display up you can see so it's

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.049 
tilt the display up you can see so it's
really<00:00:31.590> not<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:31.830> big<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.250> deal<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.850> doesn't

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
really not that big of a deal it doesn't

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.569 
really not that big of a deal it doesn't
really<00:00:33.149> affect<00:00:33.239> anything<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.280> then<00:00:35.280> let<00:00:35.489> me

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
really affect anything and then let me

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.180 
really affect anything and then let me
show<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.790> how<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.090> cable<00:00:36.660> run<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.320> cable

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
show you how the cable run so the cable

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.889 
show you how the cable run so the cable
on<00:00:38.280> line<00:00:38.550> comes<00:00:38.940> off<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.180> top<00:00:39.390> here<00:00:39.690> if<00:00:39.840> you

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
on line comes off the top here if you

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.360 
on line comes off the top here if you
order<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.170> same<00:00:40.320> kid<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.829> mine<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.160> will<00:00:41.250> come

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
order the same kid is mine it will come

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.090 
order the same kid is mine it will come
off<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.610> top<00:00:41.840> connects<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.320> cable<00:00:43.980> from

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
off the top connects to the cable from

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.910 
off the top connects to the cable from
the<00:00:44.160> controller<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.809> fits<00:00:46.260> just<00:00:46.590> nicely

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
the controller and I it fits just nicely

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.680 
the controller and I it fits just nicely
actually<00:00:47.309> quite<00:00:47.700> perfectly<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.420> little

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
actually quite perfectly in this little

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.680 
actually quite perfectly in this little
slot<00:00:48.899> back<00:00:49.170> here<00:00:49.410> between<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.329> battery

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
slot back here between the the battery

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.990 
slot back here between the the battery
bay<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.199> kind<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.370> back<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.789> case

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
bay and kind of the back of the case

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.229 
bay and kind of the back of the case
where<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.360> hinge<00:00:54.600> would<00:00:55.350> sit<00:00:55.680> if<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.820> was<00:00:56.940> you

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
where the hinge would sit if I was you

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.580 
where the hinge would sit if I was you
know<00:00:57.270> if<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.510> had<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.780> top<00:00:57.960> half<00:00:58.170> hooked<00:00:58.410> up

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
know if I had the top half hooked up

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.680 
know if I had the top half hooked up
like<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.699> normally<00:00:59.789> would<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.239> let's<00:01:00.510> go<00:01:00.629> and

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
like you normally would so let's go and

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.549 
like you normally would so let's go and
move<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:00.989> display<00:01:01.350> over<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.719> we<00:01:03.719> will<00:01:03.989> zoom

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
move this display over and we will zoom

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.609 
move this display over and we will zoom
in<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> little<00:01:05.220> bit<00:01:05.369> on<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:07.080> area<00:01:07.380> where<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
in a little bit on the area where the

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.380 
in a little bit on the area where the
touch<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.310> touch<00:01:08.549> controller<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.240> can

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
touch the touch controller is so I can

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.240 
touch the touch controller is so I can
explain<00:01:09.600> what's<00:01:09.810> going<00:01:09.869> on<00:01:10.080> back<00:01:10.260> here<00:01:10.470> so

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
explain what's going on back here so

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.760 
explain what's going on back here so
here's<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.670> HP<00:01:12.110> mobile<00:01:13.110> drive<00:01:13.290> connector

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
here's the HP mobile drive connector

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.870 
here's the HP mobile drive connector
just<00:01:14.040> standard<00:01:14.460> USB<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.119> we<00:01:15.960> have<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> USB

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
just standard USB and we have a USB

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.340 
just standard USB and we have a USB
adapter<00:01:17.880> for<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.360> board<00:01:18.659> comes<00:01:19.080> with<00:01:19.259> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
adapter for this board comes with the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.289 
adapter for this board comes with the
board<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.220> plug<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.759> us<00:01:20.909> be<00:01:21.090> there

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
board so you plug it in to us be there

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.580 
board so you plug it in to us be there
and<00:01:21.540> then<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.750> plug<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.049> into<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.290> board<00:01:22.500> on

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
and then you plug it into the board on

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.999 
and then you plug it into the board on
the<00:01:22.650> other<00:01:22.770> end<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:24.030> then<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.890> know<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
the other end and then you know the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:26.960 
the other end and then you know the
wires<00:01:26.189> going<00:01:26.400> out<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.640> touchscreen

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
wires going out the touchscreen

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.240 
wires going out the touchscreen
obviously<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.360> here's<00:01:27.509> my<00:01:27.600> run<00:01:28.229> core<00:01:28.500> SSD<00:01:28.950> so

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
obviously and here's my run core SSD so

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.940 
obviously and here's my run core SSD so
when<00:01:29.400> we<00:01:29.490> flip<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.180> over<00:01:30.530> you<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:31.710> see<00:01:31.920> that

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
when we flip this over you can see that

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.940 
when we flip this over you can see that
we've<00:01:32.250> got<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:33.270> full<00:01:33.540> controller<00:01:33.990> here<00:01:34.350> it's

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
we've got the full controller here it's

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.370 
we've got the full controller here it's
60<00:01:35.430> millimeters<00:01:36.030> long<00:01:36.240> by<00:01:36.420> 20<00:01:37.020> millimeters

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
60 millimeters long by 20 millimeters

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.580 
60 millimeters long by 20 millimeters
wide<00:01:38.240> these<00:01:39.240> two<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:39.750> far<00:01:39.960> haven't<00:01:40.350> interacted

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
wide these two so far haven't interacted

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.319 
wide these two so far haven't interacted
in<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.040> way<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.400> would<00:01:41.610> cause<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.000> them<00:01:42.210> to

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
in a way that would cause you to them to

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.980 
in a way that would cause you to them to
short<00:01:42.540> out<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.780> cause<00:01:42.960> any<00:01:43.170> problems<00:01:43.939> so<00:01:44.990> so

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
short out to cause any problems so so

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.359 
short out to cause any problems so so
far<00:01:46.200> it's<00:01:46.350> been<00:01:46.470> good<00:01:46.680> i'm<00:01:46.890> probably<00:01:47.100> going<00:01:47.280> to

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
far it's been good i'm probably going to

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.859 
far it's been good i'm probably going to
put<00:01:47.490> some<00:01:47.520> kind<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.880> an<00:01:48.000> insulator<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.659> the

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
put some kind of an insulator on the

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.230 
put some kind of an insulator on the
bottom<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.290> SSD<00:01:49.740> just<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.700> make<00:01:50.850> sure<00:01:50.880> that

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
bottom of the SSD just to make sure that

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.520 
bottom of the SSD just to make sure that
nothing<00:01:51.390> happens<00:01:51.540> once<00:01:52.020> i<00:01:52.140> get<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.350> thing

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
nothing happens once i get this thing

nothing happens once i get this thing
all<00:01:52.649> chased<00:01:52.920> up<00:01:53.149> i'm<00:01:54.149> going<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.390> make<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:54.720> i

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
all chased up i'm going to make it so i

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.359 
all chased up i'm going to make it so i
can<00:01:55.049> open<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.409> case<00:01:55.590> for<00:01:55.770> future<00:01:56.040> upgrades

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
can open the case for future upgrades

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.800 
can open the case for future upgrades
but<00:01:56.520> i<00:01:56.579> really<00:01:56.790> don't<00:01:56.820> want<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.329> open<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.659> case

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
but i really don't want to open the case

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.600 
but i really don't want to open the case
for<00:01:57.990> future<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.590> know<00:01:58.710> for<00:01:58.979> anything<00:01:59.159> but<00:01:59.430> an

around in my backpack and whatnot so
that<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:09.989> how<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.410> works<00:02:10.679> let's<00:02:10.979> go<00:02:11.099> ahead

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
that is how that works let's go ahead

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.960 
that is how that works let's go ahead
and<00:02:11.459> put<00:02:11.580> the

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
and put the

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.000 
and put the
screen<00:02:12.150> kind<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.420> back<00:02:13.380> where<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.680> belongs

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
screen kind of back where it belongs

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.680

actually show you the other modes here
that<00:05:41.360> we<00:05:41.449> can<00:05:41.479> do<00:05:41.720> with<00:05:41.930> the<00:05:42.139> with<00:05:42.680> this<00:05:42.889> so<00:05:43.789> for

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:43.819 
that we can do with the with this so for

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:45.189 
that we can do with the with this so for
docking<00:05:44.330> we<00:05:44.389> can<00:05:44.509> also<00:05:44.659> dock<00:05:44.900> at<00:05:45.050> top<00:05:45.169> of

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 
docking we can also dock at top of

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:46.749 
docking we can also dock at top of
screen<00:05:45.470> so<00:05:45.710> it<00:05:45.770> takes<00:05:45.919> up<00:05:46.069> the<00:05:46.190> top<00:05:46.340> half<00:05:46.550> I

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:46.759 
screen so it takes up the top half I

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:49.749 
screen so it takes up the top half I
find<00:05:47.449> bottom<00:05:47.720> to<00:05:47.840> be<00:05:47.960> better<00:05:48.139> just<00:05:48.409> from<00:05:49.310> how<00:05:49.729> I

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 
find bottom to be better just from how I

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:53.439 
find bottom to be better just from how I
hold<00:05:50.090> it<00:05:50.210> and<00:05:50.440> make<00:05:51.440> a<00:05:51.500> float<00:05:51.970> which<00:05:52.970> floats<00:05:53.270> it

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:53.449 
hold it and make a float which floats it

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:57.100 
hold it and make a float which floats it
and<00:05:53.599> then<00:05:53.840> you<00:05:54.020> can<00:05:54.169> also<00:05:55.479> scale<00:05:56.479> the<00:05:56.690> keyboard

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
and then you can also scale the keyboard

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:05.559 
and then you can also scale the keyboard
I<00:05:57.610> can<00:05:58.610> hit<00:05:58.669> the<00:05:58.819> corner<00:06:01.900> so<00:06:04.210> this<00:06:05.210> is<00:06:05.240> always

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:05.569 
I can hit the corner so this is always

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:07.779 
I can hit the corner so this is always
an<00:06:05.720> option<00:06:05.870> here<00:06:06.349> and<00:06:06.560> then<00:06:07.430> if<00:06:07.520> we<00:06:07.610> go<00:06:07.729> to

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:07.789 
an option here and then if we go to

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:09.850 
an option here and then if we go to
tablet<00:06:08.419> see<00:06:08.659> that<00:06:08.840> the<00:06:09.229> handwriting

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
tablet see that the handwriting

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.890 
tablet see that the handwriting
recognition<00:06:10.099> mode<00:06:10.669> is<00:06:11.419> much<00:06:11.630> better<00:06:11.840> than

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
recognition mode is much better than

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.870 
recognition mode is much better than
you're<00:06:12.110> just<00:06:12.289> doing<00:06:12.500> a<00:06:12.560> normal<00:06:12.650> float<00:06:13.039> because

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
you're just doing a normal float because

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.149 
you're just doing a normal float because
you're<00:06:14.210> I<00:06:17.289> just<00:06:18.289> I'm<00:06:18.440> afraid<00:06:18.590> of<00:06:18.770> touching<00:06:18.889> too

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:19.159 
you're I just I'm afraid of touching too

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:20.950 
you're I just I'm afraid of touching too
hard<00:06:19.370> so<00:06:19.520> i<00:06:19.580> end<00:06:19.669> up<00:06:19.759> direct<00:06:20.449> touching<00:06:20.780> it<00:06:20.870> to

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
hard so i end up direct touching it to

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.320 
hard so i end up direct touching it to
lately<00:06:21.139> native<00:06:21.469> dragging<00:06:21.800> across<00:06:22.000> that<00:06:23.000> the

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
lately native dragging across that the

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.870 
lately native dragging across that the
but<00:06:23.840> the<00:06:24.130> kettering<00:06:25.130> recognition<00:06:25.550> works<00:06:25.639> what

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
but the kettering recognition works what

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.360 
but the kettering recognition works what
better<00:06:26.090> in<00:06:26.240> this<00:06:26.330> floating<00:06:26.630> mode<00:06:27.370> because

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.370 
better in this floating mode because

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:34.870 
better in this floating mode because
it'll<00:06:28.759> just<00:06:28.940> add<00:06:29.030> lines<00:06:31.900> as<00:06:33.460> it<00:06:34.460> thinks<00:06:34.639> you

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 
it'll just add lines as it thinks you

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.520 
it'll just add lines as it thinks you
need<00:06:35.090> them<00:06:35.360> from<00:06:35.690> your<00:06:35.840> typing<00:06:36.169> so<00:06:36.349> see<00:06:36.469> how

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:36.530 
need them from your typing so see how

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:43.930 
need them from your typing so see how

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940 
just expanded that oops end up leading

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
keyboard there and you can also do right

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.589 
keyboard there and you can also do right
character<00:06:49.580> by<00:06:49.669> character<00:06:49.699> you<00:06:50.389> can<00:06:50.509> do
