00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.579 

so<00:00:00.210> we've<00:00:00.359> all<00:00:00.539> seen<00:00:00.750> the<00:00:00.870> MAC<00:00:01.050> pallets<00:00:01.500> that

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
so we've all seen the MAC pallets that

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.789 
so we've all seen the MAC pallets that
have<00:00:01.800> the<00:00:01.949> 15<00:00:02.429> pan<00:00:02.990> trays<00:00:03.990> in<00:00:04.259> them<00:00:04.440> but

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
have the 15 pan trays in them but

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.200 
have the 15 pan trays in them but
they're<00:00:04.980> super<00:00:05.160> inconvenient<00:00:05.940> because<00:00:06.000> they

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
they're super inconvenient because they

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.660 
they're super inconvenient because they
only<00:00:06.390> hold<00:00:06.600> 15<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.350> if<00:00:08.099> you're<00:00:08.250> a<00:00:08.280> big<00:00:08.460> makeup

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
only hold 15 and if you're a big makeup

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.970 
only hold 15 and if you're a big makeup
person<00:00:09.059> like<00:00:09.210> me<00:00:09.389> you<00:00:09.780> want<00:00:10.110> it<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.380> hold<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.769> lot

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
person like me you want it to hold a lot

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.070 
person like me you want it to hold a lot
more<00:00:11.190> so<00:00:11.429> this<00:00:11.580> one<00:00:11.730> actually<00:00:12.030> holds<00:00:12.269> 26<00:00:12.809> I

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
more so this one actually holds 26 I

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.330 
more so this one actually holds 26 I
believe<00:00:14.839> which<00:00:15.839> is<00:00:15.870> so<00:00:16.590> much<00:00:16.680> more<00:00:16.740> practical

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
believe which is so much more practical

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.260 
believe which is so much more practical
because<00:00:18.260> one<00:00:19.260> pallet<00:00:19.800> basically<00:00:20.490> almost

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
because one pallet basically almost

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.000 
because one pallet basically almost
doubles<00:00:21.750> what<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.050> would<00:00:22.199> like<00:00:22.410> need<00:00:22.680> for<00:00:22.890> two

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
doubles what you would like need for two

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.920 
doubles what you would like need for two
of<00:00:23.160> these<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:23.670> it's<00:00:24.119> super<00:00:24.390> more<00:00:24.570> it's<00:00:24.779> like

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
of these so it's super more it's like

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.240 
of these so it's super more it's like
just<00:00:25.080> way<00:00:25.230> more<00:00:25.410> convenient<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.949> do<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.130> this

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
just way more convenient to do it this

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.189 
just way more convenient to do it this
way<00:00:26.430> because<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:27.269> can<00:00:27.420> see<00:00:27.449> everything<00:00:28.019> it's

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
way because you can see everything it's

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.460 
way because you can see everything it's
all<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.590> there<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.820> yeah<00:00:30.480> so<00:00:30.929> today<00:00:31.260> I'm<00:00:31.349> going

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
all in there and yeah so today I'm going

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.440 
all in there and yeah so today I'm going
to<00:00:31.529> show<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.679> how<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.550> can<00:00:32.700> actually<00:00:32.880> take

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
to show you how you can actually take

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.709 
to show you how you can actually take
this<00:00:34.230> part<00:00:34.590> out<00:00:34.969> so<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.120> your<00:00:36.239> pallet<00:00:36.570> is

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
this part out so that your pallet is

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.040 
this part out so that your pallet is
just<00:00:37.020> empty<00:00:37.380> like<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.820> and<00:00:38.820> also<00:00:39.390> what's

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
just empty like that and also what's

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.150 
just empty like that and also what's
good<00:00:40.170> about<00:00:40.260> this<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.860> can<00:00:41.010> always

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
good about this is that you can always

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.190 
good about this is that you can always
put<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.550> back<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:41.969> if<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.629> change<00:00:42.960> your

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
put this back in if you change your

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.810 
put this back in if you change your
storage<00:00:43.530> or<00:00:43.680> whatever<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.370> just<00:00:44.579> make<00:00:44.670> sure

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
storage or whatever so just make sure

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.549 
storage or whatever so just make sure
that<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:45.000> keep<00:00:45.210> these<00:00:45.450> but<00:00:46.110> it's<00:00:46.230> really

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
that you keep these but it's really

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.119 
that you keep these but it's really
really<00:00:46.770> simple

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
really simple

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.369 
really simple
it<00:00:47.879> doesn't<00:00:48.120> involve<00:00:48.300> like<00:00:48.510> any<00:00:48.690> heat<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.110> just

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
it doesn't involve like any heat I just

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.650 
it doesn't involve like any heat I just
I<00:00:49.590> just<00:00:50.070> use<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> safety<00:00:50.670> pin<00:00:50.879> which<00:00:51.210> obviously

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
I just use a safety pin which obviously

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.119 
I just use a safety pin which obviously
right<00:00:51.780> now<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.050> completely<00:00:52.440> mangled<00:00:52.620> because

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
right now is completely mangled because

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.220 
right now is completely mangled because
I<00:00:53.219> just<00:00:53.370> destroyed<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:54.180> my<00:00:54.570> process<00:00:54.930> of

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
I just destroyed it in my process of

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.139 
I just destroyed it in my process of
doing<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.590> but<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.129> know<00:00:56.399> one<00:00:56.640> safety<00:00:56.910> pin

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
doing this but you know one safety pin

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.869 
doing this but you know one safety pin
costs<00:00:57.629> like<00:00:57.750> maybe<00:00:57.960> three<00:00:58.680> cents<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.520> the

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
costs like maybe three cents in the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.000 
costs like maybe three cents in the
whole<00:01:00.030> scheme<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.329> things<00:01:00.629> whereas<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.980> know

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
whole scheme of things whereas you know

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.830 
whole scheme of things whereas you know
buying<00:01:02.370> multiple<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.120> these<00:01:03.270> can<00:01:03.719> get

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
buying multiple of these can get

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.179 
buying multiple of these can get
expensive<00:01:04.110> really<00:01:04.530> quickly<00:01:04.799> because<00:01:04.920> they

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
expensive really quickly because they

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.830 
expensive really quickly because they
cost<00:01:05.369> like<00:01:05.549> eighteen<00:01:06.060> dollars<00:01:06.330> each<00:01:06.540> after

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
cost like eighteen dollars each after

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.399 
cost like eighteen dollars each after
tax<00:01:07.049> if<00:01:07.530> you're<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:07.799> Canada<00:01:08.240> so<00:01:09.240> yeah<00:01:09.390> um<00:01:10.320> I

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
tax if you're in Canada so yeah um I

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.899 
tax if you're in Canada so yeah um I

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
bye okay so we all know that Mac pallets

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.480 
bye okay so we all know that Mac pallets
come<00:01:31.770> like<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.250> with<00:01:32.640> 15<00:01:33.150> spaces<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.869> them

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
come like this with 15 spaces in them

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.100 
come like this with 15 spaces in them
but<00:01:35.490> what's<00:01:35.670> really<00:01:35.850> frustrating<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.720> if

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
but what's really frustrating is that if

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.450 
but what's really frustrating is that if
these<00:01:37.290> dividers<00:01:37.799> weren't<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.100> there<00:01:38.250> you'd<00:01:38.369> be

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
these dividers weren't in there you'd be

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.460 
these dividers weren't in there you'd be
able<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.759> hold<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.090> many<00:01:39.210> more<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:40.229> what<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.409> lot

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
able to hold so many more so what a lot

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.140 
able to hold so many more so what a lot
of<00:01:40.650> people<00:01:40.860> do<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.220> they<00:01:41.369> take<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.729> spacers

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
of people do is they take the spacers

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.999 
of people do is they take the spacers
out<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.540> then<00:01:42.630> they<00:01:42.750> can<00:01:42.869> hold<00:01:43.020> 26<00:01:43.680> shadows

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
out and then they can hold 26 shadows

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.260 
out and then they can hold 26 shadows
instead<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.820> just<00:01:44.939> 15<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:46.189> I<00:01:47.189> bought<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.210> new

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
instead of just 15 so I bought this new

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.850 
instead of just 15 so I bought this new
one<00:01:48.570> because<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:49.110> too<00:01:49.259> many<00:01:49.350> purples<00:01:49.770> and

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
one because I have too many purples and

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.340 
one because I have too many purples and
pinks<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.310> they<00:01:50.909> obviously<00:01:51.060> overflow<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.259> I'm

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
pinks and they obviously overflow so I'm

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.660 
pinks and they obviously overflow so I'm
going<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.619> separate<00:01:52.829> my<00:01:52.920> purple<00:01:53.280> my<00:01:53.399> Pink's

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
going to separate my purple my Pink's

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.850 
going to separate my purple my Pink's
into<00:01:53.850> their<00:01:53.970> own<00:01:54.090> palette

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
into their own palette

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:02.200 
into their own palette
so<00:01:55.610> I<00:01:57.700> need<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:58.940> remove<00:01:59.390> this<00:02:00.340> tray<00:02:01.340> theme<00:02:01.580> so

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210

I'm gonna show you how to do that today

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.810 
I'm gonna show you how to do that today
so<00:02:03.590> obviously<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.340> first<00:02:04.520> thing<00:02:04.640> you're

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
so obviously the first thing you're

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.550 
so obviously the first thing you're
gonna<00:02:04.910> do<00:02:05.120> is<00:02:05.150> like<00:02:05.480> take<00:02:05.720> out<00:02:05.840> any<00:02:06.050> colors<00:02:06.350> if

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
gonna do is like take out any colors if

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:15.790 
gonna do is like take out any colors if
there's<00:02:06.770> any<00:02:06.980> in<00:02:07.160> there<00:02:13.540> then<00:02:14.540> you'll<00:02:15.500> see

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
there's any in there then you'll see

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.470 
there's any in there then you'll see
that<00:02:15.830> there's<00:02:16.550> like<00:02:16.970> these<00:02:18.460> edges<00:02:19.460> all<00:02:19.880> along

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
that there's like these edges all along

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.710 
that there's like these edges all along
the<00:02:20.990> entire<00:02:21.290> thing<00:02:22.120> just<00:02:23.120> I<00:02:23.270> just<00:02:23.330> use<00:02:23.690> a

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
the entire thing just I just use a

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.330 
the entire thing just I just use a
safety<00:02:24.080> pin<00:02:24.260> but<00:02:24.740> I<00:02:24.770> guess<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.160> could<00:02:25.310> use

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
safety pin but I guess you could use

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.130 
safety pin but I guess you could use
anything<00:02:25.790> with<00:02:26.030> can't<00:02:26.630> even<00:02:26.780> see<00:02:26.930> just<00:02:27.050> a

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
anything with can't even see just a

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.630 
anything with can't even see just a
Japan<00:02:29.170> but<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.830> can<00:02:30.950> use<00:02:31.070> anything<00:02:31.280> with<00:02:31.520> like

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
Japan but you can use anything with like

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.160 
Japan but you can use anything with like
a<00:02:31.700> sharp<00:02:31.970> edge<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:32.510> I<00:02:33.350> just<00:02:33.560> stick<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.160> in<00:02:34.310> and

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
a sharp edge and I just stick it in and

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:46.770 
a sharp edge and I just stick it in and
lift<00:02:36.170> it<00:02:36.350> out

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.990 

and<00:02:47.780> that<00:02:47.990> sound<00:02:48.350> isn't<00:02:49.010> fit<00:02:49.250> breaking<00:02:49.850> if

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
and that sound isn't fit breaking if

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000 
and that sound isn't fit breaking if
just<00:02:50.270> that<00:02:50.450> because<00:02:50.990> it's<00:02:51.140> clipped<00:02:51.470> in<00:02:51.800> you've

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
just that because it's clipped in you've

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.660 
just that because it's clipped in you've
got<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.160> kind<00:02:52.400> of<00:02:52.550> remove<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:53.500> clipping<00:02:54.670> that

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
got to kind of remove the clipping that

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:26.180 
got to kind of remove the clipping that
makes<00:02:55.880> any<00:02:56.090> sense

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.910 

so<00:03:27.190> there<00:03:27.490> you<00:03:27.610> go<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:28.180> tray<00:03:29.020> thingy<00:03:29.350> is<00:03:29.650> out

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
so there you go the tray thingy is out

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.330 
so there you go the tray thingy is out
of<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.670> pan<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.270> now<00:03:31.960> this<00:03:32.560> is<00:03:32.710> actually<00:03:33.130> just

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
of the pan and now this is actually just

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.270 
of the pan and now this is actually just
a<00:03:33.670> sheet<00:03:34.240> of<00:03:34.450> metal<00:03:34.720> in<00:03:35.050> there<00:03:35.260> which<00:03:35.890> is<00:03:36.100> what

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
a sheet of metal in there which is what

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.360 
a sheet of metal in there which is what
makes<00:03:36.430> these<00:03:36.640> pellets<00:03:36.970> magnetized<00:03:38.310> so<00:03:39.310> you

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
makes these pellets magnetized so you

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.440 
makes these pellets magnetized so you
can<00:03:39.550> stick<00:03:39.820> your<00:03:39.850> shadows<00:03:40.390> in<00:03:40.890> and<00:03:42.270> they<00:03:43.270> won't

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
can stick your shadows in and they won't

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.820 
can stick your shadows in and they won't
go<00:03:43.600> anywhere<00:03:43.840> because<00:03:44.400> it's<00:03:45.420> magnetized<00:03:46.800> yeah

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
go anywhere because it's magnetized yeah

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.470 
go anywhere because it's magnetized yeah
so<00:03:48.130> this<00:03:48.310> way<00:03:48.460> you<00:03:48.520> can<00:03:48.640> obviously<00:03:49.270> fit<00:03:49.450> a

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
so this way you can obviously fit a

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.480 
so this way you can obviously fit a
whole<00:03:49.690> bunch<00:03:49.930> more<00:03:50.050> in<00:03:50.410> and<00:03:50.650> if<00:03:51.160> you<00:03:51.310> ever

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
whole bunch more in and if you ever

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.940 
whole bunch more in and if you ever
wanted<00:03:52.000> to<00:03:52.060> go<00:03:52.600> back<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:53.050> these<00:03:53.170> you<00:03:53.410> can<00:03:53.650> just

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
wanted to go back to these you can just

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.860 
wanted to go back to these you can just
pop<00:03:54.130> it<00:03:54.280> back<00:03:54.310> in<00:03:54.640> and<00:03:54.850> the<00:03:55.300> little<00:03:55.540> clasp

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
pop it back in and the little clasp

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.050 
pop it back in and the little clasp
thingies<00:03:56.500> will<00:03:56.800> just<00:03:57.070> grip<00:03:57.430> onto<00:03:57.640> it<00:03:57.880> again

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
thingies will just grip onto it again

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.370 
thingies will just grip onto it again
and<00:03:58.410> yeah<00:03:59.410> that's<00:03:59.920> how<00:04:00.070> you<00:04:00.160> do<00:04:00.340> that
