 I attached the gel bag with the extension of the 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.800

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.940
 that the body in the child is ti 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:33.000
 I mixed three shades of blue mixed tones 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:36.310

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:50.020

 each dress on the clothesline 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.380
 then I cut other elements like 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.150
 a cloud 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:14.590
