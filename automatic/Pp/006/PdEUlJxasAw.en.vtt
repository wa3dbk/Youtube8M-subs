00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.780 

now<00:01:21.050> before<00:01:21.230> I<00:01:21.410> jump<00:01:21.710> in<00:01:21.890> on<00:01:22.010> him<00:01:22.160> I<00:01:22.310> made<00:01:22.760> sure

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
now before I jump in on him I made sure

that<00:01:23.030> he<00:01:23.420> would<00:01:23.540> use<00:01:23.750> his<00:01:23.780> stun<00:01:24.260> just<00:01:24.710> before

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
that he would use his stun just before

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.560 
that he would use his stun just before
so<00:01:25.280> I<00:01:25.340> could<00:01:25.520> get<00:01:25.640> a<00:01:25.670> quick<00:01:25.970> kill<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:26.480> get

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
so I could get a quick kill and get

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.660 
so I could get a quick kill and get
