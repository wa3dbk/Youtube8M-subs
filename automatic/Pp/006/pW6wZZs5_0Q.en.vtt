00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.740
 hello that such friends I am crisis from the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.590
 universe of crisis and today we are going to 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.750
 prepare another raw vegan recipe that 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.340
 besides this is a recipe that apart from 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.289
 be very simple and prepare very 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.240
 fast is one of those well then 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.640
 for when we want to give us a little 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.619
 homage or we want to invite someone to 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.230
 house is a much more colorful dish 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.140
 ok but it is a dish also low in 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.520
 super digestive fat came out almost all 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.809
 the recipes that I do and if I will not tell you 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.520
 they are well combined they are worth and they do not have 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.750
 I do not usually make very dense recipes very 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.270
 high in fat with bad combinations 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.550
 we can do that in counted 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.129
 chances are good but they are usually 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.100
 all very light and we're going to make some 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.199
 vegetable rolls we will use 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.079
 therefore to fill those rolls 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.789
 we're going to it lately 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.440
 a few sheets of rice but today we 're going 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.390
 to make with gonzález seaweed rolls 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.379
 algae I bought us supermarkets 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.270
 Asians 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.329
 now seen that the finestra 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.340
 has ecological so and it shows 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:13.710
 note very much the taste and texture 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.979
 then we will use 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.750
 nori seaweed sheets we are going to use 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.750
 for the carrot cucumber filling 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:27.050
 and pineapple and the secret of these rolls 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.980
 they will carry will carry coconut 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.780
 cool 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.680
 I have opened a coconut if you want to know 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.300
 how to open it 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.680
 I have a video of how to open it in a 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.970
 minute and you got the pulp worth and these 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.730
 coconuts where you can buy them 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.640
 you can buy in chests worth the carry 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.410
 in one day home and all these vegetables 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.000
 they are from between cabbage and cabbage that are vegetables 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.060
 they are the most ecological they also have 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.170
 some of integrated agriculture worth 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.640
 but they are of a fabulous quality worth and 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.770
 the secret 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.140
 we are going to use the pulp and the 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.090
 sauce that we are going to add let's add 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.830
 curried seaweed tartar that this 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.140

 you can buy what you can buy many 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.360
 herbalists is worth it and it is very good if not 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.060
 we have this tartar, we can do 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.280
 us a salty from algae 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.489
 example with zucchini or with almonds 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.950
 ok and that's it, so let's get to 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.680
 make the recipe first thing we're going to 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.230
 cut the carrot and cucumber into strips 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.150
 with a mandolin and with the accessory 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:39.159
 saw is worth so simply 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.159
 and with this to not cut our fingers 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.450
 now let's take a mat for 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.450
 sushi 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.790
 Y 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:18.939
 let's put the nori seaweed 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.939
 and we are going to fill with the vegetables 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.990
 we put the carrot 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.850
 we put 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:33.790
 the cucumber 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.790
 we put strips of pineapple 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.260
 the pulp of fresh coconut 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.629
 that this is going to give a very 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.629
 exotic to the rolls the pineapple and the coconut 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:01.420
 and let's take a couple of tablespoons of 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.420
 algae tartar curry 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.680
 low 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:17.040
 look 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.040
 how nice and tasty 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.860
 and now we are going to roll 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.310
 is that we put it more or less in the 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.310
 center 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:36.320
 and now we roll with the mat 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.320
 we tighten well with fingers 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.490
 look at this liquid 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.949
 that is letting go we are going to take advantage 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:48.800
 to wet the part if we would not 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:52.670
 with water to wet the edge d 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:57.250
 of long so that later it is pegadito 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:57.250
 now that we're fine and something is going 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.169
 the question of the day 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:17.000
 and we have many 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.450
 and now the secret so that we are not 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.450
 break 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:27.340
 use a knife that is well 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.340
 sharp edges the edges are removed 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.860
 we remove the edges 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:38.210
 and also how the rolls have marks 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.210
 we are cutting by the practices 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.500
 do not 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.890
