design<00:00:27.300> thingies<00:00:27.810> on<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.109> top<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:29.090> don't<00:00:30.090> know

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
design thingies on the top I don't know

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.310 
design thingies on the top I don't know
how<00:00:30.330> accurate<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.199> but<00:00:33.260> here's<00:00:34.260> the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
how accurate that is but here's the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.130 
how accurate that is but here's the
cockpit<00:00:35.960> you<00:00:36.960> can<00:00:37.140> open<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.469> up<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.980> there's<00:00:38.370> a

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
cockpit you can open it up and there's a

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.610 
cockpit you can open it up and there's a
control<00:00:40.140> panel<00:00:40.320> or<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.890> person<00:00:41.399> can<00:00:41.550> sit<00:00:43.309> and

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
control panel or a person can sit and

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.069 
control panel or a person can sit and
then<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.489> easily<00:00:47.910> like<00:00:48.600> put<00:00:48.960> it

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
then so you can easily like put it

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.529 
then so you can easily like put it
somewhere<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.920> wings<00:00:50.160> are<00:00:50.399> detachable<00:00:51.800> so

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
somewhere the wings are detachable so

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.090 
somewhere the wings are detachable so
that<00:00:54.539> way<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.750> can<00:00:54.989> easily<00:00:55.140> like<00:00:55.590> store<00:00:55.949> it

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
that way you can easily like store it

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:04.210 
that way you can easily like store it
and<00:00:56.600> then<00:00:58.670> the<00:01:00.079> these<00:01:01.079> things<00:01:01.469> go<00:01:02.039> up<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.370> down

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
and then the these things go up and down

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.870 
and then the these things go up and down
and<00:01:05.220> then<00:01:05.750> you<00:01:06.750> can<00:01:06.960> fit<00:01:07.860> like<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.640> don't<00:01:08.760> know

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
and then you can fit like I don't know

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.520 
and then you can fit like I don't know
how<00:01:09.030> many<00:01:09.060> blocks<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.900> whole<00:01:10.049> lot<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.290> people
