 very good everyone again welcome 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.570
 to the channel, I'm may, how are you? 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.240
 welcome to a small video 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.220
 explanatory today Sunday so you can 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.630
 access our server ads 22 that is 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.480
 running under the version of taiana eu 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.680
 it there are many people who do not have 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.240
 could not see and could not enter 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.340
 I gave up and I see that it was quite 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.890
 necessary to catch and make this this 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.360
 small videotutorial how good that for 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.669
 this case is very specific but that 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.060
 will serve for other occasions and good I 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.710
 I hope that for many 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.330
 The fact is that when you have some 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.420
 problem with the beta so it's not 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:44.140
 still here in ez commander it's worth 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.810
 usually you see that here goes from 100 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.100
 697 to 101 480 is it has happened in 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.710
 Our server is running under the 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.480
 version 101 74 7 that new one appears there 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.420
 it's as simple as coming here to this 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.560
 address that I will leave the description 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.170
 www armed dotcom 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:03.359
 beta php script 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.509
 you are looking for the one that you need to notice 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.320
 here are all the versions the 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.560
 previous versions that there are also of 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.869
 caps in this case the one above would be the 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.689
 newest in which we are using 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.250
 they were simple as fuck 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.299
 ok we could download the right here 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.979
 down think that this is chrome 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.530
 depending on the browser you have 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.549
 canceled that I already have it downloaded if you 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.860
 I would download vale extract fields extract 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.289
 here then yes to everything for the extra 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.200
 extracted for the right button run 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:37.259
 as an equal administrator, you install 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.600
 come extracting let's go there 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.360
 application to update the data or 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.470
 the armada data 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.550
 two 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.100
 you give this is done ok with this 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.420
 I will leave this message tell you cancel 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.100
 because the problem has been installed well 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.330
 with this we would have installed the beta 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.160
 patch that is running right now we 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.110
 can be used for other versions worth 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.940
 it does not mean that it's just for this 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.920
 let's say it's commander because in 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.520
 he says he's with van der if he pikes 22 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.420
 is our server currently does not appear 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.119
 possibly later yes that 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.640
 appear and there will be no problems in this 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.830
 case what what we do is 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.410
 select any any server 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.040
 of taiana a reminder also of one 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.090
 I will say many times and what is needed 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.220
 OK 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.910
 you give a filter that same does not matter 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.650
 ok and you give access 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.800
 now it's a matter of what 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.440
 load the game and appear 'aces' in the 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.820
 pool of any server 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.320
 now when I launch the game I will explain 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.610
 stands is really simple really 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.560
 simple but good to avoid 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.150
 that people are left without being able to enter and 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.150
 keep playing like so far 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.810
 once we are in the poule what we 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.670
 I used to say that I'm in the poule de 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.210
 another server that is not our own 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.530
 I just take some disconnect 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.530
 I'm going to multiplayer 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.920
 we waited for a moment that I located the 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.600
 two servers or in this case one set 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.730
 that is half empty if not empty 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.800
 for this the fact that people still do not 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.870
 he knows how to get in and that's what 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.250
 video voucher we enter here password 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.230
 current free waffles 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.840
 and such 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.560
 and these are snake things worth 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.560
 password spades 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.300
 and we would be here entering the 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.300
 server 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.650
 after all this, now you will see 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.630
 as when I entered we appear in the place 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.500
 where we were at the time 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.780
 and you can start playing 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.730
 later to all this I will explain that 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.180
 given the merger that we have carried out 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.000
 with downstream with server s 69 and 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.550
 us that 22 are going to have two 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.290
 Dedicated servers that are going to pay 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.750
 monthly for us here you 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.620
 you do not have to pay anything for it 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.959
 surely in the long run we put a 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.310
 option to donate if you want here nobody 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.130
 is bound we do it because 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.320
 we want but good against more income 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.820
 have the community because already what is 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.470
 for the community is not for us not 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.350
 it's nothing to stay with us much 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.510
 less will be for improvements to the 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.830
 server towards the web towards the two 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.870
 servers towards the two servers 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.209
 sorry one of them the downstream one goes 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.860
 to be running with the zeta version 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:25.500
 plus that is chernarus basically but 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:27.360
 It is also modified to the 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.500
 downstream guys those are about 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.409
 cracks and what they have done has been 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.449
 prepare 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:34.399
 a version that already had zeta plus 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:35.569
 well with certain things quite more 

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:37.219
 interesting as for example when 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:40.519
 we got five crossbow tokens 

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:42.439
 can be grouped in a single charger by 

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:43.689
 well call it agree things by the 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:46.659
 style 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:48.519
 and new and good weapons and we in 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:51.759
 brief in a few days we will be playing with 

00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:53.110
 what is the version of tatiana origins 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:56.769
 which is a much harder version already 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:59.379
 let's leave out those 50 m 107 if 

00:04:56.769 --> 00:05:01.299
 to the most antimatter you already know that no 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:03.339
 we like it not much better like this so all 

00:05:01.299 --> 00:05:07.209
 we enjoyed what the game itself is 

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:10.320
 and it's not so easy, so it's good 

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:11.910
 here you have me, I'm here 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.870

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:19.850
 way it does not have any better and here if all 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.850
 it has gone well it has to appear my plx 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.820
