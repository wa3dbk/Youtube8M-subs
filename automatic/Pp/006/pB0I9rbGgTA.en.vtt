00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:05.210
 the mc war which is a hunger games here 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.929
 In Brazil, it 's 100 web, no people 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.940

 without much curling you are seeing there 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.520
 in the title what is the kit review is from 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:22.580
 fisherman who also equals hunger 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:36.170
 games gringo the fischer man but without much 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:38.270
 Let's open it and then 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.509
 well guys why fisherman you get 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.360
 only with a fishing rod in normal 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:48.409
 of minecraft and it's good because you 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.600
 can play is both sun on soil and 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.939
 also towers grandson are you will see in the 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.200
 game play a few games in which I 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:58.219
 I threw it on the ground cracking and also on 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.950
 tower 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:03.649
 It's great for you to pull is on the ground. 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.350
 because with the fishing rod you 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:09.649
 will pull your enemies to you and 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.590
 You pulling them you have a 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.760
 very large facility 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:20.660
 komba on you give rt followed in it before 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.930
 it is to seal the apple through the 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.030
 by knoc beck of same year sword 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.430
 so you have this ease to drop 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.900
 several based on them as you go 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.530
 can see and gameplay 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.900
 now if you are going to play in martinho 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.270
 the tower team you have the chance to 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.720
 pull the same tower enemies is 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.060
 towers next edict for you to take down 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.400
 they for example you still pull meiji 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.250
 You pull the crop is knock them down already 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:53.180
 it was the enemy tower right? 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:56.239
 so we can see that the fisherman 's kit is 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.790
 a very versatile kit he serves 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.350
 for several and several things he 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.360
 also serves quit for what? 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.630
 in case you 're dying of hunger 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.620
 practically you can and you can 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.320
 to fish 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.709
 you do not need canada mids you 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:16.010
 can simply put the fault in the 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:21.980
 more in the sea ​​on the lake or whatever 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:24.620
 When the sun is out, I do not know what you call it. 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.290
 it's sinking you press the right 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.140
 new and there will come the fish comes to you 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.480
 since then this also makes it much easier 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.150
 on his survival in the emmy or cicada 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.430
 no hunger games 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.980
 honestly I do not play much with the kit 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.440
 fisherman is because because I do not 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.470
 I knew how good it is. 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.470
 Now I went to play the rhythm to record the rhythm. 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.650
 and saw guys I found it very good even 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:55.880
 We had p why that pulled you give 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:58.040
 in his enemy he loses the notion of 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.590
 Where is he wrong when you 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.600
 hit it like hell for him you can 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.560
 see that I kill the very enemies 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.720
 quickly 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.420
 before they even notice that I am 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.660
 close understood then I 'm enjoying 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.359
 enough of this kit remembering that in the 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:19.940
 hunger games gringo calls fischer man e 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:22.270
 in the war he calls the fisherman and I suggest 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.400
 that if I were to play with this kit it would be 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:29.000
 I recommend that you leave the stick 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.880
 fish button 1 and the sword button 2 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.100
 or vice versa the sword on the button 1 the stick 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.229
 to fish the two button because you go 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.740
 have to give two clicks to the guy 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:42.080
 The next Sunday comes to you, with a 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.300
 hotel and carriage in quotes 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.670
 you'll have to click first with 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.340
 the right button stops 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.870

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.660

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.660
