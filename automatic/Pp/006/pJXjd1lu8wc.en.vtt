the<00:02:04.040> bubbles<00:02:04.400> there<00:02:05.180> is<00:02:05.330> food<00:02:05.630> coloring<00:02:06.080> you

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
the bubbles there is food coloring you

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.260 
the bubbles there is food coloring you
start<00:02:06.500> to<00:02:06.620> get<00:02:06.770> a<00:02:06.800> little<00:02:07.010> little<00:02:07.580> bigger<00:02:07.880> and

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
start to get a little little bigger and

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.359 
start to get a little little bigger and
then<00:02:08.570> they<00:02:08.720> go<00:02:08.900> to<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.740> bottom<00:02:09.950> of<00:02:10.220> the

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
then they go to the bottom of the

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.960 
then they go to the bottom of the
vegetable<00:02:10.910> oil<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:12.770> vegetable<00:02:13.280> oil<00:02:13.670> is<00:02:13.790> on

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
vegetable oil the vegetable oil is on

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.900 
vegetable oil the vegetable oil is on
the<00:02:14.120> top<00:02:14.330> of<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.630> water<00:02:15.430> it<00:02:16.430> does<00:02:16.700> this

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
the top of the water it does this

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.160 
the top of the water it does this
because<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.990> density<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.830> has<00:02:19.490> more<00:02:20.170> density

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
because the density it has more density

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.190 
because the density it has more density
has<00:02:21.470> what<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.970> vegetable<00:02:23.450> oil<00:02:23.570> have<00:02:23.960> less

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
has what the vegetable oil have less

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.830 
has what the vegetable oil have less
density<00:02:24.890> than<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.130> water<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:26.240> density<00:02:26.690> the

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
density than the water the density the

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.560 
density than the water the density the
density<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:27.980> water<00:02:28.220> has<00:02:28.640> more<00:02:29.090> than<00:02:29.420> the

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
density and the water has more than the

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.590 
density and the water has more than the
vegetable<00:02:30.080> oil<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:31.120> so<00:02:32.120> does<00:02:32.270> the<00:02:32.390> food

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
vegetable oil and so does the food

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.690 
vegetable oil and so does the food
coloring<00:02:32.900> it<00:02:33.440> is<00:02:33.680> going<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.310> bottom<00:02:34.580> of

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
coloring it is going to the bottom of

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.870 
coloring it is going to the bottom of
the<00:02:34.790> vegetable<00:02:35.470> oil<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:37.340> top<00:02:37.550> of<00:02:37.790> the

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
waiting to go even though it was first

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.900 
waiting to go even though it was first
to<00:03:37.430> drop<00:03:37.640> in<00:03:37.880> now<00:03:38.420> there<00:03:38.840> goes<00:03:39.400> it<00:03:40.400> just<00:03:40.430> looks

to drop in now there goes it just looks

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.199 
to drop in now there goes it just looks
black<00:03:41.300> but<00:03:42.069> that's<00:03:43.069> because<00:03:43.310> it's<00:03:43.640> mixed<00:03:43.910> with

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
black but that's because it's mixed with

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:56.110 
black but that's because it's mixed with
the<00:03:44.390> blue<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:54.680> vegetable<00:03:55.160> oil<00:03:55.310> is<00:03:55.670> still<00:03:55.970> on

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
the blue the vegetable oil is still on

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.539 
the blue the vegetable oil is still on
the<00:03:56.239> top<00:03:56.480> but<00:03:56.840> everything<00:03:57.769> else<00:03:58.010> is<00:03:58.250> going

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
the top but everything else is going

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:07.120 
the top but everything else is going
down<00:03:58.760> to<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.239> bottom<00:03:59.420> of<00:03:59.660> the<00:03:59.780> water<00:04:05.290> now<00:04:06.290> the

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
down to the bottom of the water now the

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.370 
down to the bottom of the water now the
food<00:04:07.400> coloring<00:04:07.819> has<00:04:08.060> more<00:04:08.450> density<00:04:08.900> than<00:04:09.049> the

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
food coloring has more density than the

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:17.849 
food coloring has more density than the
vegetable<00:04:09.860> oil

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.479 

there's<00:04:19.409> still<00:04:20.409> a<00:04:20.470> few<00:04:20.590> that<00:04:20.889> haven't<00:04:21.310> gone

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
there's still a few that haven't gone

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.089 
there's still a few that haven't gone
down<00:04:21.549> yet<00:04:22.030> but<00:04:22.659> that's<00:04:22.840> just<00:04:23.289> how<00:04:23.439> it<00:04:23.560> works

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
down yet but that's just how it works

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:40.710 
down yet but that's just how it works
and<00:04:24.430> there's<00:04:24.970> one<00:04:25.270> going<00:04:25.479> down<00:04:25.659> now<00:04:29.639> this

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.230 

as<00:04:41.380> you<00:04:41.650> can<00:04:41.830> see<00:04:42.070> the<00:04:42.250> rat<00:04:42.430> is<00:04:42.670> now<00:04:42.880> turning

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
as you can see the rat is now turning

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.720 
as you can see the rat is now turning
into<00:04:43.540> a<00:04:43.870> dark<00:04:44.320> dark<00:04:44.680> purple<00:04:44.980> because<00:04:45.460> of<00:04:45.640> the

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
into a dark dark purple because of the

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.110 
into a dark dark purple because of the
brown<00:04:45.970> or<00:04:46.240> not<00:04:46.990> the<00:04:47.140> bound<00:04:47.350> but<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:47.950> blue<00:04:48.190> the

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
brown or not the bound but the blue the

00:04:49.120 --> 00:05:02.430 
brown or not the bound but the blue the
yellow<00:04:49.750> and<00:04:49.990> the<00:04:50.530> green<00:05:00.510> they<00:05:01.510> stored<00:05:01.900> it<00:05:02.050> they

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
yellow and the green they stored it they

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.810 
yellow and the green they stored it they
sort<00:05:02.800> of<00:05:02.920> stay<00:05:03.370> up<00:05:03.610> there<00:05:03.940> and<00:05:05.520> they<00:05:06.520> have<00:05:06.790> a

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
sort of stay up there and they have a

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:26.560 
sort of stay up there and they have a
little<00:05:07.120> less<00:05:07.450> density<00:05:08.050> than<00:05:08.620> the<00:05:10.320> bottom<00:05:11.320> does

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.780 

that<00:05:27.410> is<00:05:27.770> just<00:05:28.190> one<00:05:29.000> of<00:05:29.770> liquid<00:05:30.790> combinations

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 
that is just one of liquid combinations

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.480 
that is just one of liquid combinations
if<00:05:32.030> you<00:05:32.240> mix<00:05:32.510> them<00:05:32.690> together<00:05:32.870> but<00:05:33.710> as<00:05:33.980> you<00:05:34.310> can

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
if you mix them together but as you can

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.150 
if you mix them together but as you can
see<00:05:34.550> they<00:05:34.850> don't<00:05:35.000> really<00:05:35.390> mix<00:05:35.680> they<00:05:36.680> one<00:05:37.130> of

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
see they don't really mix they one of

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.310 
see they don't really mix they one of
them<00:05:37.430> just<00:05:37.640> stays<00:05:37.940> at<00:05:38.120> the<00:05:38.240> top<00:05:38.270> and<00:05:38.750> one<00:05:39.200> of

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
them just stays at the top and one of

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.670 
them just stays at the top and one of
them<00:05:39.440> goes<00:05:39.680> down<00:05:39.710> at<00:05:40.130> the<00:05:40.250> bottom<00:05:43.420> good<00:05:44.420> bye

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
them goes down at the bottom good bye

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.310 
them goes down at the bottom good bye
see<00:05:45.680> you<00:05:45.770> next<00:05:45.830> time
