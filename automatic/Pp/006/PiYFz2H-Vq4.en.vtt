00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:08.090
 marzipan figures marzipan only 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.250
 first of all marzipan is a mixture 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.370
 crushed almond flour and sugar 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.400
 syrup or powdered sugar 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.619
 sometimes marzipan is also called mass 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.480
 From other nuts in Russia widely 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.380
 common marzipan buns from 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:29.760
 peanut enough product has a long 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:33.079
 story some what translates it as 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.840
 century march or march easter eggs 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.910
 in different proportions where sugar 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.629
 make up from one third to two fifths 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.379
 and this proportion with almonds gives 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.820
 real classic marzipan 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.860
 some believe that it was invented 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.110
 in france but the spread itself 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.129
 wide received in germany and austria 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.410
 also our domestic industry 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.660
 basically the confectionery industry 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.940
 under Soviet rule she is not 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.890
 made marzipan 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.460
 and widespread 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.200
 various marzipan figures 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.770
 imitate how this case figure 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:18.250
 baby either figurine of some things 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.840
 fruit is not our industry 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.180
 engaged it was lost it 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.930
 was considered somewhat bourgeois rather 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.670
 of all, and all the more so in the Soviet 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.630
 confectionery industry like 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.970
 some write could not do 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.610
 real marzipan as a mixture of 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.090
 walnuts either from hazelnut 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.330
 nutritionally almond than almond 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:47.980
 possesses special properties which 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:50.380
 makes that mixture sticky and suitable for 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:54.310
 manufacturing quality of marzipan here this 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:58.020
 figure we get it out of the box this one 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:03.100
 baby of what kind of sleep 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:07.150
 covered with a blanket on pillows blankets 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:10.110

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.800
 round round round mattress yes not 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.620
 mattress even so round simple here 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.030
 he sleeps nipple nipple by the way he has 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.250
 repeats the look of this bow 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:31.000
 more precisely which is available here on 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.400
 blanket it enough, it is well done 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.840
 even his dolls 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.850
 there is here in the area hair strange 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.550
 despite the fact that the doll is not small 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.720
 This is already a hairstyle like some 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.840
 rock stars but see what hair 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.700
 long settlement with visa excellent 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.850
 babies hair isn't that long 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.930
 thick okay this is marzipan blanket 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:01.989
 has certain repetitions in part 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:06.480
 repetitions of drawings that are printed on 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:09.540
 him here is such a marzipan water the same here 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.959
 baby caps have such curved 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.880
 forms 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.269
 here are similar figures in the west 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.770
 are made gifts and there is enough 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.320
 common eat 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:25.330
 same museum here I read the museum 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:28.120
 marzipan marzipan in szentendre hungary 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.210
 Aging Estonia Love Germany Kafar 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.460
 Products and looking Keszthely Hungary 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:38.350
 that is quite common 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:42.430
 it's in europe we have a few things 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.470
 not done either got off in time on 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.320
 Tsarist Russia but then it all 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.020
 production was lost due to the fact that 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:53.200
 maybe he didn't need it all 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:57.480
 bore some bourgeois shade 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:00.670
 which was not needed by us but was superfluous 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:04.480
 so here's a look at what the box 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:07.930
 I was with a cap here I read the composition and 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.180
 mentioned almonds 20 percent and so 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.790
 understand 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.790
 made made this figurochka 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:23.130
 look at the list deplete 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.060
 natural product 60 grams 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.780
 but it is strange that the term does not seem 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:35.440
 shelf life was up to 23 0 2013 2013 yourself 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:39.400
 you see that is most likely marzipan 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:43.290
 the end has come though mars and bear proceed 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:46.000
 it can be stored as chocolate 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:49.540
 infinitely well of course it has a deadline 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.610
 shelf life but still this figure 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.230
 so thats can bring in 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:58.020
 gift similar marzipan products 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.070
 or even read a lot on the Internet 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.970
 information about such 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.970
 stuff
