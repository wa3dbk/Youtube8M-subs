little<00:02:06.010> cream<00:02:06.280> and<00:02:06.400> super<00:02:07.060> runny<00:02:07.470> as<00:02:08.470> you<00:02:08.619> can

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
little cream and super runny as you can

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.550 
little cream and super runny as you can
see<00:02:09.129> it<00:02:09.700> just<00:02:10.000> comes<00:02:10.360> out<00:02:10.569> with<00:02:10.929> of<00:02:11.050> me<00:02:11.230> even

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
see it just comes out with of me even

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.900 
see it just comes out with of me even
squeezing<00:02:12.129> it<00:02:12.250> so<00:02:12.370> I'm<00:02:12.459> just<00:02:12.580> gonna<00:02:12.670> use<00:02:12.879> a

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
squeezing it so I'm just gonna use a

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:36.250 
squeezing it so I'm just gonna use a
little<00:02:13.030> bit<00:02:13.330> and<00:02:14.230> instructs<00:02:15.239> about<00:02:16.239> this<00:02:16.510> much

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.750 

so<00:02:37.260> this<00:02:37.410> is<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.620> first<00:02:37.890> section<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.430> hair

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
so this is the first section of hair

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.810 
so this is the first section of hair
that<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.900> did<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:41.100> far<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:41.580> good

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
that I did so far so good

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.040 
that I did so far so good
and<00:02:42.380> using<00:02:43.380> this<00:02:44.150> blow<00:02:45.150> dryer<00:02:45.180> was<00:02:45.690> kind<00:02:45.990> of

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
and using this blow dryer was kind of

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.650 
and using this blow dryer was kind of
awkward<00:02:46.200> in<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.650> beginning<00:02:46.800> but<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.700> think<00:02:48.600> I

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
awkward in the beginning but I think I

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.480 
awkward in the beginning but I think I
kind<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:48.930> go<00:02:49.020> to<00:02:49.140> hammer<00:02:49.350> I<00:02:49.830> need<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.130> trim<00:02:50.340> my

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
kind of go to hammer I need to trim my

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.130 
kind of go to hammer I need to trim my
hands<00:02:50.850> on<00:02:50.970> them<00:02:51.090> because<00:02:51.270> it's<00:02:51.630> definitely
