great ideas start that's a couple of
years<00:00:48.899> we<00:00:49.170> decided<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.710> we<00:00:50.579> need<00:00:50.969> some<00:00:51.149> sort

of motivation to train throughout a

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.490 
of motivation to train throughout a
winter<00:00:53.390> it's<00:00:54.390> kind<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.840> hard<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.140> get<00:00:55.320> your

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
winter it's kind of hard to get your

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.650

butt<00:00:55.649> out<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.829> bed<00:00:55.980> when<00:00:56.370> it's<00:00:56.550> cold<00:00:57.180> out<00:00:57.360> dark

to<00:01:13.110> set<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.409> pattern<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.040> if<00:01:14.130> we<00:01:14.159> can<00:01:14.310> do<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.490> in

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
to set a pattern so if we can do this in

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.030 
to set a pattern so if we can do this in
November<00:01:15.030> will<00:01:15.450> probably<00:01:15.960> be<00:01:16.770> able<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.920> take

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
November will probably be able to take

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.100

the<00:03:32.610> second<00:03:32.970> piece<00:03:33.090> I<00:03:33.270> think<00:03:33.300> is<00:03:33.600> the

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
the second piece I think is the

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.020 
the second piece I think is the
community<00:03:34.170> yes<00:03:34.380> you<00:03:34.590> can<00:03:34.710> find<00:03:35.160> a<00:03:35.430> running

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
community yes you can find a running

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.300 
community yes you can find a running
club<00:03:36.270> or<00:03:36.660> a<00:03:36.690> workout<00:03:37.110> club<00:03:37.380> somewhere<00:03:37.800> and<00:03:38.160> you

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
know you can have a bunch of buddies but

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.680 
know you can have a bunch of buddies but
