on board and it is switchable in and out
on<00:00:48.100> a<00:00:48.130> push-pull<00:00:48.880> pot<00:00:49.590> that's<00:00:50.590> running<00:00:50.920> here

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:51.310 
on a push-pull pot that's running here

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.360 
on a push-pull pot that's running here
into<00:00:51.700> our<00:00:52.200> switcher<00:00:53.200> device<00:00:53.680> here<00:00:53.950> and

into our switcher device here and

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.460 
into our switcher device here and
basically<00:00:54.970> it<00:00:55.300> just<00:00:55.329> switches<00:00:55.870> between<00:00:55.990> three

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
basically it just switches between three
