00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
like as a benchmark i guess like it

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.230 
like as a benchmark i guess like it
makes<00:02:26.070> sense<00:02:26.190> but<00:02:26.430> like<00:02:26.610> everyone's<00:02:27.120> always

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
makes sense but like everyone's always

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.930 
makes sense but like everyone's always
like<00:02:27.330> what's<00:02:27.540> average<00:02:27.660> who<00:02:28.440> cares<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.950> have<00:02:29.760> no

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940
