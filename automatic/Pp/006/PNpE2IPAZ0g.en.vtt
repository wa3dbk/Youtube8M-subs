00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.460
 good afternoon I'm the lawyer me 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.830
 angle responsible for the dispatch of 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.129
 angle and associated lawyers in barcelona 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.750
 Today I am going to talk about a 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:19.170
 situation that can be found in 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:23.070
 criminal matter when some of our 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.680
 that your vehicle has been involved 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.430
 in a crime is to say something very usual 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:34.530
 of a citizen who was 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:37.980
 stealing copper wire and had his vehicle 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.339
 to the side on which I was loading the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.589
 cable and entering it in the vehicle 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:47.100
 what happened there was an operation of the 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:52.470
 police and has caught in flagrante is 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.840
 they have taken arrested and the test 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.120
 that the police also found apart 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.630
 of the amount of cable and the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.800
 tools was the vehicle that happens 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.110
 with this vehicle 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.970
 my client wanted to recover his vehicle 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.250
 but being part of an investigation 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:15.290
 until this procedure is completed 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:19.260
 That vehicle stays in a warehouse 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:22.680
 municipal is called here in Spain 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.210
 this way until there is a 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.479
 judgment 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.850
 because it is a fundamental part of the test 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.490
 what's going on 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.600
 my client also wanted to recover as 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:41.369
 it's normal for example a phone your 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.050
 good wallet key he wanted to recover his 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.000
 tools 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.910
 we see what we do in these 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.060
 situations we wrote a brief 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.110
 directed to his lordship doing this 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.490
 request 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.550
 that document must be transferred 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.160
 that is to say they give him entrance in the court what 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.450
 also pass to the prosecutor and the prosecutor and 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.520
 will decide that he almost always opposes and 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.820
 later the judge decides if we 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.310
 they say yes yes perfect and we 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.710
 we recover the belongings of the 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.350
 client and if they tell us that we do not have 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.210
 also request the client and 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.900
 We request now we recommend you to 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:25.110
 you to keep the invoices that 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.360
 costs but you have to keep receipts 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.750
 invoices so that in a situation like 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.290
 this can we make a 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.800
 written as more formal being able 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.160
 identify these tools and say 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.860
 for example that they were not part 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.960
 The company where the client worked 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.220
 I invent it but they were his property 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:51.470
 or that they were from pedro pÃ©rez et cetera but 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.090
 we always need those tools and 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.700

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.310
