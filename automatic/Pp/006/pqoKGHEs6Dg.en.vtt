released<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.480> new<00:00:15.740> 6750<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:17.180> 6770<00:00:18.180> have<00:00:18.750> now

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
released the new 6750 and 6770 have now

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.650 
released the new 6750 and 6770 have now
been<00:00:19.680> released<00:00:20.100> as<00:00:20.580> far<00:00:20.820> as<00:00:20.939> their<00:00:21.090> specs<00:00:21.420> go

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660
