right<00:02:05.209> here<00:02:05.450> we've<00:02:05.569> got<00:02:05.629> high<00:02:06.580> low-nutrient

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
right here we've got high low-nutrient

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.699 
right here we've got high low-nutrient
reverse<00:02:07.909> this<00:02:08.720> is<00:02:08.929> four-wheel<00:02:09.200> drive<00:02:09.440> so

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
reverse this is four-wheel drive so

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.290 
reverse this is four-wheel drive so

just<00:03:08.790> turning<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.120> Fenian<00:03:09.480> crank<00:03:09.750> them<00:03:09.840> up

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
just turning the Fenian crank them up

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.809 
just turning the Fenian crank them up
they<00:03:10.290> start<00:03:10.709> real<00:03:10.920> good<00:03:11.159> they're<00:03:11.400> nice<00:03:11.579> and

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
they start real good they're nice and

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.630 
they start real good they're nice and
quiet<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.650> they<00:03:13.650> just<00:03:13.859> do<00:03:14.010> really<00:03:14.340> really

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
quiet and they just do really really

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:22.040 
quiet and they just do really really
well<00:03:15.049> just<00:03:16.049> a<00:03:16.170> gas<00:03:16.409> bottle<00:03:16.709> a<00:03:16.920> brake<00:03:17.129> pedal

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.670 

got<00:03:23.010> seatbelts<00:03:23.750> I<00:03:24.750> think<00:03:25.200> I<00:03:25.260> showed<00:03:25.500> you<00:03:25.650> that

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
got seatbelts I think I showed you that

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.710 
got seatbelts I think I showed you that
much<00:03:25.890> your<00:03:26.010> parking<00:03:26.310> brake<00:03:26.340> there<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:27.000> one<00:03:27.630> of

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
much your parking brake there I one of

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.870 
much your parking brake there I one of
the<00:03:27.780> cool<00:03:27.960> things<00:03:28.290> about<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.890> mules

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.340 

it's<00:03:32.880> right<00:03:33.150> up<00:03:33.270> here<00:03:33.450> is<00:03:33.510> your<00:03:33.630> air<00:03:33.750> intake<00:03:33.960> so

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
it's right up here is your air intake so

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.320 
it's right up here is your air intake so
air<00:03:34.560> gets<00:03:34.860> drawn<00:03:35.190> in<00:03:35.430> through<00:03:35.940> those<00:03:36.090> two

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
air gets drawn in through those two

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.830 
air gets drawn in through those two
ports<00:03:36.780> air<00:03:37.230> comes<00:03:37.650> down<00:03:37.860> these<00:03:38.010> tubes<00:03:38.840> here

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
ports air comes down these tubes here

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.520 
ports air comes down these tubes here
and<00:03:40.020> I've<00:03:40.650> got<00:03:40.680> a<00:03:40.830> hose<00:03:41.450> that<00:03:42.450> connects<00:03:42.900> right

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
and I've got a hose that connects right

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.130 
and I've got a hose that connects right
back<00:03:43.710> here<00:03:44.070> to<00:03:44.730> that<00:03:44.880> and<00:03:45.150> that<00:03:45.300> goes<00:03:45.510> to<00:03:45.930> the

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
back here to that and that goes to the

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.670 
back here to that and that goes to the
air<00:03:46.680> filter<00:03:47.160> and<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.520> the<00:03:47.640> torque<00:03:47.850> converter

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
air filter and to the torque converter

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.460 
air filter and to the torque converter
we've<00:03:49.680> got<00:03:49.890> so<00:03:50.490> here's<00:03:50.790> that<00:03:50.940> hose<00:03:51.470> connected

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
we've got so here's that hose connected

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.290 
we've got so here's that hose connected
this<00:03:52.680> filter<00:03:53.160> goes<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:53.910> torque<00:03:54.180> converter

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
this filter goes to the torque converter

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.210 
this filter goes to the torque converter
we<00:03:54.660> circulate<00:03:55.230> air<00:03:55.470> through<00:03:55.800> this<00:03:55.920> torque

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
we circulate air through this torque

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.790 
we circulate air through this torque
converter<00:03:56.580> to<00:03:56.760> keep<00:03:56.940> it<00:03:57.090> cool<00:03:57.300> so<00:03:58.200> this<00:03:58.470> is<00:03:58.650> the

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
converter to keep it cool so this is the

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.010 
converter to keep it cool so this is the
intake<00:03:59.220> here<00:04:00.150> this<00:04:00.870> is<00:04:01.050> the<00:04:01.200> exhaust<00:04:01.500> here<00:04:02.130> and

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
intake here this is the exhaust here and

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.570 
intake here this is the exhaust here and
so<00:04:04.020> we<00:04:04.200> filter<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.830> air<00:04:04.860> we<00:04:05.130> circulate

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
so we filter the air we circulate

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.830 
so we filter the air we circulate
through<00:04:05.760> there<00:04:05.910> and<00:04:06.060> then<00:04:06.210> by<00:04:06.330> drawing<00:04:06.630> that

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
through there and then by drawing that

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.290 
through there and then by drawing that
air<00:04:07.080> up<00:04:07.230> high<00:04:07.470> then<00:04:08.340> what<00:04:08.520> we<00:04:08.610> call<00:04:08.760> small<00:04:09.090> cold

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
air up high then what we call small cold

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.700 
air up high then what we call small cold
air<00:04:09.390> intake<00:04:09.660> we<00:04:09.810> get<00:04:09.930> cleaner<00:04:10.230> air<00:04:10.470> that's

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710 
air intake we get cleaner air that's

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.370 
air intake we get cleaner air that's
less<00:04:10.890> dust<00:04:11.160> up<00:04:11.370> high<00:04:11.550> so<00:04:12.240> really<00:04:12.630> a<00:04:12.660> cool

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
less dust up high so really a cool

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.140 
less dust up high so really a cool
feature<00:04:13.710> and<00:04:14.010> then<00:04:14.430> there's<00:04:14.610> another<00:04:14.730> hose

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
feature and then there's another hose

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.610 
feature and then there's another hose
over<00:04:15.390> there<00:04:15.540> on<00:04:15.600> the<00:04:15.660> other<00:04:15.720> side<00:04:16.140> goes<00:04:16.380> to<00:04:16.410> a

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
over there on the other side goes to a

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.160 
over there on the other side goes to a
filter<00:04:16.890> there<00:04:17.250> that<00:04:18.030> goes<00:04:18.480> into<00:04:18.690> the<00:04:18.870> engine

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
filter there that goes into the engine

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.570 
filter there that goes into the engine
there's<00:04:19.350> your<00:04:19.500> throttle<00:04:19.830> body<00:04:20.010> and<00:04:20.250> stuff<00:04:20.459> for

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
there's your throttle body and stuff for

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.470 
there's your throttle body and stuff for
the<00:04:20.640> fuel<00:04:20.910> injection

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
the fuel injection

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.550 
the fuel injection
so<00:04:22.520> again<00:04:23.520> just<00:04:23.820> cleaner<00:04:24.150> air<00:04:24.420> up<00:04:24.630> high<00:04:24.840> less

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
so again just cleaner air up high less

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.590 
so again just cleaner air up high less
