00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
to get a good screen recording program

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.029 
to get a good screen recording program
the<00:00:45.539> best<00:00:45.690> one<00:00:45.870> out<00:00:45.899> there<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.260> Camtasia<00:00:46.499> but

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
the best one out there is Camtasia but

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
expensive actually but if you go to

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.270
