 glamor producing content for tv requires 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:39.459
 A lot of work is about capturing

 two years I was without anything to do 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:24.250

 That's where I know, this is what I want. 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.570
 This is what I 'm going to do I think 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.160
 my life has changed completely is not 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.030
 because it was a project that helped me 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.340
 enough 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:46.169
 Today I have a production company with 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.169
 own equipment and 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:57.260
 and today I come here I'm going to work 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.780

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.590
 I 'm hanging out with pillar 56 hours I'm here with the 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.720
 folks 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.750
 Let's fight, let's not channel the channel. 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.880
 will create more more ideas let's create 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.270
 programs is to prevent the project to 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.970
 a program a type program equal to the 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:17.270
 you prefer that you enter 10 more or 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:20.120
 the less I think the future I can help 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.850
 also people I was helped too 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.130
 poet in the world of viola in the world of 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.670
 Bad things but nowadays I have 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.670
 a profession 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:39.050
 Our thinking is to organize 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:42.320
 our site to organize our site and 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.630
 can put the same tv schedule 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.420
 on the internet on our site 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:50.030
 We think that someday the channel will come. 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.520
 reach for more people understood that the 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:55.450
 the channel closed, so I remember a lot 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.450
 this culture 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:33.900
 oh I wash my soul 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.900
