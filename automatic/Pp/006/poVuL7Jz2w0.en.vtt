00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
have to do the meteors at exact times so

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.280

ground after the second wave just or

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.630 
ground after the second wave just or
even<00:00:55.240> before<00:00:55.360> that<00:00:55.570> like<00:00:55.930> I<00:00:56.050> have<00:00:56.490> just<00:00:57.490> make

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
even before that like I have just make

sure you can get all these flying things
and<00:00:59.980> you'll<00:01:00.130> be<00:01:00.310> good<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:01.480> is<00:01:01.720> fairly<00:01:02.140> simple

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
and you'll be good it is fairly simple

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.510 
and you'll be good it is fairly simple
just<00:01:03.430> make<00:01:03.640> sure<00:01:03.850> you<00:01:04.030> do<00:01:04.180> have<00:01:04.420> enough<00:01:04.720> stars

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520

before<00:01:06.520> you<00:01:06.640> start<00:01:06.909> the<00:01:07.060> level<00:01:07.179> to<00:01:07.420> upgrade

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
before you start the level to upgrade

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.370 
before you start the level to upgrade
all<00:01:08.170> of<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.439> extra<00:01:08.979> things<00:01:09.250> I<00:01:10.049> am<00:01:11.049> assuming

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
all of the extra things I am assuming

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.380 
all of the extra things I am assuming
that<00:01:11.649> you<00:01:11.740> have<00:01:11.890> done<00:01:12.039> all<00:01:12.369> the<00:01:12.670> levels<00:01:13.000> before

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
that you have done all the levels before

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.870 
that you have done all the levels before
this<00:01:13.630> including<00:01:14.469> 3<00:01:14.859> stars<00:01:15.189> on<00:01:15.399> all<00:01:15.609> of<00:01:15.789> the

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
this including 3 stars on all of the

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.099 
this including 3 stars on all of the
campaign<00:01:16.450> as<00:01:16.750> well<00:01:17.140> as<00:01:17.320> all<00:01:17.590> of<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:18.100> iron<00:01:18.399> and

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:19.109 
campaign as well as all of the iron and

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:21.569 
campaign as well as all of the iron and
heroic<00:01:20.109> challenges<00:01:20.979> so<00:01:21.189> that's<00:01:21.340> a<00:01:21.460> lot<00:01:21.549> of

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:21.579 
heroic challenges so that's a lot of

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:23.279 
heroic challenges so that's a lot of
stars<00:01:21.909> it's<00:01:22.210> enough<00:01:22.509> to<00:01:22.630> upgrade<00:01:22.960> everything

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
stars it's enough to upgrade everything

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:25.230 
stars it's enough to upgrade everything
except<00:01:24.009> for<00:01:24.219> one<00:01:24.520> thing

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
except for one thing

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.899 
except for one thing
I<00:01:25.270> chose<00:01:26.109> to<00:01:26.380> not<00:01:26.590> upgrade<00:01:27.039> the<00:01:27.189> artillery<00:01:27.670> as

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
I chose to not upgrade the artillery as

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.419 
I chose to not upgrade the artillery as
you<00:01:28.179> notice<00:01:28.509> I<00:01:28.719> do<00:01:28.899> not<00:01:29.439> really<00:01:29.710> use<00:01:29.829> it<00:01:30.189> I

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
you notice I do not really use it I

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:32.639 
you notice I do not really use it I
think<00:01:31.060> I<00:01:31.149> got<00:01:31.299> used<00:01:31.509> to<00:01:31.689> not<00:01:31.810> being<00:01:32.259> able<00:01:32.469> to

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
think I got used to not being able to

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:34.410 
think I got used to not being able to
use<00:01:32.890> it<00:01:33.039> in<00:01:33.159> the<00:01:33.340> iron<00:01:33.579> challenge<00:01:34.179> which

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
use it in the iron challenge which

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.349 
use it in the iron challenge which
you're<00:01:34.630> not<00:01:34.899> able<00:01:35.289> to<00:01:35.560> and<00:01:35.979> so<00:01:36.670> I<00:01:36.700> think<00:01:36.850> that

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:37.359 
you're not able to and so I think that

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:40.590 
you're not able to and so I think that
is<00:01:37.960> why<00:01:38.499> ultimately<00:01:38.829> chose<00:01:39.399> to<00:01:39.729> not<00:01:40.210> do<00:01:40.420> it<00:01:40.509> on

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
is why ultimately chose to not do it on

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.609 
is why ultimately chose to not do it on
this<00:01:40.749> either<00:01:40.960> and<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:43.450> will<00:01:43.659> be<00:01:43.810> up<00:01:44.109> or

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
this either and I will be up or

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.069 
this either and I will be up or
releasing<00:01:45.399> the<00:01:45.639> iron<00:01:45.880> challenge<00:01:46.509> walkthrough

you see it is not the hardest of the
hard<00:02:03.609> mode<00:02:04.420> levels<00:02:05.170> but<00:02:05.469> it's<00:02:05.740> not<00:02:05.889> the

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
hard mode levels but it's not the

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.580 
hard mode levels but it's not the
easiest<00:02:06.280> either<00:02:06.689> but<00:02:07.689> I<00:02:07.719> will<00:02:08.050> just<00:02:08.259> let<00:02:08.470> it
