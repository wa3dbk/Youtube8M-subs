of v-shape it'll come more apparent as

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:38.659 
of v-shape it'll come more apparent as
we<00:06:36.509> keep<00:06:36.930> going<00:06:37.169> so<00:06:37.889> I'll<00:06:37.979> do<00:06:38.129> a<00:06:38.189> couple<00:06:38.399> more

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 
you how it looks like when you get a few

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.320 
you how it looks like when you get a few
more<00:06:43.169> rows<00:06:43.349> worked<00:06:43.680> up<00:06:46.460> so<00:06:47.460> after<00:06:47.819> five<00:06:48.029> rows

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330 
more rows worked up so after five rows

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.389 
more rows worked up so after five rows
this<00:06:48.629> is<00:06:48.809> what<00:06:48.990> it's<00:06:49.110> going<00:06:49.289> to<00:06:49.379> look<00:06:49.469> like<00:06:49.740> you

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:50.399 
this is what it's going to look like you

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:52.790 
this is what it's going to look like you
can<00:06:50.550> see<00:06:50.729> the<00:06:50.879> V's<00:06:51.289> forming<00:06:52.289> especially<00:06:52.649> if<00:06:52.740> I

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 
can see the V's forming especially if I

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.540 
can see the V's forming especially if I
spread<00:06:53.099> it<00:06:53.159> out<00:06:53.339> a<00:06:53.399> little<00:06:53.639> bit<00:06:55.219> you<00:06:56.219> can<00:06:56.339> see

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.550 
spread it out a little bit you can see

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.089 
spread it out a little bit you can see
all<00:06:56.729> those<00:06:56.879> great<00:06:57.149> v-shape<00:06:57.899> so<00:06:58.319> this<00:06:58.919> is<00:06:59.069> a

00:06:59.089 --> 00:06:59.099 
all those great v-shape so this is a

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:01.129 
all those great v-shape so this is a
really<00:06:59.460> nice<00:06:59.610> pattern<00:07:00.120> to<00:07:00.270> use<00:07:00.389> again<00:07:00.749> for

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:01.139 
really nice pattern to use again for

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:05.899 
really nice pattern to use again for
dishcloth<00:07:01.860> for<00:07:02.399> as<00:07:02.849> part<00:07:03.059> of<00:07:03.120> an<00:07:03.210> Afghan<00:07:04.909> would

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:05.909 
dishcloth for as part of an Afghan would

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:07.429 
dishcloth for as part of an Afghan would
be<00:07:06.059> a<00:07:06.089> pretty<00:07:06.419> scarf<00:07:06.749> there<00:07:07.020> are<00:07:07.110> lots<00:07:07.289> of

00:07:07.429 --> 00:07:07.439 
be a pretty scarf there are lots of

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:09.439 
be a pretty scarf there are lots of
things<00:07:07.649> you<00:07:07.740> can<00:07:07.919> do<00:07:08.009> if<00:07:08.129> this<00:07:08.279> pattern<00:07:08.520> so<00:07:09.419> I

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:09.449 
things you can do if this pattern so I
