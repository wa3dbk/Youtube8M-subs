00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.239
 I do not want to be caught by surprise a 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.890
 armed command as you see that we 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.100
 they removed the rifles and even the 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.100
 uniforms 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.600

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.850
 very super 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.110
 when they bring command to any statement 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.900
 to let us know that we were going to have 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.870
 visits plus we had picked up the room 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.030

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.760
 before embarrassing because the lord 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.530

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.010

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.150

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.150
 do if you're talking 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.250
 I think novels in the afternoon is not 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.370
 eating the brain 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:51.000

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:08.480
 Misses of generate with your blade 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.480

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.990

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.920

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.920
 happens do not interrupt if my captain 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:50.530

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.829
 that also killed soldiers and 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.349
 infuse him then I started thinking 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:01.780

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:04.060

 in the form ladybugs 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.280
 so that they are ready when he comes and that 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:12.969
