00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:36.109 
we didn't turn it on an echo is just

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:39.130 
we didn't turn it on an echo is just
there<00:02:36.380> well<00:02:36.829> the<00:02:37.130> fellas<00:02:37.640> at<00:02:37.910> xotic<00:02:38.450> pedals

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
there well the fellas at xotic pedals

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.860 
there well the fellas at xotic pedals
have<00:02:39.530> come<00:02:39.769> up<00:02:40.030> with<00:02:41.030> this<00:02:41.180> little<00:02:41.450> guy<00:02:41.600> which

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
have come up with this little guy which

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.840 
have come up with this little guy which
is<00:02:42.049> the<00:02:42.200> preamp<00:02:42.650> section<00:02:42.920> of<00:02:43.220> an<00:02:43.310> echo<00:02:43.579> place

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
is the preamp section of an echo place

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.030 
is the preamp section of an echo place
and<00:02:44.269> I<00:02:44.630> thought<00:02:44.900> since<00:02:45.350> we<00:02:45.560> are<00:02:45.620> using<00:02:45.799> the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
and I thought since we are using the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.180 
and I thought since we are using the
hundred<00:02:46.400> watt<00:02:46.549> Marshall<00:02:47.000> I'll<00:02:47.570> kick<00:02:47.810> it<00:02:47.930> in

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
hundred watt Marshall I'll kick it in

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.580 
hundred watt Marshall I'll kick it in
it's<00:02:49.190> just<00:02:49.519> the<00:02:49.670> cramp<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:50.299> it<00:02:51.019> really<00:02:51.260> makes

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
it's just the cramp and it really makes

00:02:51.590 --> 00:03:10.670 
it's just the cramp and it really makes
a<00:02:51.950> lot<00:02:52.250> of<00:02:52.459> difference<00:02:52.880> in

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.870 

so<00:03:11.680> I<00:03:11.709> just<00:03:11.920> thought<00:03:12.069> I'd<00:03:12.190> throw<00:03:12.220> that<00:03:12.459> in<00:03:12.610> for

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
so I just thought I'd throw that in for

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.850 
so I just thought I'd throw that in for
a<00:03:12.970> few<00:03:13.150> good<00:03:13.360> words<00:03:13.540> for<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.989> boys<00:03:14.200> that

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
a few good words for the boys that

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.190 
a few good words for the boys that
exotic<00:03:15.250> it's<00:03:16.349> 1971<00:03:17.349> Marshall<00:03:17.890> red
