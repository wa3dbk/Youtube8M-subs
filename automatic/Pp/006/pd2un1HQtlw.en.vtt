what<00:00:03.510> I<00:00:03.540> see<00:00:03.899> with<00:00:04.259> the<00:00:04.589> scientific<00:00:05.009> evidence

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
what I see with the scientific evidence

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.550 
what I see with the scientific evidence
that<00:00:05.580> I<00:00:05.700> have<00:00:05.970> is<00:00:06.180> Seneca<00:00:06.600> Lake<00:00:06.690> slowly

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
that I have is Seneca Lake slowly

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.799 
that I have is Seneca Lake slowly
getting<00:00:07.980> worse<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.309> worse<00:00:08.370> over<00:00:08.790> time<00:00:08.820> if<00:00:09.570> we

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
getting worse and worse over time if we

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.890 
getting worse and worse over time if we
don't<00:00:10.050> do<00:00:10.260> something<00:00:10.559> about<00:00:10.769> it<00:00:11.070> now<00:00:11.099> then<00:00:11.900> its

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
don't do something about it now then its

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.650 
don't do something about it now then its
trajectory<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:13.860> such<00:00:14.099> that<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:15.269> will<00:00:15.330> degrade

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
trajectory is such that it will degrade

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.260 
trajectory is such that it will degrade
beyond<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.379> point<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.740> return<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.310> maybe<00:00:17.460> 20<00:00:18.029> 30

beyond a point of return and maybe 20 30
years<00:00:18.539> something<00:00:18.900> along<00:00:19.020> those<00:00:19.170> lines<00:00:20.810> my

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
years something along those lines my

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.750 
years something along those lines my
primary<00:00:22.170> research<00:00:22.560> interests<00:00:23.340> are<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.609> look

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
primary research interests are to look

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.340 
primary research interests are to look
at<00:00:23.850> water<00:00:24.060> quality<00:00:24.269> issues<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.080> Finger

at water quality issues in the Finger

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.250 
at water quality issues in the Finger
Lakes<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.769> do<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.670> by<00:00:26.939> actively<00:00:27.510> sampling<00:00:28.019> the

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
Lakes I do that by actively sampling the

Lakes I do that by actively sampling the
Finger<00:00:28.529> Lakes<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:28.949> compiling<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.760> data<00:00:29.970> set

Finger Lakes and compiling a data set

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.630 
Finger Lakes and compiling a data set
that<00:00:30.480> extends<00:00:30.960> back<00:00:31.170> about<00:00:31.529> two<00:00:31.740> decades<00:00:32.130> from

that extends back about two decades from
the<00:00:32.820> lakes<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.149> see<00:00:33.329> how<00:00:33.450> they've<00:00:33.630> changed<00:00:33.660> and

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
the lakes to see how they've changed and

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.200 
the lakes to see how they've changed and
to<00:00:34.469> see<00:00:34.680> how<00:00:34.829> different<00:00:35.190> perturbations<00:00:36.000> have

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
to see how different perturbations have

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.280 
to see how different perturbations have
influenced<00:00:37.140> those<00:00:37.680> changes<00:00:38.750> then<00:00:39.750> what<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.020> try

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
influenced those changes then what I try

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.619 
influenced those changes then what I try
to<00:00:40.320> use<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.980> data<00:00:41.190> for<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.670> if<00:00:41.879> there's<00:00:42.120> trends

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
to use the data for is if there's trends

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.479 
to use the data for is if there's trends
that<00:00:42.719> are<00:00:42.870> going<00:00:43.170> in<00:00:43.410> an<00:00:43.530> alarming<00:00:44.010> direction

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
that are going in an alarming direction

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.220 
that are going in an alarming direction
over<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.969> water<00:00:45.149> quality's<00:00:45.629> degrading

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
over to the water quality's degrading

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.139 
over to the water quality's degrading
then<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:46.980> try<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.370> present<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
then I try to present it to the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.610 
then I try to present it to the
appropriate<00:00:48.690> people<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.170> they<00:00:49.289> might<00:00:49.440> be<00:00:49.469> able

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
appropriate people so they might be able

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.160 
appropriate people so they might be able
to<00:00:49.770> take<00:00:49.920> action<00:00:50.309> on<00:00:50.399> it

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.600 

specifically<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.230> spend<00:00:55.680> most<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.220> my<00:00:56.280> time<00:00:56.370> on

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
specifically I spend most of my time on

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.490 
specifically I spend most of my time on
Seneca<00:00:57.239> Lake<00:00:57.329> I've<00:00:57.570> been<00:00:57.810> monitoring<00:00:58.320> that

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
Seneca Lake I've been monitoring that

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.610 
Seneca Lake I've been monitoring that
since<00:00:58.950> the<00:00:59.160> early<00:00:59.430> 1990s<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.420> I've<00:01:01.230> found

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
since the early 1990s and I've found

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.950 
since the early 1990s and I've found
very<00:01:02.130> simple<00:01:02.550> parameters<00:01:02.850> have<00:01:03.270> have<00:01:03.540> changed

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
very simple parameters have have changed

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.810 
very simple parameters have have changed
to<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.199> point<00:01:04.440> where<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:05.129> water<00:01:05.339> quality's

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
to the point where the water quality's

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.820 
to the point where the water quality's
degrading<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.600> other<00:01:06.870> words<00:01:07.050> the<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.500> lake<00:01:07.650> is

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
degrading in other words the the lake is

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.860 
degrading in other words the the lake is
getting<00:01:08.130> more<00:01:08.280> turbid<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.880> if<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.420> continues

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:09.870 
getting more turbid and if it continues

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.140 
getting more turbid and if it continues
on<00:01:10.050> its<00:01:10.200> present<00:01:10.410> track<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.190> fear<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.790> it's

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
on its present track I fear that it's

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.090 
on its present track I fear that it's
gonna<00:01:12.300> get<00:01:12.990> turbid<00:01:13.440> enough<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.920> turn

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
gonna get turbid enough to turn

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.690 
gonna get turbid enough to turn
eutrophic<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.090> get<00:01:15.479> ugly<00:01:16.490> eutrophic<00:01:17.490> means

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
eutrophic and get ugly eutrophic means

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.180 
eutrophic and get ugly eutrophic means
very<00:01:18.000> productive<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.660> what<00:01:19.290> very<00:01:19.650> productive

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
very productive and what very productive

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.800 
very productive and what very productive
means<00:01:20.430> instead<00:01:20.940> of<00:01:21.090> seeing<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.660> nice

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
means instead of seeing a nice

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.680 
means instead of seeing a nice
crystal-clear<00:01:22.650> blue<00:01:22.860> lake<00:01:23.400> like<00:01:23.670> we<00:01:23.880> enjoy

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
crystal-clear blue lake like we enjoy

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.980 
crystal-clear blue lake like we enjoy
now<00:01:25.020> it's<00:01:25.680> going<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.950> be<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> green<00:01:26.640> slimy<00:01:27.360> lake

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
now it's going to be a green slimy lake

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.400 
now it's going to be a green slimy lake
with<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> algal<00:01:29.160> scum<00:01:29.430> on<00:01:29.580> the<00:01:29.700> surface<00:01:30.410> the

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
with a algal scum on the surface the

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.350 
with a algal scum on the surface the
bottom<00:01:31.740> waters<00:01:32.039> will<00:01:32.220> turn<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.580> oxic<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.210> when

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
bottom waters will turn on oxic and when

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.359 
bottom waters will turn on oxic and when
that<00:01:33.479> happens<00:01:33.930> they<00:01:34.170> stink<00:01:34.590> they<00:01:34.860> stink<00:01:35.190> like

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
that happens they stink they stink like

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.880 
that happens they stink they stink like
rotten<00:01:35.520> eggs<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.240> both<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.410> those<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.770> don't

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
rotten eggs and both of those you don't

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.230 
rotten eggs and both of those you don't
want<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.190> happen<00:01:38.520> because<00:01:38.640> it's<00:01:38.910> going<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.119> be

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
want to happen because it's going to be

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.150 
want to happen because it's going to be
very<00:01:39.390> detrimental<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.710> winery

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
very detrimental to the a winery

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.370 
very detrimental to the a winery
industry<00:01:41.729> into<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.060> tourist<00:01:42.509> trade<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.200> more

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
industry into the tourist trade and more

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.320 
industry into the tourist trade and more
importantly<00:01:43.890> we<00:01:44.280> draw<00:01:44.520> water<00:01:44.759> out<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.119> the

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
importantly we draw water out of the

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.660 
importantly we draw water out of the
lake<00:01:45.360> for<00:01:45.690> drinking<00:01:46.050> water<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.470> we<00:01:47.399> probably

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
lake for drinking water and we probably

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.160 
lake for drinking water and we probably
won't<00:01:47.940> be<00:01:48.060> able<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.300> do<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.600> anymore<00:01:48.899> either

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
won't be able to do that anymore either

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.889 
won't be able to do that anymore either
so<00:01:49.680> we<00:01:50.070> don't<00:01:50.280> want<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.700> ruin<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.420> vital

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
so we don't want to ruin that vital

problem<00:03:47.940> that<00:03:48.060> I<00:03:48.120> face<00:03:48.450> is<00:03:48.720> that<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:49.109> lot<00:03:49.620> of

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
problem that I face is that a lot of

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.470 
problem that I face is that a lot of
