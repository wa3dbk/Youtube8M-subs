pull<00:01:05.239> in<00:01:05.449> the<00:01:05.540> wild<00:01:05.870> so<00:01:06.320> that's<00:01:06.500> why<00:01:06.710> we<00:01:06.920> chose

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
pull in the wild so that's why we chose

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.130 
pull in the wild so that's why we chose
them<00:01:07.549> so<00:01:07.700> we<00:01:07.790> haven't<00:01:08.060> gonna<00:01:08.210> take<00:01:08.420> any<00:01:08.690> birds

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
them so we haven't gonna take any birds

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.420 
them so we haven't gonna take any birds
and<00:01:09.409> just<00:01:09.530> release<00:01:09.830> them<00:01:10.010> out<00:01:10.130> through<00:01:10.310> the

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
to work together with a land development

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.470 
to work together with a land development
and<00:01:45.470> all<00:01:45.590> that<00:01:45.850> because<00:01:46.850> if<00:01:47.150> you<00:01:47.240> do<00:01:47.360> it

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
and all that because if you do it

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.570 
and all that because if you do it
smartly<00:01:47.930> it<00:01:48.230> doesn't<00:01:48.530> have<00:01:48.650> to<00:01:48.800> be<00:01:48.920> such<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:49.310> big

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
smartly it doesn't have to be such a big

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.300 
smartly it doesn't have to be such a big
problem<00:01:49.820> as<00:01:50.120> it<00:01:50.330> is<00:01:50.420> now<00:01:50.690> so<00:01:51.140> this<00:01:51.890> is<00:01:51.950> also<00:01:52.130> a

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
problem as it is now so this is also a

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.820 
problem as it is now so this is also a
way<00:01:52.580> to<00:01:52.640> get<00:01:52.970> this<00:01:53.780> is<00:01:53.930> like<00:01:54.020> an<00:01:54.140> educational

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
way to get this is like an educational

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.190 
way to get this is like an educational
tool<00:01:55.040> to<00:01:55.310> make<00:01:55.700> people<00:01:56.120> aware<00:01:56.210> we<00:01:56.870> check<00:01:57.080> the

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
tool to make people aware we check the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.080 
tool to make people aware we check the
literature<00:01:57.590> we<00:01:57.950> consulted<00:01:58.490> we<00:01:58.670> check<00:01:58.910> out<00:01:59.030> our

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
literature we consulted we check out our

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.180 
literature we consulted we check out our
consultants<00:01:59.660> and<00:01:59.840> nobody<00:02:00.470> else<00:02:00.650> anywhere<00:02:01.010> has

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
consultants and nobody else anywhere has

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.710 
consultants and nobody else anywhere has
ever<00:02:01.310> done<00:02:01.520> it<00:02:01.580> with<00:02:01.850> this<00:02:01.940> particular<00:02:02.240> pigeon

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
ever done it with this particular pigeon

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.780 
ever done it with this particular pigeon
and<00:02:02.870> you<00:02:03.710> might<00:02:03.890> think<00:02:03.920> breeding<00:02:04.400> pigeons<00:02:04.550> is

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
and you might think breeding pigeons is

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.460 
and you might think breeding pigeons is
easy<00:02:05.030> but<00:02:05.270> this<00:02:05.390> is<00:02:05.540> not<00:02:05.690> a<00:02:05.720> domestic<00:02:06.020> pigeon

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
easy but this is not a domestic pigeon

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.320 
easy but this is not a domestic pigeon
this<00:02:06.590> is<00:02:06.680> a<00:02:06.740> wild<00:02:07.070> bird<00:02:07.190> they're<00:02:07.820> very<00:02:08.119> high

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
this is a wild bird they're very high

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.699 
this is a wild bird they're very high
strung<00:02:08.659> their<00:02:08.810> prey<00:02:09.050> species<00:02:09.289> so<00:02:09.590> they're

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
strung their prey species so they're

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.520 
strung their prey species so they're
very<00:02:09.739> agitated<00:02:10.599> they're<00:02:11.599> really<00:02:11.959> hard<00:02:12.200> to

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
very agitated they're really hard to

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.690 
very agitated they're really hard to
maintain<00:02:12.680> in<00:02:13.010> it

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
maintain in it

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.070 
maintain in it
in<00:02:13.790> a<00:02:13.849> captive<00:02:14.209> environment<00:02:14.300> because<00:02:14.930> they're

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
in a captive environment because they're

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.449 
in a captive environment because they're
so<00:02:15.230> shy<00:02:15.440> they<00:02:15.860> can<00:02:16.010> actually<00:02:16.250> enjoy

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
so shy they can actually enjoy

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.280 
so shy they can actually enjoy
themselves<00:02:16.790> trying<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.090> escape<00:02:17.209> from<00:02:17.450> you<00:02:17.599> so

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
themselves trying to escape from you so

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.900 
themselves trying to escape from you so
we<00:02:18.530> had<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.739> figure<00:02:18.890> out<00:02:19.160> a<00:02:19.190> bit<00:02:19.489> how<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.700> get

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
we had to figure out a bit how to get

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.400 
we had to figure out a bit how to get
them<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.060> breed<00:02:20.360> these<00:02:21.050> some<00:02:21.200> of<00:02:21.260> these

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
them to breed these some of these

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.229 
them to breed these some of these
turbines<00:02:21.739> how<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:22.340> put<00:02:22.670> them<00:02:22.760> together<00:02:22.880> and

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
turbines how to put them together and

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.330 
turbines how to put them together and
get<00:02:23.569> them<00:02:23.630> to<00:02:23.810> change<00:02:24.080> from<00:02:24.349> a<00:02:24.530> from<00:02:25.069> a

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
get them to change from a from a

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.339 
get them to change from a from a
commercial<00:02:25.849> diet<00:02:26.239> basically<00:02:26.660> eating<00:02:26.959> pellets

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
commercial diet basically eating pellets

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.860 
commercial diet basically eating pellets
to<00:02:28.010> their<00:02:28.430> wild<00:02:28.760> diet<00:02:28.880> which<00:02:29.090> is<00:02:29.209> small<00:02:29.540> fruits

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
to their wild diet which is small fruits

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.449 
to their wild diet which is small fruits
and<00:02:30.020> berries<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.530> recognize<00:02:30.950> these<00:02:31.100> single

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
and berries to recognize these single

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:32.590 
and berries to recognize these single
they've<00:02:31.550> never<00:02:31.700> seen<00:02:31.940> these<00:02:32.120> things<00:02:32.300> inside

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
they've never seen these things inside

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.350 
they've never seen these things inside
aviary<00:02:33.020> so<00:02:33.739> these<00:02:33.860> are<00:02:34.040> and<00:02:34.220> plus<00:02:34.940> we<00:02:35.150> do<00:02:35.270> the

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
aviary so these are and plus we do the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.430 
aviary so these are and plus we do the
health<00:02:35.540> checks<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:35.959> everything<00:02:35.989> to<00:02:36.319> make

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
health checks and everything to make

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.830 
health checks and everything to make
sure<00:02:36.560> we're<00:02:36.709> releasing<00:02:37.360> healthy<00:02:38.360> birds<00:02:38.600> into

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
sure we're releasing healthy birds into

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.449 
sure we're releasing healthy birds into
the<00:02:38.900> environment<00:02:39.140> these<00:02:39.890> birds<00:02:40.250> for<00:02:40.340> example

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
the environment these birds for example

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.070 
the environment these birds for example
we<00:02:41.209> actually<00:02:41.330> take<00:02:41.630> them<00:02:41.780> out<00:02:41.900> in<00:02:42.019> the

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
we actually take them out in the

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.080 
we actually take them out in the
beginning<00:02:42.200> of<00:02:42.560> April<00:02:42.760> so<00:02:43.760> they've<00:02:43.910> been<00:02:44.030> here

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
beginning of April so they've been here

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.479 
beginning of April so they've been here
for<00:02:44.420> a<00:02:44.450> long<00:02:44.630> time<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:45.170> now<00:02:45.860> we're<00:02:46.310> waiting

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
for a long time and now we're waiting

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.580 
for a long time and now we're waiting
for<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.239> food<00:02:47.569> in<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.140> wild

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
for the food in the wild

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.470 
for the food in the wild
technically<00:02:48.890> ripen<00:02:49.489> they're<00:02:49.970> like<00:02:50.120> fetch

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
technically ripen they're like fetch

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.930 
technically ripen they're like fetch
berries<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.530> red<00:02:51.739> birch<00:02:51.980> berries<00:02:52.519> wild

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
berries the red birch berries wild

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.630 
berries the red birch berries wild
strawberries<00:02:53.780> then<00:02:54.290> also<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.160> sea<00:02:55.370> grapes

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
strawberries then also the sea grapes

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.070 
strawberries then also the sea grapes
that<00:02:55.790> will<00:02:55.880> compete<00:02:56.180> with<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.450> humans<00:02:56.840> and

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
that will compete with the humans and

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.900 
that will compete with the humans and
it's<00:02:57.200> also<00:02:57.350> important<00:02:57.769> when<00:02:57.799> we<00:02:57.950> do<00:02:58.069> this<00:02:58.280> food

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
it's also important when we do this food

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.390 
it's also important when we do this food
transition<00:02:59.540> that<00:03:00.110> we<00:03:00.290> don't<00:03:00.500> only<00:03:00.799> give<00:03:01.250> the

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
transition that we don't only give the

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.100 
transition that we don't only give the
berries<00:03:01.730> we<00:03:02.150> have<00:03:02.330> to<00:03:02.450> give<00:03:02.600> like<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.930> whole

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
berries we have to give like the whole

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.920 
berries we have to give like the whole
bronze<00:03:03.500> and<00:03:03.880> with<00:03:04.880> the<00:03:05.000> leaves<00:03:05.239> so<00:03:05.660> they<00:03:05.750> can

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
bronze and with the leaves so they can

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.680 
bronze and with the leaves so they can
do<00:03:06.019> the<00:03:06.140> food<00:03:06.350> recognition<00:03:07.040> so<00:03:07.269> not<00:03:08.269> only<00:03:08.480> they

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
do the food recognition so not only they

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.920 
do the food recognition so not only they
see<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.049> birds<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.380> granita<00:03:09.590> have<00:03:10.190> to<00:03:10.930> know

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
see the birds the granita have to know

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.570 
see the birds the granita have to know
the<00:03:12.140> plant<00:03:12.440> were<00:03:12.739> to<00:03:12.950> land<00:03:13.130> and<00:03:13.370> everything

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
the plant were to land and everything

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.250 
the plant were to land and everything
just<00:03:13.910> give<00:03:14.090> them<00:03:14.209> a<00:03:14.299> little<00:03:14.600> bit<00:03:14.690> extra<00:03:15.019> heads

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
just give them a little bit extra heads

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.240 
just give them a little bit extra heads
to<00:03:15.530> they<00:03:15.620> can<00:03:15.769> survive

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
to they can survive

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.220 
to they can survive
normally<00:03:16.730> this<00:03:17.000> is<00:03:17.120> a<00:03:17.150> feeding<00:03:17.510> ground<00:03:17.660> around

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
normally this is a feeding ground around

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.930 
normally this is a feeding ground around
here<00:03:18.440> there's<00:03:18.620> a<00:03:18.650> lot<00:03:18.799> of<00:03:18.980> food<00:03:19.160> around<00:03:19.459> but

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
here there's a lot of food around but

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.430 
here there's a lot of food around but
then<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.180> nesting<00:03:20.660> ground<00:03:20.870> is<00:03:21.019> actually<00:03:21.380> in

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
then the nesting ground is actually in

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.259 
then the nesting ground is actually in
the<00:03:21.530> mangroves<00:03:22.040> and<00:03:22.519> normally<00:03:22.970> they<00:03:23.090> fly

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
the mangroves and normally they fly

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.449 
the mangroves and normally they fly
there<00:03:23.450> but<00:03:23.600> it<00:03:23.780> it's<00:03:24.170> good<00:03:24.709> for<00:03:24.980> release<00:03:25.250> that

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
there but it it's good for release that

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.310 
there but it it's good for release that
they<00:03:25.579> can<00:03:25.730> find<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.060> food<00:03:26.329> and<00:03:26.600> then<00:03:27.170> when

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
they can find the food and then when

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.750 
they can find the food and then when
they<00:03:27.410> meet<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.709> wild<00:03:27.980> birds<00:03:28.160> they<00:03:28.340> can<00:03:28.489> go<00:03:28.609> and

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
they meet the wild birds they can go and

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.520 
they meet the wild birds they can go and
find<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.299> nesting<00:03:29.660> ground<00:03:29.900> so<00:03:30.140> it's<00:03:30.380> actually

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
find the nesting ground so it's actually

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.560 
find the nesting ground so it's actually
an<00:03:30.739> excellent<00:03:30.980> location<00:03:31.400> for<00:03:31.609> it<00:03:31.880> this<00:03:32.359> is<00:03:32.420> a

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
an excellent location for it this is a

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.479 
an excellent location for it this is a
soft<00:03:32.930> release<00:03:33.170> so<00:03:33.709> basically<00:03:34.190> what<00:03:34.370> we're

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
soft release so basically what we're

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:35.860 
soft release so basically what we're
going<00:03:34.609> to<00:03:34.640> do<00:03:34.730> we<00:03:34.850> are<00:03:34.880> going<00:03:34.970> to<00:03:35.150> open<00:03:35.480> a<00:03:35.570> doors

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
going to do we are going to open a doors

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.420 
going to do we are going to open a doors
today<00:03:36.260> they<00:03:36.709> don't<00:03:36.829> want<00:03:37.040> to<00:03:37.160> leave<00:03:37.280> they

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
today they don't want to leave they

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.130 
today they don't want to leave they
don't<00:03:37.609> have<00:03:37.790> to<00:03:38.000> and<00:03:38.180> then<00:03:38.540> they<00:03:38.660> ask<00:03:38.810> go<00:03:39.079> to

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
don't have to and then they ask go to

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.090 
don't have to and then they ask go to
separate<00:03:39.620> ways

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
separate ways

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.620 
separate ways
last<00:03:40.489> time<00:03:40.670> we<00:03:40.790> released<00:03:41.090> them<00:03:41.180> we<00:03:41.390> color

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
last time we released them we color

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.569 
last time we released them we color
Bandar<00:03:41.989> the<00:03:42.079> birds<00:03:42.290> and<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.130> reason<00:03:43.340> we<00:03:43.430> call

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
Bandar the birds and the reason we call

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.220 
Bandar the birds and the reason we call
about<00:03:43.790> it<00:03:43.850> them<00:03:44.030> is<00:03:44.180> because<00:03:44.299> they're<00:03:45.049> usually

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
about it them is because they're usually

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.590 
about it them is because they're usually
far<00:03:45.709> away<00:03:45.920> and<00:03:46.160> you<00:03:46.970> have<00:03:47.000> to<00:03:47.209> look<00:03:47.420> at<00:03:47.510> them

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
far away and you have to look at them

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.120 
far away and you have to look at them
from<00:03:47.690> binoculars<00:03:48.230> and<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.590> only<00:03:48.709> way<00:03:48.859> to<00:03:48.890> do

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
from binoculars and the only way to do

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.979 
from binoculars and the only way to do
to<00:03:49.430> recognize<00:03:49.609> them<00:03:50.000> is<00:03:50.120> to<00:03:50.209> put<00:03:50.239> color<00:03:50.720> codes

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
to recognize them is to put color codes

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.259 
to recognize them is to put color codes
so<00:03:51.200> you<00:03:51.230> have<00:03:51.440> like<00:03:51.799> red<00:03:52.310> on<00:03:52.459> one<00:03:52.640> leg<00:03:52.850> blue<00:03:53.150> on

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
so you have like red on one leg blue on

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.180 
so you have like red on one leg blue on
the<00:03:53.329> other<00:03:53.390> leg<00:03:53.660> or<00:03:53.870> red<00:03:54.380> and<00:03:54.410> white<00:03:54.709> and<00:03:54.950> so<00:03:55.070> on

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
the other leg or red and white and so on

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.410 
the other leg or red and white and so on
and<00:03:55.430> you<00:03:55.459> look<00:03:55.609> at<00:03:55.730> the<00:03:55.790> color<00:03:55.970> bands<00:03:56.180> and<00:03:56.359> you

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
and you look at the color bands and you

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.000 
and you look at the color bands and you
can<00:03:56.510> tell<00:03:56.630> which<00:03:56.810> bridges<00:03:57.049> how<00:03:57.380> old<00:03:57.650> it<00:03:57.769> is<00:03:57.829> and

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
can tell which bridges how old it is and

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.699 
can tell which bridges how old it is and
so<00:03:58.160> on<00:03:58.280> and<00:03:58.750> when<00:03:59.750> we<00:03:59.780> release<00:04:00.140> them<00:04:00.290> last<00:04:00.560> year

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
so on and when we release them last year

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.210 
so on and when we release them last year
September<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:02.510> birds<00:04:02.750> came<00:04:02.959> back<00:04:03.140> I<00:04:03.380> could

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
September the birds came back I could

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.920 
September the birds came back I could
release<00:04:04.430> if<00:04:04.670> you<00:04:04.819> walk<00:04:04.940> into<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:05.269> wild<00:04:05.630> we

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
release if you walk into the wild we

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.270 
release if you walk into the wild we
couldn't<00:04:06.200> find<00:04:06.350> them<00:04:06.440> anywhere<00:04:06.530> you<00:04:06.950> had<00:04:07.130> no

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
couldn't find them anywhere you had no

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.490 
couldn't find them anywhere you had no
idea<00:04:07.310> if<00:04:07.579> they<00:04:07.670> survived<00:04:08.030> or<00:04:08.150> not<00:04:08.269> but<00:04:08.959> earlier

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
idea if they survived or not but earlier

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.620 
idea if they survived or not but earlier
this<00:04:09.620> year<00:04:09.680> in<00:04:10.040> January<00:04:10.299> some<00:04:11.299> of<00:04:11.389> the<00:04:11.450> birds

came back they came back around the

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.979 
came back they came back around the
aviary<00:04:14.000> because<00:04:14.239> it<00:04:14.359> familiar<00:04:14.540> with<00:04:14.780> the<00:04:14.840> area

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
aviary because it familiar with the area

knew
we<00:04:24.030> knew<00:04:24.270> that<00:04:24.390> the<00:04:24.480> program<00:04:24.810> was<00:04:24.900> working

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
we knew that the program was working

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.530 
we knew that the program was working
food<00:04:25.830> supplies<00:04:26.070> will<00:04:26.550> be<00:04:26.700> left<00:04:26.880> on<00:04:27.060> top<00:04:27.330> of<00:04:27.480> the

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
food supplies will be left on top of the

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.660 
food supplies will be left on top of the
cage<00:04:27.750> for<00:04:28.080> about<00:04:28.290> a<00:04:28.320> week<00:04:28.590> then<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.430> birds

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
cage for about a week then the birds

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.030 
cage for about a week then the birds
must<00:04:30.000> fend<00:04:30.300> for<00:04:30.420> themselves<00:04:31.020> in<00:04:31.380> the<00:04:31.500> wild

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
must fend for themselves in the wild

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.760 
must fend for themselves in the wild
each<00:04:32.460> is<00:04:32.820> tagged<00:04:33.180> with<00:04:33.510> two<00:04:33.810> bands<00:04:34.140> like<00:04:34.470> these

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
each is tagged with two bands like these

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.550 
each is tagged with two bands like these
so<00:04:35.400> if<00:04:35.490> you<00:04:35.640> spot<00:04:35.970> any<00:04:36.270> make<00:04:36.810> sure<00:04:36.990> you<00:04:37.140> report
