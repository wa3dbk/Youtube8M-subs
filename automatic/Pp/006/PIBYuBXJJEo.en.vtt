effective<00:00:58.320> Mills<00:00:58.579> this<00:00:59.579> knowledge<00:00:59.820> would<00:01:00.090> be

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
effective Mills this knowledge would be

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.910 
effective Mills this knowledge would be
allowed<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.719> grow<00:01:00.899> with<00:01:01.050> property<00:01:01.530> values

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
elderly folks on fixed incomes next we

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.740 
elderly folks on fixed incomes next we
want<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.860> shift<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.280> burden<00:01:08.430> from<00:01:09.299> property

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750

want to shift the burden from property
taxes<00:01:10.260> over<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.799> sales<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.250> income<00:01:11.400> taxes<00:01:12.060> so

taxes over to sales and income taxes so

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.240 
taxes over to sales and income taxes so
that<00:01:12.600> non<00:01:13.049> homeowners<00:01:13.770> actually<00:01:14.159> are

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
that non homeowners actually are

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.969 
that non homeowners actually are
starting<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.580> pay<00:01:14.790> more<00:01:15.030> for<00:01:15.210> their<00:01:15.330> schools

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
starting to pay more for their schools

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.740 
starting to pay more for their schools
this<00:01:16.979> creates<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.460> much<00:01:17.640> larger<00:01:18.150> state<00:01:18.450> pool

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
this creates a much larger state pool

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.929 
this creates a much larger state pool
that<00:01:18.990> can<00:01:19.140> be<00:01:19.259> used<00:01:19.470> equalized<00:01:20.009> funding<00:01:20.460> so

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
that can be used equalized funding so

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.490 
that can be used equalized funding so
initially<00:01:21.210> everybody<00:01:21.990> gets<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.290> same<00:01:22.320> amount
