sliding<00:02:15.040> lid<00:02:15.490> and<00:02:16.090> I<00:02:16.569> got<00:02:16.720> to<00:02:16.840> looking<00:02:17.110> at<00:02:17.200> this

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
sliding lid and I got to looking at this

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.320 
sliding lid and I got to looking at this
I<00:02:17.560> thought<00:02:17.860> wow<00:02:18.310> that's<00:02:18.700> kind<00:02:18.880> of<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:19.000> neat<00:02:19.180> way

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
I thought wow that's kind of a neat way

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.540 
I thought wow that's kind of a neat way
to<00:02:19.360> make<00:02:19.600> a<00:02:19.630> box<00:02:19.959> and<00:02:20.290> I<00:02:20.530> think<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:20.890> can<00:02:21.069> kind<00:02:21.490> of

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
to make a box and I think I can kind of

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.420 
to make a box and I think I can kind of
modify<00:02:22.090> that<00:02:22.300> make<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.690> smaller<00:02:23.319> and<00:02:23.590> come<00:02:24.310> up

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
modify that make it smaller and come up

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.240 
modify that make it smaller and come up
with<00:02:24.520> a<00:02:24.580> design<00:02:24.730> for<00:02:25.209> little<00:02:25.569> bitty<00:02:26.110> boxes<00:02:27.010> I

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
with a design for little bitty boxes I

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.100 
with a design for little bitty boxes I
think<00:02:27.910> I<00:02:27.940> can<00:02:28.090> use<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.330> router<00:02:28.510> for<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:28.990> whole

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
think I can use the router for the whole

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.780 
think I can use the router for the whole
thing<00:02:29.319> so<00:02:29.530> that's<00:02:29.890> going<00:02:30.069> to<00:02:30.130> be<00:02:30.190> my<00:02:30.280> project

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
thing so that's going to be my project

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.910
