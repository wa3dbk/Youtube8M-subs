00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
full capabilities the m39 would be

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.789 
full capabilities the m39 would be
really<00:01:48.450> good<00:01:48.720> with<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.869> flash<00:01:49.140> presser<00:01:49.560> just

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
really good with the flash presser just

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.249 
really good with the flash presser just
because<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.220> has<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.729> seems<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.450> has<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> tiny
