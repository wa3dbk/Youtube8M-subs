00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.150

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.039
 call milky way let's go your guitars 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.400
 fasten your belts and let's 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.400
 take off 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.210
 ok standard tunings and girls and how 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.210
 we start 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.710
 we are sorry 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.000
 but only 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.320
 they hit me on my lower lip 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.260
 ok friends for the beginning part 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:02.320
 we are going to occupy what is an agreement of my 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:06.030
 minor one C major and one minor 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.030
 the whole mind rhythm is down 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.790
 killing the sound with the pair with the hand 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.650
 left we will kill at the time of 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.390
 play the rhythm down Tequense like 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.180
 we do it so that they can do it 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.690
 at home it's not going to be fast and then what 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.690
 it's going to be slow 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:47.780
 and now it's going slow and in this part we do 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.140
 a recurre mate to move to the part of 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.140
 the letter 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.090
 then to be very slow so that only 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.090
 can do at home 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.950
 we would be this way the part of the 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.950
 principle 23 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.340
 ah 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.580
 ah 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.000
 ok friend already to join the first stanza 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.240
 the pre chorus and the choir the only thing 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.840
 we will occupy extra chords is a do 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:31.950
 greater a greater re 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.950
 if less one minus seven and one greater sun 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:49.430
 the rhythm is basically always the same 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:53.800
 then we would be in this way kiss 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.800
 ghost stuck in my lower lip 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:08.530
 of your eyes on my astronaut helmet and 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.730
 the shy aurora 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.730
 from your cell phone 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.870
 and we enter the choir and every night 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.489
 will be 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.489
 to be there 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:38.160
 every night under violence 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.160
 I conjure your immortal name 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.640
 ok goodbye practically the song is 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.739
 play the same with the chords the same 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.900
 rhythm only for a I take an inter 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:02.220
 little nuanced with two chords that is a 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.180
 greater but without the little finger 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.800
 we're just going to remove the little finger 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:10.710
 and we would stay like this 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.720
 and then we make a greater sun 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.170
 and the interim with the nuance we would have left 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.170
 this form 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.340
 i 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.220
 i 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.280
 i 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:31.120
 ah 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.770
 and practically that would be like the inter 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.930
 of the song because there is to come back 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.810
 again repeat the chorus and 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.350
 we would end only with a rhythm in 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:47.170
 C major and in G major to finish 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:50.970
 that stays this way and all the 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.970
 stop nights 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.219
 for the road 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:07.490
 every night under violence 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.490
 I conjure your immortal name 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.980
 ok practically for the end part 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:27.200
 all we do is give rhythm and 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.730
 to finish with a punch and it will be 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.900
 this way the rhythm only goes to 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.410
 be very slow so they can only do 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.410
 at home 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.470
 now I'm going to do it at fast speed 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.110
 and I'm going to finish the song for you 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.790
 they can check it and they can touch it where 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.240
 want them to go then it would be 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.240
 this form 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.040

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:29.000
