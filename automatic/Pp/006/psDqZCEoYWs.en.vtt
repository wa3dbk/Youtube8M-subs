00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
just thought about the struggle of

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.160 
just thought about the struggle of
hip-hop<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.060> skating<00:01:30.420> as<00:01:30.540> one<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.869> same

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
hip-hop and skating as one in the same

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.670 
hip-hop and skating as one in the same
you<00:01:31.710> know<00:01:31.829> mr.<00:01:32.790> youth<00:01:33.119> its<00:01:33.960> expression<00:01:34.409> is

self-expression it's something that came

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.109 
self-expression it's something that came
from<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.140> street<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.520> just<00:01:38.939> thought

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
from the street and so I just thought

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.819 
from the street and so I just thought
about<00:01:39.380> like<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.860> know<00:01:40.979> what<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.340> hadn't<00:01:41.729> heard

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
about like you know what I hadn't heard

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.899 
about like you know what I hadn't heard
and<00:01:43.829> never<00:01:44.280> really<00:01:44.549> her

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
and never really her

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.450 
and never really her
like<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.649> hard<00:01:47.090> joint<00:01:48.229> that<00:01:49.229> sort<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:49.920> mesh

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
like a hard joint that sort of like mesh

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.069 
like a hard joint that sort of like mesh
the<00:01:50.670> emotion<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.210> what<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.450> feels<00:01:51.659> like<00:01:51.780> when

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
the emotion of what it feels like when

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.980 
the emotion of what it feels like when
you<00:01:52.200> just<00:01:52.409> got<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:53.210> when<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.299> got<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.479> peel<00:01:54.780> out

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
you just got it when you got a peel out

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.590 
you just got it when you got a peel out
because<00:01:55.950> you're<00:01:56.130> being<00:01:56.310> chased<00:01:56.520> what<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.450> got

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
because you're being chased what you got

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.730
