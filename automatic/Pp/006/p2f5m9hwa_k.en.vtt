Hello all Blog del Runner followers.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.750
My name is Teodoro VÃ¡zquez.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.350
Today I want to show you how to make a very interesting alkaline drink,

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:18.010
that may be the perfect and natural substitute for soft- drinks and sodas on the market.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.370
This is how to prepare it:

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.800
Well, let's start making the alkaline drink.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:36.000
For this drink we need two lemons, which we are going to cut and squeeze.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.960
Well, once the lemons are squeezed,

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.060
the next step is to pour the juice

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:39.200
into one liter of water that we have already put into the jug.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:56.420
And the last step: we take a coffee teaspoon of Bicarbonate of Soda,

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:04.210
an amount more or less like this, filling the spoon well, and we pour into the jar.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.500
Now Bicarbonate is reacting with lemon juice.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.720
Some foam appears on top.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.590
And we leave to stand for a while.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.300
Well, as you have seen it is very easy to make.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:47.800
It is a very refreshing drink, plus it helps you keep an alkaline pH in your body,

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.580
which is very interesting for all runners or athletes.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.160
Before ending I just want to tell you that

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.940
any comments or questions you have

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.260

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.460
