00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:28.649 
show you you've got the number one at

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.790 
show you you've got the number one at
the<00:00:28.739> very<00:00:28.770> top<00:00:29.189> which<00:00:29.460> indicates<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.619> the<00:00:31.619> day

the morning from day 1 to day 5 at the

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.020 
the morning from day 1 to day 5 at the
top<00:00:45.150> this<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.540> program<00:00:46.140> 1<00:00:46.430> every<00:00:47.430> day<00:00:47.580> so<00:00:47.640> we'll

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
top this is program 1 every day so we'll

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.970 
top this is program 1 every day so we'll
just<00:00:48.180> click<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.840> comes<00:00:49.290> on<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.560> 630

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
just click on it and it comes on the 630

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.030 
just click on it and it comes on the 630
I<00:00:50.340> could<00:00:51.000> change<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.360> with<00:00:51.450> the<00:00:51.540> arrows<00:00:52.040> as

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
I could change it with the arrows as

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.180 
I could change it with the arrows as
such<00:00:53.840> if<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:54.930> go<00:00:55.079> through<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.470> program<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:55.980> it

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
such if we go through the program so it

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.430 
such if we go through the program so it
comes<00:00:56.370> on<00:00:56.550> at<00:00:56.730> 6:30<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.450> the<00:00:57.510> morning<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.989> it

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
comes on at 6:30 in the morning and it

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.319 
comes on at 6:30 in the morning and it
has<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.010> your<00:00:59.610> boss<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.880> temperature<00:01:00.210> to

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
has to and your boss the temperature to

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.819 
has to and your boss the temperature to
be<00:01:00.450> 19<00:01:00.780> degrees<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.470> just<00:01:01.650> an<00:01:01.739> example

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
be 19 degrees this is just an example

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.429 
be 19 degrees this is just an example
then<00:01:02.700> the<00:01:02.820> second<00:01:03.180> program<00:01:03.510> from<00:01:03.840> day<00:01:04.110> 1<00:01:04.290> to

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
then the second program from day 1 to

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.840 
then the second program from day 1 to
day<00:01:04.470> 5

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
day 5

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.399 
day 5
switches<00:01:06.479> off<00:01:06.600> at<00:01:06.780> 8<00:01:06.930> o'clock<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.350> morning

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
switches off at 8 o'clock in the morning

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.320 
switches off at 8 o'clock in the morning
you<00:01:08.009> could<00:01:08.159> change<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.940> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
you could change that and the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.330 
you could change that and the
temperature<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.990> 5<00:01:10.440> so<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.830> means<00:01:11.159> it's

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
temperature is 5 so that means it's

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.430 
temperature is 5 so that means it's
gonna<00:01:11.460> switch<00:01:11.790> off<00:01:12.000> from<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.930> 19<00:01:13.290> degrees

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
gonna switch off from the 19 degrees

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.520 
gonna switch off from the 19 degrees
which<00:01:13.830> are<00:01:13.979> set<00:01:14.159> previously<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:16.200> second

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
which are set previously the second

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.620 
which are set previously the second
program<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:17.070> going<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.850> end<00:01:18.030> with<00:01:18.150> 5<00:01:18.360> degrees

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
program is going to end with 5 degrees

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.600 
program is going to end with 5 degrees
and<00:01:18.870> then<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:18.990> third<00:01:19.350> program<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:20.159> comes<00:01:20.460> on

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
and then the third program it comes on

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.490 
and then the third program it comes on
again<00:01:20.850> at<00:01:21.030> 6<00:01:21.270> o'clock<00:01:21.390> in<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.690> evening<00:01:21.840> and

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
again at 6 o'clock in the evening and

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.000 
again at 6 o'clock in the evening and
again<00:01:22.860> temperature<00:01:23.460> 19<00:01:23.760> degrees<00:01:24.890> and<00:01:28.010> program

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
again temperature 19 degrees and program

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.820 
again temperature 19 degrees and program
for<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.549> when<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.210> switches<00:01:30.479> off<00:01:30.870> because<00:01:31.470> 13

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
for is when it switches off because 13

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.850 
for is when it switches off because 13
degrees<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.700> quite<00:01:32.940> cold<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.380> switches<00:01:34.590> off

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
degrees is quite cold so it switches off

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.280 
degrees is quite cold so it switches off
that<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.850> evening<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.020> just

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
that is a evening this is just

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.990 
that is a evening this is just
an<00:01:37.409> example<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.890> not<00:01:37.979> my<00:01:38.100> definite<00:01:38.580> settings

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
an example is not my definite settings

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.640 
an example is not my definite settings
and<00:01:39.860> then<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.580> goes<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.030> program<00:01:42.600> one<00:01:42.900> of<00:01:43.140> days

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
and then it goes to program one of days

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.530 
and then it goes to program one of days
6<00:01:44.010> Saturday<00:01:44.670> comes<00:01:44.909> on<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.119> heat<00:01:45.210> up<00:01:45.330> up<00:01:45.420> in

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
6 Saturday comes on the heat up up in

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.980 
6 Saturday comes on the heat up up in
the<00:01:45.600> morning<00:01:46.280> temperature<00:01:47.450> then<00:01:48.450> program

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
the morning temperature then program

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.649 
the morning temperature then program
number<00:01:49.260> 2<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:50.189> going<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.520> come<00:01:50.850> off<00:01:51.030> that's

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
number 2 is going to come off that's

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.500 
number 2 is going to come off that's
that<00:01:52.200> temperature<00:01:52.619> there<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.299> there's<00:01:54.299> 4

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
that temperature there and there's 4

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.850 
that temperature there and there's 4
programs<00:01:54.960> for<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.229> Saturday<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:57.260> there's<00:01:58.260> 4

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
programs for the Saturday and there's 4

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.980 
programs for the Saturday and there's 4
programs<00:01:59.340> for<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.970> seventh<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.479> seventh<00:02:00.810> day

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
programs for the seventh the seventh day

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.030 
programs for the seventh the seventh day
which<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> Sunday<00:02:01.799> obviously<00:02:02.659> and<00:02:04.040> that's

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
which is a Sunday obviously and that's

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.480 
which is a Sunday obviously and that's
it

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
it

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.370
