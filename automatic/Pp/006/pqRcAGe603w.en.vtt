00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
think they should have just had two

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.609 
think they should have just had two
kitty<00:01:43.240> count<00:01:43.509> windows<00:01:43.869> one<00:01:44.079> on<00:01:44.200> each<00:01:44.350> side

kitty count windows one on each side

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.099 
kitty count windows one on each side
that<00:01:44.649> would<00:01:45.130> have<00:01:45.219> been<00:01:45.340> more<00:01:45.880> adorable<00:01:46.149> but<00:01:47.079> I

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:47.109 
that would have been more adorable but I

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:48.779 
that would have been more adorable but I
think<00:01:47.380> they're<00:01:47.500> trying<00:01:47.740> to<00:01:47.799> give<00:01:48.070> a<00:01:48.460> different

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
think they're trying to give a different

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:51.929 
think they're trying to give a different
feeling<00:01:49.630> for<00:01:49.840> this<00:01:50.020> side<00:01:50.520> because<00:01:51.520> it<00:01:51.640> is<00:01:51.759> more

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939

out of the packaging as you can see

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.830 
out of the packaging as you can see
there<00:03:22.350> was<00:03:22.590> completely<00:03:23.550> no<00:03:24.060> setup<00:03:24.510> he<00:03:24.660> just

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
there was completely no setup he just

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.500 
there was completely no setup he just
had<00:03:24.990> to<00:03:25.080> take<00:03:25.230> her<00:03:25.350> out<00:03:25.530> of<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.709> packaging<00:03:26.250> and

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
had to take her out of the packaging and

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.420 
had to take her out of the packaging and
removed<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.660> plastic<00:03:28.050> wrap<00:03:28.290> which<00:03:28.800> was<00:03:29.040> a

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
removed the plastic wrap which was a

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.330 
removed the plastic wrap which was a
little<00:03:29.910> bit<00:03:30.090> difficult<00:03:30.330> because<00:03:31.190> some<00:03:32.190> of<00:03:32.220> the

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
little bit difficult because some of the

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.640 
little bit difficult because some of the
plastic<00:03:32.790> was<00:03:33.120> stuck<00:03:33.360> between<00:03:33.600> her<00:03:33.959> torso<00:03:34.260> and

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
plastic was stuck between her torso and

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.040 
plastic was stuck between her torso and
her<00:03:35.280> bottom<00:03:35.519> and<00:03:35.880> she<00:03:36.480> doesn't<00:03:36.720> appear<00:03:36.930> to

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
her bottom and she doesn't appear to

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.660 
her bottom and she doesn't appear to
come<00:03:37.170> apart<00:03:37.470> so<00:03:37.530> I<00:03:37.680> just<00:03:37.950> had<00:03:38.100> to<00:03:38.280> rip<00:03:38.519> the

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
come apart so I just had to rip the

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.540 
come apart so I just had to rip the
plastic<00:03:39.090> out<00:03:39.209> so<00:03:39.720> I'm<00:03:39.840> not<00:03:40.050> sure<00:03:40.370> really<00:03:41.370> cuz

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
plastic out so I'm not sure really cuz

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.190 
plastic out so I'm not sure really cuz
normally<00:03:41.940> they<00:03:42.060> only<00:03:42.209> do<00:03:42.420> that<00:03:42.570> with<00:03:42.690> joints

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
normally they only do that with joints

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.130 
normally they only do that with joints
but<00:03:43.410> I<00:03:43.680> can't<00:03:44.160> take<00:03:44.370> her<00:03:44.519> apart<00:03:44.930> her<00:03:45.930> base

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
but I can't take her apart her base

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.140 
but I can't take her apart her base
actually<00:03:46.440> just<00:03:46.860> screws<00:03:47.160> on<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.550> her<00:03:47.610> foot<00:03:47.910> so

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
actually just screws on to her foot so

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.820 
actually just screws on to her foot so
right<00:03:48.390> when<00:03:48.570> you<00:03:48.690> take<00:03:48.900> her<00:03:49.050> out<00:03:49.260> her<00:03:49.590> face

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
right when you take her out her face

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.789 
right when you take her out her face
does<00:03:50.160> not<00:03:50.190> need<00:03:50.670> to<00:03:50.880> be<00:03:50.910> attached<00:03:51.570> so<00:03:52.290> once

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
does not need to be attached so once

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.610 
does not need to be attached so once
again<00:03:52.980> she<00:03:53.610> is<00:03:53.820> a<00:03:54.120> one<00:03:54.480> piece<00:03:54.750> complete<00:03:55.260> figure

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
again she is a one piece complete figure

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.550 
again she is a one piece complete figure
right<00:03:56.040> out<00:03:56.280> of<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.610> box<00:03:57.080> taking<00:03:58.080> a<00:03:58.200> close<00:03:58.440> look

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
right out of the box taking a close look

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.789 
right out of the box taking a close look
at<00:03:58.860> her<00:03:59.070> base<00:03:59.310> we<00:03:59.940> can<00:03:59.970> see<00:04:00.510> that<00:04:01.080> it<00:04:01.260> is<00:04:01.290> a

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
at her base we can see that it is a

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.680 
at her base we can see that it is a
plain<00:04:02.190> disc<00:04:02.549> but<00:04:02.820> they<00:04:02.940> really<00:04:03.239> did<00:04:03.390> try<00:04:03.630> to

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
plain disc but they really did try to

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.199 
plain disc but they really did try to
class<00:04:03.959> it<00:04:04.170> up<00:04:04.260> a<00:04:04.440> bit<00:04:04.470> with<00:04:04.830> a<00:04:05.400> faux<00:04:05.820> wood

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
class it up a bit with a faux wood

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.780 
class it up a bit with a faux wood
finish<00:04:06.690> around<00:04:07.019> the<00:04:07.170> edges<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:07.739> then<00:04:08.370> the

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
finish around the edges and then the

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.390 
finish around the edges and then the
plaid<00:04:09.330> panic<00:04:10.200> on<00:04:10.380> the<00:04:10.590> bottom<00:04:10.890> so<00:04:11.100> it<00:04:11.220> just

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
plaid panic on the bottom so it just

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.490 
plaid panic on the bottom so it just
adds<00:04:11.549> a<00:04:11.700> little<00:04:11.820> cuteness<00:04:12.450> that<00:04:12.750> works

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
adds a little cuteness that works

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.590 
adds a little cuteness that works
perfectly<00:04:14.130> with<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.519> figure<00:04:14.880> and<00:04:15.120> doesn't

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
perfectly with the figure and doesn't

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.060 
perfectly with the figure and doesn't
take<00:04:15.780> away<00:04:15.989> from<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.530> figure<00:04:16.769> it<00:04:16.859> doesn't

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
take away from the figure it doesn't

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.090 
take away from the figure it doesn't
make<00:04:17.160> it<00:04:17.190> very<00:04:17.310> flashy<00:04:18.290> because<00:04:19.290> let's<00:04:20.040> be

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
make it very flashy because let's be

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.650 
make it very flashy because let's be
honest<00:04:20.400> you<00:04:20.669> want<00:04:20.760> to<00:04:20.880> focus<00:04:21.150> on<00:04:21.269> the<00:04:21.359> figure

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
honest you want to focus on the figure

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.850 
honest you want to focus on the figure
and<00:04:21.900> not<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.830> base

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
and not the base

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.600 
and not the base
yeah<00:04:24.159> I<00:04:25.169> totally<00:04:26.169> agree<00:04:26.560> with<00:04:26.590> that<00:04:26.770> but<00:04:27.280> the

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
yeah I totally agree with that but the

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.089 
yeah I totally agree with that but the
base<00:04:27.819> sells<00:04:28.150> pretty<00:04:28.479> nice<00:04:28.750> so<00:04:29.620> since<00:04:29.919> we're

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:30.099 
base sells pretty nice so since we're

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:32.700 
base sells pretty nice so since we're
down<00:04:30.280> here<00:04:30.340> let's<00:04:30.909> take<00:04:31.419> a<00:04:31.629> closer<00:04:32.020> look<00:04:32.199> at

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
down here let's take a closer look at

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.100 
down here let's take a closer look at
her<00:04:32.889> shoes<00:04:33.099> and<00:04:33.159> stockings<00:04:33.780> they<00:04:34.780> kind<00:04:35.020> of

her shoes and stockings they kind of

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.550 
her shoes and stockings they kind of
remind<00:04:35.500> me<00:04:35.620> of<00:04:35.969> mary-jane<00:04:36.969> style<00:04:37.479> which<00:04:38.199> maybe

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
remind me of mary-jane style which maybe

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.100 
remind me of mary-jane style which maybe
they<00:04:38.800> still<00:04:39.039> kind<00:04:39.340> of<00:04:39.430> count<00:04:39.759> but<00:04:40.479> you<00:04:40.840> see<00:04:41.080> a

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
they still kind of count but you see a

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.260 
they still kind of count but you see a
lot<00:04:41.439> of<00:04:41.469> lolita's<00:04:42.189> wearing<00:04:42.639> these<00:04:42.819> type<00:04:43.090> of

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
really cute bows on each shoe so they

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.219 
really cute bows on each shoe so they
really<00:04:50.949> did<00:04:51.129> take<00:04:51.460> this<00:04:51.699> whole<00:04:52.030> theme<00:04:52.479> all<00:04:52.840> the

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
really did take this whole theme all the

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:55.399 
really did take this whole theme all the
way<00:04:53.379> down<00:04:53.650> to<00:04:53.889> every<00:04:54.310> last<00:04:54.490> detail

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:55.409 
way down to every last detail

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:58.619 
way down to every last detail
so<00:04:56.409> moving<00:04:56.710> up<00:04:56.979> her<00:04:57.250> leg<00:04:57.580> we<00:04:57.819> can<00:04:57.969> see<00:04:58.150> that<00:04:58.389> her

00:04:58.619 --> 00:04:58.629
