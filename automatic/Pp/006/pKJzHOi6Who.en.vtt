00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 the situation of michael schumacher it 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.750
 There are many sympathy expressions 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.700
 on the cars at mercedesgp time 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.250
 schumi sebastian vettel has the schumi 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.610
 logo on his visor and I have it here 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.100
 the helmet of felipe massa in the arm of the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.240
 this is also the name michael schumacher logo 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.480
 his helmet former team colleague has 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.220
 He also visited in Grenoble in the hospital 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.260
 and of course everyone always wants to know 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.960
 is there anything new about Michael? 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.960
 schumacher reports for us jan krebs 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.820
 and we stand here in front of the hospital 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.950
 in grenoble in the michael schumacher 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.890
 meanwhile for two and a half months in the 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.570
 Koma is lying and thanksgiving wise 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.910
 sabine kehm the managers and 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.200
 longtime friend of the family time 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.510
 For us some questions 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.030
 answer not only the formula 1 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.739
 but people all over the world 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.989
 lets this fate of michael 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.449
 Schumacher does not let go how are you in me 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.190
 what news is there news 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.049
 There are unfortunately no 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.729
 Michael is still in the 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.070
 he does not wake up 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.360
 Of course, we are waiting for it 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.520
 but we also learned and we did 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.150
 also accept that it will take a long time 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.500
 can 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.210
 and that takes a whole lot already 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.810
 and it is okay for us and me 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.610
 think it is just a fact all 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.200
 have to accept that it is not here 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.840
 every hour and every day something new 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.610
 he reports to the chagrin of 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.470
 they and the family will have a lot 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.810
 about the health of michael 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.130
 Last time , one speculated that he read 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.369
 could breathe independently 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.049
 What happened to such rumors ? 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.030
 Often there is not much of a rumor 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.400
 more off than the word suggests it 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.869
 are some rumors or most 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.329
 actually in the past almost eleven 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.170
 Weeks you are very wrong 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.909
 highlighted 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.409
 but in general I really want to 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.369
 rumors and speculation not 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.439
 enter 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.479
 I have said from the beginning only the 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.310
 Information from us or also 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.700
 here by the doctors from the hospital 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.439
 come the information is as 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.430
 should be considered solid and that 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.939
 I do not want to change now either 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.040
 hold 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.680
 in her written message from 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.780
 Tuesdays they talk about again and again 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.069
 small signs that make courage what 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.870
 signs are that 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.920
 Here I ask for understanding that 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.900
 Of course, I'm not closer to that 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.040
 would like to enter which indication that 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.290
 are because that affects the already 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.420
 absolute privacy of the family and 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.430
 Of course we also try the 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.540
 privacy of the family and also 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.219
 protect michaels 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.769
 it's already two and a half months 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:30.269
 gone by how serious is this accident 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.519
 for you and for the family actually 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.200
 to understand 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.269
 Yes, that's a good question, of course 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.189
 insanely difficult to understand for 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.950
 So all of us are destined for the families 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:43.049
 much more than for me 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.909
 the problem is of course that one 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.760
 can hardly understand that a human 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:49.349
 who drove formula 1 over 20 years 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.909
 before that, motorsport has already been done 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.629
 and also made motorsport afterwards 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:56.400
 so many but also partly in 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.439
 has survived brutal situations 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.379
 and then in such an unbelievably banal way 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.879
 situations like a relaxed ski ride 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.919
 because that was actually a cruising 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.739
 the anna on the runway on a relative 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:09.480
 light track hurt so badly 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.579
 that's a thing you really do 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.769
 rational can hardly understand 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.540
 So he did not want to go through this tongue 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.430
 this rocky tongue from a piste too 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.720
 drive others no that is synonymous one 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.359
 cause they were the courts earlier 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.159
 address that suddenly came this 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.319
 rumored that he is from the one runway 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:27.840
 wanted to others and through it and for that 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.720
 drive through this rock collection 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.549
 Wanted somehow to be a fact 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.989
 manifested in some people no 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.549
 he is not in this rock at all 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.530
 mine is driven all the time 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.780
 driven along the edge of the piste 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.370
 sometimes just in there and sometimes 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.680
 just outside because there was snow 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.509
 fresh and then he just has one 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.829
 a stone or rocks you do not 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:48.509
 could see because she was just new snow 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.620
 met and he just has him 

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:51.150
 dug and then he is like that 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.040
 unhappy and probably 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.509
 exactly with the speed neither 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.280
 too fast too slow was this 

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:58.079
 So other rocks hit that 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.150
 Bad is actually that s.der 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.590
 driven down the slopes is this rock 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.639
 I always read about it and where 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.569
 I always said that at the beginning 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:08.340
 have not been there were not there 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.979
 the world public continues unabated 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.379
 large part of the recovery state of 

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:15.449
 Michael is a forecast so far 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.289
 just not possible that they say yes 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:18.810
 again and again 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:20.729
 how do corinna children go? 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.409
 family with this situation around and how 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.960
 very much the participation on the part of the 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:25.419
 fans 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.220
 So the shares helps the participation 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.780
 Sorry that helps a lot 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.340
 I just have to say that does 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.160
 Alright when you're there when you realize 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.620
 that so many people have so much good 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.020
 wish and somehow positive 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.330
 It's energy for the family 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.220
 Of course, nevertheless 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:45.370
 very difficult task but me 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.410
 have to say they are incredibly strong 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.280
 can be their courage not take the 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:53.550
 are here every day who are brave the 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.020
 they just accept it and try 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.860
 with Michael together somehow 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.960
 get through 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.870
 and I have to say it's fuller 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.000
 respect and deep respect sabine 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.800
 thank you very much for being ready 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.020
 power in this difficult time and hope 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.150
 Of course in the near future good 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.320
 thanks sabine and 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.320
 back to australia
