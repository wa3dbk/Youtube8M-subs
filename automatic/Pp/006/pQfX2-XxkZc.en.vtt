00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.719
 we love quite a lot ask me how 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.490
 Are you doing that with the nutrition that is 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.940
 a very complex topic is i explain 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:22.380
 you need that bread today 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:25.680
 easiest for all adrenaline junkies 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.890
 among you red soup on white 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.150
 Tablecloth with spoon is a bit 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.210
 harder I explain you now 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.250
 Therefore left hand on the table 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.050
 in the right hand comes the spoon and 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.429
 Now that's not really true 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.370
 just we have to take care you have to 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:42.960
 immerse the spoon in the soup and 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.079
 then you have something on the spoon that is 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.749
 the search leads now to the cautious 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.940
 moon opens and for the super 

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:55.409
 simply an experience level gentleman 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.629
 do not sit more exciting we stay on 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:00.479
 but have the same level instead of 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.269
 a spoon of a fork 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:06.660
 thus one can muster the namely 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:11.220
 for example tomatoes fork and leads 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:13.590
 to tomato and turn her so and 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.500
 then have the tomato or on it too 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:23.040
 get it right here and then carefully 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:24.480
 otherwise it down to the moon and you're done 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.510
 is under for the right cracks now 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.050
 because you need a fork and 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.750
 knife 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.690
 but how do I know what I am in which 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.990
 hand should lie 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:39.120
 simply cable belonged to mel 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:43.140
 and left begins with more elan so 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.640
 namely fork in the left hand and meta 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.000
 listened 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.860
 and not for the right hand to 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.890
 So you take the knife in the right 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:58.930
 This is how you do it best 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:01.360
 then we already had the finepix 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.750
 and now with the knife that is now 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.440
 heavy 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:09.040
 he starts and cuts left to right 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.420
 left that you therefore cut then 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.230
 maybe that knows through 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.000
 to look and see that 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.780
 really good until then, you've already 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.060
 perfect times 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.660
 now you make that's quark on the 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.570
 potato 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.570
 because now again really careful too 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:38.680
 finished that is now like a direct 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.210
 You are right to banks 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.560
 still allow entrance for he takes the 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.270
 little people they do not want it 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.750
 Exaggerate the takes in the right 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.820
 hand clapton so complicated between the 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.650
 finger it in the beginning still heavily hard me 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.739
 I know but I can do it by the way 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.239
 Practice a porn every day then for the 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.130
 spoon down again as with the sun 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:03.160
 please do it again a bit 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:06.239
 out it looks like that then about then 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.239
 she feels that and 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.980
 and then you can just now 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:14.439
 enjoy it and I think it's that hard it is 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.860
 Not at all I feed myself on everyone 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:16.510
 case 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.829
 and if you are all very nice then 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.510
 Let's meet again in the 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.909
 comments under the video 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.860
 I am looking forward to increasing when 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:27.750
 always I have time and only learned 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.750
 and in any case it glad continue
