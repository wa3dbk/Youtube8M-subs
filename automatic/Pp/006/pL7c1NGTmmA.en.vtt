00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
recommend this because I with the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.859 
recommend this because I with the
ingredients<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.939> first<00:01:24.150> thing<00:01:24.360> was<00:01:24.570> fish

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
ingredients and the first thing was fish

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.620 
ingredients and the first thing was fish
meal<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.380> then<00:01:26.040> whole<00:01:26.340> wheat<00:01:26.460> flour<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:27.180> then

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.760 
meal and then whole wheat flour and then
soybean<00:01:28.020> meal<00:01:28.229> which<00:01:29.040> isn't<00:01:29.610> entirely<00:01:29.939> good

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
soybean meal which isn't entirely good

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.980 
soybean meal which isn't entirely good
but<00:01:31.770> we<00:01:32.610> got<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.909> because<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.420> were<00:01:33.570> on<00:01:33.720> you

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
spectrum benefit so we read this it's

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.539 
spectrum benefit so we read this it's
not<00:01:44.070> more<00:01:44.310> fish<00:01:44.460> like<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.710> whatever<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.430> the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
not more fish like it so whatever so the

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.460 
not more fish like it so whatever so the
next<00:01:47.670> thing<00:01:47.820> we<00:01:48.030> got<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.930> pretty<00:01:49.200> highly

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
next thing we got is a pretty highly

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.530

recommended food called betta buffet

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.569 
recommended food called betta buffet
pellets<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.680> was<00:01:52.950> about<00:01:53.130> four<00:01:53.430> dollars

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
pellets this was about four dollars

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.830 
pellets this was about four dollars
which<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.509> kind<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.320> ridiculous<00:01:55.759> but<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:57.390> lasts

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
which is kind of ridiculous but it lasts

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.620 
which is kind of ridiculous but it lasts
a<00:01:57.869> long<00:01:57.990> time<00:01:58.939> this<00:01:59.939> has<00:02:00.180> really<00:02:00.420> good

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
a long time this has really good

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.760 
a long time this has really good
ingredients<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:01.200> probably<00:02:01.439> can't<00:02:01.619> see<00:02:01.680> it

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
ingredients you probably can't see it

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.609 
ingredients you probably can't see it
because<00:02:01.890> my<00:02:02.070> camera<00:02:02.430> sucks<00:02:02.610> but<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.180> says

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
because my camera sucks but it says

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.429 
because my camera sucks but it says
whole<00:02:04.619> salmon<00:02:05.090> halibut<00:02:06.090> shrimp<00:02:06.659> wheat<00:02:07.170> flour

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
whole salmon halibut shrimp wheat flour

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.740 
whole salmon halibut shrimp wheat flour
so<00:02:07.799> there's<00:02:08.160> three<00:02:08.429> things<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.970> fish<00:02:09.270> in<00:02:09.569> this

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
so there's three things of fish in this

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.020 
so there's three things of fish in this
and<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.080> protein<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.800> at<00:02:10.950> 42

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
and the protein is at 42

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.210 
and the protein is at 42
but<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.390> always<00:02:12.569> want<00:02:12.750> higher<00:02:12.900> protein<00:02:13.220> the

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
but you always want higher protein the

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.460 
but you always want higher protein the
protein<00:02:14.250> in<00:02:14.700> this<00:02:14.850> is<00:02:15.000> at<00:02:15.120> 38<00:02:15.510> this<00:02:16.110> is<00:02:16.260> great

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
protein in this is at 38 this is great

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.720 
protein in this is at 38 this is great
stuff<00:02:18.110> none<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.319> fish<00:02:19.470> well<00:02:20.310> some<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.610> the

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
stuff none of the fish well some of the

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.910 
stuff none of the fish well some of the
fish<00:02:20.910> ate<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.300> but<00:02:21.600> I<00:02:21.900> think<00:02:22.290> they're<00:02:22.560> all<00:02:22.680> kind

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
fish ate it but I think they're all kind

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.199 
fish ate it but I think they're all kind
of<00:02:22.980> stressed<00:02:23.280> because<00:02:23.459> their<00:02:23.730> own<00:02:23.850> small

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
of stressed because their own small

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.050 
of stressed because their own small
places<00:02:24.480> except<00:02:25.319> for<00:02:25.560> pyro<00:02:25.770> which<00:02:26.250> pyro<00:02:26.790> is

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
places except for pyro which pyro is

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.940 
places except for pyro which pyro is
just<00:02:27.300> being<00:02:27.480> picky<00:02:27.660> or<00:02:28.080> he<00:02:28.350> doesn't<00:02:28.530> feel<00:02:28.800> too

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
just being picky or he doesn't feel too

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.120 
just being picky or he doesn't feel too
well<00:02:29.100> or<00:02:29.430> whatever<00:02:29.819> but<00:02:30.750> this<00:02:31.620> is<00:02:31.800> awesome

yeah it actually made in the Netherlands

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.650 
yeah it actually made in the Netherlands
which<00:03:26.100> I<00:03:26.400> figure<00:03:26.730> this<00:03:26.940> is<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.239> same<00:03:27.420> stuff

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
which I figure this is the same stuff

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.020 
which I figure this is the same stuff
that<00:03:27.720> people<00:03:28.140> define<00:03:28.590> Wilkinson's<00:03:29.160> so<00:03:32.000> so<00:03:33.000> I

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
that people define Wilkinson's so so I

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.780 
that people define Wilkinson's so so I
have<00:03:33.150> an<00:03:33.269> obsession<00:03:33.360> with<00:03:33.750> foreign<00:03:34.260> treats

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
have an obsession with foreign treats

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.640 
have an obsession with foreign treats
the<00:03:35.790> next<00:03:36.180> thing<00:03:36.329> on<00:03:36.750> my<00:03:37.350> hole<00:03:38.220> is<00:03:39.049> two<00:03:40.049> bags<00:03:40.290> of

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
the next thing on my hole is two bags of

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.930 
the next thing on my hole is two bags of
99<00:03:41.579> cent<00:03:41.940> Gertie<00:03:42.269> guinea<00:03:42.510> pig<00:03:43.310> 12<00:03:44.310> ounces<00:03:44.760> each

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
99 cent Gertie guinea pig 12 ounces each

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.910 
99 cent Gertie guinea pig 12 ounces each
so<00:03:45.480> 24<00:03:45.989> ounces<00:03:47.329> which<00:03:48.329> is<00:03:48.780> a<00:03:49.470> good<00:03:49.709> deal

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
so 24 ounces which is a good deal

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.770 
so 24 ounces which is a good deal
considering<00:03:50.579> this<00:03:50.940> stuff<00:03:51.209> is<00:03:51.450> really

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
considering this stuff is really

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.000 
considering this stuff is really
expensive<00:03:51.959> if<00:03:52.440> you<00:03:52.470> buy<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:52.739> by<00:03:52.980> the

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
expensive if you buy it by the

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.030 
expensive if you buy it by the
five-pound<00:03:53.549> back<00:03:54.739> actually<00:03:55.739> it's<00:03:55.829> a<00:03:55.859> four

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
five-pound back actually it's a four

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.140 
five-pound back actually it's a four
pounder<00:03:56.840> whatever<00:03:58.340> so<00:03:59.340> yeah<00:03:59.430> my<00:03:59.730> guinea<00:03:59.910> pigs

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
pounder whatever so yeah my guinea pigs

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.660 
pounder whatever so yeah my guinea pigs
really<00:04:00.390> love<00:04:00.600> this<00:04:00.780> as<00:04:01.049> a<00:04:01.079> treat<00:04:01.350> food<00:04:01.530> and<00:04:02.370> got
