we've<00:00:09.920> addressed<00:00:10.309> our<00:00:10.670> elevation<00:00:11.330> challenges

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.050 
we've addressed our elevation challenges

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.890 
we've addressed our elevation challenges
at<00:00:12.290> our<00:00:12.680> rainwater<00:00:13.250> Sam<00:00:13.760> cistern<00:00:14.300> by<00:00:14.480> building

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
at our rainwater Sam cistern by building

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.080 
at our rainwater Sam cistern by building
up<00:00:15.019> the<00:00:15.230> soil<00:00:15.440> level<00:00:15.920> between<00:00:16.369> the<00:00:16.670> cistern

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
up the soil level between the cistern

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.329 
up the soil level between the cistern
and<00:00:17.180> our<00:00:17.359> cottage<00:00:17.900> and<00:00:18.109> also<00:00:18.710> building<00:00:19.010> a<00:00:19.130> low

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:19.339 
and our cottage and also building a low

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:22.329 
and our cottage and also building a low
retaining<00:00:20.300> wall<00:00:20.630> to<00:00:21.199> hold<00:00:21.409> that<00:00:21.679> soil<00:00:22.039> back

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:22.339 
retaining wall to hold that soil back

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:24.729 
retaining wall to hold that soil back
now<00:00:22.970> we're<00:00:23.150> ready<00:00:23.329> to<00:00:23.419> move<00:00:23.720> the<00:00:23.749> water<00:00:24.140> from

00:00:24.729 --> 00:00:24.739 
now we're ready to move the water from

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:27.460 
now we're ready to move the water from
the<00:00:24.949> cottage<00:00:25.640> over<00:00:25.999> to<00:00:26.089> the<00:00:26.179> cistern<00:00:26.749> and<00:00:26.989> we

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
the cottage over to the cistern and we

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.040 
the cottage over to the cistern and we
start<00:00:27.769> that<00:00:28.009> simply<00:00:28.519> by<00:00:28.730> building<00:00:29.390> adding

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
start that simply by building adding

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.019 
start that simply by building adding
guttering<00:00:30.470> to<00:00:30.589> the<00:00:30.679> building<00:00:31.069> and<00:00:31.220> draining

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
guttering to the building and draining

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.240 
guttering to the building and draining
it<00:00:32.149> to<00:00:32.390> the<00:00:32.480> East<00:00:32.660> End<00:00:32.899> where<00:00:33.590> our<00:00:33.770> cistern

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
it to the East End where our cistern

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.790 
it to the East End where our cistern
lives<00:00:34.489> once<00:00:35.239> we<00:00:35.420> get<00:00:35.570> to<00:00:35.870> the<00:00:35.989> downspout<00:00:36.559> we

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
lives once we get to the downspout we

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.619 
lives once we get to the downspout we
have<00:00:37.010> a<00:00:37.039> couple<00:00:37.460> of<00:00:37.550> options<00:00:37.850> that<00:00:38.300> we<00:00:38.420> can<00:00:38.570> use

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
have a couple of options that we can use

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.200 
have a couple of options that we can use
to<00:00:39.500> move<00:00:39.649> the<00:00:39.859> water<00:00:40.070> from<00:00:40.699> the<00:00:40.789> building<00:00:41.090> to

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
to move the water from the building to

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.970 
to move the water from the building to
the<00:00:41.239> cistern<00:00:41.809> we<00:00:41.960> can<00:00:42.079> either<00:00:42.199> move<00:00:42.469> it<00:00:42.649> above

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
the cistern we can either move it above

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.040 
the cistern we can either move it above
ground<00:00:43.250> or<00:00:43.519> below<00:00:44.030> ground<00:00:44.059> now<00:00:44.870> if<00:00:44.929> we're

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
ground or below ground now if we're

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.930 
ground or below ground now if we're
going<00:00:45.140> to<00:00:45.199> move<00:00:45.320> it<00:00:45.530> below<00:00:45.980> ground<00:00:46.340> we<00:00:46.519> do<00:00:46.699> that

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
going to move it below ground we do that

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.329 
going to move it below ground we do that
by<00:00:47.539> simply<00:00:48.260> connecting<00:00:49.269> some<00:00:50.269> non<00:00:51.339> perforated

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339

drainage pipe to our downspout and

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:56.889 
drainage pipe to our downspout and
there's<00:00:55.760> a<00:00:55.820> little<00:00:55.999> adapter<00:00:56.480> that<00:00:56.600> we<00:00:56.719> could

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
there's a little adapter that we could

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.319 
there's a little adapter that we could
use<00:00:57.079> for<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:57.620> attachment<00:00:57.949> and<00:00:58.670> we<00:00:58.999> want<00:00:59.210> to

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
use for the attachment and we want to

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.989 
use for the attachment and we want to
bury<00:00:59.629> this<00:00:59.929> below<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:00.589> soil<00:01:00.920> so<00:01:01.760> that<00:01:01.909> it

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:01.999 
bury this below the soil so that it

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:04.450 
bury this below the soil so that it
slopes<00:01:02.480> towards<00:01:03.050> the<00:01:03.260> cistern<00:01:03.829> and<00:01:04.040> we<00:01:04.220> want

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
slopes towards the cistern and we want

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.140 
slopes towards the cistern and we want
the<00:01:05.150> drain<00:01:05.600> opening<00:01:05.810> to<00:01:06.620> be<00:01:06.650> at<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:07.670> top<00:01:07.940> of

to grow in it or by building a dry creek

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.190 
to grow in it or by building a dry creek
bed<00:01:25.190> which<00:01:25.400> is<00:01:25.550> what<00:01:25.820> we're<00:01:26.000> gonna<00:01:26.120> do<00:01:26.450> and<00:01:27.080> we

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
bed which is what we're gonna do and we

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.920 
bed which is what we're gonna do and we
want<00:01:27.380> to<00:01:27.470> start<00:01:27.830> our<00:01:28.220> dry<00:01:28.760> creek<00:01:29.060> bed<00:01:29.300> by

want to start our dry creek bed by
identifying<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:30.890> shape<00:01:31.220> of<00:01:31.430> it<00:01:31.610> and<00:01:31.820> I'm

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
identifying the shape of it and I'm

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.640 
identifying the shape of it and I'm
using<00:01:32.660> a<00:01:33.200> hoe<00:01:33.760> just<00:01:34.760> to<00:01:34.940> dig<00:01:35.150> out<00:01:35.330> the<00:01:36.230> shape<00:01:36.470> I

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
using a hoe just to dig out the shape I

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.920 
using a hoe just to dig out the shape I
want<00:01:36.680> to<00:01:36.920> follow<00:01:37.160> if<00:01:37.820> you<00:01:37.880> have<00:01:38.120> a<00:01:38.180> large<00:01:38.540> area

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
want to follow if you have a large area

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.020 
want to follow if you have a large area
I<00:01:39.700> often<00:01:40.700> use<00:01:41.030> a<00:01:41.330> garden<00:01:41.840> hose<00:01:42.110> and<00:01:42.470> lay<00:01:42.980> that

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
I often use a garden hose and lay that

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.970 
I often use a garden hose and lay that
along<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:44.210> soil<00:01:44.510> I<00:01:44.810> do<00:01:45.170> this<00:01:45.410> a<00:01:45.470> lot<00:01:45.680> when<00:01:45.860> I'm

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
along the soil I do this a lot when I'm

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.160 
along the soil I do this a lot when I'm
shaping<00:01:46.430> beds<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:47.240> such<00:01:47.480> so<00:01:47.810> that<00:01:47.840> I<00:01:47.960> could

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
shaping beds and such so that I could

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.260 
shaping beds and such so that I could
get<00:01:48.260> the<00:01:48.410> shape<00:01:48.680> properly<00:01:49.160> now<00:01:49.880> if<00:01:50.000> you<00:01:50.090> think

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
get the shape properly now if you think

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.750 
get the shape properly now if you think
about<00:01:50.570> a<00:01:50.630> natural<00:01:51.230> Creek<00:01:51.560> they<00:01:52.100> have<00:01:52.340> curves

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
about a natural Creek they have curves

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.120 
about a natural Creek they have curves
and<00:01:53.120> bends<00:01:53.450> and<00:01:53.780> our<00:01:54.020> Dry<00:01:54.320> Creek<00:01:54.680> is<00:01:54.860> going<00:01:55.070> to

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
and bends and our Dry Creek is going to

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.670 
and bends and our Dry Creek is going to
look<00:01:55.280> much<00:01:55.880> more<00:01:56.270> at<00:01:56.540> home<00:01:56.570> in<00:01:57.080> the<00:01:57.170> landscape

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
look much more at home in the landscape

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.860 
look much more at home in the landscape
if<00:01:57.890> we<00:01:58.310> give<00:01:58.460> it<00:01:58.580> a<00:01:58.670> few<00:01:58.700> curbs<00:01:59.330> rather<00:01:59.660> than

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
if we give it a few curbs rather than

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.530 
if we give it a few curbs rather than
running<00:02:00.110> it<00:02:00.290> straight<00:02:01.060> the<00:02:02.060> next<00:02:02.300> thing<00:02:02.450> we

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
running it straight the next thing we

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.290 
running it straight the next thing we
want<00:02:02.720> to<00:02:02.780> do<00:02:02.960> is<00:02:03.200> just<00:02:03.530> to<00:02:03.740> start<00:02:04.130> digging<00:02:04.940> out

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
want to do is just to start digging out

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.369 
want to do is just to start digging out
our<00:02:05.690> dry<00:02:06.650> creek<00:02:06.980> bed<00:02:07.250> and<00:02:07.660> creeks<00:02:08.660> typically

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
our dry creek bed and creeks typically

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.650 
our dry creek bed and creeks typically
aren't<00:02:09.679> very<00:02:10.250> deep<00:02:10.340> they're<00:02:11.000> wider<00:02:11.300> than

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
aren't very deep they're wider than

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.770 
aren't very deep they're wider than
they're<00:02:11.810> deep<00:02:12.050> and<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.680> good<00:02:12.890> rule<00:02:13.130> of<00:02:13.550> thumb<00:02:13.780> to

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
they're deep and a good rule of thumb to

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.030 
they're deep and a good rule of thumb to
you

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
you

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.240 
you
is<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:16.299> dig<00:02:16.510> your<00:02:16.720> dry<00:02:16.900> creek<00:02:17.230> bed<00:02:17.470> so<00:02:18.220> that

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
is to dig your dry creek bed so that

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.770 
is to dig your dry creek bed so that
it's<00:02:18.610> 2<00:02:19.030> times<00:02:19.769> wider<00:02:20.769> than<00:02:21.519> as<00:02:21.760> then<00:02:22.239> is<00:02:22.420> deep

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
it's 2 times wider than as then is deep

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.479 
it's 2 times wider than as then is deep
and<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.340> get<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:25.450> depth<00:02:25.780> but<00:02:26.200> also<00:02:26.489> to

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
and so to get the depth but also to

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.880 
and so to get the depth but also to
start<00:02:27.760> building<00:02:28.360> up<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.900> edges<00:02:29.379> of<00:02:29.530> our<00:02:29.620> dry

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
start building up the edges of our dry

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.729 
start building up the edges of our dry
creek<00:02:30.250> I'm<00:02:30.640> simply<00:02:31.209> pulling<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.200> soil<00:02:32.500> out

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
creek I'm simply pulling the soil out

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.250 
creek I'm simply pulling the soil out
from<00:02:33.099> inside<00:02:33.579> the<00:02:33.760> creek<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.390> then<00:02:34.900> building

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
from inside the creek and then building

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:42.740 
from inside the creek and then building
up<00:02:35.409> in<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:35.980> end

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.979 

as<00:02:43.750> you<00:02:44.650> sighs<00:02:45.010> your<00:02:45.640> dry<00:02:45.939> creek<00:02:46.329> bed<00:02:46.599> you<00:02:46.810> want

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
as you sighs your dry creek bed you want

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.830 
as you sighs your dry creek bed you want
it<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.439> be<00:02:47.560> proportional<00:02:47.829> to<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:49.329> surrounding

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
it to be proportional to the surrounding

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.140 
it to be proportional to the surrounding
landscape<00:02:50.319> and<00:02:50.829> also<00:02:51.219> the<00:02:51.549> length<00:02:51.790> of<00:02:52.060> the

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
landscape and also the length of the

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.750 
landscape and also the length of the
creek<00:02:52.480> bed<00:02:52.750> a<00:02:52.959> really<00:02:53.500> long<00:02:53.739> skinny<00:02:54.189> channel

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
creek bed a really long skinny channel

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.270 
creek bed a really long skinny channel
isn't<00:02:55.000> going<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:55.239> look<00:02:55.390> very<00:02:56.140> natural<00:02:56.439> you

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
isn't going to look very natural you

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.309 
isn't going to look very natural you
also<00:02:57.430> want<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:57.879> size<00:02:58.150> it<00:02:58.480> to<00:02:58.629> accommodate<00:02:59.139> the

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
also want to size it to accommodate the

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.679 
also want to size it to accommodate the
flow<00:02:59.590> of<00:02:59.620> water<00:03:00.099> which<00:03:00.909> we<00:03:01.180> have<00:03:01.359> a<00:03:01.389> pretty

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:01.689 
flow of water which we have a pretty

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:03.629 
flow of water which we have a pretty
limited<00:03:02.049> source<00:03:02.709> from<00:03:03.099> the<00:03:03.189> bottom<00:03:03.459> of<00:03:03.549> a

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:03.639 
limited source from the bottom of a

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.250 
limited source from the bottom of a
gutter<00:03:03.849> we<00:03:04.060> don't<00:03:04.209> have<00:03:04.389> that<00:03:04.750> much<00:03:04.989> water

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
gutter we don't have that much water

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.709 
gutter we don't have that much water
flowing<00:03:05.709> through<00:03:06.069> so<00:03:06.280> this<00:03:06.450> pretty<00:03:07.450> narrow

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:07.719 
flowing through so this pretty narrow

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:10.110 
flowing through so this pretty narrow
width<00:03:07.989> should<00:03:08.260> be<00:03:08.349> adequate<00:03:08.859> now<00:03:09.579> the<00:03:09.639> end<00:03:09.879> of

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
width should be adequate now the end of

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.089 
width should be adequate now the end of
it<00:03:10.329> I've<00:03:10.719> widened<00:03:11.409> a<00:03:11.530> little<00:03:11.769> bit<00:03:11.889> if<00:03:12.010> you

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
it I've widened a little bit if you

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:13.500 
it I've widened a little bit if you
think<00:03:12.310> about<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.609> mouth<00:03:12.790> of<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.090> river<00:03:13.299> they

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
think about the mouth of the river they

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.949 
think about the mouth of the river they
tend<00:03:13.810> to<00:03:13.900> open<00:03:14.530> up<00:03:14.950> as<00:03:15.159> they<00:03:15.310> flow<00:03:15.700> into<00:03:16.329> a<00:03:16.629> lake

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
tend to open up as they flow into a lake

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.159 
tend to open up as they flow into a lake
or<00:03:17.230> a<00:03:17.290> pond<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:18.040> so<00:03:18.579> we've<00:03:18.760> widened<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.870> ends

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169 
or a pond and so we've widened the ends

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:21.929 
or a pond and so we've widened the ends
of<00:03:20.260> it<00:03:20.319> a<00:03:20.379> little<00:03:20.620> bit<00:03:20.680> one<00:03:21.370> thing<00:03:21.579> you<00:03:21.700> have<00:03:21.909> to

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:21.939 
of it a little bit one thing you have to

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:24.690 
of it a little bit one thing you have to
be<00:03:22.209> sure<00:03:22.480> of<00:03:22.510> is<00:03:22.870> that<00:03:23.169> you<00:03:23.709> maintain<00:03:23.950> a<00:03:24.310> nice

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
be sure of is that you maintain a nice

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.110 
be sure of is that you maintain a nice
gentle<00:03:25.299> slope<00:03:25.720> flowing<00:03:26.379> downhill<00:03:26.969> toward<00:03:27.969> the

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
gentle slope flowing downhill toward the

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.050 
gentle slope flowing downhill toward the

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
cistern now dry creek beds have many

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.479 
cistern now dry creek beds have many
different<00:03:31.629> purposes<00:03:32.230> in<00:03:32.469> the<00:03:32.680> landscape<00:03:33.310> and

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
different purposes in the landscape and

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.990 
different purposes in the landscape and
ours<00:03:34.269> is<00:03:34.659> used<00:03:35.349> to<00:03:35.530> move<00:03:35.680> water<00:03:35.950> but<00:03:36.310> we<00:03:36.849> can

we're<00:04:10.840> ready<00:04:11.019> to<00:04:11.709> put<00:04:11.919> in<00:04:12.069> a<00:04:12.280> liner<00:04:13.060> and<00:04:13.479> if

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
we're ready to put in a liner and if

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.140 
we're ready to put in a liner and if
you're<00:04:14.379> building<00:04:14.590> a<00:04:14.859> dry<00:04:15.099> creek<00:04:15.459> bed<00:04:15.729> just<00:04:16.030> for

you're building a dry creek bed just for
aesthetic<00:04:16.750> purposes<00:04:16.979> you<00:04:17.979> can<00:04:18.190> use<00:04:18.430> a<00:04:18.789> weed

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
aesthetic purposes you can use a weed

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.930 
aesthetic purposes you can use a weed
mat<00:04:19.630> as<00:04:19.900> your<00:04:20.440> liner<00:04:20.680> but<00:04:21.430> because<00:04:21.759> we're

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
mat as your liner but because we're

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.899 
mat as your liner but because we're
trying<00:04:22.180> to<00:04:22.330> maximize<00:04:22.949> the<00:04:23.949> capture<00:04:24.460> of<00:04:24.580> water

this is just going to make sure that the
water<00:04:59.390> moves<00:05:00.390> from<00:05:00.570> our<00:05:00.810> downspout<00:05:01.380> into<00:05:02.010> our

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
water moves from our downspout into our

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.220 
water moves from our downspout into our
dry<00:05:02.400> creek<00:05:02.790> and<00:05:03.000> as<00:05:03.420> we<00:05:03.630> work<00:05:03.840> we're<00:05:04.050> going<00:05:04.170> to

dry creek and as we work we're going to

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.260 
dry creek and as we work we're going to
hide<00:05:04.590> this<00:05:04.890> with<00:05:05.220> some<00:05:05.520> of<00:05:05.550> the<00:05:05.700> rock<00:05:05.880> that<00:05:06.150> we

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
hide this with some of the rock that we

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.180 
hide this with some of the rock that we
build<00:05:06.510> up<00:05:06.690> along<00:05:07.050> our<00:05:07.410> creek<00:05:07.710> bed

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
build up along our creek bed

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.280 
build up along our creek bed
well<00:05:08.700> now<00:05:08.790> we're<00:05:08.970> ready<00:05:09.120> to<00:05:09.330> start<00:05:09.540> filling<00:05:10.020> it

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
and I'm going to use River Rock along

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:27.970 
and I'm going to use River Rock along
the<00:05:14.010> bottom<00:05:14.460> of<00:05:14.820> our<00:05:15.090> chance

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.950 

the<00:05:28.980> waters<00:05:29.310> gonna<00:05:29.520> flow<00:05:30.060> over<00:05:30.420> the<00:05:30.720> river

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
the waters gonna flow over the river

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.620 
the waters gonna flow over the river
rock<00:05:31.290> towards<00:05:32.160> the<00:05:32.340> mouth<00:05:32.550> of<00:05:32.880> our<00:05:32.970> dry<00:05:33.240> creek

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
rock towards the mouth of our dry creek

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.110 
rock towards the mouth of our dry creek
and<00:05:33.840> into<00:05:34.140> the<00:05:34.260> cistern<00:05:34.710> and<00:05:35.040> at<00:05:35.490> this<00:05:35.670> point

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
and into the cistern and at this point

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.930 
and into the cistern and at this point
we<00:05:36.690> need<00:05:36.870> to<00:05:36.930> use<00:05:37.410> some<00:05:37.890> of<00:05:38.010> our<00:05:38.100> larger<00:05:38.550> stones

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
we need to use some of our larger stones

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.600 
we need to use some of our larger stones
to<00:05:39.360> hold<00:05:39.630> back<00:05:39.840> the<00:05:40.110> gravel<00:05:40.590> but<00:05:41.190> we<00:05:41.310> want<00:05:41.490> to

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
to hold back the gravel but we want to

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.700 
to hold back the gravel but we want to
also<00:05:41.760> leave<00:05:42.090> some<00:05:42.390> large<00:05:42.690> openings<00:05:43.410> where<00:05:43.590> the

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
also leave some large openings where the

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.680 
also leave some large openings where the
water<00:05:43.920> can<00:05:44.250> flow<00:05:44.280> through<00:05:44.580> so<00:05:45.150> this<00:05:45.300> is<00:05:45.480> maybe

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
water can flow through so this is maybe

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.290 
water can flow through so this is maybe
the<00:05:45.810> more<00:05:46.440> challenging<00:05:46.770> part<00:05:47.400> but<00:05:48.090> it's<00:05:48.180> going

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
the more challenging part but it's going

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.120 
the more challenging part but it's going
to<00:05:48.390> give<00:05:48.480> it<00:05:48.570> a<00:05:48.630> beautiful<00:05:49.020> aesthetic<00:05:49.800> feel

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
to give it a beautiful aesthetic feel

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.830 
to give it a beautiful aesthetic feel
we're<00:05:50.760> also<00:05:50.880> going<00:05:51.120> to<00:05:51.180> use<00:05:51.300> some<00:05:51.450> of<00:05:51.720> our

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
we're also going to use some of our

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.920 
we're also going to use some of our
larger<00:05:52.230> stone<00:05:52.620> to<00:05:53.340> start<00:05:53.610> building<00:05:54.090> up<00:05:54.240> along

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
larger stone to start building up along

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.120 
larger stone to start building up along
the<00:05:55.050> edges<00:05:55.560> and<00:05:55.800> finish<00:05:56.310> off<00:05:56.490> our<00:05:56.700> creek
