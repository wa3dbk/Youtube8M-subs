00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980

this<00:03:12.440> Mouse<00:03:12.709> but<00:03:13.100> my<00:03:13.400> computer<00:03:13.880> really<00:03:14.750> hates

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
this Mouse but my computer really hates

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.650 
this Mouse but my computer really hates
this<00:03:15.560> Mouse<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:16.370> I<00:03:16.850> think<00:03:17.209> it<00:03:17.330> was<00:03:17.450> an<00:03:17.540> issue

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
this Mouse and I think it was an issue

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.300 
this Mouse and I think it was an issue
with<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:17.930> BIOS<00:03:18.350> settings<00:03:18.739> or<00:03:18.890> something<00:03:19.220> I

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
with the BIOS settings or something I

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.930 
with the BIOS settings or something I
changed<00:03:19.820> them<00:03:20.000> and<00:03:20.410> it<00:03:21.410> slowly<00:03:21.940> electrocuted

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
changed them and it slowly electrocuted

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.960 
changed them and it slowly electrocuted
each<00:03:23.120> Mouse<00:03:23.450> at<00:03:24.050> the<00:03:24.230> DJ<00:03:24.770> 400<00:03:25.340> long<00:03:25.430> attack<00:03:25.790> and

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
each Mouse at the DJ 400 long attack and

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.479 
each Mouse at the DJ 400 long attack and
I<00:03:26.330> was<00:03:26.510> going<00:03:26.810> through<00:03:27.050> them<00:03:27.350> every<00:03:27.739> probably

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
I was going through them every probably

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.220 
I was going through them every probably
two<00:03:28.790> months<00:03:29.300> and<00:03:29.450> it<00:03:29.510> would<00:03:29.630> start<00:03:29.870> off<00:03:30.020> with

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
two months and it would start off with

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.110 
two months and it would start off with
it<00:03:30.350> just<00:03:30.500> disconnecting<00:03:31.310> for<00:03:31.580> like<00:03:31.790> five

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
it just disconnecting for like five

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.990 
it just disconnecting for like five
seconds<00:03:32.690> and<00:03:33.020> then<00:03:33.080> it<00:03:33.500> would<00:03:33.709> reconnect<00:03:34.520> and

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
seconds and then it would reconnect and

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.620 
seconds and then it would reconnect and
it's<00:03:35.810> okay<00:03:36.380> in<00:03:36.770> most<00:03:37.280> games<00:03:37.670> to<00:03:37.970> have<00:03:38.150> that<00:03:38.420> but

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
it's okay in most games to have that but

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.479 
it's okay in most games to have that but
like<00:03:38.780> for<00:03:38.959> example<00:03:39.080> League<00:03:39.650> of<00:03:39.770> Legends<00:03:40.220> if

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
like for example League of Legends if

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:41.200 
like for example League of Legends if
you<00:03:40.670> just<00:03:40.910> can

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
you just can

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.780 
you just can
five<00:03:41.570> seconds<00:03:41.990> you've<00:03:42.110> dead<00:03:42.380> I<00:03:42.620> raped<00:03:43.160> so<00:03:43.610> many

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
five seconds you've dead I raped so many

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.150 
five seconds you've dead I raped so many
times<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:44.420> I<00:03:44.660> think<00:03:45.080> I've<00:03:45.380> gone<00:03:45.590> through<00:03:45.650> all

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
times and I think I've gone through all

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.950 
times and I think I've gone through all
of<00:03:46.190> about<00:03:46.610> five<00:03:46.940> of<00:03:46.970> them<00:03:47.330> because<00:03:47.720> I've

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:47.960 
of about five of them because I've

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.530 
of about five of them because I've
learned<00:03:48.140> I've<00:03:48.700> learned<00:03:49.700> him<00:03:49.910> out<00:03:50.090> I've<00:03:50.360> gone

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
learned I've learned him out I've gone

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.290 
learned I've learned him out I've gone
through<00:03:50.600> like<00:03:51.020> the<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:51.800> warranties<00:03:52.430> and<00:03:52.820> I

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
through like the the warranties and I

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.390 
through like the the warranties and I
could<00:03:53.690> keep<00:03:53.930> theoretically<00:03:54.650> doing<00:03:55.040> that<00:03:55.220> but

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
could keep theoretically doing that but

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.490 
could keep theoretically doing that but
it's<00:03:55.610> just<00:03:55.670> a<00:03:55.880> waste<00:03:56.090> of<00:03:56.360> resources<00:03:56.510> I<00:03:57.080> decided

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
it's just a waste of resources I decided

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.290 
it's just a waste of resources I decided
it<00:03:57.710> wasn't<00:03:57.980> meant<00:03:58.100> to<00:03:58.160> be<00:03:58.250> I<00:03:58.670> mean<00:03:58.700> I<00:03:58.970> was<00:03:59.150> so

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
it wasn't meant to be I mean I was so

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.390 
it wasn't meant to be I mean I was so
happy<00:03:59.510> with<00:03:59.840> it<00:03:59.990> but<00:04:00.110> my<00:04:00.260> computer<00:04:00.590> wasn't<00:04:01.130> so

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
happy with it but my computer wasn't so

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.990 
happy with it but my computer wasn't so
on<00:04:01.550> I<00:04:02.060> went<00:04:02.660> out<00:04:03.080> and<00:04:03.380> bought<00:04:04.070> another<00:04:04.310> mouse

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
on I went out and bought another mouse

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.540 
on I went out and bought another mouse
which<00:04:05.510> it<00:04:06.050> fits<00:04:06.350> very<00:04:06.530> well<00:04:06.680> I<00:04:06.980> went<00:04:07.190> with<00:04:07.400> the

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
which it fits very well I went with the

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.100 
which it fits very well I went with the
idea<00:04:07.850> this<00:04:07.940> is<00:04:08.060> what<00:04:08.180> I'm<00:04:08.300> using<00:04:08.480> a<00:04:08.630> moment<00:04:09.020> is

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
idea this is what I'm using a moment is

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.650 
idea this is what I'm using a moment is
just<00:04:09.140> a<00:04:09.410> basic<00:04:09.680> Microsoft<00:04:10.670> analysis<00:04:11.210> there's

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
just a basic Microsoft analysis there's

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.590 
just a basic Microsoft analysis there's
like<00:04:11.990> one<00:04:12.380> side<00:04:13.190> button<00:04:13.640> okay<00:04:14.000> two<00:04:14.240> side

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
like one side button okay two side

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.660 
like one side button okay two side
buttons<00:04:14.810> I<00:04:15.200> wanted<00:04:15.710> the<00:04:15.830> same<00:04:16.010> shape<00:04:16.400> as<00:04:16.640> the

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
buttons I wanted the same shape as the

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.030 
buttons I wanted the same shape as the
g400<00:04:17.570> and<00:04:17.720> this<00:04:17.840> is<00:04:17.989> the<00:04:18.110> closest<00:04:18.500> I<00:04:18.650> could<00:04:18.710> get

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
g400 and this is the closest I could get

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.370 
g400 and this is the closest I could get
and<00:04:19.430> I've<00:04:19.550> had<00:04:19.760> this<00:04:19.880> for<00:04:19.940> about<00:04:20.450> four<00:04:20.870> months

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
and I've had this for about four months

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.650 
and I've had this for about four months
ish<00:04:21.830> and<00:04:22.040> it<00:04:22.160> hasn't<00:04:22.400> disconnected<00:04:23.240> all<00:04:23.540> right

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
ish and it hasn't disconnected all right

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.070 
ish and it hasn't disconnected all right
so<00:04:24.170> I<00:04:24.440> will<00:04:24.890> put<00:04:25.370> these<00:04:25.580> away<00:04:25.790> now<00:04:26.360> back<00:04:26.720> into

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
so I will put these away now back into

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:42.680 
so I will put these away now back into
the<00:04:27.200> mouse<00:04:27.410> graveyard

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.100 

okay<00:04:43.690> so<00:04:44.010> another<00:04:45.010> technology<00:04:45.790> that<00:04:46.150> I<00:04:46.810> got

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
okay so another technology that I got

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.940 
okay so another technology that I got
recently<00:04:47.530> and<00:04:48.160> this<00:04:48.850> is<00:04:49.330> called<00:04:49.750> a<00:04:50.020> Samson
