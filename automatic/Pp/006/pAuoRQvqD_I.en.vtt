00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.860
 English school program is very 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.529
 different there are many items which 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.420
 no Russian for example business business 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.210
 probably one of the most difficult subjects 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.970
 for our students because nothing 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.710
 there is no similar in our school program 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.330
 and there everything is very attached to 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.270
 really everything is tied to 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.760
 real life and puzzles solve casey 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.040
 so called for example there is a city in 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.480
 which area of ​​the city are you recommended 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.480
 open new mcdonald's 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.280
 why there just do not feed shrimp not 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.860
 fed immorally not fed to the apartment 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.350
 also wilted and the device in the form of feed 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.800
 all other crusts of red caviar too 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.800
 decor 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.070
 Show can utkin not let on 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.950
 school grounds leave but what do i 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.990
 it seems important that there is a very big 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.870
 transparency that is guys know for 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.250
 what offense what punishment and me 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.260
 It seems this is a very fundamental difference. 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.150
 from our Russian school because the most 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.820
 interesting that one of the worst 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.290
 punishments for british 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.170
 schoolchildren is when they are not allowed 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.210
 go to school they do not write off 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.490
 because they have something different now 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.680
 say mentality is another psychology 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.460
 the other is our guys study for 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.690
 teachers well at best for parents 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.900
 English students learn for themselves 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.820
 so their main goal is to get 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.180
 knowledge they are not even with each other 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.770
 Writes off not so much there in the phone 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:56.860
 it is easy to learn because the best is another 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:00.490
 up to 16 years is considered the most important thing to teach 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:04.050
 guys learn why not stuffed 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.070
 knowledge when communicating with school principals 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.140
 British they say Russian 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.770
 students are very similar to Chinese 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.290
 schoolchildren 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.890
 and not just like walking cyclopias and everywhere 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.440
 but also English schoolchildren to 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.540
 certain stage know much less 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.060
 because they are given ignorance gives 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.270
 tools of knowledge is much more important 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.370
 because in the modern world to know everything 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.010
 impossible and this is not striving for 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.069
 but you need to give the tools you need 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.970
 teach learn learn teach teach 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.700
 analyze 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.640
 teach defend your position and and 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.010
 slow spell 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.700
 Well, so live in England, so live at 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.700
 british schools
