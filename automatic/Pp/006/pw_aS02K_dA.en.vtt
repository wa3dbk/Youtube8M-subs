there's<00:00:44.100> one<00:00:44.280> card<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.579> think<00:00:44.760> I'll<00:00:44.879> getting

advanced<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.660> differently<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.620> think<00:00:46.980> that's

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
advanced and differently I think that's

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.790

all<00:00:47.280> morning<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> really<00:00:48.840> strategic<00:00:49.289> car

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
all morning it is a really strategic car

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.830 
all morning it is a really strategic car
but<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.190> mean<00:00:50.460> it's<00:00:50.640> really<00:00:50.760> way<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.239> talk<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:51.750> a

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
but I mean it's really way to talk on a

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.410 
but I mean it's really way to talk on a
cell<00:00:52.020> phone<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.230> like<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:53.000> limited<00:00:54.000> list<00:00:54.120> I

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
cell phone I like this limited list I

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.980 
cell phone I like this limited list I
actually<00:00:55.110> with<00:00:55.379> kindling

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:55.990 
actually with kindling

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.140 
actually with kindling
and<00:00:56.140> it<00:00:56.920> is<00:00:57.070> using<00:00:57.640> one<00:00:57.730> day<00:00:57.850> but<00:00:58.030> it

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
and it is using one day but it

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.720 
and it is using one day but it
absolutely<00:00:58.660> nuts<00:00:59.230> everyone<00:00:59.800> can<00:00:59.920> agree

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
absolutely nuts everyone can agree

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.460 
absolutely nuts everyone can agree
and<00:01:00.850> I<00:01:01.239> can<00:01:01.450> kind<00:01:01.660> of<00:01:01.720> say

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.080 

that's<00:01:04.950> probably<00:01:05.070> about<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.460> until<00:01:05.700> my<00:01:05.820> loot<00:01:05.970> I

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
that's probably about it until my loot I

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.970 
that's probably about it until my loot I
think<00:01:06.270> they'll<00:01:06.360> put<00:01:06.570> back<00:01:06.720> tinky<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.200> do<00:01:07.350> think

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:07.980 
think they'll put back tinky to do think

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.740 
think they'll put back tinky to do think
they'll<00:01:08.100> put<00:01:08.250> back<00:01:08.400> records<00:01:08.610> you're<00:01:08.850> going<00:01:09.570> to

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
they'll put back records you're going to

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.700 
they'll put back records you're going to
use<00:01:09.900> regular<00:01:10.170> screen<00:01:10.410> is<00:01:10.500> all<00:01:10.620> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
use regular screen is all the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.880 
use regular screen is all the
title-winning<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.370> so<00:01:11.520> it's<00:01:12.300> just<00:01:12.510> not

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
title-winning and so it's just not

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.840 
title-winning and so it's just not

I've heard about global I think that

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.050 
I've heard about global I think that

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
sylvan support what should happen is a

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.819 
sylvan support what should happen is a
dragon<00:01:26.250> sleep<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.640> just<00:01:26.729> go<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.270> need<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.659> go

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
dragon sleep and just go I need to go

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.460 
dragon sleep and just go I need to go
but<00:01:29.090> we<00:01:30.090> know<00:01:30.240> they<00:01:30.390> won't<00:01:30.420> because<00:01:30.960> like<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
but we know they won't because like the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.899 
but we know they won't because like the
ocg<00:01:31.979> has<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> hard-on<00:01:32.549> for<00:01:32.729> them<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.930> mean

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
ocg has a hard-on for them and I mean

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.999 
ocg has a hard-on for them and I mean
one<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.210> neuter<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.080> know<00:01:38.509> but<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.659> think<00:01:40.009> a

one is neuter to know but I think a

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.889

heretic steal from the ashes is probably

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.389 
heretic steal from the ashes is probably
going<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.110> get<00:01:43.170> banned<00:01:43.439> or<00:01:43.649> go<00:01:43.770> down<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.039> one<00:01:44.250> or

really<00:06:06.730> dominating<00:06:07.730> at<00:06:07.850> all<00:06:07.940> so<00:06:08.270> I<00:06:08.330> couldn't

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.510 
really dominating at all so I couldn't

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.450

lead wouldn't hurt and I could see like

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.960 
lead wouldn't hurt and I could see like

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
that would make it i would make it

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.620 
that would make it i would make it

balance it stop the HC k but it was

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.930 
balance it stop the HC k but it was
still<00:06:35.840> hang<00:06:35.930> it<00:06:36.050> good<00:06:36.230> for<00:06:36.920> like<00:06:37.070> stuff<00:06:37.910> that

still hang it good for like stuff that

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.340 
still hang it good for like stuff that
needs<00:06:38.240> to<00:06:38.390> be<00:06:38.510> done<00:06:38.660> you<00:06:39.020> have<00:06:39.110> to<00:06:39.260> do

needs to be done you have to do
something<00:06:39.590> too<00:06:40.070> barfuss<00:06:40.670> morels<00:06:41.210> and<00:06:41.480> I<00:06:41.810> think

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:41.990 
something too barfuss morels and I think

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.840 
something too barfuss morels and I think
bruises<00:06:42.290> like<00:06:42.470> even<00:06:42.740> though<00:06:42.860> they're<00:06:43.340> not<00:06:43.520> the

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:43.850 
bruises like even though they're not the

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.760 
bruises like even though they're not the
best<00:06:44.000> right<00:06:44.300> now<00:06:44.330> they're<00:06:44.840> still<00:06:45.080> just<00:06:45.110> like<00:06:45.680> I

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:45.770 
best right now they're still just like I

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:46.900 
best right now they're still just like I
play<00:06:45.950> morels<00:06:46.280> and<00:06:46.460> that's<00:06:46.640> one<00:06:46.730> of<00:06:46.790> the

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:46.910 
play morels and that's one of the

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:48.460 
play morels and that's one of the
hardest<00:06:46.970> matchups<00:06:47.390> with<00:06:47.540> me<00:06:47.630> fire<00:06:47.900> to<00:06:48.110> spot

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:48.470 
hardest matchups with me fire to spot

removal<00:06:48.830> I<00:06:49.040> do<00:06:49.400> too<00:06:49.670> but<00:06:49.880> I<00:06:49.970> the<00:06:50.030> Colosseum's

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:50.660 
removal I do too but I the Colosseum's

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:51.510 
removal I do too but I the Colosseum's
really

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520

I<00:07:07.160> can<00:07:07.490> also<00:07:07.640> see<00:07:08.030> maybe<00:07:08.840> Amato<00:07:09.200> going<00:07:09.530> to

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:09.770 
I can also see maybe Amato going to

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.740 
I can also see maybe Amato going to
along<00:07:10.220> with<00:07:10.400> three<00:07:10.520> two<00:07:10.730> one<00:07:10.880> and<00:07:11.360> same<00:07:11.600> as

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:11.750 
along with three two one and same as

golf<00:07:11.930> park<00:07:12.170> it's<00:07:12.650> either<00:07:12.800> going<00:07:12.920> to<00:07:12.980> be<00:07:13.040> wolf

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:13.250 
golf park it's either going to be wolf

golf park it's either going to be wolf
parker<00:07:13.520> bear<00:07:13.700> for<00:07:14.300> me<00:07:14.390> to<00:07:14.540> go<00:07:14.660> to<00:07:14.720> one<00:07:14.930> because

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800 
parker bear for me to go to one because

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.320 
parker bear for me to go to one because
those<00:07:15.920> are<00:07:16.040> both<00:07:16.100> very<00:07:16.280> overpowered<00:07:16.790> cards<00:07:17.150> i

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:17.330 
those are both very overpowered cards i

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:18.540 
those are both very overpowered cards i
don't<00:07:17.510> think<00:07:17.570> they<00:07:17.750> would<00:07:17.840> touch<00:07:18.020> wolf<00:07:18.230> clark

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:18.550 
don't think they would touch wolf clark

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:20.650 
don't think they would touch wolf clark
specifically<00:07:19.550> just<00:07:19.850> because<00:07:20.060> fire<00:07:20.270> teams<00:07:20.510> on

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:20.660 
specifically just because fire teams on

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.580 
specifically just because fire teams on
deck<00:07:20.810> so<00:07:21.500> it'd<00:07:22.570> be<00:07:23.570> more<00:07:23.750> likely<00:07:24.110> for<00:07:24.260> them<00:07:24.500> to

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:24.590 
deck so it'd be more likely for them to

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:25.990 
deck so it'd be more likely for them to
quit<00:07:24.740> bear<00:07:24.920> to<00:07:25.040> one<00:07:25.190> just<00:07:25.490> so<00:07:25.580> that<00:07:25.730> way<00:07:25.850> the

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 
quit bear to one just so that way the

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.090 
quit bear to one just so that way the
whole<00:07:26.030> time<00:07:26.180> it's<00:07:26.630> like<00:07:26.690> okay<00:07:27.410> well<00:07:27.650> it's<00:07:27.980> not

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:28.100 
whole time it's like okay well it's not

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.460 
whole time it's like okay well it's not
a<00:07:28.160> payer<00:07:28.400> every<00:07:28.700> turn<00:07:28.910> it's<00:07:29.240> my<00:07:29.720> one<00:07:29.930> bear<00:07:30.170> and

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:30.470 
a payer every turn it's my one bear and

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.900 
a payer every turn it's my one bear and
then<00:07:30.560> I<00:07:30.620> get<00:07:30.830> the<00:07:30.920> wolf<00:07:31.070> park<00:07:31.310> it<00:07:31.430> back<00:07:31.580> and<00:07:31.850> if

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:31.910 
then I get the wolf park it back and if

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.010 
then I get the wolf park it back and if
i<00:07:32.000> can<00:07:32.060> get<00:07:32.210> it<00:07:32.330> so<00:07:32.480> it's<00:07:32.570> going<00:07:32.690> to<00:07:32.750> make<00:07:32.810> call

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:33.020 
i can get it so it's going to make call

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.070 
i can get it so it's going to make call
to<00:07:33.140> wanted<00:07:33.380> to<00:07:33.500> play<00:07:33.670> if<00:07:34.670> that<00:07:34.880> happens<00:07:35.240> other

to wanted to play if that happens other
than<00:07:36.260> that

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:37.940 
than that

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.700 
than that
honestly<00:07:38.720> think<00:07:38.960> that<00:07:39.050> all<00:07:39.290> the<00:07:39.410> dragon

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:39.710 
honestly think that all the dragon

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.040 
honestly think that all the dragon
rulers<00:07:39.950> are<00:07:39.980> going<00:07:40.190> to<00:07:40.250> go<00:07:40.340> back<00:07:40.550> to<00:07:40.760> I<00:07:41.150> wish

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:42.050 
rulers are going to go back to I wish

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:43.240 
rulers are going to go back to I wish
that<00:07:42.170> that<00:07:42.320> would<00:07:42.470> happen<00:07:42.500> it<00:07:42.860> seems<00:07:42.890> really

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:43.250 
that that would happen it seems really

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.490 
that that would happen it seems really
nice<00:07:43.450> we<00:07:44.450> give<00:07:44.630> her<00:07:44.750> any<00:07:44.900> dragons<00:07:45.260> a<00:07:45.320> little

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:45.500 
nice we give her any dragons a little

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.900 
nice we give her any dragons a little
bit<00:07:45.620> of<00:07:45.710> a<00:07:45.770> boost<00:07:45.980> and<00:07:46.310> at<00:07:46.430> the<00:07:46.490> same<00:07:46.640> time<00:07:46.700> I

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:46.910 
bit of a boost and at the same time I

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:47.850 
bit of a boost and at the same time I
mean<00:07:47.180> they're<00:07:47.330> broke

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:47.860 
mean they're broke

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.490 
mean they're broke
so<00:07:48.460> if<00:07:48.520> that<00:07:48.550> happens<00:07:49.000> in<00:07:49.270> faretta<00:07:50.229> king<00:07:50.409> of

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:50.500 
so if that happens in faretta king of

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.469 
so if that happens in faretta king of
Batum<00:07:50.710> needs<00:07:50.919> to<00:07:50.979> go<00:07:51.039> to<00:07:51.099> one<00:07:51.310> or<00:07:51.819> two<00:07:52.060> I<00:07:52.240> can

00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:52.479 
Batum needs to go to one or two I can

00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:54.119 
Batum needs to go to one or two I can
see<00:07:52.569> it<00:07:52.659> going<00:07:52.870> to<00:07:52.930> work<00:07:53.080> as<00:07:53.650> far<00:07:53.860> as<00:07:53.949> where

00:07:54.119 --> 00:07:54.129 
see it going to work as far as where

00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:55.860 
see it going to work as far as where
males<00:07:54.310> go<00:07:54.490> as<00:07:54.639> much<00:07:54.729> as<00:07:54.879> it<00:07:54.969> pains<00:07:55.000> me<00:07:55.360> to<00:07:55.419> say<00:07:55.629> I

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:55.870 
males go as much as it pains me to say I

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.020 
males go as much as it pains me to say I
think<00:07:56.289> this<00:07:56.409> fear<00:07:56.800> or<00:07:57.159> TS<00:07:57.520> is<00:07:57.669> going<00:07:57.819> to<00:07:57.879> go<00:07:57.969> to

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:58.030 
think this fear or TS is going to go to

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.990 
think this fear or TS is going to go to
one<00:07:58.240> or<00:07:58.449> two<00:07:58.800> would<00:07:59.800> that<00:07:59.979> happen<00:08:00.129> the<00:08:00.310> ICC<00:08:00.580> DTD

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:01.000 
one or two would that happen the ICC DTD

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.740 
one or two would that happen the ICC DTD
but<00:08:01.180> going<00:08:01.300> up<00:08:01.509> to<00:08:01.629> two

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:03.750 
but going up to two

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.570 
but going up to two
so<00:08:04.350> many<00:08:04.530> so<00:08:04.770> many<00:08:04.830> different<00:08:05.100> things<00:08:05.280> and<00:08:05.460> if

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:05.580 
so many so many different things and if

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.250 
so many so many different things and if
this<00:08:05.700> happens<00:08:06.120> and<00:08:06.330> X<00:08:06.480> happens<00:08:06.930> and<00:08:07.080> then<00:08:07.170> we

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:07.260 
this happens and X happens and then we

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:07.820 
this happens and X happens and then we
just<00:08:07.410> had

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:07.830 
just had

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.410 
just had
 up<00:08:08.280> tree<00:08:08.550> of<00:08:08.700> just<00:08:08.940> like<00:08:09.090> evo

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:09.420 
 up tree of just like evo

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.110 
 up tree of just like evo
eventually<00:08:09.930> all

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:11.120 
eventually all

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.780 
eventually all
each<00:08:11.210> other<00:08:11.360> it's<00:08:11.570> crazy
