00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
during this presentation I'm going to

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.740 
during this presentation I'm going to
demonstrate<00:00:02.280> how<00:00:02.730> you<00:00:02.760> can<00:00:03.000> sync<00:00:03.300> between<00:00:03.540> AI

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
demonstrate how you can sync between AI

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.010 
demonstrate how you can sync between AI
thoughts<00:00:04.170> and<00:00:04.500> Omni<00:00:04.950> outliner<00:00:05.600> so<00:00:06.600> if<00:00:06.690> we<00:00:06.810> open

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
thoughts and Omni outliner so if we open

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.879 
thoughts and Omni outliner so if we open
up<00:00:07.080> our<00:00:07.230> thoughts<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:07.919> create<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.790> quick<00:00:09.030> map

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889 
up our thoughts and create a quick map

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:15.799 
up our thoughts and create a quick map
call<00:00:10.889> it<00:00:11.010> Omni<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:12.349> we'll<00:00:13.349> create<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:14.809> new

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
call it Omni and we'll create a new

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.040 
call it Omni and we'll create a new
child<00:00:16.230> topic<00:00:16.560> idea<00:00:17.100> one<00:00:17.369> an<00:00:17.850> idea<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.510> an<00:00:18.750> idea

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
child topic idea one an idea to an idea

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.090 
child topic idea one an idea to an idea
three<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:20.130> then<00:00:20.970> under<00:00:21.330> idea<00:00:21.689> three<00:00:22.109> we'll

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
three and then under idea three we'll

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.910 
three and then under idea three we'll
create<00:00:23.939> some<00:00:24.029> more<00:00:24.210> subtopics<00:00:24.810> just<00:00:25.529> idea

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
create some more subtopics just idea

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:33.440 
create some more subtopics just idea
idea<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.580> idea<00:00:29.269> then<00:00:30.269> we'll<00:00:31.759> select<00:00:32.759> idea<00:00:33.180> one

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
idea and idea then we'll select idea one

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.360 
idea and idea then we'll select idea one
and<00:00:33.719> then<00:00:33.840> open<00:00:34.170> up<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:35.210> notes<00:00:36.210> window<00:00:37.370> once

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
and then open up the notes window once

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.690 
and then open up the notes window once
we've<00:00:38.550> tidied<00:00:38.790> up<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.030> map<00:00:40.280> so<00:00:41.280> if<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:41.430> open<00:00:41.640> up

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
we've tidied up the map so if we open up

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.580 
we've tidied up the map so if we open up
the<00:00:41.820> notes<00:00:42.000> window<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.629> then<00:00:42.870> enter<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.320> note

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
the notes window and then enter a note

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.779 
the notes window and then enter a note
against<00:00:44.010> idea<00:00:44.280> one<00:00:48.739> and<00:00:49.739> if<00:00:49.890> we<00:00:50.039> select<00:00:50.219> idea

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
against idea one and if we select idea

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.670 
against idea one and if we select idea
two<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.510> we'll<00:00:51.960> assign<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.969> web<00:00:53.969> link<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.239> that

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
two and we'll assign a web link to that

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.700 
two and we'll assign a web link to that
so<00:00:55.730> WWI<00:00:56.730> thoughts<00:00:57.270> coda<00:00:57.719> okay<00:01:00.530> then<00:01:01.530> what

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
so WWI thoughts coda okay then what

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.740 
so WWI thoughts coda okay then what
we're<00:01:01.829> going<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.039> do<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.520> save<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:02.940> up<00:01:03.420> to

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
we're going to do is save this up to

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.920 
we're going to do is save this up to
Dropbox<00:01:04.339> so<00:01:05.339> if<00:01:05.400> we<00:01:05.489> make<00:01:05.700> sure<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.180> OPML

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
Dropbox so if we make sure that the OPML

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.399 
Dropbox so if we make sure that the OPML
format<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:08.040> enabled<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.630> what<00:01:09.840> Omni

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
format is enabled this is what Omni

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.250 
format is enabled this is what Omni
outliner<00:01:10.770> can<00:01:10.950> read<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.479> then<00:01:12.479> we'll<00:01:12.659> go<00:01:12.869> send

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
outliner can read and then we'll go send

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.240 
outliner can read and then we'll go send
to<00:01:13.530> Dropbox<00:01:14.210> in<00:01:15.210> OPML<00:01:15.990> format<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.740> we'll<00:01:16.950> save

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
to Dropbox in OPML format and we'll save

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.770 
to Dropbox in OPML format and we'll save
it<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.520> our<00:01:17.610> shared<00:01:17.970> folder<00:01:20.330> okay<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.390> that's

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
it in our shared folder okay so that's

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.950 
it in our shared folder okay so that's
exported<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.830> uploaded<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.610> Dropbox<00:01:23.810> if<00:01:24.810> we

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
exported and uploaded to Dropbox if we

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.060 
exported and uploaded to Dropbox if we
now<00:01:25.140> open<00:01:25.740> up<00:01:25.830> our<00:01:26.280> Dropbox<00:01:26.909> folder<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:28.070> Omni

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
now open up our Dropbox folder in Omni

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.550 
now open up our Dropbox folder in Omni
outliner<00:01:29.450> there<00:01:30.450> we<00:01:30.540> can<00:01:30.689> see<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.840> file<00:01:31.140> Omni

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
outliner there we can see the file Omni

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.270 
outliner there we can see the file Omni
to<00:01:31.680> OPML<00:01:32.960> we<00:01:33.960> open<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.259> there<00:01:34.710> we<00:01:34.829> have<00:01:34.950> Omni

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
to OPML we open that there we have Omni

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.410 
to OPML we open that there we have Omni
outliner<00:01:35.640> has<00:01:36.030> opened<00:01:36.780> up<00:01:37.610> that<00:01:38.610> map<00:01:39.030> as<00:01:39.270> an

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
outliner has opened up that map as an

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.020 
outliner has opened up that map as an
outline<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.049> we<00:01:40.829> can<00:01:40.979> see<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.820> notes

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
outline so we can see the the notes

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.359 
outline so we can see the the notes
field<00:01:42.329> there<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.810> we<00:01:43.560> can<00:01:43.710> see<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.979> web<00:01:44.130> link

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.340 
field there and we can see the web link
and<00:01:44.520> idea<00:01:45.450> one<00:01:45.720> two<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.290> three<00:01:47.720> if<00:01:48.720> we<00:01:48.869> now<00:01:49.049> add

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
and idea one two and three if we now add

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.719 
and idea one two and three if we now add
an<00:01:49.710> idea<00:01:50.009> for<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.720> Omni<00:01:51.720> outliner<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.729> save

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
an idea for in Omni outliner and save

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.490 
an idea for in Omni outliner and save
that<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.750> will<00:01:54.869> save<00:01:55.140> back<00:01:55.470> up<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:56.130> Dropbox

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
that that will save back up to Dropbox

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.600 
that that will save back up to Dropbox
now<00:01:58.500> we<00:01:58.560> can<00:01:58.770> go<00:01:58.860> back<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.100> our<00:01:59.219> thoughts<00:01:59.670> and

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
now we can go back to our thoughts and

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.170 
now we can go back to our thoughts and
select<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:03.570> redownload<00:02:04.350> from<00:02:04.979> Dropbox<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:06.119> if

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
select to redownload from Dropbox so if

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.690 
select to redownload from Dropbox so if
we<00:02:06.299> redownload<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.140> opml<00:02:07.590> file<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:08.580> will

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
we redownload that opml file that will

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.600 
we redownload that opml file that will
download<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.479> open<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.959> in<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.259> thoughts

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
download it and open it in I thoughts

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.360 
download it and open it in I thoughts
and<00:02:11.610> here<00:02:11.970> we<00:02:12.090> can<00:02:12.209> see<00:02:12.390> that's<00:02:12.540> now<00:02:12.720> pulled<00:02:13.020> in

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
and here we can see that's now pulled in

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.440 
and here we can see that's now pulled in
idea<00:02:13.730> for<00:02:15.519> so<00:02:16.519> that<00:02:16.640> demonstrates<00:02:17.180> how<00:02:17.269> you

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
idea for so that demonstrates how you

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.780 
idea for so that demonstrates how you
can<00:02:17.780> use<00:02:18.080> Omni<00:02:18.530> outliner<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.159> I<00:02:19.519> thought

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
can use Omni outliner and I thought

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.380 
can use Omni outliner and I thought
together<00:02:20.209> with<00:02:20.510> Dropbox<00:02:21.019> to<00:02:22.060> sync<00:02:23.060> up<00:02:23.209> your
