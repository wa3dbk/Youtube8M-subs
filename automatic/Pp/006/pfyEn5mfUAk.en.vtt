Hey Class, this is our video called "Feel the Burn," its about Cellular Respiration."  Oh yea.  1, 2, 3, 4.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Feel the Burn!

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:57.000
In the presence of my oxygen.  Oh, I release my energy, by breaking down food molecules.  What I'd like to begin here.  Oh.  Is the process of cellular respiration. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.100
Feel the Burn!   

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Feel the Burn!  

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Glycolysis has only small amounts of energy.  But when Oxygen is there it has 2 pathways it can choose.  When this occurs a large amount of energies released.  The paths are called the Krebs Cycle &amp; electron transport chain.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Feel the Burn!

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Feel the Burn!

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Pyruvic acid passes to the second stage of this.  Its also known as the Krebs Cycle.  Oh.  Pyruvic acid broken down to carbon dioxide.  In a series of reactions taking energy away. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Feel the burn!

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Feel the Burn!

00:02:49.000 --> 00:03:23.000
When A.T.P. is made it gives away 2 molecules (of CO2).  But in return 4 new ones (carbon atoms) just alike, are made again.  When NAD+ takes a pair of high energy electrons.  The NADH passes energy to other pathways in the cell from glucose.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Feel the Burn!

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Feel the Burn!

00:03:40.000 --> 00:04:10.000
But when O2 is not around a funny thing occurs.  The cell converts NADH to NAD+.  By passing back electrons to pyruvic acid.  This occurs all in the name of fermentation.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Feel the Burn!

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Feel the Burn!   

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Feel the Burn!   

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:48.000
I feel the burn oh baby....Feel the burn, feel the burn.  Oh feel the burn oh feel it oh yea.  Feel the burn.  Are you feeling it yet?  Feel it!
