00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:15.849
 by the way, from our streaming jury who 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.880
 Fruit straps you can do the whole thing 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:21.849

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.579
 directly to the readme linked with the 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.329
 reviews on ketscher blaser point ch 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.669
 definitely have a look 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:35.280
 today we have the samsung further 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:38.800
 audio dock that more precisely that dab 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.449
 750 in the review and what the whole thing is 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.579
 Let's take a look 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:45.480
 a little closer 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:49.510
 speak of the optics forth in the clear coat 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.609
 kept so modern but still like 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.989
 Show thing in detail with the 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:56.350
 reinforce the tubes 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.839
 a very very retro stylish device 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.140
 Generally it looks really hot 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:05.350
 the front two speakers with 20 each 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:09.900
 watt performance down is still one 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.900
 subwoofer with 60 watts of power installed 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.550
 Everything is controlled here 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.950
 this circle speaks here are two 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.340
 buttons plusminus guide the volume 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.470
 play break and the more functional the 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.180
 take a closer look 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.170
 but I 'll come to it first 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.900
 the cool retro tube amp this 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.790
 animals in it all maybe if the 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.680
 smaller children do not necessarily have in 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.040
 keep it close because it is quite warm 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.340
 in here the lights are colored while 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:46.150
 the operation of said as the two 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.190
 speaker and then we want the whole thing 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.020
 still from the back look the back 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.840
 you have on the right side 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:57.220
 all the connections from 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.350
 internet and usb port the wps button 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.580
 Speak for the connect with the iphone 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.980
 with 1 with samsung gadgets and other 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:09.099
 quite simple and next to it is the 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.170
 jack input and this one 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.749
 is simply intended for their service as 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.550
 you have nothing to do with it or could 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:18.120
 not with this 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.830
 make down power plug must of course 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.820
 also be that whole wants with electricity 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.800
 be supplied 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.800
 and here it comes 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:31.080
 unique feature of the docks behind 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:33.510
 shit and there comes out that is called 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.490
 here you can not just iphone 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.000
 plug in no there is also the 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:42.980
 possibility of samsung device only that 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.840
 whole looks as I said a bit 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:51.330
 wobbly is out but not drive out 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.310
 plug it in and has a rear 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.020
 support can not speak that either 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.510
 just be canceled like that 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.170
 the same thing works with the 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.510
 iphone 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:06.360
 Simply put in here that was 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.550
 go a bit shaky thing 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.920
 We it the cool is back up here 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:15.210
 yes as I said that it is not only samsung 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:18.480
 devices and apple devices can be stuck 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:22.470
 smartphone as well as tablets at the samsung 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.300
 the galaxy s2 is the emergency as well as the 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.360
 tablet which you have this on 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:30.630
 could put phone ipod touch and ipad 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.690
 you can plug in apple devices 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:37.020
 but this is about streaming 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.870
 devices you can on the one hand via airplay 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.660
 go from the iphone from the ipad ipod touch 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.239
 or mac out and serve the whole thing 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.790
 samsung has an app for you 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.880
 you can download and then you can download 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.980
 her about samsung's all play the whole 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.530
 Streaming is basically something 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.090
 Actual like the airplay only that it 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.300
 News from the app 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.989
 works and at ios everyone has the 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:07.830
 possibility from anywhere on the system 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:10.140
 airplay enabled devices to go and the 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.570
 Third possibility is it should not 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.610
 Apple and no Samsung device will be there 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:18.239
