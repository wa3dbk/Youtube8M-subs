normally<00:00:06.160> late<00:00:07.160> March<00:00:07.460> the<00:00:07.700> fish<00:00:07.880> should<00:00:08.029> be

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.170 
normally late March the fish should be

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.020 
normally late March the fish should be
full-blown<00:00:09.170> spawning<00:00:10.010> and<00:00:11.230> this<00:00:12.230> week

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.030 
full-blown spawning and this week

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.000 
full-blown spawning and this week
because<00:00:14.030> of<00:00:14.150> that<00:00:14.240> cold<00:00:14.540> weather<00:00:14.840> we<00:00:15.410> actually

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
because of that cold weather we actually

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.130 
because of that cold weather we actually
had<00:00:16.129> a<00:00:16.160> cold<00:00:16.490> front<00:00:16.699> that<00:00:16.820> came<00:00:16.970> through<00:00:17.029> and<00:00:17.510> I

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
had a cold front that came through and I

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.689 
had a cold front that came through and I
think<00:00:18.500> it<00:00:18.590> pushed<00:00:18.800> some<00:00:19.130> of<00:00:19.189> those<00:00:19.250> fish<00:00:19.490> off

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
think it pushed some of those fish off

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:21.819 
think it pushed some of those fish off
that<00:00:19.970> we're<00:00:20.179> about<00:00:20.419> to<00:00:20.599> spawn<00:00:20.869> there's

00:00:21.819 --> 00:00:21.829 
that we're about to spawn there's

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:24.339 
that we're about to spawn there's
definitely<00:00:22.130> a<00:00:22.159> few<00:00:22.310> up<00:00:22.460> there<00:00:22.669> but<00:00:23.320> what<00:00:24.320> I

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
definitely a few up there but what I

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.870 
definitely a few up there but what I
found<00:00:24.769> is<00:00:25.550> that<00:00:26.539> I<00:00:26.839> could<00:00:27.050> run<00:00:27.310> the<00:00:28.310> outside

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
found is that I could run the outside

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.870 
found is that I could run the outside
edges<00:00:29.119> of<00:00:29.619> this<00:00:30.619> graph<00:00:30.679> so<00:00:31.369> now<00:00:31.609> right<00:00:31.819> here

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
edges of this graph so now right here

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.000 
edges of this graph so now right here
I'm<00:00:32.329> fishing<00:00:32.509> it's<00:00:32.780> like<00:00:32.840> a<00:00:32.960> hay<00:00:33.230> grass<00:00:33.530> and

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
I'm fishing it's like a hay grass and

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.299 
I'm fishing it's like a hay grass and
there's<00:00:34.760> some<00:00:35.000> wood<00:00:35.270> there's<00:00:35.690> a<00:00:35.750> few<00:00:35.930> sticks

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309 
there's some wood there's a few sticks

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.459 
there's some wood there's a few sticks
what<00:00:37.309> I<00:00:37.340> was<00:00:37.550> doing<00:00:37.820> is<00:00:37.940> I<00:00:38.030> was<00:00:38.090> taking<00:00:38.239> the<00:00:39.489> 1.5

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:41.469 
what I was doing is I was taking the 1.5

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.880 
what I was doing is I was taking the 1.5
DRS<00:00:42.469> and<00:00:42.500> running<00:00:43.340> these<00:00:43.489> edges<00:00:44.320> and<00:00:45.320> it's<00:00:45.679> not

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
DRS and running these edges and it's not

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.700 
DRS and running these edges and it's not
outside<00:00:46.129> it<00:00:46.519> I<00:00:46.550> mean<00:00:46.910> I'm<00:00:47.149> saying<00:00:47.629> outside<00:00:48.350> we

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
outside it I mean I'm saying outside we

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.169 
outside it I mean I'm saying outside we
have<00:00:48.800> a<00:00:48.829> shoreline<00:00:49.129> grass<00:00:49.579> and<00:00:49.940> then<00:00:50.059> I'm

00:00:50.169 --> 00:00:50.179 
have a shoreline grass and then I'm

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:52.060 
have a shoreline grass and then I'm
fishing<00:00:50.480> that<00:00:50.600> the<00:00:51.079> edge<00:00:51.469> of<00:00:51.679> that<00:00:51.769> shoreline

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
fishing that the edge of that shoreline

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.259 
fishing that the edge of that shoreline
grass<00:00:53.859> and<00:00:54.859> what<00:00:55.129> I<00:00:55.160> found<00:00:55.429> is<00:00:55.699> those<00:00:55.999> fish

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
grass and what I found is those fish

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:00.910 
grass and what I found is those fish
that<00:00:57.999> we're<00:00:58.999> about<00:00:59.179> ready<00:00:59.420> to<00:00:59.600> spawn<00:00:59.870> or<00:01:00.469> were

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
that we're about ready to spawn or were

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.189 
that we're about ready to spawn or were
spawning<00:01:01.309> and<00:01:01.699> they<00:01:01.909> just<00:01:02.300> backed<00:01:02.570> out<00:01:02.839> there

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
spawning and they just backed out there

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:04.930 
spawning and they just backed out there
on<00:01:03.350> that<00:01:03.379> you<00:01:04.100> know<00:01:04.159> they're<00:01:04.309> holding<00:01:04.519> just

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
on that you know they're holding just

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.110 
on that you know they're holding just
off<00:01:05.150> the<00:01:05.330> bank<00:01:05.570> and<00:01:06.050> what<00:01:06.860> I<00:01:06.920> could<00:01:07.130> do<00:01:07.310> is<00:01:07.490> you

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
off the bank and what I could do is you

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.760 
off the bank and what I could do is you
know<00:01:08.210> run<00:01:08.450> a<00:01:08.480> lot<00:01:08.720> of<00:01:08.870> Bank<00:01:09.050> with<00:01:09.320> with<00:01:09.590> this

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
know run a lot of Bank with with this

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.120 
know run a lot of Bank with with this
1.5<00:01:10.840> and<00:01:11.840> catch<00:01:12.260> them<00:01:12.500> and<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:12.680> reason<00:01:12.980> why<00:01:13.100> I

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
1.5 and catch them and the reason why I

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.090 
1.5 and catch them and the reason why I
went<00:01:13.370> with<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.610> DRS<00:01:13.940> is<00:01:14.390> that<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:15.650> water's

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
went with the DRS is that the water's

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.640 
went with the DRS is that the water's
fairly<00:01:16.790> stained<00:01:17.120> and<00:01:17.450> so<00:01:17.930> I'm<00:01:18.110> throwing<00:01:18.530> a

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
fairly stained and so I'm throwing a

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.190 
fairly stained and so I'm throwing a
chartreuse<00:01:19.010> shad<00:01:19.340> so<00:01:20.300> you<00:01:20.720> know<00:01:20.810> a<00:01:20.870> little<00:01:21.080> bit

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
chartreuse shad so you know a little bit

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.870 
chartreuse shad so you know a little bit
brighter<00:01:21.350> bait<00:01:21.710> but<00:01:22.010> I<00:01:22.040> wanted<00:01:22.370> that<00:01:22.460> nock

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
brighter bait but I wanted that nock

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.670 
brighter bait but I wanted that nock
just<00:01:23.210> to<00:01:23.300> add<00:01:23.420> a<00:01:23.450> little<00:01:23.690> bit<00:01:23.810> of<00:01:23.990> commotion<00:01:24.350> to

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
just to add a little bit of commotion to

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.340 
just to add a little bit of commotion to
it<00:01:24.770> those<00:01:24.980> fish<00:01:25.190> could<00:01:25.340> find<00:01:25.580> it<00:01:25.700> better<00:01:29.350> but

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
it those fish could find it better but

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.950 
it those fish could find it better but
basically<00:01:30.920> what<00:01:31.490> I<00:01:31.520> do<00:01:31.640> is<00:01:31.820> just<00:01:32.180> you<00:01:32.660> know<00:01:32.750> run

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
basically what I do is just you know run

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.600 
basically what I do is just you know run
Bank<00:01:33.260> and<00:01:33.500> I<00:01:33.530> found<00:01:33.770> areas<00:01:34.160> that<00:01:34.280> were<00:01:34.400> holding

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
Bank and I found areas that were holding

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.000 
Bank and I found areas that were holding
fish<00:01:35.020> and<00:01:36.020> it<00:01:36.320> was<00:01:36.470> interesting<00:01:36.980> because

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
fish and it was interesting because

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.860 
fish and it was interesting because
you'd<00:01:37.550> fish<00:01:37.790> a<00:01:37.820> lot<00:01:38.090> of<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:38.240> same<00:01:38.420> stuff<00:01:38.660> and

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
you'd fish a lot of the same stuff and

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.080 
you'd fish a lot of the same stuff and
not<00:01:38.990> catching<00:01:39.380> anything

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
not catching anything

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.640 
not catching anything
and<00:01:41.090> then<00:01:41.600> all<00:01:41.750> sudden<00:01:41.990> you<00:01:42.080> get<00:01:42.200> in<00:01:42.350> an<00:01:42.410> area

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
and then all sudden you get in an area

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.730 
and then all sudden you get in an area
and<00:01:42.740> you<00:01:42.830> get<00:01:43.040> a<00:01:43.070> couple<00:01:43.400> bites<00:01:44.410> and<00:01:45.410> what<00:01:45.710> I

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
and you get a couple bites and what I

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.350 
and you get a couple bites and what I
was<00:01:45.920> able<00:01:46.010> to<00:01:46.190> do<00:01:46.370> is<00:01:46.580> is<00:01:46.820> go<00:01:47.120> back<00:01:47.330> and

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
was able to do is is go back and

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.610 
was able to do is is go back and
duplicate<00:01:47.930> that<00:01:48.080> I'd<00:01:48.260> go<00:01:48.410> to<00:01:48.470> those<00:01:48.680> areas<00:01:50.620> and

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
duplicate that I'd go to those areas and

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.160 
duplicate that I'd go to those areas and
catch<00:01:51.890> fish<00:01:52.070> again<00:01:52.370> and<00:01:52.520> just<00:01:52.580> seemed<00:01:52.850> like

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
catch fish again and just seemed like

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
catch fish again and just seemed like
when<00:01:54.170> you<00:01:54.260> got<00:01:54.410> around<00:01:54.740> them<00:01:54.920> you'd<00:01:55.070> have

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
when you got around them you'd have

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.070 
when you got around them you'd have
multiple<00:01:55.730> bites<00:01:55.940> they<00:01:56.240> were<00:01:56.300> really<00:01:56.720> grouped

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
multiple bites they were really grouped

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.140 
multiple bites they were really grouped
up<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:58.780> that<00:01:59.780> Drs<00:02:00.790> helped<00:02:01.790> me<00:02:01.880> to<00:02:01.970> actually

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
up and that Drs helped me to actually

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.070 
up and that Drs helped me to actually
find<00:02:02.390> those<00:02:02.840> areas<00:02:03.140> and<00:02:03.890> go<00:02:04.400> back<00:02:04.640> and

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
find those areas and go back and

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.779 
find those areas and go back and
capitalize<00:02:06.080> on<00:02:06.110> those<00:02:06.470> in<00:02:06.620> the<00:02:06.710> tournament

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.729 

little<00:02:10.789> one

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
little one

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:19.110 
little one
thing<00:02:12.280> that's<00:02:12.400> barely<00:02:12.640> bigger<00:02:12.909> than<00:02:13.000> 1.5<00:02:18.120> but

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
thing that's barely bigger than 1.5 but

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.580 
thing that's barely bigger than 1.5 but
the<00:02:19.209> thing<00:02:19.390> about<00:02:19.420> this<00:02:19.840> is<00:02:20.019> that<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.319> these

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
the thing about this is that the these

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.640 
the thing about this is that the these
fish<00:02:20.890> were<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:22.420> can't<00:02:22.689> really<00:02:22.930> see<00:02:23.470> what

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
fish were you can't really see what

fish were you can't really see what
they're<00:02:23.799> targeting<00:02:24.220> on<00:02:24.340> other<00:02:24.610> than<00:02:24.819> just

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030

they're targeting on other than just
edges<00:02:25.599> of<00:02:25.780> grass<00:02:26.349> and<00:02:26.799> there's<00:02:26.920> a<00:02:27.010> few<00:02:27.159> stumps

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
edges of grass and there's a few stumps

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.490 
edges of grass and there's a few stumps
and<00:02:27.790> things<00:02:28.030> but<00:02:28.269> see<00:02:29.170> that<00:02:29.319> right<00:02:29.470> there

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
and things but see that right there

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.380 
and things but see that right there
there's<00:02:30.129> some<00:02:30.400> of<00:02:30.489> that<00:02:30.609> there's<00:02:30.909> a<00:02:31.120> shoreline

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
there's some of that there's a shoreline

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.410 
there's some of that there's a shoreline

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
hey grass but you can't see the target

Sun throwing to you meaning I could not

pick up a worm or jig and fish slow to
catch<00:02:43.209> those<00:02:43.480> those<00:02:43.870> fish<00:02:44.139> what<00:02:44.590> I<00:02:44.620> had<00:02:44.829> to<00:02:44.920> do

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
catch those those fish what I had to do

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.940 
catch those those fish what I had to do
is<00:02:45.310> come<00:02:46.209> into<00:02:46.389> these<00:02:46.540> areas<00:02:46.959> and<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.409> what<00:02:47.920> I

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
is come into these areas and and what I

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.789 
is come into these areas and and what I
would<00:02:48.159> actually<00:02:48.370> do<00:02:48.760> is<00:02:49.079> in<00:02:50.079> there<00:02:50.409> is<00:02:50.590> where<00:02:50.769> I

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
would actually do is in there is where I

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.949 
would actually do is in there is where I
found<00:02:52.019> you<00:02:53.019> that<00:02:53.200> were<00:02:53.290> more<00:02:53.470> productive<00:02:54.959> you

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
found you that were more productive you

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.569 
found you that were more productive you
would<00:02:56.260> think<00:02:56.500> that<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:56.920> know<00:02:57.010> in<00:02:57.099> a<00:02:57.159> typical

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
would think that you know in a typical

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.729 
would think that you know in a typical
situation<00:02:57.930> I'd<00:02:58.930> go<00:02:59.230> through<00:02:59.439> with<00:02:59.680> the

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
situation I'd go through with the

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.800 
situation I'd go through with the
reaction<00:03:00.159> bait<00:03:00.310> like<00:03:00.459> this<00:03:00.700> would<00:03:01.180> that<00:03:01.420> that

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
reaction bait like this would that that

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.640 
reaction bait like this would that that
DRS<00:03:02.379> and<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:03.430> make<00:03:04.389> one<00:03:04.689> quick<00:03:04.989> pass<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.530> get

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
DRS and and make one quick pass and get

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.589 
DRS and and make one quick pass and get
out<00:03:05.799> of<00:03:05.920> there<00:03:06.040> but<00:03:06.280> what<00:03:06.819> I've<00:03:07.000> noticed<00:03:07.269> that

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
out of there but what I've noticed that

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.259 
out of there but what I've noticed that
I<00:03:07.629> had<00:03:07.810> to<00:03:07.959> do<00:03:08.139> is<00:03:08.400> is<00:03:09.400> go<00:03:09.579> through<00:03:09.909> those<00:03:10.060> areas

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
I had to do is is go through those areas

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.960 
I had to do is is go through those areas
and<00:03:10.689> fish<00:03:11.500> it<00:03:11.650> just<00:03:11.680> a<00:03:11.950> little<00:03:12.220> bit<00:03:12.340> slower<00:03:12.670> you

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
and fish it just a little bit slower you

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.759 
and fish it just a little bit slower you
know<00:03:13.120> fish<00:03:13.329> the<00:03:13.450> bait<00:03:13.629> fast<00:03:13.930> like<00:03:14.349> I<00:03:14.709> normally

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
know fish the bait fast like I normally

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.550 
know fish the bait fast like I normally
would<00:03:15.269> but<00:03:16.269> fish<00:03:16.510> its<00:03:16.660> lowers<00:03:17.019> and<00:03:17.260> making

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
would but fish its lowers and making

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.500 
would but fish its lowers and making
moles<00:03:17.799> will<00:03:18.099> cache<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.609> areas<00:03:18.940> or<00:03:19.150> I<00:03:19.209> could

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
moles will cache the areas or I could

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.080 
moles will cache the areas or I could
I'd<00:03:19.629> make<00:03:19.870> a<00:03:19.900> pass<00:03:20.169> through<00:03:20.530> and<00:03:20.769> I<00:03:21.730> turn<00:03:21.970> I

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
I'd make a pass through and I turn I

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.110 
I'd make a pass through and I turn I
come<00:03:22.269> right<00:03:22.449> back<00:03:22.599> it<00:03:22.840> again<00:03:23.079> and<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.970> know<00:03:25.090> I

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
come right back it again and you know I

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.899 
come right back it again and you know I
could<00:03:25.329> go<00:03:25.449> down<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.930> stretch<00:03:26.230> and<00:03:26.609> not<00:03:27.609> get<00:03:27.879> a

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 
could go down the stretch and not get a

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:31.140 
could go down the stretch and not get a
bite<00:03:28.120> and<00:03:28.419> come<00:03:28.659> back<00:03:28.870> and<00:03:29.139> catch<00:03:29.290> to<00:03:29.590> and<00:03:30.220> you

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
bite and come back and catch to and you

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.069 
bite and come back and catch to and you
know<00:03:31.299> or<00:03:32.549> go<00:03:33.549> through<00:03:33.879> and<00:03:34.150> and<00:03:34.540> make<00:03:34.840> multiple

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
know or go through and and make multiple

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.319 
know or go through and and make multiple
casts<00:03:35.470> multiple<00:03:35.919> casts<00:03:36.099> and<00:03:36.489> you<00:03:37.180> know<00:03:37.269> I'd

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
casts multiple casts and you know I'd

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.530 
casts multiple casts and you know I'd
see<00:03:37.629> maybe<00:03:37.870> one<00:03:38.169> target<00:03:38.680> or<00:03:38.769> I'd<00:03:39.090> feel<00:03:40.090> a<00:03:40.120> stump

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
see maybe one target or I'd feel a stump

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.449 
see maybe one target or I'd feel a stump
down<00:03:40.750> there<00:03:41.019> that<00:03:41.280> you<00:03:42.280> know<00:03:42.370> the

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
down there that you know the

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.219 
down there that you know the
one-point-five<00:03:43.120> would<00:03:43.299> balance<00:03:43.449> off<00:03:43.750> of<00:03:43.989> and

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:44.229 
one-point-five would balance off of and

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:46.319 
one-point-five would balance off of and
I'd<00:03:44.680> make<00:03:44.949> another<00:03:45.250> cast<00:03:45.489> to<00:03:45.729> it<00:03:45.760> invited<00:03:46.269> on

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
I'd make another cast to it invited on

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:47.750 
I'd make another cast to it invited on
the<00:03:46.419> next<00:03:46.599> -<00:03:46.659> there's<00:03:46.810> one<00:03:46.930> right<00:03:47.199> there

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
the next - there's one right there

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.210 
the next - there's one right there
little<00:03:48.760> guy<00:03:50.310> little<00:03:51.310> guy<00:03:51.699> Oh<00:03:52.799> any<00:03:53.799> stuck<00:03:54.040> on<00:03:54.190> a

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.940 

so<00:03:59.400> just<00:03:59.700> making<00:04:00.030> repeated<00:04:00.900> cast<00:04:01.349> instead<00:04:01.860> of

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
so just making repeated cast instead of

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.410 
so just making repeated cast instead of
just<00:04:02.040> burning<00:04:02.459> through<00:04:02.489> that<00:04:02.819> Bank<00:04:03.090> real

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
just burning through that Bank real

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.770 
just burning through that Bank real
quick<00:04:04.459> I'm<00:04:05.459> fishing<00:04:05.819> the<00:04:06.030> bait<00:04:06.209> quick<00:04:06.480> but<00:04:06.689> I'm

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
quick I'm fishing the bait quick but I'm

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.240 
quick I'm fishing the bait quick but I'm
covering<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.230> water<00:04:07.409> you<00:04:07.620> know<00:04:07.709> really

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
covering the water you know really

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.309 
covering the water you know really
fishing<00:04:08.489> it<00:04:08.700> thorough<00:04:08.939> that's<00:04:09.780> a<00:04:09.900> little<00:04:10.110> and

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
fishing it thorough that's a little and

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.210 
fishing it thorough that's a little and
that<00:04:10.439> wouldn't<00:04:10.650> really<00:04:10.739> help<00:04:10.950> in<00:04:11.129> the

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
that wouldn't really help in the

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:18.110 
that wouldn't really help in the
tournament<00:04:11.579> but<00:04:12.709> you<00:04:13.709> know<00:04:13.799> the<00:04:14.159> 1.5<00:04:15.030> DRS<00:04:17.120> what

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
tournament but you know the 1.5 DRS what

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.699 
tournament but you know the 1.5 DRS what
was<00:04:18.329> the<00:04:18.479> trick<00:04:18.750> for<00:04:18.930> catching<00:04:19.530> these<00:04:19.650> fish

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
was the trick for catching these fish

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.830 
was the trick for catching these fish
and<00:04:20.280> this<00:04:20.669> type<00:04:20.880> of<00:04:20.910> cover<00:04:21.180> right<00:04:21.449> here<00:04:21.720> a

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
and this type of cover right here a

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.900 
and this type of cover right here a
little<00:04:21.959> bit<00:04:22.139> more<00:04:22.320> open<00:04:22.650> water<00:04:22.800> a<00:04:23.220> little<00:04:23.820> bit

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
little bit more open water a little bit

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.050 
little bit more open water a little bit
more<00:04:24.090> of<00:04:24.180> a<00:04:24.270> defined<00:04:24.630> edge<00:04:25.789> something<00:04:26.789> like<00:04:26.910> it

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
more of a defined edge something like it

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.000 
more of a defined edge something like it
kind<00:04:27.270> of<00:04:27.300> sit<00:04:27.539> out<00:04:27.690> off<00:04:27.900> and<00:04:28.199> make<00:04:28.770> multiple

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
kind of sit out off and make multiple

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.969 
kind of sit out off and make multiple
casts<00:04:29.580> down<00:04:29.729> there<00:04:30.530> that's<00:04:31.530> that<00:04:31.770> right<00:04:31.919> there

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
casts down there that's that right there

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:35.180 
casts down there that's that right there

is a you know stump that you know I
couldn't<00:04:35.490> see<00:04:35.760> this<00:04:36.320> but<00:04:37.320> these<00:04:37.440> are<00:04:37.650> the

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
couldn't see this but these are the

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.320 
couldn't see this but these are the
targets<00:04:38.100> that<00:04:38.130> I<00:04:38.220> catch<00:04:38.550> those<00:04:38.729> fish<00:04:38.760> on<00:04:39.120> that

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
targets that I catch those fish on that

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.240 
targets that I catch those fish on that
if<00:04:39.630> I<00:04:39.720> came<00:04:39.780> through<00:04:40.260> you<00:04:40.860> know<00:04:40.919> I'm<00:04:40.979> right<00:04:41.130> on

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
if I came through you know I'm right on

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.730 
if I came through you know I'm right on
top<00:04:41.430> of<00:04:41.610> it<00:04:41.729> now<00:04:41.850> but<00:04:42.060> if<00:04:42.150> I<00:04:42.210> felt<00:04:42.510> that<00:04:42.740> out

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
top of it now but if I felt that out

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.409 
top of it now but if I felt that out
there<00:04:43.919> on<00:04:43.949> the<00:04:44.100> end<00:04:44.220> of<00:04:44.250> my<00:04:44.310> cast<00:04:44.639> I<00:04:45.000> would<00:04:45.210> make

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
there on the end of my cast I would make

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:56.180 
there on the end of my cast I would make
repeated<00:04:45.750> cast<00:04:46.110> in<00:04:46.320> that<00:04:46.350> same<00:04:46.650> direction<00:04:55.190> 1.5

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
repeated cast in that same direction 1.5

repeated cast in that same direction 1.5
DRS<00:04:58.370> you<00:04:59.370> hear<00:04:59.580> that<00:04:59.729> bait<00:05:00.030> that<00:05:00.300> single<00:05:00.690> knock

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
DRS you hear that bait that single knock

in there getting on a not a big fish but

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.779 
in there getting on a not a big fish but
a<00:05:06.419> fun<00:05:07.410> you<00:05:07.949> know<00:05:08.039> Rayburn<00:05:09.320> 1.5<00:05:10.320> DRS<00:05:10.830> fish<00:05:11.070> that

a fun you know Rayburn 1.5 DRS fish that
single<00:05:12.180> knock<00:05:12.360> is<00:05:12.539> definitely<00:05:12.960> the<00:05:13.050> trick<00:05:13.260> to

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349 
single knock is definitely the trick to

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:18.230 
single knock is definitely the trick to
get<00:05:13.500> those<00:05:13.650> fish<00:05:13.830> to<00:05:13.860> bite<00:05:16.880> but<00:05:17.880> this<00:05:18.030> time<00:05:18.210> I

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
get those fish to bite but this time I

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.089 
get those fish to bite but this time I
went<00:05:18.510> with<00:05:18.720> a<00:05:19.220> 1.5<00:05:20.220> DRS<00:05:21.000> and<00:05:21.770> same<00:05:22.770> thing<00:05:22.800> I

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:23.099 
went with a 1.5 DRS and same thing I

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:24.500 
went with a 1.5 DRS and same thing I
changed<00:05:23.310> out<00:05:23.550> the<00:05:23.580> hook<00:05:23.880> so<00:05:24.030> those<00:05:24.180> Gamakatsu

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
changed out the hook so those Gamakatsu

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.040 
changed out the hook so those Gamakatsu
the<00:05:24.930> ewg<00:05:25.410> on<00:05:25.560> the<00:05:25.680> back<00:05:26.360> and<00:05:27.360> what<00:05:27.599> I<00:05:27.630> did<00:05:27.870> with

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
the ewg on the back and what I did with

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.320 
the ewg on the back and what I did with
this<00:05:28.139> one<00:05:28.410> is<00:05:28.590> I<00:05:28.800> could<00:05:29.699> actually<00:05:29.849> fish<00:05:30.150> it<00:05:30.300> a

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
this one is I could actually fish it a

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.570 
this one is I could actually fish it a
little<00:05:30.479> bit<00:05:30.630> shallower<00:05:30.990> than<00:05:31.169> BBS<00:05:31.560> 3<00:05:31.830> and<00:05:32.070> when

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
little bit shallower than BBS 3 and when

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.339 
little bit shallower than BBS 3 and when
I<00:05:32.639> felt<00:05:32.880> like<00:05:33.000> there<00:05:33.210> on<00:05:33.419> shad<00:05:33.870> a<00:05:33.900> little<00:05:34.260> bit

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
I felt like there on shad a little bit

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:35.210 
I felt like there on shad a little bit
more<00:05:34.560> bait

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
more bait

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.219 
more bait
instead<00:05:35.849> of<00:05:35.910> that<00:05:36.000> crawdad<00:05:36.479> color<00:05:36.720> I<00:05:36.990> would

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
instead of that crawdad color I would

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:38.779 
instead of that crawdad color I would
switched<00:05:37.620> to<00:05:37.800> this<00:05:37.979> and<00:05:38.280> I<00:05:38.340> would<00:05:38.490> just<00:05:38.610> change

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
switched to this and I would just change

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:41.390 
switched to this and I would just change
up<00:05:39.030> back<00:05:39.300> and<00:05:39.510> forth<00:05:39.690> between<00:05:39.810> the<00:05:40.110> two<00:05:40.400> but

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
up back and forth between the two but

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.790 
up back and forth between the two but
the<00:05:41.520> DRS<00:05:42.090> was<00:05:42.449> for<00:05:42.750> a<00:05:43.050> day<00:05:43.289> like<00:05:43.470> today<00:05:43.530> you

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
the DRS was for a day like today you

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.649 
the DRS was for a day like today you
can't<00:05:44.130> really<00:05:44.310> tell<00:05:44.550> but<00:05:44.729> we're<00:05:45.479> in<00:05:45.599> a

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 
protected pocket but when it was a

rain and overcast that white seemed to

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.770 
rain and overcast that white seemed to
work<00:05:54.150> better

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
work better

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.510 
work better

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
of a brighter color but that was the

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.589 
of a brighter color but that was the
setup<00:05:59.190> so<00:05:59.310> my<00:05:59.430> two<00:05:59.550> crank<00:05:59.789> baits<00:05:59.970> for<00:06:00.090> the<00:06:00.270> BDS
