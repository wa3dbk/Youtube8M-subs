00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello everyone last night I'm on fast 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.990
 I got a hand a review of the broken series 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.130
 in order to show that in principle there is but 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.290
 it turned out that they are such a dummy 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:28.260
 I will show you strength too 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:31.740
 their activate it so first of all 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.489
 make sure it is installed with 8. 3 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.440
 beta 2 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.300
 further all you need to do it all 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.850
 just reset this nothing 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.129
 no trouble and even I'm sitting on a betty without 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.290
 account developer decided to click this 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.270
 button and after reboot 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.610
 strange everything works all the content on 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.590
 Your device will remain settings 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.809
 only upgrade to standard and in general 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.969
 that's all, but I'm sure that everyone who is 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.949
 or else decided to put the beta did 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.320
 such a backup we let's the same 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.090
 let's talk about Syria itself and yesterday 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.510
 that is, tonight we do not 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.510

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:14.380
 Hi Siri Hi Vova 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:15.280
 how much is a kidney and so what am I 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.980
 managed to find 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:26.760
 siri coincidence and so that's what i 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.760
 failed on what is the best file sharing service 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.280
 that's what I managed to find on the internet 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.909
 passeri 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:38.030
 you understand the geometry we now would 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.979
 right you if the cactus 10 years will stay 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:45.500
 near the computer he will distribute 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:50.659
 Wi-Fi setting Wi-Fi enabled as u 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:55.569
 understand the girl that's what I managed to find 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:59.509
 where do the balls fly to the sky 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:01.340
 This is what I managed to find on the Internet as 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.380
 you see Siri can answer a couple 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.479
 questions and with some humor 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.849
 Of course her voice leaves much to be 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.220
 The best but to the release exactly correct three 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:12.530
 they've been waiting for a year or two for sure 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.390
 wait I checked various questions and 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.069
 for some reason she understands very well 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.200
 swear words I will not show 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.410
 try it yourself but the answer is something like 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.569
 I hope there were no children around 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.769
