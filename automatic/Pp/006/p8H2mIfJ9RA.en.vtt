00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
anabelle credit so this must test world

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.930 
anabelle credit so this must test world
where<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.210> kind<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.629> tested<00:00:40.050> my<00:00:40.260> um<00:00:40.730> guess<00:00:41.730> it

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
where I kind of tested my um guess it

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.750 
where I kind of tested my um guess it
with<00:00:42.059> magic<00:00:42.239> doing<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:43.079> crater<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.829> it's

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
with magic doing so crater and it's

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.819 
with magic doing so crater and it's
pretty<00:00:44.879> cool<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:45.930> just<00:00:46.469> gives<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.800> a

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
clear view of how I kind of made my

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.920 
clear view of how I kind of made my
uranium<00:00:50.070> cells<00:00:50.340> well<00:00:51.030> automated<00:00:51.480> them<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:51.899> I

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
uranium cells well automated them so I

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.920 
uranium cells well automated them so I
don't<00:00:52.170> do<00:00:52.410> anything<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.949> make<00:00:53.039> them<00:00:53.219> or<00:00:53.930> mind

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
don't do anything to make them or mind

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.430 
don't do anything to make them or mind
them<00:00:55.110> all<00:00:55.260> over<00:00:55.379> my<00:00:55.920> name<00:00:56.809> so<00:00:57.809> basically<00:00:58.140> what

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
them all over my name so basically what

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.360 
them all over my name so basically what
i've<00:00:58.559> done<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:59.039> i've<00:00:59.699> made<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.739> bit<00:01:01.739> impulsive

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
i've done is i've made a bit impulsive

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.310 
i've done is i've made a bit impulsive
show<00:01:02.789> right<00:01:03.120> now<00:01:03.270> this<00:01:03.420> just<00:01:03.750> might<00:01:03.989> as<00:01:04.140> well

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
show right now this just might as well
