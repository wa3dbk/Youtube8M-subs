00:00:37.419 --> 00:00:37.429 
Lindbergh had to have for this airplane

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:41.380 
Lindbergh had to have for this airplane
he<00:00:37.789> needed<00:00:38.179> a<00:00:38.359> lot<00:00:38.690> of<00:00:39.019> fuel<00:00:39.469> in<00:00:39.710> fact<00:00:40.390> 400

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
he needed a lot of fuel in fact 400

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.360 
he needed a lot of fuel in fact 400
gallons<00:00:41.600> the<00:00:42.319> engine<00:00:42.649> burned<00:00:42.890> about<00:00:43.039> 10

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
gallons the engine burned about 10

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.639 
gallons the engine burned about 10
gallons<00:00:43.789> an<00:00:43.909> hour<00:00:44.030> and<00:00:44.359> so<00:00:44.870> he<00:00:45.079> had<00:00:45.199> enough<00:00:45.469> for

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
gallons an hour and so he had enough for

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.130 
gallons an hour and so he had enough for
40<00:00:46.219> hours<00:00:46.640> of<00:00:46.789> flying<00:00:47.059> he<00:00:47.269> figured<00:00:47.690> that<00:00:47.870> he

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
40 hours of flying he figured that he

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.630 
40 hours of flying he figured that he
could<00:00:48.440> have<00:00:48.589> plenty<00:00:48.890> of<00:00:48.979> time<00:00:49.159> to<00:00:49.339> get<00:00:49.429> there

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
could have plenty of time to get there

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.090 
could have plenty of time to get there
and<00:00:49.670> some<00:00:49.969> reserve<00:00:50.390> well<00:00:51.079> where<00:00:51.649> do<00:00:51.769> we<00:00:51.890> put

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
and some reserve well where do we put

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.160 
and some reserve well where do we put
all<00:00:52.219> the<00:00:52.339> fuel<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:53.149> airplane<00:00:53.510> has<00:00:53.719> to<00:00:53.749> balance

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
all the fuel the airplane has to balance

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.559 
all the fuel the airplane has to balance
properly<00:00:55.129> and<00:00:55.339> so<00:00:55.729> what<00:00:55.909> they<00:00:56.059> did<00:00:56.120> from<00:00:56.510> a

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:56.569 
properly and so what they did from a

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:58.869 
properly and so what they did from a
design<00:00:56.899> consideration<00:00:57.260> was<00:00:58.010> put<00:00:58.309> all<00:00:58.489> the

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
design consideration was put all the

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.849 
design consideration was put all the
fuel<00:00:59.239> on<00:00:59.479> the<00:00:59.600> balance<00:01:00.019> point<00:01:00.319> so<00:01:00.710> the

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
fuel on the balance point so the

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:02.169 
fuel on the balance point so the
airplane<00:01:01.069> with<00:01:01.280> balance<00:01:01.699> whether<00:01:01.879> it<00:01:02.059> was

airplane with balance whether it was
full<00:01:02.510> or<00:01:03.049> it<00:01:03.229> was<00:01:03.350> empty<00:01:03.589> and<00:01:04.040> since<00:01:04.370> Charles

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
Lindbergh was fixed weight when it took

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.890 
Lindbergh was fixed weight when it took
off<00:01:06.920> and<00:01:07.130> when<00:01:07.250> it<00:01:07.370> landed<00:01:07.790> he<00:01:08.300> ended<00:01:08.570> up<00:01:08.720> in

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
off and when it landed he ended up in

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.840 
off and when it landed he ended up in
the<00:01:09.050> back<00:01:09.260> behind<00:01:09.770> all<00:01:09.980> the<00:01:10.160> fuel<00:01:10.400> tanks

factor<00:01:23.420> for<00:01:24.290> landing<00:01:24.710> I<00:01:24.800> can<00:01:24.950> tell<00:01:25.130> you

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
factor for landing I can tell you

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.590 
factor for landing I can tell you
because<00:01:25.310> you<00:01:25.400> cannot<00:01:25.940> see<00:01:26.240> where<00:01:26.420> you're

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
because you cannot see where you're

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.950 
because you cannot see where you're
going

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
going

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.020 
going
when<00:01:27.440> these<00:01:27.560> wind<00:01:27.890> when<00:01:28.130> these<00:01:28.250> doors<00:01:28.580> closed

when these wind when these doors closed

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.270 
when these wind when these doors closed
the<00:01:29.720> only<00:01:29.960> way<00:01:30.080> you<00:01:30.140> can<00:01:30.320> see<00:01:30.590> outside<00:01:30.800> is

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
the only way you can see outside is

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.460 
the only way you can see outside is
these<00:01:31.460> windows<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:32.300> everybody<00:01:32.870> ask<00:01:33.140> me<00:01:33.320> they

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
these windows and everybody ask me they

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.620 
these windows and everybody ask me they
say<00:01:33.650> oh<00:01:33.680> can<00:01:34.070> you<00:01:34.160> look<00:01:34.280> out<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:34.640> side<00:01:34.850> you're

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
say oh can you look out the side you're

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.870 
say oh can you look out the side you're
sitting<00:01:36.050> so<00:01:36.320> far<00:01:36.620> back<00:01:36.890> and<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.310> airplanes<00:01:37.670> so

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
sitting so far back and the airplanes so

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.240 
sitting so far back and the airplanes so
wide<00:01:38.180> you<00:01:38.870> cannot<00:01:39.350> see<00:01:39.770> where<00:01:39.950> you're<00:01:40.070> going

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
wide you cannot see where you're going

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.070 
wide you cannot see where you're going
so<00:01:40.370> when<00:01:40.490> you<00:01:40.550> come<00:01:40.730> into<00:01:40.880> land<00:01:41.180> you<00:01:41.750> can<00:01:41.900> bring

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
so when you come into land you can bring

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.630 
so when you come into land you can bring
the<00:01:42.230> airplane<00:01:42.560> in<00:01:42.740> sideways<00:01:43.190> a<00:01:43.250> little<00:01:43.430> bit

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
the airplane in sideways a little bit

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.790 
the airplane in sideways a little bit
look<00:01:44.210> out<00:01:44.390> the<00:01:44.570> side<00:01:44.750> but<00:01:45.020> once<00:01:45.230> you<00:01:45.350> get<00:01:45.470> slow

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
look out the side but once you get slow

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.230 
look out the side but once you get slow
enough<00:01:46.040> you<00:01:46.400> have<00:01:46.520> to<00:01:46.640> go<00:01:46.760> straight<00:01:47.060> ahead

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
enough you have to go straight ahead

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.640 
enough you have to go straight ahead
look<00:01:47.540> straight<00:01:47.960> at<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:48.200> instrument<00:01:48.620> panel

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
look straight at the instrument panel

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.790 
look straight at the instrument panel
and<00:01:49.070> just<00:01:49.610> let<00:01:49.760> the<00:01:49.910> peripheral<00:01:50.450> vision<00:01:50.800> guide

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
and just let the peripheral vision guide

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.980 
and just let the peripheral vision guide
you<00:01:52.130> because<00:01:52.400> if<00:01:52.520> you<00:01:52.640> look<00:01:52.850> at<00:01:53.030> one<00:01:53.270> side<00:01:53.540> you

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
you because if you look at one side you

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.500 
you because if you look at one side you
tend<00:01:54.290> to<00:01:54.350> go<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.740> other<00:01:54.860> way<00:01:55.010> and<00:01:55.460> we<00:01:56.300> have

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
tend to go the other way and we have

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.030 
tend to go the other way and we have
things<00:01:57.110> around<00:01:57.320> here<00:01:57.500> that<00:01:57.620> we<00:01:57.710> don't<00:01:57.860> like<00:01:58.010> to

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
things around here that we don't like to

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.630 
things around here that we don't like to
hit<00:01:58.340> so<00:01:58.990> amazing<00:01:59.990> flying<00:02:00.280> scares<00:02:01.280> me<00:02:01.460> every

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
hit so amazing flying scares me every

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:31.400 
hit so amazing flying scares me every
time<00:02:01.790> I<00:02:01.850> landed

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:03:21.690 

you

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.760
