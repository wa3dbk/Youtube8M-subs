hello<00:00:01.110> friends<00:00:01.469> this<00:00:01.740> is<00:00:01.920> a<00:00:01.949> tutorial<00:00:02.280> series

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
hello friends this is a tutorial series

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.150 
hello friends this is a tutorial series
to<00:00:02.970> design<00:00:03.300> a<00:00:03.330> screwdriver<00:00:03.780> in<00:00:04.200> GTA<00:00:04.560> 5<00:00:04.920> and

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
to design a screwdriver in GTA 5 and

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.610 
to design a screwdriver in GTA 5 and
here<00:00:06.120> you're<00:00:06.270> looking<00:00:06.450> at<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:07.020> some<00:00:07.379> of<00:00:07.410> the

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
here you're looking at the some of the

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.100 
here you're looking at the some of the
snapshots<00:00:08.220> are<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:09.059> rendered<00:00:09.450> outputs<00:00:09.900> from

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
snapshots are the rendered outputs from

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.379 
snapshots are the rendered outputs from
CATIA<00:00:11.099> v5<00:00:11.840> screwdriver<00:00:12.840> design<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.460> here<00:00:15.299> is

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
CATIA v5 screwdriver design and here is

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.800 
CATIA v5 screwdriver design and here is
the<00:00:15.509> design<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.699> the<00:00:17.699> design<00:00:17.880> part<00:00:18.570> is

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
the design and the design part is

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.980 
the design and the design part is
already<00:00:19.199> over<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:20.240> only<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.480> rendering<00:00:21.840> is

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
already over and only the rendering is

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.189 
already over and only the rendering is
remaining<00:00:22.350> now<00:00:22.670> so<00:00:23.670> let's<00:00:23.910> just<00:00:24.269> get<00:00:24.900> into<00:00:25.080> it

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
remaining now so let's just get into it

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.640 
remaining now so let's just get into it
so<00:00:26.130> these<00:00:26.279> are<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.609> different<00:00:27.500> outputs<00:00:28.500> we

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
so these are the different outputs we

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.650 
so these are the different outputs we
get<00:00:29.840> while<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:30.990> render<00:00:32.059> so<00:00:33.059> firstly<00:00:33.390> before

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
get while you render so firstly before

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.410 
get while you render so firstly before
rendering<00:00:34.050> we<00:00:34.350> need<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.620> apply<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.920> material

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
rendering we need to apply the material

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.990 
rendering we need to apply the material
so<00:00:36.420> this<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.780> work<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.200> progress<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:38.000> this

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
so this is a work in progress and this

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.069 
so this is a work in progress and this
know<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> work<00:00:40.500> in<00:00:40.649> progress<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:42.079> this

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
know this is a work in progress and this

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.420 
know this is a work in progress and this
is<00:00:44.989> what<00:00:45.989> which<00:00:46.170> has<00:00:46.410> already<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.860> material

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
is what which has already the material

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.400 
is what which has already the material
so<00:00:48.149> as<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.329> can<00:00:48.480> see<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.750> material<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.170> here

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
so as you can see the material is here

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.990 
so as you can see the material is here
so<00:00:50.100> let's<00:00:50.280> see<00:00:50.370> how<00:00:50.430> we<00:00:50.550> can<00:00:50.670> apply<00:00:50.879> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
so let's see how we can apply the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.400 
so let's see how we can apply the
material<00:00:51.449> into<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.719> rendering<00:00:52.170> for<00:00:52.320> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
material into the rendering for the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.180 
material into the rendering for the
screwdriver<00:00:53.149> so<00:00:54.149> firstly<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:54.949> make<00:00:55.949> sure

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
screwdriver so firstly just make sure

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.860 
screwdriver so firstly just make sure
the<00:00:56.340> whole<00:00:56.520> design<00:00:56.820> was<00:00:56.850> done<00:00:57.239> in<00:00:57.570> two

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
the whole design was done in two

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.680 
the whole design was done in two
different<00:00:58.230> parts<00:00:58.879> under<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.059> same<00:01:00.270> product

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
different parts under the same product

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.080 
different parts under the same product
and<00:01:03.049> select<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.229> material<00:01:04.710> editor<00:01:04.820> if<00:01:05.820> it's

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
and select the material editor if it's

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.370 
and select the material editor if it's
not<00:01:06.330> here<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.990> could<00:01:07.200> find<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.860> here<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.760> just

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
not here you could find it here and just

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.670 
not here you could find it here and just
go<00:01:10.380> for<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.740> material<00:01:11.130> editor<00:01:11.689> and<00:01:12.689> select

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
go for the material editor and select

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.410 
go for the material editor and select
the<00:01:13.920> material<00:01:14.250> which<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.400> want<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.760> do<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
the material which you want to do the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.230 
the material which you want to do the
rendering<00:01:15.600> for<00:01:16.020> basically<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:18.060> real

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
rendering for basically the the real

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.870 
rendering for basically the the real
materials<00:01:18.780> like<00:01:18.990> glass<00:01:19.140> or<00:01:19.710> steel<00:01:20.430> takes<00:01:20.729> a

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
materials like glass or steel takes a

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.670 
materials like glass or steel takes a
lot<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.150> time<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.570> I'll<00:01:21.689> just<00:01:21.720> basically<00:01:22.530> go

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
lot of time so I'll just basically go

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.960 
lot of time so I'll just basically go
for<00:01:23.360> painting<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:25.130> just<00:01:26.130> I'll<00:01:26.280> apply<00:01:26.610> paint

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
for painting and just I'll apply paint

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.370 
for painting and just I'll apply paint
for<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:28.610> so<00:01:29.610> which<00:01:30.600> would<00:01:30.840> be<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.079> better

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
for this so which would be a better

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.399 
for this so which would be a better
option<00:01:31.640> so<00:01:32.640> fire<00:01:33.420> red<00:01:33.810> won't<00:01:33.990> be<00:01:34.200> good<00:01:36.409> yeah

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
option so fire red won't be good yeah

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.550 
option so fire red won't be good yeah
this<00:01:37.619> rebel<00:01:37.860> there<00:01:38.310> will<00:01:38.430> be<00:01:38.490> fine<00:01:39.290> just<00:01:40.290> drag

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
this rebel there will be fine just drag

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.399 
this rebel there will be fine just drag
and<00:01:40.860> drop<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.400> material

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:02:04.390 

oh<00:01:46.679> my<00:01:47.679> goodness

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.250 

okay<00:02:05.110> just<00:02:06.110> select<00:02:06.530> open<00:02:07.780> but<00:02:08.780> it's<00:02:08.930> supposed

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:09.260 
okay just select open but it's supposed

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:20.550 
okay just select open but it's supposed
to<00:02:09.410> come<00:02:10.780> I'm<00:02:11.780> not<00:02:11.990> sure<00:02:14.500> that's<00:02:15.500> here

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.200 

No

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.730 

select<00:02:25.210> a<00:02:25.390> similar<00:02:25.810> material<00:02:25.990> which<00:02:26.560> is

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
select a similar material which is

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.280 
select a similar material which is
looking<00:02:27.610> just<00:02:27.670> like<00:02:29.190> steel<00:02:30.690> but<00:02:31.690> not<00:02:31.900> really<00:02:32.140> a

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
looking just like steel but not really a

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:40.320 
looking just like steel but not really a
steel<00:02:32.620> so<00:02:33.280> a<00:02:33.310> light<00:02:33.580> BG<00:02:34.090> will<00:02:34.240> do<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:40.060> that

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
steel so a light BG will do and that

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.630 
steel so a light BG will do and that
creates<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.230> completes<00:02:41.740> the<00:02:41.860> material<00:02:42.340> part

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
creates and completes the material part

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.030 
creates and completes the material part
now<00:02:43.570> it's<00:02:43.720> just<00:02:43.900> a<00:02:44.050> simple<00:02:44.380> rendering<00:02:44.740> it's

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
now it's just a simple rendering it's

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.330 
now it's just a simple rendering it's
not<00:02:45.220> really<00:02:45.850> so<00:02:46.030> complicated<00:02:46.660> as<00:02:46.750> 3ds<00:02:47.140> max<00:02:47.470> so

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
not really so complicated as 3ds max so

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.680 
not really so complicated as 3ds max so
you<00:02:48.430> could<00:02:48.610> click<00:02:48.760> on<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.060> camera<00:02:49.390> button<00:02:49.600> if

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
you could click on the camera button if

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.330 
you could click on the camera button if
you<00:02:49.840> don't<00:02:50.050> find<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.380> camera<00:02:50.680> button<00:02:50.890> you

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
you don't find the camera button you

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.800 
you don't find the camera button you
know<00:02:51.430> let's<00:02:51.640> go<00:02:51.820> here<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:52.330> find<00:02:52.570> out<00:02:52.720> the

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
know let's go here and find out the

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.100 
know let's go here and find out the
camera<00:02:53.170> button<00:02:53.350> here<00:02:53.680> that<00:02:56.280> must<00:02:57.280> be<00:02:57.340> there

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
camera button here that must be there

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.420 
camera button here that must be there
the<00:02:59.110> render<00:02:59.440> option<00:02:59.740> will<00:02:59.860> be<00:02:59.980> there<00:03:00.160> some

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
the render option will be there some
