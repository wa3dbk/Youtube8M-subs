00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.700
 Hello here for Christian I am 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.849
 me still at the booth of arco and 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.769
 we have here now the second of the 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.530
 three newly introduced devices in the 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.710
 hand, and that is the archos 59 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.480
 Counters and the differences that give 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.960
 we have a smaller display here 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.859
 and 25 90 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.900
 we also have a hd resolution of 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:31.280
 1280 x 720 pixels 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.470
 Again we have an ips panel 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.960
 we have a good view here 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.670
 what else made the case sit 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.670
 a little different so we have now 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.730
 here again plastic but this time one 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.460
 smooth version so similar to the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.190
 the former steam and smartphones whom 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.440
 that will definitely be here 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.350
 at the smaller model 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.440
 then we will have happier 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.410
 same processor as at 6 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.810
 2 7 inch tablet we have the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:10.670
 mediatek tipps.net 65 82 and 4.7 cores 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.670
 with 1 3 ghz 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.299
 we also have a gigabyte ram here and 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:15.860
 8 GB of memory is just like you on the 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.090
 model 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.560
 we find differences in front of the camera 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.570
 now have here on the front 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:29.200
 a 2 megapixel front camera 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:31.810
 and on the back we have one 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.640
 8 megapixel camera 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.760
 again we have a micro SD card 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.940
 slot we have 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.700
 and mps so lte gives in all three 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.159
 cars is not coming 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.829
 we have a slightly stronger battery 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.579
 here at this version and although he has 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.579
 2500 billion ago 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.630
 We have a weight of 2 104 grams 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.150
 and a relatively cheap price of only 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.810
 just under 150 euros 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.510
 as an operating system is still running android 4 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.160
 54 turns 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.170
 but maybe it will 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.170
 an update lollipop gives 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.340
 then maybe we can go here again 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.110
 I've already earlier times a few tips 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.270
 photos taken 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.040
 we can just go right now 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.349
 look at 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.209
 So the camera makes in any case 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.209
 takes very good pictures 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.460
 that's what it was with the 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.220
 arChOs 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.750
 We'll be the smallest now 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.520
 look at the model of the three 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.990
 and as always if you liked it 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.370
 Gives us thumbs up
