00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 just on twitch not so small 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.290
 watching a match would be better done in chat 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.940
 didn't really have to write if 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.969
 you will write every second something in 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.080
 Chat more chances will not have to 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.430
 winning gold gaming so just 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.199
 guys us the map starts mines and 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.769
 look at the colors on the whiplay two from 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.750
 third t69 two 13 90 playing on the bottom 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.119
 bases and on the bottom base here are two of a 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.099
 third and two virginities from 3 to 32 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.489
 50100 tatyana soon from the top base 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.989
 friendship with the bottom very sorry base 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.450
 made a reservation and plunge card so 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.640
 Well, it was possible to watch the guys from 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.590
 this will wipey goes uphill with 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.719
 its and themselves and here is the last time that 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.219
 we are watching third or not 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.410
 very cool play either they both 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.210
 burn the bull explode and generally they 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.809
 complete failure let's see how this time 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.989
 will have 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.390
 Whipley but we have enemies when in principle 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.610
 tier habitual under nikon became karst 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.020
 There are no tables. Understand it. 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.850
 which we have a little bit not 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.859
 shows that she has no 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.780
 very understand what these are taken such 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.760
 threes that inside the old play is not 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.320
 able period of the fact that these threes simply 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.750
 when give your you understand they 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.460
 disassembled cords half as easy 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.350
 tanks will actually not so much 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.720
 again bounce from them they occur 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.630
 very very rarely someone gets 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.640
 Now they and this gets us a burger 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.470
 I drove him no one controls 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.390
 brazenly worth shooting about the sense of Zhaks 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.890
 rarely does not explode at all this here 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.189
 nines from and 3 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.049
 how rarely does the damage go and this is what 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.560
 right now let's see how he doesn't 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.479
 will pass so inside 2 seem very 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.909
 It feels good falcon once 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.890
 got another well here are two of the third already 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.420
 beaten himself the main question is why the burger 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.159
 did not respond why apple and not 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.899
 control in general the lighthouse that they are there 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.829
 figured out where they have 2 devyanosyk where 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:56.369
 they are common t1 all in the center and t 1 91 by 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.649
 bases look flank all here 60 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.310
 nine behind the bakun also sagged but 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:06.770
 here again, so far it was 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:08.360
 the whole team was mono hand and that's the center 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.560
 they just asked me very much 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.120
 It seems you can now 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.069
 counterattack rhinoceros already in principle 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.110
 here is pulling up a hundred if he does not burn 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.000
 then I think this friend should 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.980
 just break into the center and put out there 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.750
 most of the enemy team 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.959
 surely they will still be anyway 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.489
 a couple of minutes I think to shoot 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.370
 maximize your maximize 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.110
 its advantages although Schulz here 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.940
 received damage in response 2 t69 nobody 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:40.269
 guarantees. 9 free fell three 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:40.269
 projectile space gap one writes in this 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.880
 path time fight will not start yet 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.819
 sedan pull 50100 tt team us 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.440
 the thief we look again for such a tank 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.180
 standing in the center like on the floor 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.019
 positions are in both teams ready 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.000
 fight in the center 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.130
 but so far it seems to me calm 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.280
 there are no breakthroughs before the storm 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.500
 constrictions though no here something went on 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.600
 lighthouse at tt us corne is a burger 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.000
 Burkov who will try to apparently 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.430
 drive a little further and put t69 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.549
 you click on a4 there no one and the planets 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:17.450
 no one controls the base there on b2b 3 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:19.459
 you are almost one in the circle of good 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.920
 The first damage has gone and will continue 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.600
 work baku but not yet moving and 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.989
 in general, in a good way deployed 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.410
 stop and spill berman to the end 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:32.260
 NBA teeth where it could pick up 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.450
 okay some heat has gone us 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.230
 The center of the devyastik asked supersu I was 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.960
 dressed so brazenly 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.570
 but hehey tariff vanshotny for Isa 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.130
 the third falkon and schultz begin 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.870
 center aggressively right now 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.290
 here 50100 would help a lot 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.240
 team 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.610
 his wish for now n.k. well, where to spare 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.530
 Absolutely a plan cherish apparently or waiting 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.230
 while the opponent goes to them or 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.330
 some kind of wonderful timing olya there 2 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.280
 30 but with such a house if now your 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.660
 replay for although there all the forces on the hill 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.810
 send, in principle, all of them 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.430
 it will work out, but then maybe see what 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.280
 Generally be happening here from 3 Hyde 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.690
 already finally sank the body 2 55 hp 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.230
 left at haight 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.440
 and he leaves the center just simply 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.450
 ran off 90 could could Schultz and pick up 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.520
 kant file rotate the tower anyone 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.859
 treatises free hour will come will go 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.570
 by whom you get to 2 probably went 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.250
 attack to sail but let's watch 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.690
 I leave the replay takes the first tank bye 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.130
 drive on it can also pick up from the butt 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.380
 can be immediately picked up in response 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.360
 taken tyazha well not scary best under 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.830
 blow vodka should work need 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.350
 you need to implement the drum at least 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:39.010
 once sweet is breathing but not yet a pack 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.930
 work is visible the US bureau is too early here 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.240
 in principle, everything should be for the team 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.410
 weplay well guys or not yurka 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.660

 we see that b sci burger without hepe 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.700
 both players play on c d maybe yurka 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.410
 hurried up 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.470
 questioning god he calls in for free 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.760
 pick up b100 don't cover up nothing 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.830
 there was no escape 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.390
 Well, watch 60 years how to catch your breath 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.690
 the fastest so you just need 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.610
 trying to break in here and trying to somehow 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:12.670
 twist Ivan oh well b you something 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:16.090
 do not turn out so well floor 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.800
 only until human charges the tank too 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.300
 He loaded he could drum work here 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.580
 I would need to help you spout came 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.690

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:29.530
 okay when exactly on and burger too 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:32.470
 no longer run away see him and 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:35.200
 I don't see him anyway oh well he doesn't 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:38.260
 sat shot 2 shot all he'll take a whip 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.510
 one projectile well, like a human, the pular approached 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.670
 almost point blank and here he is a burger sho yes there is 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.590
 one of her need to block don't run away 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.970
 run away close burger because 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.450
 the seizure takes place there all 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:51.310
 actor control and t1 capture well if 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.410
 three of them go there will pass of course 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.770
 why minton pit radius we still have to play 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:59.820
 minute 30 ok mouth sounds yet 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:02.710
 alive but far you will leave with your news php 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.900
 just great now you are yourself now 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.130
 will arrange a real break check but the main thing 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.480
 so that human both their projectiles are not 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.840
 missed because there will be trouble too 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:13.600
 sorrow if he where he where the enemy but 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:17.140
 affect you maybe something 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:19.120
 takes and the Oberst which is no longer 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.620
 represent absolutely no 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.810
 threat to replay 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.490
 and this is one of Athens is not very sure 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:28.750
 see the guys who beat us 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:30.520
 not at all very confident at first yes not 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.350
 very confident their playing in the mines is not 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.030
 indeed, this position is weave 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.100
 which in the end it is essentially there especially 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.720
 I did not do anything in general, I think that 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:41.260
 in four there the whole fight was in a fight 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:44.170
 greenhouse and what and the day and I was not through 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.910
 the village is not through the lighthouse breakthroughs well how 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.590
 quite simple is generally very simple 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.850
 tried to play rhinos but also in some 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.680
 the moment he would have to change 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.990
 the virginity that came out took away immediately 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:56.230
 Weeks day resin would have taken away 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:59.970
 the same burden or both even here and devyastiyk 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.970
 I’d quietly be over there already
