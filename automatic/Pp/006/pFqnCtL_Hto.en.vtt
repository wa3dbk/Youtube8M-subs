00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.600
 good euros 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.559
 Today we have to talk about the lighting system for babies 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:15.919
 of the set of lights luminous devices 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:19.349
 in reflective paint that carry all the vehicles 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.489
 and that have three objectives 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.819
 on the one hand see 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:27.669
 for example balcácer sports lights 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:30.029
 on the other hand be seen 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.530
 as for example the l 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.370
 after several minutes flying over reflecting 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.370
 or the position lights of a vehicle 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.690
 as a third objective 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.210
 the p warn the maneuvers as for example those of more back 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.000
 oo the inter 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 This is a subject that gives us a supply of good 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.280
 efe what we have to do to remove or servers simplifies not because 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.430
 I can guarantee that there are not so many questions about this topic in the 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.580
 living room 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.950
 meaning summarized 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.300
 what are we going to achieve 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.750
 We are going to achieve a first part of the general rules that should be 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.710
 meet the lighting system of a vehicle 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.150
 in the second part of the characteristics of each of these 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.460
 dispositives 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.460
 i in a third of the mobilization 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.530
 I was going to know how that way he understands it and his assimilation of the site 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.050
 much simpler 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.100
 of face 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.430
 but let's pray for the general rules 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.310
 p the first of the light devices the scoop and reflective paint that 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.920
 they carry the 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.690
 first we have to know is that 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.340
 ee vehicles are prohibited from carrying any device or device 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.340
 reflective paint that is not previously as 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.040
 but said that your goals 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.780
 see being seen and warned 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.510
 the maneuvers are done 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.020
 you also have to know that those crosses 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.440
 that being double 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.800
 have the same function 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.599
 for example he is light this rare kc carry two light of the tourisms 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.989
 percent and have the same function 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.530
 expanding the visual field ahead of the vehicle times are you 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:25.310
 is the double have the same function you must asymmetric which means be 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.469
 simple 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:29.129
 well that is to say that they must be 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.399
 at the same distance the outer edges of the vehicle ii 

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:36.549
 also for same height with respect to the horizontal plane 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:43.429
 There is another general rule that you have to know what is 

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:47.119
 what the voices that are in the front of a vehicle 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:50.439
 they will be white 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:54.509
 as a general rule also the lights that are on the back 

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:57.509
 of the vehicle colored sedan 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.460
 a series of exceptions 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.300
 for example is the sky will be general rule that tells us that in the part 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.219
 front of the vehicle the lights are white 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:08.699
 well, we have two 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:13.629
 On the one hand we have the indicators of direction the intermittent that will be 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:18.759
 of yellow color and on the other hand the feathers of birds came the front ones 

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:23.699
 that will be raised but may also be selective yellow 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:25.600
 is discounted 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.300
 the only lights 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.260
 more than anything 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.920
 so that you do not have this problem of recognizing that if yellow 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.630
 educational one yellow auto that you know there are only some women 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.130
 or luminous devices and they are yellow is the time and effort 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.130
 the prevailing fog lights 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:51.579
 p exceptionally on the back of the vehicles and norvis otero 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.259
 national says so 

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:58.030
 what its color the color of the lights or luminous device subject 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.499
 hence the vehicles in the back was red but we also have 

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:04.259
 three specials 

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:08.439
 percent the same station that in front we said the lights 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:11.889
 address indicators the participants will advance behind 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:16.219
 remain yellow and in addition to the intermittent 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:22.129
 The lights that illuminate the license plate and the 

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:24.409
 light from more to less 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:27.599
 Well, we have already discussed a series of general rules 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.639
 what is the lÃ³pez lighting system
