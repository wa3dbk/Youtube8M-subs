a lot more information for me than that

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.300 
a lot more information for me than that

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
script but there was a whole book that

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.760 
script but there was a whole book that
he'd<00:02:02.880> done<00:02:02.909> like<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.750> whole<00:02:03.810> graphic<00:02:04.229> novel

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
that he'd done on his computer with this

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.440 
that he'd done on his computer with this
entire<00:02:07.350> world<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.979> he'd<00:02:08.129> built<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:09.300> was

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
entire world that he'd built that was

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.670 
entire world that he'd built that was
just<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.780> such<00:02:10.050> incredible<00:02:10.679> detail

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
just in such incredible detail

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.789 
just in such incredible detail
and<00:02:12.209> so<00:02:13.209> like<00:02:13.480> arresting<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.379> mean<00:02:14.500> I<00:02:14.560> couldn't

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
and so like arresting I mean I couldn't

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:17.670 
and so like arresting I mean I couldn't
believe<00:02:15.099> how<00:02:15.629> it<00:02:16.629> was<00:02:16.989> this<00:02:17.170> thing<00:02:17.409> where<00:02:17.439> it's

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
believe how it was this thing where it's

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.649 
believe how it was this thing where it's
like<00:02:17.799> I'd<00:02:18.069> never<00:02:18.099> seen<00:02:18.670> anything<00:02:18.909> like<00:02:19.090> it<00:02:19.269> but

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659 
like I'd never seen anything like it but

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.360 
like I'd never seen anything like it but
it<00:02:19.780> was<00:02:19.930> familiar<00:02:20.349> to<00:02:20.379> me<00:02:20.590> right<00:02:20.769> away<00:02:20.920> you

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
it was familiar to me right away you

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.130 
it was familiar to me right away you
know<00:02:21.489> it<00:02:21.730> was<00:02:21.849> just<00:02:21.879> just<00:02:22.450> great<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:23.019> then

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
know it was just just great and then

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.630

for<00:04:22.930> for<00:04:23.650> a<00:04:23.680> story<00:04:23.979> to<00:04:24.159> take<00:04:24.340> place<00:04:24.580> in

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
for for a story to take place in

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.619 
for for a story to take place in
side<00:04:25.039> of<00:04:25.250> which<00:04:25.580> is<00:04:25.699> really<00:04:26.330> where<00:04:26.479> the

00:04:26.619 --> 00:04:26.629 
side of which is really where the

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:29.230 
side of which is really where the
Genesis<00:04:27.349> I<00:04:27.469> think<00:04:27.680> for<00:04:27.919> you<00:04:28.909> know<00:04:29.000> for<00:04:29.210> the

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
Genesis I think for you know for the

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.670 
Genesis I think for you know for the
kinds<00:04:29.509> of<00:04:29.569> films<00:04:29.719> i<00:04:29.840> want<00:04:30.050> to<00:04:30.110> make<00:04:30.229> they<00:04:30.500> just

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
kinds of films i want to make they just

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.899 
kinds of films i want to make they just
they<00:04:30.860> need<00:04:31.009> to<00:04:31.159> take<00:04:31.310> place<00:04:31.520> inside<00:04:31.699> of

00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:31.909 
they need to take place inside of

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:36.790 
they need to take place inside of
interesting<00:04:32.770> environments<00:04:34.509> it<00:04:35.509> became<00:04:36.379> it

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
interesting environments it became it

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.469 
interesting environments it became it
became<00:04:37.580> a<00:04:37.610> science-fiction<00:04:38.000> place<00:04:38.270> that<00:04:38.419> I

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
became a science-fiction place that I

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.450 
became a science-fiction place that I
just<00:04:38.659> wanted<00:04:38.840> to<00:04:38.900> see<00:04:39.080> these<00:04:39.680> characters<00:04:40.280> and

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
just wanted to see these characters and

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.480 
just wanted to see these characters and
the<00:04:40.520> story<00:04:41.349> evolved<00:04:42.349> inside<00:04:42.770> of<00:04:43.009> so<00:04:44.080> the

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
the story evolved inside of so the

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.129 
the story evolved inside of so the
subtext<00:04:46.490> to<00:04:46.580> the<00:04:46.699> film<00:04:46.909> are<00:04:47.150> I<00:04:47.210> guess<00:04:47.599> those

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
subtext to the film are I guess those

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.580 
subtext to the film are I guess those
those<00:04:48.620> relatively<00:04:49.719> you<00:04:50.719> know<00:04:50.750> important<00:04:51.319> and

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
those relatively you know important and

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.520 
those relatively you know important and
pretty<00:04:51.889> pretty<00:04:52.990> apparent<00:04:53.990> in<00:04:54.259> the<00:04:54.319> film

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
pretty pretty apparent in the film

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.399 
pretty pretty apparent in the film
themes<00:04:55.099> and<00:04:55.400> ideas<00:04:55.460> but<00:04:56.449> you<00:04:56.750> know<00:04:56.870> layered<00:04:57.199> on

00:04:57.399 --> 00:04:57.409 
themes and ideas but you know layered on

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:58.869 
themes and ideas but you know layered on
top<00:04:57.439> of<00:04:57.740> that<00:04:57.800> is<00:04:57.979> a<00:04:58.009> lot<00:04:58.189> of<00:04:58.250> a<00:04:58.520> lot<00:04:58.759> of

00:04:58.869 --> 00:04:58.879 
top of that is a lot of a lot of

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:01.899 
top of that is a lot of a lot of
explosions<00:04:59.719> and<00:05:00.080> popcorn<00:05:00.639> body's<00:05:01.639> exploding

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:01.909 
explosions and popcorn body's exploding

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:04.689 
explosions and popcorn body's exploding
yeah
