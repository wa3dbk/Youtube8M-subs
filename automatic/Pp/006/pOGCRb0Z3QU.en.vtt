00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
for gold and silver being imported now

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.230 
for gold and silver being imported now
into<00:00:26.740> China<00:00:26.980> well<00:00:27.520> I<00:00:27.550> think<00:00:27.790> you<00:00:28.119> know<00:00:28.180> I

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
into China well I think you know I

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.550 
into China well I think you know I
realize<00:00:28.480> your<00:00:28.720> gold<00:00:28.960> and<00:00:29.110> silver<00:00:29.380> and<00:00:29.500> China

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
realize your gold and silver and China

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.159 
realize your gold and silver and China
is<00:00:29.890> basically<00:00:30.489> it's<00:00:30.610> part<00:00:30.880> of<00:00:30.970> the<00:00:31.090> culture

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:31.169 
is basically it's part of the culture

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.930 
is basically it's part of the culture
yeah<00:00:32.169> so<00:00:32.710> whether<00:00:33.370> or<00:00:33.520> not<00:00:33.640> you<00:00:33.820> have

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
yeah so whether or not you have

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.930 
yeah so whether or not you have
inflation<00:00:34.329> won't<00:00:34.960> change<00:00:35.230> the<00:00:36.100> Chinese

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
inflation won't change the Chinese

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.310 
inflation won't change the Chinese
pattern<00:00:37.300> and<00:00:37.450> they<00:00:37.510> will<00:00:37.660> continue<00:00:37.780> to<00:00:38.079> buy

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
pattern and they will continue to buy

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.370 
pattern and they will continue to buy
gold<00:00:38.590> yeah<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:40.270> only<00:00:40.480> thing<00:00:40.660> which<00:00:40.899> one

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:41.380 
gold yeah the only thing which one

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.049 
gold yeah the only thing which one
should<00:00:41.590> be<00:00:41.770> aware<00:00:41.980> of<00:00:42.040> and<00:00:42.489> I<00:00:42.640> think<00:00:42.670> that's

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
should be aware of and I think that's

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.360 
should be aware of and I think that's
also<00:00:43.420> something<00:00:43.570> which<00:00:43.930> is<00:00:44.140> very<00:00:44.370> interesting

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
also something which is very interesting

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.030 
also something which is very interesting
and<00:00:45.460> it<00:00:45.640> should<00:00:45.820> be<00:00:45.940> mentioned<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:47.170> china<00:00:47.740> is

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
and it should be mentioned that china is

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.840 
and it should be mentioned that china is
a<00:00:48.130> high<00:00:48.430> capital<00:00:48.820> or<00:00:49.270> the<00:00:49.480> country<00:00:50.490> so<00:00:51.490> that

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
a high capital or the country so that

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.260 
a high capital or the country so that
means<00:00:52.060> that<00:00:52.210> china<00:00:52.510> is<00:00:52.660> manufacturing<00:00:53.560> the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
means that china is manufacturing the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.730 
means that china is manufacturing the
products<00:00:55.270> that<00:00:55.300> witches<00:00:55.810> are<00:00:56.020> consumed<00:00:56.440> by

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:56.740 
products that witches are consumed by

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.460 
products that witches are consumed by
the<00:00:56.800> west<00:00:57.040> and<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:58.390> day<00:00:58.570> that<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:59.079> West<00:00:59.290> is

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
the west and the day that the West is

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.540 
the west and the day that the West is
gonna<00:00:59.740> collapse<00:01:00.370> I<00:01:01.290> mean<00:01:02.290> China<00:01:02.560> is<00:01:02.800> gonna<00:01:03.010> be

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
gonna collapse I mean China is gonna be

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.719 
gonna collapse I mean China is gonna be
a<00:01:03.579> lot<00:01:03.820> worse<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:05.409> the<00:01:05.590> solution<00:01:06.070> is<00:01:06.159> not<00:01:06.220> to

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
a lot worse so the solution is not to

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.090 
a lot worse so the solution is not to
invest<00:01:07.509> in<00:01:07.780> Chinese<00:01:08.259> stocks<00:01:08.590> and<00:01:08.890> in<00:01:08.979> the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
invest in Chinese stocks and in the

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.200 
invest in Chinese stocks and in the
Chinese<00:01:09.630> young<00:01:10.630> and<00:01:10.840> in<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:11.049> Chinese<00:01:11.500> thumbs

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
Chinese young and in the Chinese thumbs

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.340 
Chinese young and in the Chinese thumbs
because<00:01:13.210> you<00:01:13.420> know<00:01:13.540> something<00:01:14.049> will<00:01:14.200> happen

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
because you know something will happen

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.190 
because you know something will happen
there<00:01:14.619> as<00:01:14.680> well<00:01:14.890> yeah<00:01:15.670> well<00:01:16.540> how<00:01:16.659> does<00:01:16.720> to

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200
