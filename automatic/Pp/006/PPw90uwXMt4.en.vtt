for 30 40 years you know we're finding

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.660 
for 30 40 years you know we're finding
different<00:00:40.440> things<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:41.010> these<00:00:41.129> colonies<00:00:41.579> that

different things in these colonies that

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.790 
different things in these colonies that
we<00:00:41.820> don't<00:00:41.969> understand<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.780> we<00:00:42.899> need<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.230> to

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
we don't understand that we need to to

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.130 
we don't understand that we need to to
ensure<00:00:44.129> be<00:00:44.460> health<00:00:44.789> just<00:00:45.480> like<00:00:45.629> with<00:00:45.750> humans

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
ensure be health just like with humans

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.930 
ensure be health just like with humans
we're<00:00:46.649> surrounded<00:00:46.980> by<00:00:47.190> viruses<00:00:47.760> and

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
we're surrounded by viruses and

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.549 
we're surrounded by viruses and
different<00:00:48.210> pathogens<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.020> then<00:00:49.440> when

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
different pathogens and and then when

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.529 
different pathogens and and then when
our<00:00:49.680> Moon<00:00:49.800> system<00:00:50.100> becomes<00:00:50.579> weak<00:00:50.820> then<00:00:50.850> you

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
our Moon system becomes weak then you

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.029 
our Moon system becomes weak then you
wind<00:00:51.719> up<00:00:51.780> succumbing<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.289> one<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.949> those

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
wind up succumbing to one of those

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.369 
wind up succumbing to one of those
viruses<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.670> your<00:00:54.239> body<00:00:54.480> susceptible<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.199> do

viruses that your body susceptible to do

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.080 
viruses that your body susceptible to do
I<00:00:55.410> think<00:00:55.530> these<00:00:55.860> are<00:00:55.920> going<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.280> survive<00:00:56.460> with

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
I think these are going to survive with

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.020 
I think these are going to survive with
the<00:00:57.180> industry<00:00:57.420> survive<00:00:57.870> absolutely<00:00:59.030> it's

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the industry survive absolutely it's

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.610 
the industry survive absolutely it's
just<00:01:00.210> how<00:01:00.420> many<00:01:00.600> people<00:01:00.960> or<00:01:01.410> how<00:01:01.559> many

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
just how many people or how many

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.650 
just how many people or how many
beekeepers<00:01:02.100> are<00:01:02.399> we<00:01:02.550> going<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.789> lose<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.329> takes

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
beekeepers are we going to lose it takes

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.910 
beekeepers are we going to lose it takes
a<00:01:03.750> special<00:01:03.870> kind<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.350> person<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.769> be<00:01:04.890> a

a special kind of person to be a

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.039 
a special kind of person to be a
beekeeper<00:01:05.339> it's<00:01:05.729> not<00:01:05.909> easy<00:01:06.119> work<00:01:06.450> it's<00:01:06.780> hot
