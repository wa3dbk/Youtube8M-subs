00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 coveted DÃ¼nser is the owner of the villa 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.450
 momo and offers curative education 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.099
 and vault for children 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.380
 what exactly is meant by 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.759
 curative pedagogical and what 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.700
 for humans actually come to 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.830
 So they are vaulting for them 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.230
 performance or competitive sports and the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.660
 is doing gymnastics on the galloping tat 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.990
 actually, usually and the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.340
 curative approach is the 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.260
 vaulting and hunger and various 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.720
 but play the essential difference 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.960
 I did not want that for performance 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.880
 that kids do not do all the exercises times 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.530
 or have children after their 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.510
 own tempo can pretend 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.969
 that is basically called heiko 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.340
 great approach that kids the internet 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.320
 as well as interest means that is not motor 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.660
 or that they only dare 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.989
 or unsure that's just a lot 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.260
 at their own pace 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.870
 and she does that a lot 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.350
 safety for the children and especially 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.449
 You can not just conduct where 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.780
 in your development status conducive 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.240
 are 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.900
 enters the case margot and make exercises 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.150
 fun 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.340
 I like rieter and he is lying across 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.860
 warm us up 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.689
 children who come to me are a great one 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.610
 some of the children are children who are simple 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.119
 happy with horses event and judge 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.009
 learn events and another part of 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.720
 the children are children now 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.180
 really a need for support us 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.570
 or that would be promoted 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.360
 want in different ways so 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.009
 Children can definitely do more 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.500
 self-confidence warriors by the 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.899
 work but because these exercises so on 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.030
 they are attuned and even children the 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.979
 from it not as good we can be different 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.710
 it is difficult for them to train 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.630
 hand or that they are not motor like that 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.119
 sent interest like other children 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.719
 language difficulties no matter what the 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.960
 children notice that balda times and 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:02.640
 try to cover that up so that 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.380
 I'm embarrassed that this is not so good 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.140
 they can not know that it is not 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.380
 even we can get others and the 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.569
 prevention strategies 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.430
 and exactly these avoidance strategies 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.200
 could also be problematic 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.659
 Part for the children , just pull 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.480
 back and magnum in this situation 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:22.780
 come because his facets as boring 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.750
 magnet other children play casper and 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.799
 just clowning around to this situation 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.469
 escape that fail 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:32.260
 obviously other kids will be 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:34.150
 aggressive and all that I shared that 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.400
 she fail fear in front in principle 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.799
 and so little self-confidence and there 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.450
 60 years that he just like that 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.280
 exercise where you can 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.769
 accordingly, they are successful 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.739
 experience is the hand and thirst 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.389
 Success experience increases the motivation 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.519
 and if they practice better now and so 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:53.079
 this spiral develops before 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:58.959
 negative was up again 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:03:08.969
 it advises best and as climbing and 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:08.969
 software as third and climbing and 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:18.280
 therefore play sun masse children the 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:21.069
 have something as said not so good 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.349
 know how andreas kids can do with you 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.459
 the perception of difficulties 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.760
 language problems with 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.889
 partial performance weaknesses with the 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.030
 relationship difficulties children became 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:36.430
 are actually or traumas hand or 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.340
 Relationship crises hand all the likes of it 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.120
 short in her self-esteem 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.189
 to be strengthened 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.629
 In what way is the work between 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:45.060
 human and animal for the children 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.919
 conducive 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.840
 so it is flat speaks once the 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:52.720
 children on a very emotional level 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.780
 it called them possible that the 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.150
 Feelings outside that they can from 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.629
 be carried around all the horse by 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.639
 the knight so it makes a lot 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:05.409
 safety and handlebar outdoor what with 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.689
 these are already worn in the 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:09.340
 womb contours of the meringer becomes 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:12.959
 This will be rocked this is 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:16.000
 really great for everyone has 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:21.310
 many similarities with man 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.380
 that would have similar structure they have 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.280
 Friendships and antipathy you hand 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.830
 Act here within the herd 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.710
 and for the names just contact 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.100
 with the children and not least it is 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.900
 For the kids , they are great when they think 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.840
 representatives bold and able to stop and 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.660
 from eger what the horse can do 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:46.510
 should and as god little child led 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.510
 Great horse, the great experience
