00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 and what's wrong I missed already 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.240
 you also very good to everyone today 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.250
 let's talk about how and what trunks 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.170
 introduce in your aquarium first 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.730
 before I talk about fish I want to tell you 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.080
 that although the majority of 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.080
 times to your comments of 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.850
 thanks and support I read them all and 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.590
 are the ones that make me want to 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.000
 continue with the videos and have fun 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.320
 Sometimes a message that does not reach the 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.480
 Inbox and I do not hear about 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.310
 some question this is typical of 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.439
 youtube but good if you see that no 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.300
 I comment some question 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.619
 you can repeat - again very many 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.360
 heartfelt thanks to everything you are 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.610
 supporting and giving encouragement to continue 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.710
 making videos raul asks hello friend 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.960
 I just bought a trunk and I do not know what 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.160
 I must do before entering it in one 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.480
 of your videos you say you have to 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.040
 know them but I would like you to 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.739
 explain more in detail hopefully I 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.260
 can help to prepare a trunk and 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.550
 has bought especially for aquariums 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.780
 we must know him to protect 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.660
 our fish of any agent 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.340
 contagious to the aquarium and also like that 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.170
 it will sink better because the 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.000
 pores if it's too big to 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.879
 know it whole can be cooked first 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.189
 on one side and then the other then 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.570
 you have to keep it moist apart and so 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.840
 we will clean it thoroughly with 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.370
 hard until it does not release dirt to 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.560
 then we will leave it for a 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.150
 good time under the water and we return it to 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.090
 brush making sure that no longer 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.369
 so much dirt always will always come loose 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.750
 some dirt this is normal since 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.310
 the trunks release a little color 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.740
 brown for the tannins that have to 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.840
 are beneficial for fish once 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.700
 clean and boiled we can introduce the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.500
 new trunk in our aquarium and for 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.180
 no cleaning course the trunks 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.850
 nor any object of the aquarium with 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.930
 products always with water in theory the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.550
 logs sold in stores 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.619
 aquariums sink by themselves but to 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.300
 Sometimes this does not happen the solution is 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.100
 keep it submerged for several days 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.200
 until I have absorbed enough 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.090
 water like to stay sunken there 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.830
 trunks that sink in a while and 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.960
 trunk that can take many days 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.850
 never put logs that they 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.590
 find out there because they can be 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.380
 woods not valid for aquarium e 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.090
 even be toxic to fish to 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.979
 clear exception of those who live in 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.899
 places where there are tropical waters with 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.090
 trunks in them that you can disinfect 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.229
 the trunk as we said earlier 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.060
 again thank you very much for watching my 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.380
 videos the truth is that I do not think that 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.790
 so many people went to see them 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.990
 I started with this 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.770
 do not 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.770
 tomorrow see you
