00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
bit lighter it just looks darker because

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.680 
bit lighter it just looks darker because
the<00:00:37.260> camera<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.829> lighting<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.430> um<00:00:38.760> making<00:00:39.540> my

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
the camera the lighting is um making my
