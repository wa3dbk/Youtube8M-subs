now when Yamaha came out with a YFC 455
years<00:00:18.900> ago<00:00:19.230> there<00:00:19.770> was<00:00:19.920> nothing<00:00:20.490> like<00:00:20.760> it

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
years ago there was nothing like it

needs to go to the track but since then

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.700 
needs to go to the track but since then
there's<00:00:30.449> been<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.630> lot<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:30.929> competitors<00:00:31.529> in

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
there's been a lot of competitors in

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.950 
there's been a lot of competitors in
that<00:00:31.740> category<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.579> Yamaha<00:00:33.360> redesigned

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
that category and Yamaha redesigned

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.520 
that category and Yamaha redesigned
everything<00:00:34.230> for<00:00:34.890> 2009<00:00:35.700> on<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.329> front<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:37.500> make

you<00:00:39.329> needed<00:00:39.570> longer<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.930> arms<00:00:40.410> instead<00:00:40.770> of

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
you needed longer a arms instead of

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.380 
you needed longer a arms instead of
buying<00:00:41.160> them<00:00:41.340> Yamaha<00:00:41.790> gives<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.090> them<00:00:42.180> right

wide which is perfect for motocross and
then<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.950> go<00:00:50.070> with<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> arms<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.329> need<00:00:51.480> an

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
then to go with the a arms you need an

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.750 
then to go with the a arms you need an
upgraded<00:00:51.930> shock<00:00:52.320> these<00:00:52.920> shocks<00:00:53.219> have<00:00:53.460> an<00:00:53.579> oil

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
upgraded shock these shocks have an oil

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.369 
upgraded shock these shocks have an oil
capacity<00:00:54.329> that's<00:00:54.570> almost<00:00:54.960> one-and-a-half

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
capacity that's almost one-and-a-half

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.650 
capacity that's almost one-and-a-half
times<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.160> previous<00:00:56.370> units<00:00:56.940> it's<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.449> lot

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
times the previous units it's a lot

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.319 
times the previous units it's a lot
longer<00:00:57.870> shock<00:00:58.289> body<00:00:58.620> larger<00:00:59.579> diameter<00:01:00.030> coil

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
longer shock body larger diameter coil

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.540 
longer shock body larger diameter coil
it's<00:01:01.109> really<00:01:01.590> great<00:01:01.829> on<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.070> motocross<00:01:02.340> track

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
it's really great on the motocross track

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.030 
it's really great on the motocross track
the<00:01:03.480> brakes<00:01:03.840> have<00:01:04.019> been<00:01:04.080> improved<00:01:04.559> not<00:01:04.860> so

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
the brakes have been improved not so

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.620 
the brakes have been improved not so
much<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.430> calipers<00:01:05.880> but<00:01:06.119> in<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.360> lines

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
much in the calipers but in the lines

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.929 
much in the calipers but in the lines
they're<00:01:07.320> more<00:01:07.619> responsive<00:01:08.220> than<00:01:08.250> last<00:01:08.580> year

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
they're more responsive than last year

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.240 
they're more responsive than last year
you<00:01:09.390> don't<00:01:09.540> have<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.869> spongy<00:01:10.560> feeling<00:01:10.860> they're

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
you don't have a spongy feeling they're

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.859 
you don't have a spongy feeling they're
right<00:01:11.490> there<00:01:11.790> we<00:01:11.939> like<00:01:12.119> how<00:01:12.299> they<00:01:12.450> grab<00:01:12.689> when

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
right there we like how they grab when

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.710 
right there we like how they grab when
we<00:01:12.990> wrote<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.170> yesterday<00:01:14.299> the<00:01:15.299> other<00:01:15.360> thing<00:01:15.600> we

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
we wrote it yesterday the other thing we

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.960 
we wrote it yesterday the other thing we
really<00:01:15.750> liked<00:01:16.140> around<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.070> side<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.549> engine

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
really liked around the side the engine

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.410 
really liked around the side the engine
this<00:01:18.840> engine<00:01:19.049> isn't<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.890> previous<00:01:20.310> YFC<00:01:20.670> 450

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
this engine isn't the previous YFC 450

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.109 
this engine isn't the previous YFC 450
but<00:01:21.659> an<00:01:21.750> all-new<00:01:22.229> design<00:01:22.430> what<00:01:23.430> they<00:01:23.580> did<00:01:23.850> is

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
but an all-new design what they did is

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.700 
but an all-new design what they did is
they<00:01:24.150> took<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.540> oil<00:01:24.750> reservoir<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.470> was<00:01:25.590> in

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
they took the oil reservoir that was in

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.560 
they took the oil reservoir that was in
front<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.130> under<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.430> radiator<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:27.180> they

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
front and under the radiator and they

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.660 
front and under the radiator and they
incorporated<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.259> into<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.920> engine<00:01:29.280> itself

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
incorporated it into the engine itself

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.789 
incorporated it into the engine itself
so<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.360> don't<00:01:30.390> have<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.930> oil<00:01:31.200> capacity<00:01:31.320> up

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
so you don't have the oil capacity up

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.980 
so you don't have the oil capacity up
here<00:01:32.009> anymore<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:33.030> reservoir<00:01:33.360> now<00:01:33.780> it's

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
here anymore and the reservoir now it's

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.100 
here anymore and the reservoir now it's
built<00:01:34.200> into<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.500> cases<00:01:34.950> now<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.579> might<00:01:35.790> ask

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
built into the cases now you might ask

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.870 
built into the cases now you might ask
what<00:01:37.110> does<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.259> do<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.650> oil<00:01:37.890> heat<00:01:38.159> well

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
what does that do to the oil heat well

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.249 
what does that do to the oil heat well
it's<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.030> good<00:01:39.180> question<00:01:39.360> but<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.810> compensate

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
it's a good question but to compensate

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:40.940 
it's a good question but to compensate
for<00:01:40.590> that

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
for that

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.100 
for that
Yamaha<00:01:41.579> made<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> radiator<00:01:42.360> with<00:01:42.570> more<00:01:42.750> cooling

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
Yamaha made a radiator with more cooling

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.170 
Yamaha made a radiator with more cooling
capacity<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:43.920> keeps<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.340> oil<00:01:44.640> level<00:01:45.000> at<00:01:45.090> a

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
capacity so it keeps that oil level at a

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.760 
capacity so it keeps that oil level at a
temperature<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.720> still<00:01:45.960> works<00:01:46.229> she<00:01:46.500> gives<00:01:46.680> a

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
temperature that still works she gives a

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.080 
temperature that still works she gives a
good<00:01:46.890> longevity<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:47.640> it

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
good longevity on it

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.609

they<00:01:58.409> made<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.619> 15<00:01:59.069> millimeters<00:01:59.579> longer

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
they made it 15 millimeters longer

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.910 
they made it 15 millimeters longer
that's<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.569> little<00:02:00.780> over<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.049> half<00:02:01.259> inch<00:02:01.590> or<00:02:01.770> four

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
five eighths of something like that and

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:04.760 
five eighths of something like that and
the<00:02:03.659> result<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.229> little<00:02:04.500> bit<00:02:04.590> longer

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
the result is a little bit longer

a<00:02:11.790> lot<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:12.000> riders<00:02:12.269> are<00:02:12.510> going<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.720> like<00:02:12.870> is<00:02:13.080> the

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
a lot of riders are going to like is the

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.350 
a lot of riders are going to like is the
adjustability<00:02:13.860> in<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.129> handlebars<00:02:14.760> what<00:02:15.239> you

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
adjustability in the handlebars what you

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.100 
adjustability in the handlebars what you
do<00:02:15.480> is<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:15.840> pop<00:02:16.049> the<00:02:16.230> cover<00:02:16.410> off<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:18.930> can

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
do is you pop the cover off and you can

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.440 
do is you pop the cover off and you can
adjust<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.680> bars<00:02:19.920> forward<00:02:20.519> or<00:02:20.670> back<00:02:20.910> and

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
adjust the bars forward or back and

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.580 
adjust the bars forward or back and
there's<00:02:21.660> like<00:02:21.840> four<00:02:22.170> different<00:02:22.290> positions

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
there's like four different positions

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.350 
there's like four different positions
you<00:02:22.980> can<00:02:23.190> set<00:02:23.430> these<00:02:23.549> things<00:02:23.819> at<00:02:24.030> for<00:02:24.329> a

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
you can set these things at for a

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.030 
you can set these things at for a
different<00:02:24.720> size<00:02:24.870> riders<00:02:25.319> I<00:02:25.500> think<00:02:25.769> a<00:02:25.829> lot<00:02:26.010> of

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
different size riders I think a lot of

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.259 
different size riders I think a lot of
riders<00:02:26.370> will<00:02:26.489> find<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.730> comfortable<00:02:27.030> position

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
riders will find a comfortable position

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.150 
riders will find a comfortable position
for<00:02:27.569> them<00:02:27.870> but<00:02:28.079> now<00:02:28.680> that<00:02:28.829> we<00:02:28.920> are<00:02:29.010> in<00:02:29.099> the

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
for them but now that we are in the

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.830 
for them but now that we are in the
starting<00:02:29.489> line<00:02:29.610> guys<00:02:29.819> at<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.090> racetrack<00:02:30.269> it's

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
starting line guys at the racetrack it's

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.750 
starting line guys at the racetrack it's
time<00:02:30.989> to<00:02:31.110> get<00:02:31.200> out<00:02:31.319> of<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.440> track<00:02:31.680> just<00:02:32.040> get

to<00:07:11.660> test<00:07:11.960> this<00:07:12.139> bike<00:07:12.380> yesterday<00:07:13.280> we<00:07:13.460> rode<00:07:13.699> it

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:13.850 
to test this bike yesterday we rode it

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.400 
to test this bike yesterday we rode it
in<00:07:13.940> the<00:07:14.060> hills<00:07:14.300> all<00:07:14.570> day<00:07:14.750> so<00:07:14.810> we've<00:07:15.020> got<00:07:15.169> a<00:07:15.199> lot

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:15.410 
in the hills all day so we've got a lot

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.350 
in the hills all day so we've got a lot
of<00:07:15.440> time<00:07:15.680> on<00:07:15.889> it<00:07:15.979> already<00:07:16.130> and<00:07:16.520> one<00:07:17.030> thing<00:07:17.240> we

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 
of time on it already and one thing we

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.810 
of time on it already and one thing we
found<00:07:17.510> is<00:07:17.810> it<00:07:18.050> shifts<00:07:18.380> really<00:07:19.040> well<00:07:19.280> it

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:19.820 
found is it shifts really well it

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.400 
found is it shifts really well it
doesn't<00:07:20.210> have<00:07:20.300> that<00:07:20.330> typical<00:07:20.720> break<00:07:21.199> in

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:21.410 
doesn't have that typical break in

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.409 
doesn't have that typical break in
couple<00:07:21.830> days<00:07:21.979> where<00:07:22.340> things<00:07:22.910> start<00:07:23.120> to<00:07:23.150> smooth

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:23.419 
couple days where things start to smooth

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:25.000 
couple days where things start to smooth
out<00:07:23.570> if<00:07:23.720> this<00:07:23.870> does<00:07:24.110> it<00:07:24.260> right<00:07:24.470> from<00:07:24.740> day<00:07:24.800> one

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.010 
out if this does it right from day one

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.490 
out if this does it right from day one
it<00:07:25.460> shifts<00:07:25.790> nice<00:07:26.060> and<00:07:26.780> a<00:07:26.840> big<00:07:27.050> part<00:07:27.290> of<00:07:27.380> the

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:27.500 
it shifts nice and a big part of the

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.409 
it shifts nice and a big part of the
mint<00:07:27.800> what<00:07:27.949> makes<00:07:28.160> this<00:07:28.310> motor<00:07:28.639> work<00:07:28.970> so<00:07:29.210> well

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:29.419 
mint what makes this motor work so well

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:31.689 
mint what makes this motor work so well
gives<00:07:29.660> it<00:07:29.780> a<00:07:29.840> nice<00:07:30.080> linear<00:07:30.770> but<00:07:30.979> strong<00:07:31.370> power

00:07:31.689 --> 00:07:31.699 
gives it a nice linear but strong power

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:34.420 
gives it a nice linear but strong power
