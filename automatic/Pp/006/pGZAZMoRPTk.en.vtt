you<00:04:06.919> just<00:04:07.099> have<00:04:07.340> a<00:04:07.579> lot<00:04:07.879> of<00:04:07.910> different<00:04:08.389> ways

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:08.419 
you just have a lot of different ways

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:10.330 
you just have a lot of different ways
for<00:04:08.780> people<00:04:08.930> to<00:04:09.109> score<00:04:09.470> and<00:04:09.709> there's<00:04:10.040> very

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
for people to score and there's very

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.550 
for people to score and there's very
little<00:04:10.639> randomness<00:04:11.540> built<00:04:12.019> into<00:04:12.260> the<00:04:12.379> game

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
little randomness built into the game

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.039 
little randomness built into the game
once<00:04:12.980> you've<00:04:13.160> got<00:04:13.340> its<00:04:13.669> set<00:04:13.970> up<00:04:14.150> and<00:04:14.329> I<00:04:14.690> think

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
once you've got its set up and I think

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.960 
once you've got its set up and I think
that<00:04:15.290> is<00:04:15.319> what<00:04:15.650> is<00:04:15.829> really<00:04:16.250> going<00:04:16.459> to<00:04:16.549> keep<00:04:16.789> it

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
that is what is really going to keep it

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.550 
that is what is really going to keep it
coming<00:04:17.510> off<00:04:17.630> of<00:04:17.690> your<00:04:17.840> shelf<00:04:18.049> and<00:04:18.229> onto<00:04:18.530> the

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
coming off of your shelf and onto the

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.490 
coming off of your shelf and onto the
game<00:04:18.769> table<00:04:19.190> for<00:04:19.729> years<00:04:20.030> to<00:04:20.090> come<00:04:20.389> it<00:04:20.750> said<00:04:21.109> you

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
game table for years to come it said you

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.200 
game table for years to come it said you
can<00:04:21.769> pick<00:04:21.799> a<00:04:22.130> strategy<00:04:22.610> where<00:04:22.639> you're<00:04:22.940> going

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
can pick a strategy where you're going

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.240 
can pick a strategy where you're going
after<00:04:23.330> the<00:04:23.539> marketplace<00:04:23.990> one<00:04:24.680> time<00:04:24.919> and<00:04:25.160> then

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
after the marketplace one time and then

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.560 
after the marketplace one time and then
the<00:04:25.340> next<00:04:25.430> time<00:04:25.580> you're<00:04:25.940> thinking<00:04:26.180> I'm<00:04:26.449> going

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
the next time you're thinking I'm going

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.719 
the next time you're thinking I'm going
to<00:04:26.660> go<00:04:26.750> for<00:04:26.990> as<00:04:27.229> many<00:04:27.380> gin<00:04:27.710> as<00:04:27.860> possible<00:04:28.310> and

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
to go for as many gin as possible and

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.040 
to go for as many gin as possible and
another<00:04:28.910> time<00:04:29.180> you're<00:04:29.419> just<00:04:29.449> I'm<00:04:29.780> gonna<00:04:29.900> do

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
another time you're just I'm gonna do

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.659 
another time you're just I'm gonna do
board<00:04:30.320> control<00:04:30.620> and<00:04:30.800> try<00:04:30.949> to<00:04:31.010> like<00:04:31.220> own<00:04:31.400> as

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
board control and try to like own as

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.580 
board control and try to like own as
many<00:04:31.849> places<00:04:32.120> with<00:04:32.330> my<00:04:32.419> camels<00:04:32.840> and<00:04:32.960> even<00:04:33.440> in

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
many places with my camels and even in

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.379 
many places with my camels and even in
the<00:04:33.710> game<00:04:33.830> as<00:04:34.010> quickly<00:04:34.250> as<00:04:34.550> possible<00:04:35.000> there's

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
the game as quickly as possible there's

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.210 
the game as quickly as possible there's
a<00:04:35.539> lot<00:04:35.599> of<00:04:35.750> different<00:04:36.169> paths<00:04:36.440> to<00:04:36.650> it<00:04:36.860> and<00:04:37.010> on

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
a lot of different paths to it and on

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.950 
a lot of different paths to it and on
top<00:04:37.400> of<00:04:37.430> that<00:04:37.550> you<00:04:38.060> know<00:04:38.210> you<00:04:38.330> can<00:04:38.539> mix<00:04:38.780> and

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
top of that you know you can mix and

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.960 
top of that you know you can mix and
match<00:04:39.020> do<00:04:39.409> a<00:04:39.440> little<00:04:39.710> bit<00:04:39.919> of<00:04:39.949> each<00:04:40.669> and

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
match do a little bit of each and

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.370 
match do a little bit of each and
everybody<00:04:41.330> is<00:04:41.539> going<00:04:41.630> to<00:04:41.720> be<00:04:41.840> adapting<00:04:42.260> their

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
everybody is going to be adapting their

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.620 
everybody is going to be adapting their
strategy<00:04:42.800> even<00:04:43.280> as<00:04:43.430> they<00:04:43.580> play<00:04:43.820> because<00:04:44.150> moves

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
strategy even as they play because moves

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.089 
strategy even as they play because moves
are<00:04:44.780> constantly<00:04:45.139> getting<00:04:45.320> taken<00:04:45.860> away<00:04:45.949> from

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:46.099 
are constantly getting taken away from

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:48.250 
are constantly getting taken away from
you<00:04:46.400> and<00:04:46.669> one<00:04:47.330> of<00:04:47.360> the<00:04:47.479> great<00:04:47.720> things<00:04:47.990> is<00:04:48.199> that

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
you and one of the great things is that

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.710 
you and one of the great things is that
this<00:04:48.530> is<00:04:48.590> a<00:04:48.710> modular<00:04:49.070> board<00:04:49.639> right<00:04:50.000> so<00:04:50.449> these

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
this is a modular board right so these

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.839 
this is a modular board right so these
tiles<00:04:50.960> are<00:04:51.320> set<00:04:51.740> out<00:04:51.770> randomly<00:04:52.310> every<00:04:52.550> game

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:52.849 
tiles are set out randomly every game

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:54.700 
tiles are set out randomly every game
when<00:04:53.720> you<00:04:53.810> set<00:04:54.020> out<00:04:54.050> the<00:04:54.260> meatballs<00:04:54.620> you're

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
when you set out the meatballs you're

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.230 
when you set out the meatballs you're
pulling<00:04:55.070> them<00:04:55.159> from<00:04:55.190> a<00:04:55.430> bag<00:04:55.610> each<00:04:55.820> game<00:04:56.000> so<00:04:56.150> you

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
pulling them from a bag each game so you

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.120 
pulling them from a bag each game so you
don't<00:04:56.419> know<00:04:56.539> where<00:04:56.990> these<00:04:57.500> are<00:04:57.680> going<00:04:57.800> to<00:04:57.860> drop

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
don't know where these are going to drop

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.529 
don't know where these are going to drop
and<00:04:58.430> where<00:04:58.669> the<00:04:58.760> tiles<00:04:59.030> are<00:04:59.060> going<00:04:59.210> to<00:04:59.270> be<00:04:59.360> laid

00:04:59.529 --> 00:04:59.539 
and where the tiles are going to be laid

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:01.120 
and where the tiles are going to be laid
which<00:04:59.720> is<00:04:59.750> already<00:05:00.020> gonna<00:05:00.380> from<00:05:00.710> the<00:05:00.800> outset

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
which is already gonna from the outset

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.070 
which is already gonna from the outset
change<00:05:01.789> some<00:05:02.030> of<00:05:02.060> your<00:05:02.330> strategic<00:05:02.510> thinking

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
change some of your strategic thinking

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.659 
change some of your strategic thinking
and<00:05:03.169> then<00:05:03.320> of<00:05:03.440> course<00:05:03.469> other<00:05:04.099> people<00:05:04.490> are

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
and then of course other people are

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:05.860 
and then of course other people are
taking<00:05:04.940> available

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
taking available

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.930 
taking available
moves<00:05:06.020> away<00:05:06.260> from<00:05:06.560> you<00:05:06.650> the<00:05:06.740> whole<00:05:06.890> time<00:05:07.070> and

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
moves away from you the whole time and

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.490 
moves away from you the whole time and
then<00:05:08.060> I<00:05:08.090> think<00:05:08.360> the<00:05:08.570> other<00:05:08.750> thing<00:05:08.810> that<00:05:09.050> really

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
then I think the other thing that really

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.520 
then I think the other thing that really
helps<00:05:09.950> is<00:05:10.070> that<00:05:10.640> your<00:05:11.570> bidding<00:05:12.110> with<00:05:12.290> coins

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
helps is that your bidding with coins

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.620 
helps is that your bidding with coins
and<00:05:12.770> you're<00:05:12.920> even<00:05:13.190> buying<00:05:13.520> marketplace<00:05:14.180> cards

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
and you're even buying marketplace cards

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.260 
and you're even buying marketplace cards
on<00:05:14.780> from<00:05:15.530> spaces<00:05:15.950> with<00:05:16.430> coins<00:05:16.730> that<00:05:17.030> are

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
on from spaces with coins that are

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.180 
on from spaces with coins that are
actually<00:05:17.660> victory<00:05:18.140> points<00:05:18.470> so<00:05:18.620> you<00:05:18.950> have<00:05:19.070> to

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
actually victory points so you have to

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.410 
actually victory points so you have to
be<00:05:19.310> really<00:05:19.550> smart<00:05:19.580> about<00:05:19.880> it<00:05:20.030> just<00:05:20.240> because

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.420 
be really smart about it just because

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.450 
be really smart about it just because
you<00:05:20.630> land<00:05:20.870> on<00:05:20.990> an<00:05:21.170> advantageous<00:05:21.770> space<00:05:22.190> that

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
you land on an advantageous space that

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.030 
you land on an advantageous space that
is<00:05:22.610> 0<00:05:22.790> for<00:05:23.390> 6<00:05:23.600> coins<00:05:23.780> you<00:05:24.020> can<00:05:24.140> pick<00:05:24.620> up<00:05:24.770> to

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
is 0 for 6 coins you can pick up to

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.190 
is 0 for 6 coins you can pick up to
market<00:05:25.490> cards<00:05:25.850> but<00:05:26.300> if<00:05:26.570> you<00:05:26.750> don't<00:05:26.900> have<00:05:27.050> very

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
market cards but if you don't have very

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.990 
market cards but if you don't have very
many<00:05:27.380> market<00:05:27.800> cards<00:05:28.100> you<00:05:28.550> might<00:05:28.700> not<00:05:28.820> actually

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
many market cards you might not actually

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.820 
many market cards you might not actually
get<00:05:29.390> enough<00:05:29.690> value<00:05:29.990> out<00:05:30.110> of<00:05:30.140> that<00:05:30.260> to<00:05:30.440> be<00:05:30.560> worth

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
get enough value out of that to be worth

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.260 
get enough value out of that to be worth
the<00:05:31.040> six<00:05:31.280> points<00:05:31.640> that<00:05:31.880> you're<00:05:32.000> spending

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
the six points that you're spending

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
going to happen the same goes with the

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.780 
going to happen the same goes with the
bidding<00:05:35.900> if<00:05:36.200> you<00:05:36.350> bid<00:05:36.650> eight<00:05:37.160> coin<00:05:37.550> for

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
example to make sure you go first you

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.680 
example to make sure you go first you
better<00:05:39.890> be<00:05:40.070> damn<00:05:40.100> sure<00:05:40.460> that<00:05:41.300> the<00:05:41.450> move<00:05:41.660> that

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
better be damn sure that the move that

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.360 
better be damn sure that the move that
you're<00:05:41.930> going<00:05:42.020> to<00:05:42.110> be<00:05:42.200> making<00:05:42.380> on<00:05:42.740> your<00:05:43.130> next

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
you're going to be making on your next

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.400 
you're going to be making on your next
turn<00:05:43.490> is<00:05:43.790> going<00:05:44.330> to<00:05:44.420> be<00:05:44.540> worth<00:05:44.780> more<00:05:45.230> than

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
turn is going to be worth more than

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:46.900 
turn is going to be worth more than
eight<00:05:45.560> points<00:05:45.890> otherwise<00:05:46.190> you're<00:05:46.460> throwing

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
eight points otherwise you're throwing

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.540 
eight points otherwise you're throwing
away<00:05:47.090> victory<00:05:47.990> coins<00:05:48.230> right<00:05:48.560> so<00:05:49.040> it<00:05:49.160> is<00:05:49.220> a<00:05:49.310> game

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
away victory coins right so it is a game

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.030 
away victory coins right so it is a game
that<00:05:49.580> I<00:05:49.760> think<00:05:50.090> has<00:05:50.450> a<00:05:50.480> lot<00:05:50.750> of<00:05:51.020> depth<00:05:51.710> to<00:05:51.860> it

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.040 
that I think has a lot of depth to it

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.190 
that I think has a lot of depth to it
once<00:05:52.460> you<00:05:52.550> start<00:05:52.820> digging<00:05:53.000> into<00:05:53.240> it<00:05:53.480> but<00:05:53.960> it<00:05:54.080> is

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 
once you start digging into it but it is

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.080 
once you start digging into it but it is
a<00:05:54.230> really<00:05:54.530> simple<00:05:54.950> game<00:05:55.160> to<00:05:55.520> play<00:05:55.670> right<00:05:55.970> I

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
a really simple game to play right I

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.700 
a really simple game to play right I
think<00:05:56.390> the<00:05:56.480> the<00:05:56.840> only<00:05:56.930> problem<00:05:57.320> is<00:05:57.380> that<00:05:57.440> it

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
think the the only problem is that it

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.340 
think the the only problem is that it
definitely<00:05:58.130> lends<00:05:58.490> itself<00:05:58.790> to<00:05:58.910> a<00:05:59.330> lot<00:06:00.110> of

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
definitely lends itself to a lot of

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.260 
definitely lends itself to a lot of
analysis<00:06:00.980> paralysis<00:06:01.280> if<00:06:01.940> you<00:06:02.030> don't<00:06:02.210> know

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
analysis paralysis if you don't know

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.910 
analysis paralysis if you don't know
what<00:06:02.390> that<00:06:02.510> is<00:06:02.540> that<00:06:03.170> is<00:06:03.380> somebody<00:06:03.560> who

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:03.920 
what that is that is somebody who

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.490 
what that is that is somebody who
basically<00:06:04.250> is<00:06:04.460> like<00:06:04.550> I<00:06:05.020> want<00:06:06.020> to<00:06:06.110> do<00:06:06.260> now

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
basically is like I want to do now

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.230 
basically is like I want to do now
they're<00:06:07.250> basically<00:06:07.490> sitting<00:06:07.730> there<00:06:07.940> for<00:06:08.060> ten

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
they're basically sitting there for ten

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.790 
they're basically sitting there for ten
minutes<00:06:08.360> trying<00:06:08.690> to<00:06:08.810> pass<00:06:09.110> out<00:06:09.350> every

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
minutes trying to pass out every

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.440 
minutes trying to pass out every
possible<00:06:09.950> move<00:06:10.400> then<00:06:10.850> when<00:06:11.000> they<00:06:11.060> start<00:06:11.270> to<00:06:11.330> do

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.450 
possible move then when they start to do

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:12.640 
possible move then when they start to do
something<00:06:11.750> you<00:06:11.780> realize<00:06:12.080> oh<00:06:12.230> I<00:06:12.290> can't

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.760 
five minutes each turn to be fair this
game<00:06:23.240> is<00:06:23.360> like<00:06:23.450> a<00:06:23.540> half<00:06:23.720> an<00:06:23.840> hour<00:06:24.050> game<00:06:24.200> you<00:06:24.650> get
