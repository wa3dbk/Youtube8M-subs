00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.389
 hello I have a doubt we're still here in the 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.280
 third day of the mobile world congress already 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.160
 we tested the samsung galaxy s camera 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.200
 5 and now play the sony xperia camera 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.059
 cited well before anything else we're going to 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.130
 remember the characteristics of these 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.690
 two cameras in the front we have 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.850
 a camera with a resolution of 2 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.240
 megapixels and on the other hand in the part 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.490
 back we have 20 7 megapixels you see 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.039
 the target term that is here what 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.170
 it happens that to exploit the highest quality 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.880
 of the 20.7 megapixels we will have to 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.170
 take the photos in four thirds as 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.000
 you see does not occupy the whole of the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.210
 photography screen since for 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.280
 use the the panoramic format 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.100
 we have to reduce the resolution up 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.809
 the 15.5 megapixels in this case is a 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.450
 innovation bearing in mind that in the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.860
 previous versions of the zeta line the 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.140
 resolution went down until 8 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.850
 megapixels to be able to take pictures in 16 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.190
 is not to say in panoramic format and in 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.059
 this case we have 15.5 megapixels 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.370
 so is 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.010
 otherwise comment that the interface 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.120
 of the good camera is quite similar 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.910
 to the previous one 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.320
 experian z1 and we meet here with 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.240
 something new, yes 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.650
 as for example the possibility of doing 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.260
 videos in 4k 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.479
 we also have time time shift video 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.600
 which is to do slow motion in this 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.940
 case is an improved slow motion and 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.210
 worsened with respect to s 5 yes good 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.130
 in this case it allows us an improvement that 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.590
 is the power to choose the fragment in the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.960
 we want the slow motion to be seen 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.950
 but of course he also has other 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.509
 limitations like this is for example not 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.250
 it does the ads perfectly 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.369
 because it's a version demonstrates what 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.140
 but it really is a bit of a tad 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.820
 short there on that side 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.619
 otherwise comment on that we 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.009
 we also find with back background 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.240
 He said that basically it's another of the 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.930
 things we had said that 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.700
 we can perform in the focus once 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.320
 taken the photograph if it is rather 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.330
 it would be like a kind of retouching 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.600
 photographic almost almost as it were already 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.270
 that good photographs end up being 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.310
 just a little not being entirely useful 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.110
 this way because it does not just go out of focus 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.399
 well the bottom everything we wanted not 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.019
 It's something that 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.060
 it's a first step but you have to improve 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.640
 for the next versions of the 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:19.530
 phone and good and otherwise some 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.599
 good options like the effects that are 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.700
 a little silly but good 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.799
 fun to see them yes because you get scared 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.099
 Seeing how a tyrannosaurus rex comes 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:32.159
 behind you to attack you and good nothing 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:35.549
 most remarkable on this side if I say of 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:37.530
 that we have the automatic focus that 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.079
 it really is the one that we are going to finish 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.269
 using but that they limit us certain 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.159
 things for example he does not let us choose 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.920
 the resolution with which to take the photo 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.900
 that's something we intuit that will be the 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.430
 maximum resolution in this format is 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.680
 say as we said diagonally in 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.359
 panoramic would be 15.5 megapixels 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.189
 we intuit that the maximum resolution with 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:58.920
 the automatic photographs will be with 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:01.230
 this 15.5 megapixels but it's something that does not 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.720
 is specified at no time like this is and 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.189
 comment that when we want to work 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.840
 the manual for example to take photos 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.250
 by hr 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.109
 well we see in another some little problem 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.139
 to be able to activate the hdr that does not 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.730
 works at its maximum resolution its 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:17.040
 maximum resolution we have to lower 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.480
 so that it works if what happens that 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.370
 It is also important to note that in 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.849
 this stand as there is a lot of light has been 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.230
 quite impossible to test the hdr mode is 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.640
 say we have not seen differences 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.959
 remarkable but that 's something that 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.610
 We will have to prove when we have the 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.760
 mobile in our hands and in our 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.319
 offices like that is another thing that I liked 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.140
 very much I was already a little in the 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:40.110
 previous xperia z1 is the subject of power 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.299
 see good if we see here the movement of 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.610
 camera how nice it is super fluids 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.799
 louis himself the truth is that good 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.480
 a video is also made and in the 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.590
 video looks a bit more choppy not 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.810
 we know what the final result will be 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.459
 but this feeling of being able to see the 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.799
 camera as well as real time if the 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.590
 moment in which he moves is incredible 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.569
 the truth is truly fascinating 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.239
 is that good little more to say in this 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.459
 but I do want to comment something that 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.549
 we are really enjoying this sony 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.230
 xperia accepted more than the s5 more than 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.970
 nothing for the camera, there's no good 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.010
 it reduces its 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.890
 compared measures compared to the 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.720
 screen and how good they are on the right track 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.459
 surely in the back issues 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.260
 side I agree only that it's going to 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.750
 be a tad plus the size of frames 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.480
 of inferiors and superiors we will be 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.680
 to a fairly complete mobile over 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.480
 everything also by the interface and other 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.460
 but good these videos of cameras well 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.380
 that we will not save ourselves more so is the 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.270
 cited the video dale I like 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.920
