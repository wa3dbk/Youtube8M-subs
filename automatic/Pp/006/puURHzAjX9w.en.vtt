in<00:00:26.800> michigan<00:00:27.189> stadium<00:00:27.430> for<00:00:27.820> a<00:00:27.850> long<00:00:28.470> long<00:00:29.470> time

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
in michigan stadium for a long long time

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.960 
in michigan stadium for a long long time
I<00:00:30.779> would<00:00:31.779> assume<00:00:31.900> and<00:00:32.890> maybe<00:00:33.250> this<00:00:33.460> is<00:00:33.610> a<00:00:33.640> bad

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
I would assume and maybe this is a bad

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.180 
I would assume and maybe this is a bad
thing<00:00:34.030> to<00:00:34.420> assume<00:00:35.020> that<00:00:35.350> michigan's<00:00:36.160> defense

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
thing to assume that michigan's defense

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.220 
thing to assume that michigan's defense
has<00:00:36.640> played<00:00:36.820> higher<00:00:37.239> quality<00:00:37.809> opponents

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
has played higher quality opponents

inborn<00:00:38.530> green<00:00:38.710> hands<00:00:38.920> I'm<00:00:39.100> actually<00:00:39.280> positive

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
inborn green hands I'm actually positive

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.670 
inborn green hands I'm actually positive
of<00:00:40.030> it<00:00:40.059> so<00:00:40.480> I<00:00:40.510> think<00:00:40.629> that<00:00:40.809> you<00:00:41.020> might<00:00:41.200> see<00:00:41.469> a

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
of it so I think that you might see a

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.670 
of it so I think that you might see a
better<00:00:42.250> Michigan<00:00:42.850> defense<00:00:43.270> on<00:00:43.690> Saturday<00:00:44.320> just

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
better Michigan defense on Saturday just

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.639 
better Michigan defense on Saturday just
for<00:00:45.579> the<00:00:45.940> lack<00:00:46.149> of<00:00:46.180> strength<00:00:46.930> of<00:00:47.110> opponent<00:00:47.590> of

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649

kind of agree with you I think you know
not<00:01:12.820> so<00:01:13.060> much<00:01:13.210> I<00:01:13.720> don't<00:01:14.049> think<00:01:14.110> bowling<00:01:14.470> green

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
not so much I don't think bowling green

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.469 
not so much I don't think bowling green
impacts<00:01:15.159> michigan's<00:01:15.700> defense<00:01:15.760> as<00:01:16.180> much<00:01:16.330> as

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
impacts michigan's defense as much as

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:17.789 
impacts michigan's defense as much as
the<00:01:16.570> fact<00:01:16.600> that<00:01:16.869> michigan<00:01:17.260> is<00:01:17.350> coming<00:01:17.619> off<00:01:17.770> a

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
the fact that michigan is coming off a

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.370 
the fact that michigan is coming off a
tough<00:01:18.700> performance<00:01:18.880> against<00:01:19.600> umass<00:01:19.990> where

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
tough performance against umass where

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.149 
tough performance against umass where
they<00:01:20.500> defense<00:01:21.220> gave<00:01:21.430> up<00:01:21.810> 437<00:01:22.810> yards<00:01:22.840> I<00:01:23.650> think

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
they defense gave up 437 yards I think

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.280 
they defense gave up 437 yards I think
the<00:01:24.250> Wolverines<00:01:24.610> should<00:01:25.390> should<00:01:25.960> come<00:01:26.110> into

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
the Wolverines should should come into

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.530 
the Wolverines should should come into
this<00:01:26.409> game<00:01:26.530> ready<00:01:27.369> to<00:01:27.580> fight<00:01:28.210> for<00:01:28.420> their

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
this game ready to fight for their

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.840 
this game ready to fight for their
defensive<00:01:29.080> reputation<00:01:29.740> and<00:01:29.920> I<00:01:30.130> expect<00:01:30.640> to<00:01:30.729> see

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
defensive reputation and I expect to see

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.310 
defensive reputation and I expect to see
different<00:01:31.090> defense<00:01:31.540> on<00:01:31.689> the<00:01:31.780> field<00:01:31.810> this<00:01:32.140> week

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
different defense on the field this week

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.380 
different defense on the field this week
well<00:01:33.220> then<00:01:33.340> I<00:01:33.369> think<00:01:33.460> too<00:01:33.820> and<00:01:34.060> a<00:01:34.180> lot<00:01:34.210> of

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
well then I think too and a lot of

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.210 
well then I think too and a lot of
people<00:01:34.659> don't<00:01:34.900> realize<00:01:34.990> this<00:01:35.470> is<00:01:35.619> U<00:01:35.829> mass<00:01:35.950> is<00:01:36.189> a

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
people don't realize this is U mass is a

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.770 
people don't realize this is U mass is a
better<00:01:36.430> team<00:01:36.670> than<00:01:36.700> bowling<00:01:37.030> green<00:01:37.360> that's

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.179 
bowling green they play and arguably a
tougher<00:01:43.689> conference<00:01:44.170> than<00:01:44.590> bowling<00:01:44.799> green

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
tougher conference than bowling green

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.520 
tougher conference than bowling green
and<00:01:45.399> I<00:01:45.939> think<00:01:46.360> they<00:01:46.570> beat<00:01:46.930> Bowling<00:01:47.320> Green

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
and I think they beat Bowling Green

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.109 
and I think they beat Bowling Green
maybe<00:01:47.740> six<00:01:48.100> or<00:01:48.220> seven<00:01:48.490> out<00:01:48.610> of<00:01:48.670> ten<00:01:48.850> times

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
maybe six or seven out of ten times

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.450 
maybe six or seven out of ten times
again<00:01:49.869> that's<00:01:50.110> just<00:01:50.259> my<00:01:50.380> opinion<00:01:50.409> but<00:01:50.860> I<00:01:51.130> think

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
again that's just my opinion but I think

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.480 
again that's just my opinion but I think
people<00:01:52.380> maybe<00:01:53.380> underestimate<00:01:54.070> just<00:01:54.100> because

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
people maybe underestimate just because

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.609 
people maybe underestimate just because
of<00:01:54.610> that<00:01:54.640> FCS<00:01:55.060> first<00:01:55.390> FBS<00:01:55.600> title<00:01:56.200> once<00:01:56.380> you<00:01:56.470> get

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
of that FCS first FBS title once you get

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.219 
of that FCS first FBS title once you get
down<00:01:56.770> to<00:01:56.920> that<00:01:57.009> mac<00:01:57.310> sun<00:01:57.939> belt<00:01:58.180> level<00:01:58.420> it

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
down to that mac sun belt level it

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.350 
down to that mac sun belt level it
really<00:01:59.560> is<00:01:59.770> all<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.070> same<00:02:00.280> oh<00:02:00.490> god<00:02:00.850> i<00:02:00.880> would

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
really is all the same oh god i would

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.880 
really is all the same oh god i would
agree<00:02:01.479> with<00:02:01.630> you<00:02:01.810> that<00:02:01.840> UMass<00:02:02.409> is<00:02:02.619> probably

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
agree with you that UMass is probably

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.260 
agree with you that UMass is probably
better<00:02:03.070> team<00:02:03.340> to<00:02:03.460> bowling<00:02:03.729> green<00:02:03.759> but<00:02:04.030> I<00:02:04.090> think

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
better team to bowling green but I think

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.459 
better team to bowling green but I think
you<00:02:04.390> may<00:02:04.509> have<00:02:04.540> just<00:02:04.659> angered<00:02:05.110> a<00:02:05.170> lot<00:02:05.200> of

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
you may have just angered a lot of

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:08.280 
you may have just angered a lot of
viewers<00:02:05.829> by<00:02:05.979> saying<00:02:06.310> that<00:02:06.549> the<00:02:06.759> that<00:02:07.630> the<00:02:07.659> mac

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.700 
viewers by saying that the that the mac

is a worse conference in the CAA can

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.310 
is a worse conference in the CAA can

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
quarterbacks in NFL played a Delaware so

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.030 
quarterbacks in NFL played a Delaware so
you<00:02:48.780> look<00:02:49.020> at<00:02:49.140> it<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.500> those<00:02:49.830> are<00:02:49.950> just

you look at it and those are just
quarterbacks<00:02:50.580> I<00:02:50.700> would<00:02:51.210> agree<00:02:51.360> with<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:51.600> that

I<00:02:51.780> think<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.260> FCS<00:02:52.830> has<00:02:53.010> produced<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.460> lot<00:02:53.640> of

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
I think the FCS has produced a lot of

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.450 
I think the FCS has produced a lot of
top-flight<00:02:54.990> talent<00:02:55.710> in<00:02:55.770> recent<00:02:56.040> years<00:02:56.070> last

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
top-flight talent in recent years last

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.190 
top-flight talent in recent years last
year<00:02:56.670> alone<00:02:56.850> I<00:02:57.030> think<00:02:57.330> they<00:02:57.420> had<00:02:57.510> 16<00:02:57.930> players

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
year alone I think they had 16 players

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.350 
year alone I think they had 16 players
drafted<00:02:58.500> in<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:58.860> NFL<00:02:58.950> draft<00:02:59.550> which<00:03:00.180> is

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
drafted in the NFL draft which is

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.350 
drafted in the NFL draft which is
probably<00:03:01.050> at<00:03:01.260> least<00:03:01.410> comparable<00:03:01.860> to<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.130> mac

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
probably at least comparable to the mac

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.340 
probably at least comparable to the mac
you<00:03:03.360> know<00:03:03.450> I<00:03:03.480> would<00:03:03.930> agree<00:03:04.080> with<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:04.260> that

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
you know I would agree with you that

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.930 
you know I would agree with you that
they<00:03:04.530> I<00:03:04.590> mean<00:03:04.680> I'd<00:03:04.920> have<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.190> numbers<00:03:05.580> but<00:03:05.700> it

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
they I mean I'd have the numbers but it

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.790 
they I mean I'd have the numbers but it
might<00:03:06.090> be<00:03:06.120> more<00:03:06.450> anyway<00:03:06.930> what<00:03:07.410> do<00:03:07.470> you<00:03:07.560> thinks

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
might be more anyway what do you thinks

might be more anyway what do you thinks

Mike<00:03:10.530> I<00:03:10.680> think<00:03:10.950> Michigan<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.490> they<00:03:11.580> come<00:03:11.730> into

pressure<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.810> Falcons<00:03:37.800> offense<00:03:38.280> and
