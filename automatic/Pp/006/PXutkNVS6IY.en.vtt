00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.040
 and I'm javier prior of training 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:08.080
 apnea dotcom in this video I want 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.820
 reply to sergio de barcelona preciosa 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.670
 city I recommend you go to see her 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:16.120
 if you have an opportunity and sergio says that 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.990
 it can not be good that it reaches the end 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.850
 towards dynamic apnea with less 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.640
 and comes to the end and makes you want to 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.110
 breathe and can not or does not follow 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.619
 advancing on their brands because they do not 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.810
 risk puts first 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:37.440
 congratulations because you do not risk under 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:39.600
 of water according to the dynamics of a 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.490
 pool in the sea wherever it's always 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:48.680
 always accompanied with someone and you know 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.680
 of first aid yes yes no 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:57.170
 and second thing that I want to tell you is 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.630
 and I want to talk about the mind came in 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.770
 the last five years I was studying the 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.770
 mind with less 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.520
 they work in personal development and 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.850
 psychology that I'm talking about 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.010
 bill clinton madonna green day andre 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.530
 agassi many athletes and others 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.710
 people I'm talking about richard 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.240
 tandem is the founder of programming 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.610
 neurolinguistics to change 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.890
 behaviors habits and records 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.750
 mental is talking that in the 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.600
 last years I studied with this is a 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.520
 number one in the world to understand better 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.520
 the mind and as I do not tell you this 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.500
 because there is one thing that there are so many 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.170
 interesting things about the mind but 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.390
 one of the ones that has called me the most 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.289
 attention is that we have 50 thousand 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.030
 thoughts a day this means that 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.400
 we have a thought and a half 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.100
 second 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.310
 and we only have one thought at a time 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.370
 that is, we can have many 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.350
 thoughts but only one at a time there are 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.470
 people who can think very fast and 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.210
 have many thoughts in a row 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.680
 but only one each time 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.110
 and there are other people who can 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.770
 relate many things quickly and 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.510
 this is depending on the synapses that 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.580
 let's take this information we're not going 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.890
 to leave aside we will return to it 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.750
 later 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.630
 another thing is 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.540
 every time we train we will train 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.400
 maximum out of water 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.740
 the reason for this is that you can 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.530
 risk out of the water and you can 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.810
 imagine if you do 25 meters turning 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.880
 in dynamics as you take and start 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.750
 do dynamic apnea out of the water 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.430
 start to walk out of the water 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:48.140
 holding the breath you control 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:50.390
 the time how long have you done 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.040
 This rests rests and the next thing 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.430
 you are going to do is to do the same thing again 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.769
 but adding it well 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.780
 what you steam is what you like yourself 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.849
 feel that you are going to increase with 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.879
 security and another thing that we're going to do 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:08.909
 is that you do not need to train always in 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:11.909
 Dry dry will train until 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:15.569
 reach that mark that goal that we have 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:18.030
 wanted to reach from there as is 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.939
 a psychological goal is a mental goal 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.530
 let's go to the water and we know we're 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:24.859
 trained to do that and very much 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.859
 plus 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:31.280
 another of the things that sergio commented 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:34.519
 was that when the end of the 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.790
 apnea in the 25 meters with a pool or 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:41.140
 the meters that are 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.239
 He is trying to relax in the water while not 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:48.099
 it's about relaxing and underwater 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:50.019
 but it's about entering relaxed is 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.790
 different is not about relaxing 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.950
 when the punches of approval begin 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.829
 Ticos do not feel like breathing 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.170
 before doing the apnea, be completely 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:01.870
 relaxed that's why it's very important in the 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.420
 meditation the physical relaxation and the 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.129
 concentration in meditation we are going to 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.920
 use those five senses to 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:11.019
 visualize things we are going to visualize that 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.269
 I think when I meditate, you said 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.250
 meditate thinking what you want 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.519
 visualizing what you want can I 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:22.419
 I visualize my niece and nephew my partner 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.310
 my father the last time I made a 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.259
 sport that I liked an activity that 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.009
 I was passionate about the visualize or remember in 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:33.930
 Instead colors sensations me 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:39.030
 I say things that disconnect me 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:42.449
 the burden of uf now I have to do 75 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.040
 meters now I have to go down 50 meters 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.620
 of depth 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.770
 that young woman that stress that can generate 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.720
 thinking about that disconnects me thinking about 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.139
 things walk steps and they do not have 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.180
 nothing to do with apnea according 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.849
 in physical relaxation it is very evident 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:04.620
 what needs to be done and concentration 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:08.080
 it is a brif a brief profile is 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:10.180
 redundant present and end where 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:14.349
 calculas is what you're going to do I'm going to 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:16.449
 do 25 meters or I will do 30 meters 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:20.200
 and I will go back and I will give a stroke 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:24.220
 more this 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:27.220
 it is something that is very important to be able 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.380
 your mental knowledge to program 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.170
 reprogram of saying i'm going to do this and 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.520
 have your mind aware of what it is 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:37.910
 what are you going to do 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.039
 and when I say meditation the 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.710
 previous meditation is that if I am 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:45.560
 thinking about that, it is impossible that 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.599
 thinking about the risk that with the desire 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.909
 that could have and anticipate the future 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:53.120
 when I'm going to get in the water, 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:54.090
 if I owe 25 meters or 30 meters or 45 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.790
 meters 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:59.190
 that will generate an anxiety but if 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.990
 I focus on other things that I 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.970
 pleases it is impossible that he is thinking about 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.070
 that for example right now there are waves 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.600
 here behind but I'm not thinking about 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.160
 they do not deconcentrate me because I'm 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.600
 thinking about the message that I love you 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:14.360
 transmit is to say I'm concentrated 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:19.250
 the previous meditation that nothing has to 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:22.760
 see with him then I get into the 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:25.130
 water and I start my employ according that 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:29.150
 that's what meditation is for 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:32.240
 be mentally calm relaxed 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:35.120
 strong good, this is the answer 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.400
 I wanted to give that it serves for many 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.000
 other questions that have made me 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.620
 and nothing else if you liked this video 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.190
 I like nothing to share on Facebook 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.930
 twitter with your friends 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.330
 and know that in training to fight 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.340
 dotcom has many more videos 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.949
 like this one and a high video area 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.370
 definition with master classes so 

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:57.370
 have 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.470
 more I was going to say 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.710
 and another thing that is 

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:14.610
 the important thing is that 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.610
 next real round 

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.170
 ah
