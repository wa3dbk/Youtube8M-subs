the<00:00:41.649> peak<00:00:41.829> interest<00:00:42.280> and<00:00:42.430> then<00:00:43.300> as<00:00:43.660> it<00:00:43.870> went<00:00:44.050> on

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
the peak interest and then as it went on

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.069 
the peak interest and then as it went on
later<00:00:45.640> on<00:00:45.820> they<00:00:45.970> did<00:00:46.210> come<00:00:46.449> out<00:00:46.540> take<00:00:46.900> some

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
later on they did come out take some

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.979 
later on they did come out take some
tests<00:00:47.440> of<00:00:48.070> the<00:00:48.790> fact<00:00:49.030> that<00:00:49.120> we<00:00:49.269> have<00:00:49.420> to<00:00:49.780> see

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
tests of the fact that we have to see

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.399 
tests of the fact that we have to see
how<00:00:50.260> what<00:00:51.129> kind<00:00:51.879> of<00:00:51.970> methane<00:00:52.360> is<00:00:52.570> generated

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.409 
how what kind of methane is generated

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:57.680 
how what kind of methane is generated
and<00:00:53.920> they<00:00:54.460> were<00:00:54.519> favorable<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:56.500> the<00:00:56.980> head<00:00:57.190> time

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
and they were favorable so the head time

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.779 
and they were favorable so the head time
we<00:00:58.980> we<00:00:59.980> started<00:01:00.399> a<00:01:00.460> partnership<00:01:00.730> with<00:01:02.520> UW<00:01:03.520> ol

I've received from the neighbor so far
has<00:01:45.210> been<00:01:45.240> very<00:01:45.510> positive<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:46.410> haven't<00:01:47.310> had

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
has been very positive I haven't had

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:57.760 
has been very positive I haven't had
anyone<00:01:47.850> say<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.240> are<00:01:48.720> flipping<00:01:49.440> nuts<00:01:49.800> yet

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.399 

well<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:59.090> very<00:01:59.329> first<00:01:59.570> concern<00:01:59.960> is<00:01:59.990> what

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
well the very first concern is what

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.870 
well the very first concern is what
happens<00:02:00.679> if<00:02:00.740> it<00:02:00.859> doesn't<00:02:00.890> work<00:02:02.229> but<00:02:03.609> in<00:02:04.609> the

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
happens if it doesn't work but in the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.910 
happens if it doesn't work but in the
research<00:02:05.240> that<00:02:05.570> we've<00:02:05.719> done<00:02:05.750> and<00:02:06.469> what<00:02:06.770> we've

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
research that we've done and what we've

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.390 
research that we've done and what we've
seen<00:02:07.599> it's<00:02:08.599> going<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:08.929> work<00:02:11.560> it's<00:02:12.560> yeah<00:02:13.069> it's

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
seen it's going to work it's yeah it's

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.430 
seen it's going to work it's yeah it's
been<00:02:14.299> very<00:02:14.450> good<00:02:15.069> most<00:02:16.069> of<00:02:16.250> our<00:02:16.400> our<00:02:17.290> work<00:02:18.290> has

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
been very good most of our our work has

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.460 
been very good most of our our work has
been<00:02:18.650> done<00:02:19.190> with<00:02:19.370> Felix<00:02:19.700> layer<00:02:19.879> and<00:02:20.260> he's<00:02:21.260> been

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
been done with Felix layer and he's been

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.710 
been done with Felix layer and he's been
terrific

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.060 

of<00:02:25.720> course<00:02:26.050> I<00:02:26.290> believe<00:02:26.890> in<00:02:27.100> a<00:02:28.350> boy<00:02:29.350> anytime<00:02:29.860> you

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
of course I believe in a boy anytime you

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.340 
of course I believe in a boy anytime you
can<00:02:30.220> take<00:02:30.430> take<00:02:31.390> something<00:02:31.990> that<00:02:32.020> is

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
can take take something that is

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.740 
can take take something that is
basically<00:02:32.830> worthless<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:33.640> make<00:02:34.510> something

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
basically worthless and make something

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.340 
basically worthless and make something
out<00:02:34.990> of<00:02:35.020> it<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.790> mean<00:02:36.790> we're<00:02:37.210> taking<00:02:37.510> manure<00:02:37.750> and

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
out of it I mean we're taking manure and

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.560 
out of it I mean we're taking manure and
we're<00:02:39.010> going<00:02:39.190> to<00:02:39.280> take<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.790> gas<00:02:40.000> out<00:02:40.270> of<00:02:40.420> it

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
we're going to take the gas out of it

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.590 
we're going to take the gas out of it
and<00:02:40.810> make<00:02:41.440> electricity<00:02:41.830> and<00:02:42.730> when<00:02:43.270> it's<00:02:43.420> all

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
and make electricity and when it's all

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.920 
and make electricity and when it's all
said<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:43.870> done<00:02:43.990> we<00:02:44.620> still<00:02:44.920> have<00:02:45.070> manure<00:02:45.930> and

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
said and done we still have manure and

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.260 
said and done we still have manure and
it's<00:02:47.110> probably<00:02:47.530> more<00:02:48.130> available<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:48.730> let<00:02:49.150> the

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
it's probably more available to let the

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.400 
it's probably more available to let the
nutrients<00:02:49.630> are<00:02:49.720> more<00:02:49.900> available<00:02:50.020> to<00:02:50.290> the

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
nutrients are more available to the

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.270 
nutrients are more available to the
crops<00:02:50.710> than<00:02:51.070> what<00:02:51.940> it<00:02:52.000> was<00:02:52.030> before
