partitioned Drive here's what you want
we're<00:02:21.659> going<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:21.840> split<00:02:22.079> this<00:02:22.260> one<00:02:22.469> in<00:02:22.620> half<00:02:22.829> so

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
we're going to split this one in half so

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.190 
we're going to split this one in half so
if<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:23.819> just<00:02:23.939> bring<00:02:24.090> up<00:02:24.209> a<00:02:24.269> calculator<00:02:24.659> here<00:02:24.959> I

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
if I just bring up a calculator here I

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.209 
if I just bring up a calculator here I
move<00:02:25.739> it<00:02:25.890> off<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.280> side<00:02:26.840> we<00:02:27.840> have<00:02:28.219> seventy

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:29.219 
move it off to the side we have seventy

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:31.420 
move it off to the side we have seventy

eight hundred that number we can't do a
point<00:02:42.659> five<00:02:42.900> so<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.230> can't<00:02:43.379> do<00:02:43.469> like<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.620> half

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889 
point five so you can't do like a half

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.339 
point five so you can't do like a half
of<00:02:44.189> a<00:02:44.250> megabyte<00:02:44.730> so<00:02:45.299> you<00:02:45.359> can<00:02:45.780> round<00:02:45.959> down<00:02:46.139> the

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.150 
what it's acting like ah it's acting
like<00:04:33.960> it's<00:04:35.210> more<00:04:36.210> drives<00:04:36.620> put<00:04:37.620> together<00:04:37.770> that

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
like it's more drives put together that

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.750 
like it's more drives put together that
way<00:04:38.310> they<00:04:38.490> are<00:04:39.260> if<00:04:40.260> a<00:04:40.530> hard<00:04:40.830> drive<00:04:41.010> crashes<00:04:41.250> the

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
way they are if a hard drive crashes the

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.220 
way they are if a hard drive crashes the
main<00:04:41.880> hard<00:04:42.120> drive<00:04:42.180> they're<00:04:42.780> all<00:04:42.870> going<00:04:43.020> to<00:04:43.110> go

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
main hard drive they're all going to go

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.940 
main hard drive they're all going to go
with<00:04:43.410> it<00:04:43.620> but<00:04:44.490> you<00:04:44.700> can<00:04:44.910> allocate<00:04:45.950> different

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
with it but you can allocate different

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.790 
with it but you can allocate different
sections<00:04:47.790> of<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.180> drive<00:04:48.390> to<00:04:48.690> specific<00:04:49.530> things

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
sections of the drive to specific things

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.900 
sections of the drive to specific things
so<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:50.940> D<00:04:51.270> can<00:04:51.570> be<00:04:51.600> just<00:04:52.530> four<00:04:52.680> videos<00:04:53.040> F<00:04:53.370> could

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
so the D can be just four videos F could

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.500 
so the D can be just four videos F could
be<00:04:54.000> for<00:04:54.180> documents<00:04:54.720> G<00:04:54.930> can<00:04:55.170> be<00:04:55.200> for<00:04:55.640> pictures<00:04:56.640> Z

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
be for documents G can be for pictures Z

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.290 
be for documents G can be for pictures Z
can<00:04:57.750> be<00:04:57.780> for<00:04:58.200> music<00:04:59.010> I<00:04:59.190> don't<00:04:59.640> know<00:04:59.700> L<00:04:59.910> can<00:05:00.180> be

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
can be for music I don't know L can be

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.780 
can be for music I don't know L can be
your<00:05:00.480> programs<00:05:00.990> or<00:05:01.320> stuff<00:05:01.890> like<00:05:02.070> that<00:05:02.280> it's

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
your programs or stuff like that it's

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:03.980 
your programs or stuff like that it's
basically<00:05:03.000> you<00:05:03.210> can<00:05:03.300> allocate<00:05:03.480> it<00:05:03.780> you<00:05:03.870> can

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
basically you can allocate it you can

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.690 
basically you can allocate it you can
also<00:05:04.200> allocate<00:05:04.710> when<00:05:04.860> you're<00:05:04.980> hooking<00:05:05.130> up<00:05:05.370> or

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
also allocate when you're hooking up or

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.820 
also allocate when you're hooking up or
setting<00:05:05.970> up<00:05:06.090> your<00:05:06.270> operating<00:05:06.900> system<00:05:07.230> this<00:05:07.650> is

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
setting up your operating system this is

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.950 
setting up your operating system this is
if<00:05:07.950> you're<00:05:08.070> adding<00:05:08.310> more<00:05:08.340> drives<00:05:08.730> in<00:05:08.940> like<00:05:09.120> I'm

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
if you're adding more drives in like I'm

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.530 
if you're adding more drives in like I'm
doing<00:05:10.410> sideways<00:05:11.340> let's<00:05:11.910> say<00:05:12.030> allocate

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
doing sideways let's say allocate

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.020 
doing sideways let's say allocate
instead<00:05:12.840> of<00:05:12.960> hard<00:05:13.170> drives<00:05:13.440> for<00:05:14.190> a<00:05:14.220> Windows<00:05:14.880> 7

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
instead of hard drives for a Windows 7

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.440 
instead of hard drives for a Windows 7
thanks<00:05:15.780> for<00:05:15.900> watching<00:05:16.170> and<00:05:16.290> please<00:05:16.410> subscribe
