00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.299
 carved candles famous for their curls 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:07.240
 bends 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:12.550
 they look so skillful to ignite 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:14.650
 such a candle itself events all 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.990
 starts with hot wax bugs different 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.130
 colors 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.810
 switch mix to mix 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.440
 distribute a special formula 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.440
 dye 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.470
 she lets the wax core form a star in 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.109
 pure wax and then yellow pure wax 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.430
 dilutes it brightens yellow it gives 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.430
 its frozen in cold water 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:41.100
 the process is repeated 30 35 times so ass and 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:46.920
 multicolored lutsk accumulate on the core 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:49.199
 shone as the candle dipped 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.949
 it becomes warmer communication that will allow 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:56.629
 further decoration fast on horseback 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.629
 water cools only the outer layers 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:08.080
 in the midst of dunking on deepens grooves 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:10.300
 on candles she continues to shop and 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:15.220
 closely monitor the water temperature 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:17.740
 and wax if the candle gets a little more 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.479
 heat it will become too threading 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.360
 but if she salary all this will be too 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:32.170
 solid is very important to achieve faithful 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:40.020
 consistency almost a pair cut but 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:40.020
 first presses the surplus spot and cuts off 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.850
 these colorful backgrounds are too good 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:52.720
 for waste and she makes a candle of them 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:55.170
 fungus it pierces the center of the hole for 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.170
 wick 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:06.939
 she has only 15 minutes cutting main 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.599
 candles after which it will be too 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:14.440
 hard for work she cuts the bottom and 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:16.680
 wraps the pieces back it opens 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.750
 eye -catching colored layers 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.550
 she's a kunai squad of curls water so they 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.550
 slightly hardened and not bent 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.969
 but the trick she bends each row in 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.969
 direction opposite to the previous one 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.370
 she cut it 4 rows and top row 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.370
 bends them up they 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.290
 using a square knife she cuts out 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.290
 police top candles 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.550
 then makes wax ground the ground 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.550
 under the mill 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.310
 she carves tulips and other decorations 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.300
 around the top 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.740
 she works fast and not with a steady hand 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.600
 It takes at least a year of training to 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.110
 learn to cut and shape these 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.260
 patterns 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:26.600
 so fast and here is a tricky trick 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.980
 she wags an even knife to cut 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.980
 fluted bird wing silhouette 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.300
 last character and abruptly finished 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:58.480
 the throne flows down the sides 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:04:00.160
 that spoils the decoration she twists the candle 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.260
 on a hot surface to melt 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.420
 but also align it but for now the bottom is still 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.480
 hot on the catch tag with trading 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.480
 brand name 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:13.030
 finally she dips the candle in acrylic was 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.300
 it fixes the whole candle and protects against 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.300
 chick 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.850
 when the candle is lit the fire of the pure core 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.990
 pass through the patterns for real 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.990
 glowing with beauty
