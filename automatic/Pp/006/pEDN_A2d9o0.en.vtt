using<00:00:03.310> the<00:00:03.430> auto<00:00:03.700> mode<00:00:04.000> is<00:00:04.240> really<00:00:04.750> the

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:04.870 
using the auto mode is really the

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.300 
using the auto mode is really the
easiest<00:00:05.260> thing<00:00:05.560> you<00:00:05.650> can<00:00:05.830> do<00:00:05.980> with<00:00:06.160> this

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:06.310 
easiest thing you can do with this

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.180 
easiest thing you can do with this
camera<00:00:06.779> just<00:00:07.779> make<00:00:08.109> sure<00:00:08.290> your<00:00:08.470> mode<00:00:08.710> dial<00:00:08.920> is

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:09.190 
camera just make sure your mode dial is

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.390 
camera just make sure your mode dial is
set<00:00:09.580> to<00:00:09.820> ia<00:00:10.120> this<00:00:11.080> stands<00:00:11.380> for<00:00:11.679> intelligent

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:12.400 
set to ia this stands for intelligent

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.720 
set to ia this stands for intelligent
Auto<00:00:12.639> and<00:00:13.379> basically<00:00:14.379> what<00:00:14.950> that<00:00:14.980> does<00:00:15.219> is

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
Auto and basically what that does is

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.150 
Auto and basically what that does is
completely<00:00:16.540> automate<00:00:16.960> the<00:00:17.110> entire<00:00:17.440> camera<00:00:17.770> I

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160 
completely automate the entire camera I

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.090 
completely automate the entire camera I
have<00:00:18.670> very<00:00:19.090> very<00:00:19.359> little<00:00:19.689> control<00:00:20.019> if<00:00:20.650> I<00:00:20.800> press

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.100 
have very very little control if I press

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.400 
have very very little control if I press
the<00:00:21.340> quick<00:00:21.730> menu<00:00:22.000> joystick<00:00:22.539> down<00:00:22.570> for<00:00:23.140> about<00:00:23.380> a

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
the quick menu joystick down for about a

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.009 
the quick menu joystick down for about a
second<00:00:23.859> you<00:00:24.609> can<00:00:24.760> see<00:00:24.970> that<00:00:25.210> hardly<00:00:25.570> anything

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:26.019 
second you can see that hardly anything

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.859 
second you can see that hardly anything
is<00:00:26.170> available<00:00:26.619> to<00:00:26.769> me<00:00:26.949> I<00:00:27.099> can<00:00:27.910> change<00:00:28.119> the<00:00:28.330> LCD

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
is available to me I can change the LCD

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.740 
is available to me I can change the LCD
brightness<00:00:29.080> and<00:00:29.619> the<00:00:29.759> resolution<00:00:30.759> as<00:00:30.939> well<00:00:31.539> as

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
brightness and the resolution as well as

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.680 
brightness and the resolution as well as
the<00:00:32.140> auto<00:00:32.470> focus<00:00:32.710> tracking<00:00:33.490> if<00:00:34.030> I<00:00:34.240> want<00:00:34.450> to

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
the auto focus tracking if I want to

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.900 
the auto focus tracking if I want to
lock<00:00:35.260> my<00:00:35.530> focus<00:00:35.860> on<00:00:35.980> something<00:00:36.489> and<00:00:36.700> then

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
lock my focus on something and then

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.600 
lock my focus on something and then
reposition<00:00:37.690> the<00:00:37.840> camera<00:00:37.989> but<00:00:38.950> this<00:00:39.129> may<00:00:39.399> not

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
reposition the camera but this may not

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.610 
reposition the camera but this may not
be<00:00:39.670> enough<00:00:40.239> in<00:00:40.539> order<00:00:40.719> to<00:00:40.930> capture<00:00:41.140> an<00:00:41.500> image

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
be enough in order to capture an image

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.340 
be enough in order to capture an image
with<00:00:42.309> the<00:00:42.520> right<00:00:42.700> color<00:00:43.000> so<00:00:43.930> what<00:00:44.200> I<00:00:44.230> would

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
with the right color so what I would

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.590 
with the right color so what I would
recommend<00:00:44.559> doing<00:00:45.039> is<00:00:45.550> instead<00:00:46.090> of<00:00:46.239> using<00:00:46.390> the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
recommend doing is instead of using the

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.760 
recommend doing is instead of using the
auto<00:00:46.809> mode<00:00:47.280> use<00:00:48.280> the<00:00:48.730> program<00:00:49.629> mode<00:00:49.899> the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
auto mode use the program mode the

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.560 
auto mode use the program mode the
program<00:00:51.160> mode<00:00:51.340> is<00:00:51.489> very<00:00:51.760> similar<00:00:52.030> to<00:00:52.149> the<00:00:52.390> auto

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
program mode is very similar to the auto

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.439 
program mode is very similar to the auto
mode<00:00:52.870> in<00:00:53.110> that<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:54.280> camera<00:00:54.699> will<00:00:54.850> choose<00:00:55.120> the

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
mode in that the camera will choose the

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:57.270 
mode in that the camera will choose the
best<00:00:55.629> shutter<00:00:56.050> speed<00:00:56.350> and<00:00:56.530> aperture<00:00:56.739> for<00:00:57.129> you

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
best shutter speed and aperture for you

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.189 
best shutter speed and aperture for you
so<00:00:57.789> you<00:00:57.910> really<00:00:58.180> don't<00:00:58.390> have<00:00:58.539> to<00:00:58.629> think<00:00:58.930> very

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
so you really don't have to think very

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.349 
so you really don't have to think very
much<00:00:59.379> about<00:00:59.440> that<00:00:59.739> you<00:01:00.640> can<00:01:00.789> just<00:01:00.969> press<00:01:01.210> the

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
much about that you can just press the

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.110 
much about that you can just press the
shutter<00:01:01.480> button<00:01:01.629> halfway<00:01:02.190> focus<00:01:03.190> recompose

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
shutter button halfway focus recompose

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.160 
shutter button halfway focus recompose
and<00:01:04.330> shoot<00:01:05.010> but<00:01:06.010> what<00:01:06.880> it<00:01:06.970> does<00:01:07.180> that<00:01:07.630> the<00:01:07.900> auto

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
and shoot but what it does that the auto

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.320 
and shoot but what it does that the auto
mode<00:01:08.380> does<00:01:08.560> not<00:01:08.590> do<00:01:09.010> is<00:01:09.430> allow<00:01:09.760> you<00:01:09.820> to<00:01:10.090> set

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
mode does not do is allow you to set

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.890 
mode does not do is allow you to set
things<00:01:10.600> like<00:01:10.720> ISO<00:01:11.560> and<00:01:11.770> white<00:01:12.400> balance<00:01:12.900> now

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
things like ISO and white balance now

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.170 
things like ISO and white balance now
the<00:01:14.320> auto<00:01:14.500> ISO<00:01:15.130> in<00:01:15.280> this<00:01:15.400> camera<00:01:15.820> is<00:01:15.940> really

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
the auto ISO in this camera is really

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.060 
the auto ISO in this camera is really
not<00:01:16.450> that<00:01:16.660> bad<00:01:16.930> and<00:01:17.230> if<00:01:17.590> you<00:01:17.710> like<00:01:17.890> an

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
not that bad and if you like an

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.130 
not that bad and if you like an
automated<00:01:18.490> camera<00:01:19.030> you<00:01:19.570> can<00:01:19.720> probably<00:01:19.960> go

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
automated camera you can probably go

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.010 
automated camera you can probably go
ahead<00:01:20.350> and<00:01:20.500> just<00:01:20.650> use<00:01:20.740> auto<00:01:21.250> ISO<00:01:21.880> so<00:01:22.690> let's<00:01:22.870> go

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
ahead and just use auto ISO so let's go

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.050 
ahead and just use auto ISO so let's go
ahead<00:01:23.080> and<00:01:23.200> set<00:01:23.500> that<00:01:23.680> go<00:01:24.130> to<00:01:24.190> the<00:01:24.520> quick<00:01:24.790> menu

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
ahead and set that go to the quick menu

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.840 
ahead and set that go to the quick menu
just<00:01:25.330> press<00:01:25.600> this<00:01:25.840> for<00:01:26.050> a<00:01:26.110> second<00:01:26.730> then<00:01:27.730> you

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
just press this for a second then you

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.750 
just press this for a second then you
can<00:01:28.030> move<00:01:28.210> over<00:01:28.390> to<00:01:28.570> the<00:01:29.080> intelligent<00:01:29.830> ISO<00:01:30.490> and

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
can move over to the intelligent ISO and

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.610 
can move over to the intelligent ISO and
turn<00:01:31.630> this<00:01:31.840> on<00:01:32.110> I<00:01:33.330> think<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.510> intelligent<00:01:35.110> ISO

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
turn this on I think the intelligent ISO

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.290 
turn this on I think the intelligent ISO
probably<00:01:36.220> does<00:01:36.340> a<00:01:36.370> little<00:01:36.610> bit<00:01:36.790> better<00:01:36.970> job

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
probably does a little bit better job

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.660 
probably does a little bit better job
guessing<00:01:38.170> what<00:01:38.440> the<00:01:38.470> ISO<00:01:39.070> should<00:01:39.280> be<00:01:39.400> set<00:01:39.640> to

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
guessing what the ISO should be set to

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.710 
guessing what the ISO should be set to
as<00:01:40.090> opposed<00:01:40.900> to<00:01:41.050> the<00:01:41.410> regular<00:01:41.920> auto<00:01:42.400> ISO<00:01:43.090> so<00:01:43.690> I

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
as opposed to the regular auto ISO so I

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.720 
as opposed to the regular auto ISO so I
normally<00:01:44.140> just<00:01:44.380> turn<00:01:44.590> on<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:45.160> intelligent

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
normally just turn on the intelligent

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.630 
normally just turn on the intelligent
ISO<00:01:46.180> and<00:01:46.450> that<00:01:46.960> automatically<00:01:47.560> sets<00:01:47.950> the<00:01:48.040> ISO

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
ISO and that automatically sets the ISO

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.050 
ISO and that automatically sets the ISO
here<00:01:48.880> to<00:01:49.390> automatic<00:01:50.050> now<00:01:50.860> most<00:01:51.550> importantly

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
here to automatic now most importantly

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.880 
here to automatic now most importantly
is<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.600> white<00:01:52.780> balance<00:01:53.020> this<00:01:53.320> is<00:01:53.380> something

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
is the white balance this is something

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.440 
is the white balance this is something
that<00:01:53.920> I<00:01:54.190> would<00:01:54.370> not<00:01:54.520> recommend<00:01:54.760> leaving<00:01:55.210> on

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
that I would not recommend leaving on

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.110 
that I would not recommend leaving on
auto<00:01:55.660> because<00:01:56.620> indoors<00:01:57.310> you're<00:01:57.730> going<00:01:57.880> to<00:01:57.940> get

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
auto because indoors you're going to get

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.510 
auto because indoors you're going to get
a<00:01:58.330> very<00:01:58.510> yellow<00:01:58.840> hue<00:01:59.350> in<00:01:59.560> your<00:02:00.070> pictures

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
a very yellow hue in your pictures
