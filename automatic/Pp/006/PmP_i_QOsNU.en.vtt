00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
you need to search for vertex once you

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.970 
you need to search for vertex once you
have<00:00:29.429> such<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.240> vertex<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.990> will<00:00:31.170> find<00:00:31.830> that

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
have such the vertex you will find that

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.510 
have such the vertex you will find that
it<00:00:32.369> will<00:00:32.550> cost<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:33.030> dollar<00:00:33.360> 49<00:00:34.040> you<00:00:35.040> can<00:00:35.280> watch

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
vertex settings over there by default it

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.969 
vertex settings over there by default it
will<00:01:02.129> be<00:01:02.430> disabled<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.239> swipe<00:01:03.870> app<00:01:04.080> will<00:01:04.589> also

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
will be disabled and swipe app will also

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.550 
will be disabled and swipe app will also
be<00:01:05.100> disabled<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.540> need<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.900> turn<00:01:07.110> on<00:01:07.290> these

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
be disabled so you need to turn on these
