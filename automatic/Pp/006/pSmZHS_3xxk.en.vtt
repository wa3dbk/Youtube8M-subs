00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.700
 another video 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.370
 today it's about the boom max bluetooth 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.590
 speaker from the company with the 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.639
 little brother who got the boom with him 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.769
 I already told you in the last video 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.480
 shown the video you can find up here 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.699
 also linked again then I would 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.010
 say heart to me and we look 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.010
 look at what the market has on it 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.460
 in the scope of delivery is of course first 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.230
 the boom ax itself has one up here 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.320
 Also these already carrying handle off the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.390
 but if you need it here 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.040
 can lose weight 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.559
 We also have one more phone 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.239
 plug cable so we also devices without 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.079
 bluetooth here with the speaker 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.960
 can connect 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.600
 and we have to have a 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.910
 Charging cable from usb to micro usb the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.500
 cables are exactly like when boom him in 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.070
 I like a stylish red 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.620
 pretty good 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.480
 and then we come to the buhmann 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:07.250
 we have dimensions of 10.6 x 5 here 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.900
 x 92 centimeters at a weight of 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.400
 370 grams the whole thing feels very much 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.920
 high quality at one time because the 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.330
 Processing is really excellent 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.610
 There is nothing wrong with it 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.380
 to suspend and partly because the 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.630
 materials were chosen very well 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.060
 The housing itself is just out 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.890
 analyzed aluminum really correct 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.740
 cool and on the sides we have 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.900
 here already some kind of plastic 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.759
 but that's pretty well done 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.790
 and just feels good in the hand 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.790
 and high quality at the humax is in 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.990
 black light blue red and chocolate 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.880
 available black looks my opinion 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.829
 the best from here shines through 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.350
 that is, the red one 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.759
 membrane of the two speakers that 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.439
 looks really good i hope 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.299
 you can see it in the video 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.640
 we have on the top then here 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.930
 two buttons for the volume and one 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.640
 universal button 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.259
 so we can turn on the device 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.750
 switch off in the pairing mode 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.180
 put a call on hold and so on 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.770
 further on the left side we have 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.229
 then two more connections namely the 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.119
 jack to bluetooth without 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.400
 to transfer music to the 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.769
 micro-usb connection to the internal 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.450
 recharge battery was installed here 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.659
 Lithium ion battery with a capacity 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.040
 from 1600 billion per storm 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.540
 that's a whole lot and 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.849
 accordingly high fall the 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.790
 Usage times from eight to ten hours 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.220
 listen to music for up to 23 hours 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.069
 internal microphone calls and one 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.109
 Standby time of up to 95 days 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.700
 these are values ​​at a very high level 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:38.099
 level the two built-in 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.439
 Speakers each have three watts 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.750
 power speak 6 watts in this small 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:45.329
 housing here and therefore good 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.129
 it also really sounded all areas 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.870
 are well covered it sounds 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.299
 overall great 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.670
 and also what is really for a so 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:56.189
 small device is very very good that's it 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.290
 Best thing I have in this area here 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.510
 heard now we have one 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.829
 bluetooth 4.0 on board it will be first 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.170
 of course, the battery spared 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.540
 we have the usual range of 10 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.120
 meters and can be two devices 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.620
 pair with the bubacks at the same time 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.810
 We have just indicated 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.480
 built-in microphone with technologies 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.069
 for noise canceling that connect 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.870
 is as easy as you turn on 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:22.500
 just on your terminals bluetooth 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:26.579
 then turns on the boom max until the 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.260
 intro music sounds and when the 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.209
 Devices already know a very small 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.159
 wait until the pique arrives 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.989
 he already and the devices are connected 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.699
 so fast is it when the devices 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.590
 do not know because the humax must be short in 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:39.419
 the pairing mode and then you can the 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.159
 just so you can connect their new devices 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.299
 that's all in the 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:43.709
 instructions explained 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.019
 Now I want you a little one 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.359
 How much does it cost? 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.250
 Sounds like that and we play bretten sachs 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.819
 dropping out of school I just push 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.819
 time to play 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.780
 I think you definitely hear that 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.130
 that's right point center is listening 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.600
 Very good and also the bassist 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.209
 surprisingly strong for such a small one 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.800
 device in the city of uslar iphone 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.140
 now stands next to the bluetooth icon 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.180
 even a small battery that us 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.400
 So information about the state of the bbu 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.520
 max is then we are already at 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.980
 Conclusion is reached the humax from construction 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.990
 a really awesome that gets a lot 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.360
 high quality workmanship a fancy 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.120
 design and the whole at relative 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.250
 small dimensions despite the right 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.410
 Small size, the sound is really good 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.360
 pretty decent on the basis and it 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.340
 enjoy listening to music then 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.260
 Of course, the good battery life that 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.640
 built-in microphone and so on and so on 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.620
 I've got everything already 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.260
 called in my opinion a very 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.410
 very good overall package the whole is 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:03.140
 available for a price of 109 euro 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.660
 according to mieth bau so the manufacturer but 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.000
 on Amazon you can find the whole from 83 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.450
 depending on what kind of color you have 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.340
 would like to 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.540
 the amazon links are also down in the 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.130
 video description so you can 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.260
 just right after points like that 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.400
 current price because so and then 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.030
 I would say we have an end 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.770
 grown 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.930
 I would be glad if you have the video 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.880
 valued with a down home if it is 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.110
 you liked and maybe if 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.300
 Write or post a comment 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.620
 Abo that then I would say until the 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.450
 next time it'll be good 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.450
 i 'm still going to play music
