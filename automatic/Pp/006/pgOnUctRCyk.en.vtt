00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 If you are going to buy a vacuum cleaner 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.609
 Roboters decide then they should 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.759
 pay attention to some points we tell them 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.809
 which she at normal 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.759
 Vacuum cleaners also have the vacuum cleaner 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.490
 Robots use their suction power directly at the 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.850
 nozzle more expensive models have brushes 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.740
 they roll the dirt to the nozzle in threads 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.300
 the huber goes in his latest series 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.279
 because a very special way and makes 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.189
 roll out of the brush rainer hard rubber 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.390
 to increase the suction power 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.340
 cheaper models have no 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.280
 Roll and are almost only for hard floors 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.230
 suitable every suction robot has one or 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.660
 Two sides brush for edges and 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.250
 iris vacuum cleaner robot can still 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.750
 be as good as they want when they 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.789
 not get there where the dirt 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.930
 really lies then brings everything 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.420
 do not need anything 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.789
 Vacuum cleaner robot a navigation 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.770
 cheaper models like the dirt devil 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.360
 spyder drive right through the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.219
 space and here it is pure luck thing 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.940
 if they actually do the dirt 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.789
 to reach 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.859
 Even the famous rumba crosses and drives 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.750
 transversely, however, he has certain devices 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.689
 him to navigate from room to room 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.330
 Space help models again offered away 85 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.979
 or the vorwerk vr 200 have 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.110
 a clever navigation 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.360
 they have a laser mounted and 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.210
 make a map of the room 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.890
 There are also other models one 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.439
 have a camera and look at certain 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.299
 features in space orient edges 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.100
 every vacuum cleaner robot has sensors 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.140
 that does not help them with that 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.640
 you want to fall down stairs 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.810
 to buy a vacuum cleaner robot 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.090
 they have to be exactly on the 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.560
 who pay conditions of your apartment 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.270
 for example, many deep furniture 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.490
 they also have to be one accordingly 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.820
 buy deep vacuum cleaner robot with it 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.140
 he can also suck under these furniture 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.060
 heavy robots have more for most 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.970
 technology, however , also have light 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.439
 robots your advantages of eg heavy 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.090
 Robot against a green carpet 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.909
 usually fold it over 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.840
 teach yourself a barrier 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.700
 that's how comfortable it gets 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.430
 Vacuum cleaner robot when you open it 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.750
 can program time and day before 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.430
 then there is usually one 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.229
 Charging station of the vacuum cleaner robot 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.100
 independently on drives when the 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.630
 juice runs out 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.030
 in addition, some have 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.770
 Vacuum cleaner robot a remote control 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.960
 then you can remotely control the device 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.210
 that it is pointless but quite 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.610
 40 an important point is also the 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.550
 Dust container emptying which can be very 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.040
 be comfortable like the rumba or 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.170
 synonymous with the vr 200 but can also to 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.710
 torture will be around at the cheap the 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.120
 bots or the spider robot many 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.430
 Vacuum cleaner robots have over 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.260
 any special features that is 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.630
 almost a trademark for the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.320
 manufacturer finds something very special 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.030
 about the Vorwerk Kobold vr 200 of the 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.700
 has namely feet rises above those 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.260
 very high thresholds get over if 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.940
 they are allergy, they should as well 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.580
 take care that a fine dust filter 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.050
 the heeper class occupies it though 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.700
 Vacuum cleaner robot insane 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.340
 these devices are progressing 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.380
 not yet suitable for every household 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.060
 The equipment comes with deep carpets 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.860
 still not clear when many things 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.840
 it is not possible to lie around 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.060
 and floors can change the 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.560
 robot is not there yet offers itself 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.730
 rather the treatment with a normal one 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.160
 vacuum cleaner on 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.060
 Nevertheless, the weekly cleaning costs 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.500
 can significantly reduce the robots 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.350
 you can find even more videos in our 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.270
 video channel if you have detailed 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.100
 test reports and current news too 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.530
 Looking for individual products 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.510
 but on chip.de over and if they are 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.310
 no new shoot video in the future 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.050
 you can miss ours
