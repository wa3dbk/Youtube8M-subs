00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.910
 To make these coasters we are going to 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.440
 recycle polystyrene trays that 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.900
 are those that we can find with 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.640
 some foods to make it the way 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.439
 we will need a metal cutter 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.720
 circular or square the size that 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.910
 We want the coasters we will need 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.680
 also some kitchen tongs if 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.360
 we want to cut the coasters instead 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.520
 to make it shape with the cutter 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.680
 we just cut the tray with some 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.360
 scissors to decorate the coasters and or 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.700
 I'm going to use the drinking technique 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.540
 but if you prefer you can paint them with 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.730
 acrylic paint 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.160
 if you decide to make them like mine 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.320
 you will need a paper napkin with 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.000
 the white one and a brush you can also 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.280
 use of any adhesive 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.170
 cups instead of glue or for finishing 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.789
 a varnish let's start so 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.859
 we have to heat in the kitchen the 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.929
 metal cutter very carefully and 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:53.550
 taking it with the tweezers when 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:55.859
 hot just put it on 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.019
 the tray and it will melt in 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.179
 contact with the cutter and we will have 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.989
 the way we do all the coasters 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:02.989
 that we want 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.180
 Y 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.079
 Look 

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:23.079
 no no 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.660
 now that we have the shape done we are going to 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.070
 make them the design 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.110
 so you take the paper napkin 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.180
 that you have chosen and separates them jce the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.170
 white layers you just have to stay with 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.170
 the drawing layer 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.480
 we apply white glue and paste the part 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.180
 of the napkin that we want it to be 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.920
 on the coasters we cut the edges 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.920
 leftovers and we wait for it to dry 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.340
 Y 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.979
 I am 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.950
 to finish you just have to give it another 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.690
 Adhesive layer above you can 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.910
 also apply varnish or adhesive 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.910
 for drinks that already depends on what 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.980
 you choose and we already have some coasters with 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.110
 recycled material the truth is that 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.700
 they come out very cheap and we are 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.620
 reusing that they are two aspects 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.050
 important that we usually defend in the 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.180
 iu workshop and as you see we have 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.710
 countless designs I hope you have 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.750
 liked and if you are interested 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.730

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.730
 miss you anything I climb thanks 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.800
