00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
it's kind of like brown here and then it

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.080 
it's kind of like brown here and then it
faced<00:02:43.480> purple<00:02:44.140> but<00:02:44.739> I<00:02:44.770> don't<00:02:45.190> mind<00:02:45.459> it<00:02:45.730> so<00:02:46.030> much

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
faced purple but I don't mind it so much

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.430 
faced purple but I don't mind it so much
um<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.860> as<00:02:48.250> you<00:02:48.520> can<00:02:48.730> see<00:02:48.760> here<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.780> bottom<00:02:50.230> is

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
um and as you can see here the bottom is

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.570 
um and as you can see here the bottom is
blue<00:02:51.510> so<00:02:52.510> if<00:02:52.900> I<00:02:53.260> put<00:02:53.800> up<00:02:53.950> my<00:02:54.100> hair<00:02:54.310> like<00:02:54.519> this

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
blue so if I put up my hair like this

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.240 
blue so if I put up my hair like this

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
should have done a little bit higher

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.650 
should have done a little bit higher
with<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.860> blue<00:03:03.160> now<00:03:03.550> it's<00:03:03.850> kind<00:03:04.090> of<00:03:04.180> indoor

from the purple alert the blue separate
from<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.880> purple<00:03:25.299> the<00:03:25.450> purple<00:03:25.739> even<00:03:26.739> if<00:03:26.860> the

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
from the purple the purple even if the

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.380 
purple gets in the blue it wouldn't
affect<00:03:29.320> it<00:03:29.739> so<00:03:29.920> much<00:03:30.130> since<00:03:30.430> blue<00:03:30.700> is<00:03:30.910> a<00:03:30.940> darker

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
affect it so much since blue is a darker

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.870 
affect it so much since blue is a darker
color<00:03:31.630> if<00:03:32.230> you<00:03:32.350> have<00:03:32.530> a<00:03:32.560> darker<00:03:33.130> color<00:03:33.430> on<00:03:33.700> the

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
color if you have a darker color on the

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.289

bottom versus the lighter color on top

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.090 
bottom versus the lighter color on top
it's<00:03:37.299> a<00:03:37.480> lot<00:03:37.690> easier<00:03:37.870> to<00:03:38.140> do<00:03:38.440> than<00:03:38.709> the<00:03:38.769> lighter

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
it's a lot easier to do than the lighter

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.180 
it's a lot easier to do than the lighter
color<00:03:39.459> on<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:39.790> bottom<00:03:40.000> because<00:03:40.829> while<00:03:41.829> dying

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
color on the bottom because while dying

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.670 
color on the bottom because while dying
your<00:03:42.400> hair<00:03:42.430> and<00:03:43.000> when<00:03:43.720> you<00:03:43.930> wash<00:03:44.200> your<00:03:44.440> hair

your hair and when you wash your hair
the<00:03:44.950> color<00:03:45.540> like<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.660> color<00:03:46.900> fades<00:03:47.260> out<00:03:47.470> and

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
the color like the color fades out and

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.940 
the color like the color fades out and
blends<00:03:48.190> together<00:03:48.489> when<00:03:49.299> you<00:03:49.600> wash<00:03:50.140> it<00:03:50.440> out<00:03:50.650> and

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
blends together when you wash it out and

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.220 
blends together when you wash it out and
most<00:03:51.549> of<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:51.820> time<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.269> top<00:03:52.540> will<00:03:52.750> bleed<00:03:53.019> onto

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
most of the time the top will bleed onto

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.110 
most of the time the top will bleed onto
the<00:03:53.470> bottom<00:03:53.709> but<00:03:54.640> um<00:03:55.290> that's<00:03:56.290> why<00:03:56.590> I<00:03:57.579> have

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
the bottom but um that's why I have

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.599 
the bottom but um that's why I have
darker<00:03:58.690> color<00:03:58.930> on<00:03:59.049> the<00:03:59.170> bottom<00:03:59.350> and<00:03:59.769> I<00:04:00.220> decided

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
darker color on the bottom and I decided

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.030 
darker color on the bottom and I decided
to<00:04:00.760> pick<00:04:00.970> blue<00:04:01.269> on<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:01.630> bottom<00:04:01.660> because<00:04:02.500> it

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
to pick blue on the bottom because it

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.229 
to pick blue on the bottom because it
stays<00:04:03.400> dark<00:04:04.299> color<00:04:04.660> stay<00:04:04.989> easier<00:04:05.470> to<00:04:06.239> darker

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
stays dark color stay easier to darker

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.009 
stays dark color stay easier to darker
