00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.950
 the object 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.500
 the responsibility and the difficulty 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.700
 who has the project but I'm 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.140
 Wishing to hear again the anthem of 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.200
 barÃ§a al camp nou and listen what is 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.330
 seeing as partners and not as a 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.840
 coach and enjoy them that is 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.570
 about 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.370
 I hope to enjoy very much 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.370
 handsome, high- minded 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.809
 Asturian that could best be defined 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.809
 some the odd player 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.030
 look I do not know a trainer at the end anymore 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.190
 blue controller is a leader and I'm 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.550
 delighted and amazed and have the best 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.430
 please the world the template this is 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.120
 an event impossible to forget and also 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.880
 a fact that motivates me the amount 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.200
 in fact the club thinks the same and is 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.570
 to the same line he just signed his 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.040
 renewal contract with which I read 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.510
 Messi is also happy to follow 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.000
 here he always said by active and by 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.640
 passive and I have read it that I would like 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.080
 finish his career at the club and 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.670
 fantastic there can be a nexus of 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.070
 larger union between three parties that 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.990
 is what is happening here as the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.090
 attack we will play the attack with new 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.830
 how the club has been identified 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.650
 lately football that is attractive 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:44.130
 football that has hooked millions of 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.300
 people in the world hard hand I do not know what 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.640
 what do you understand, hard brother? 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.980
 always positive they always positive 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.620
 do not worry, I do not think I need 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.990
 hard hand I think you need a lot 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.880
 communication but they need those that 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.510
 I need them I need them 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.730
 everyone 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.170
 and all together hand in hand be very 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.820
 demanding at work that already 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.740
 forward I really like that the 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.260
 players train well that not sure 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.100
 nobody crazy could not take bicycles nor 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.630
 weird things 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.490
 I talk with soccer ball work 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.620
 and I think the most beautiful and the most 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.270
 important for a club is this 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.500
 magnitude and of this level is that the 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.660
 players enjoy the training 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.640
 but if we will reinforce if it can be in 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.010
 all the lines with when they are best 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.100
 the players are better for the 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.870
 club better for me 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.870
 and try to have that project 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.550
 exciting or that start that we have 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.800
 started talking about a team that 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.280
 excites everyone yes who has spoken with 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.020
 him with pepe I keep in contact not 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.610
 we are only friends but also these 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.930
 women that contact is maintained 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.930
 which is even easier 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.510
 I would not like to look like those two 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.040
 incoming pieces that you said but I 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.460
 I look like the enrique with which I 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.850
 you're going to have to come up with this version 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.850
 more simple
