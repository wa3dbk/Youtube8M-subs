00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
5 millimeter hex bit to under the pins

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.430 
5 millimeter hex bit to under the pins
that<00:01:04.159> hold<00:01:04.370> the<00:01:04.580> pads<00:01:04.820> in<00:01:05.050> 40<00:01:06.050> millimeter

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
that hold the pads in 40 millimeter

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.200 
that hold the pads in 40 millimeter
socket<00:01:06.890> to<00:01:07.550> take<00:01:07.760> off<00:01:07.940> the<00:01:08.180> caliper<00:01:08.840> bolts<00:01:10.210> now

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
socket to take off the caliper bolts now

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.899 
socket to take off the caliper bolts now
this<00:01:11.360> is<00:01:11.510> a<00:01:11.540> track<00:01:11.810> bike<00:01:12.050> so<00:01:12.370> I'm<00:01:13.370> required<00:01:13.820> to

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
this is a track bike so I'm required to

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.660 
this is a track bike so I'm required to
have<00:01:14.180> the<00:01:14.650> caliper<00:01:15.650> bolts<00:01:15.950> wired<00:01:16.280> what<00:01:17.170> so<00:01:18.170> if

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
have the caliper bolts wired what so if

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.980 
have the caliper bolts wired what so if
yours<00:01:19.670> is<00:01:19.850> not<00:01:20.000> a<00:01:20.030> track<00:01:20.300> bike<00:01:20.510> you<00:01:20.660> won't<00:01:20.840> have

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
yours is not a track bike you won't have

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.280 
yours is not a track bike you won't have
these<00:01:21.140> clips<00:01:21.770> on<00:01:21.950> there<00:01:22.900> so<00:01:23.900> I'll<00:01:23.990> just<00:01:24.140> take

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
these clips on there so I'll just take

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.280 
these clips on there so I'll just take
those<00:01:24.500> out<00:01:24.680> first<00:01:24.950> I<00:01:28.510> like<00:01:29.510> using<00:01:29.690> these<00:01:29.960> clips

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
those out first I like using these clips

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.740 
those out first I like using these clips
because<00:01:30.380> it<00:01:30.590> just<00:01:30.890> makes<00:01:31.130> it<00:01:31.250> very<00:01:31.750> quick

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
because it just makes it very quick

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.080 
because it just makes it very quick
rather<00:01:33.680> than<00:01:33.890> having<00:01:34.010> to<00:01:34.190> read<00:01:34.400> lock<00:01:34.640> wire

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
rather than having to read lock wire

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:45.940 
rather than having to read lock wire
them<00:01:35.330> again<00:01:41.080> loosen<00:01:42.910> the<00:01:43.910> caliper<00:01:44.360> pins<00:01:44.690> first

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
them again loosen the caliper pins first

00:01:45.950 --> 00:02:03.320 
them again loosen the caliper pins first
the<00:01:46.850> brake<00:01:47.030> pad<00:01:47.270> Pete

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:28.979 

now<00:02:04.330> I<00:02:04.360> can<00:02:04.630> take<00:02:05.410> out<00:02:05.650> the<00:02:06.400> caliper<00:02:07.229> bolts

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.080 

because<00:02:29.989> the<00:02:30.200> caliper<00:02:30.800> bolts<00:02:31.099> go<00:02:31.280> into<00:02:31.670> alloy

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
because the caliper bolts go into alloy

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.780 
because the caliper bolts go into alloy
I<00:02:32.360> always<00:02:32.989> put<00:02:33.260> a<00:02:33.290> bit<00:02:33.470> of<00:02:33.590> sort<00:02:34.280> of<00:02:34.310> anti-seize

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
I always put a bit of sort of anti-seize

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.960 
I always put a bit of sort of anti-seize
grease<00:02:35.420> on<00:02:35.599> them<00:02:38.440> so<00:02:39.440> now<00:02:39.620> that<00:02:39.680> I've<00:02:40.580> taken

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
grease on them so now that I've taken

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.290 
grease on them so now that I've taken
those<00:02:41.180> out<00:02:41.360> I<00:02:41.450> can<00:02:41.629> just<00:02:41.750> pull<00:02:41.900> that<00:02:42.019> off<00:02:43.300> like

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
those out I can just pull that off like

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.479 
those out I can just pull that off like
that<00:02:44.510> and<00:02:44.720> there's<00:02:45.019> your<00:02:45.140> pads<00:02:45.380> in<00:02:45.530> there<00:02:45.709> so

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
that and there's your pads in there so

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.729 
that and there's your pads in there so
first<00:02:47.120> thing<00:02:47.330> before<00:02:47.690> you<00:02:47.840> remove<00:02:48.319> the<00:02:48.500> pins

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
first thing before you remove the pins

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.559 
first thing before you remove the pins
completely<00:02:49.340> is<00:02:49.459> just<00:02:49.670> put<00:02:49.819> a<00:02:49.849> screwdriver<00:02:50.150> in

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
completely is just put a screwdriver in

00:02:50.569 --> 00:03:03.490 
completely is just put a screwdriver in
there<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:52.209> push<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.390> piston<00:03:00.790> so<00:03:02.290> they<00:03:03.290> right

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
there and push the piston so they right

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.880 
there and push the piston so they right
back<00:03:03.680> in<00:03:03.890> now<00:03:04.310> I<00:03:04.640> can<00:03:04.910> take<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.239> pins<00:03:05.480> out

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
back in now I can take the pins out

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:22.429 
back in now I can take the pins out
completely

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:22.439 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:25.770

it's the same thing I always a little

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.020 
it's the same thing I always a little
bit<00:03:25.900> of<00:03:26.019> anti-seize<00:03:26.640> grease<00:03:27.640> on<00:03:27.849> those

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
bit of anti-seize grease on those

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.869 
bit of anti-seize grease on those
threads<00:03:31.980> so<00:03:32.980> that<00:03:33.010> pad<00:03:33.459> just<00:03:33.670> fell<00:03:33.849> out

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
threads so that pad just fell out

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:38.940 
threads so that pad just fell out
there's<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:34.840> other<00:03:34.900> one<00:03:34.989> there<00:03:36.120> yeah<00:03:37.950> next

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950

get make sure there's no deposits or
anything<00:03:53.709> on<00:03:53.920> there<00:03:54.069> so<00:03:54.310> they<00:03:54.459> so<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.060> pads

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
anything on there so they so the pads

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:01.530 
anything on there so they so the pads
can<00:03:55.540> slide<00:03:55.840> really<00:03:59.310> so<00:04:00.310> they're<00:04:00.489> all<00:04:00.639> polished

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
can slide really so they're all polished

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:11.940 
can slide really so they're all polished
up<00:04:01.659> nicely<00:04:07.709> here's<00:04:08.709> my<00:04:08.859> new<00:04:09.750> pads<00:04:10.950> sintered

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
up nicely here's my new pads sintered

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:21.029 
up nicely here's my new pads sintered
pads<00:04:17.789> so<00:04:18.789> very<00:04:19.359> simple<00:04:19.780> just<00:04:20.260> put<00:04:20.919> them

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
pads so very simple just put them

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:26.400 
pads so very simple just put them
together<00:04:24.150> grab<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.270> caliper<00:04:25.720> drop<00:04:26.139> them<00:04:26.320> in

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
together grab the caliper drop them in

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:34.439 
together grab the caliper drop them in
there<00:04:26.820> and<00:04:27.820> then<00:04:31.860> wait<00:04:32.860> the<00:04:32.979> pin<00:04:33.220> here<00:04:33.550> I'll

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
there and then wait the pin here I'll

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.120 
there and then wait the pin here I'll
put<00:04:34.660> the<00:04:34.690> top<00:04:34.930> line<00:04:35.080> first<00:04:35.410> just<00:04:35.770> put<00:04:36.039> it

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
put the top line first just put it

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.400 
put the top line first just put it
through<00:04:36.280> it's<00:04:36.550> got<00:04:36.639> to<00:04:36.760> go<00:04:36.880> through<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:40.410> show

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
through it's got to go through the show

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.219 
through it's got to go through the show
this<00:04:41.620> again<00:04:42.150> the<00:04:43.150> P<00:04:43.389> Novus<00:04:43.720> Li<00:04:43.840> has<00:04:43.990> to<00:04:44.110> go

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
this again the P Novus Li has to go

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:52.070 
this again the P Novus Li has to go
through<00:04:44.560> those<00:04:44.740> holes

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.200 

this<00:04:53.080> camera<00:04:54.070> so<00:04:54.340> I<00:04:54.370> push<00:04:54.850> the<00:04:54.970> pin<00:04:55.180> in<00:04:55.890> and

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
this camera so I push the pin in and

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.520 
this camera so I push the pin in and
I've<00:04:58.210> got<00:04:58.270> it<00:04:58.480> through<00:04:58.630> the<00:04:58.750> first<00:04:58.990> hole<00:04:59.230> and

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
I've got it through the first hole and

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.630 
I've got it through the first hole and
then<00:04:59.710> there's<00:05:00.400> a<00:05:00.490> little<00:05:00.790> spring<00:05:02.340> clip<00:05:03.340> here

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
then there's a little spring clip here

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.820 
then there's a little spring clip here
which<00:05:04.060> is<00:05:04.180> an<00:05:04.270> anti-rattle<00:05:04.720> clip<00:05:05.350> so<00:05:05.620> you<00:05:05.650> got

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
which is an anti-rattle clip so you got

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.350 
which is an anti-rattle clip so you got
to<00:05:05.980> make<00:05:06.100> sure<00:05:06.400> that<00:05:06.640> that<00:05:06.820> clip<00:05:07.150> is

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
to make sure that that clip is

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.300 
to make sure that that clip is
underneath<00:05:07.750> the<00:05:07.990> pin<00:05:09.750> so<00:05:10.830> that's<00:05:11.830> through<00:05:12.190> the

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
underneath the pin so that's through the

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:24.710 
underneath the pin so that's through the
second<00:05:12.640> hole<00:05:14.550> and<00:05:15.550> now<00:05:15.760> I<00:05:15.790> can<00:05:18.060> screw<00:05:19.060> that<00:05:19.180> in

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.140 

now<00:05:25.720> the<00:05:25.780> same<00:05:26.080> with<00:05:26.230> the<00:05:26.290> second<00:05:26.650> one

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
now the same with the second one

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.440 
now the same with the second one
put<00:05:28.150> that<00:05:28.270> in<00:05:28.420> there<00:05:29.820> it's<00:05:30.820> through<00:05:31.090> the<00:05:31.210> first

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
put that in there it's through the first

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:37.980 
put that in there it's through the first
hole<00:05:31.660> but<00:05:31.930> I<00:05:32.080> have<00:05:32.290> to<00:05:32.440> push<00:05:32.650> that<00:05:36.990> it's

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
hole but I have to push that it's

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.750 
hole but I have to push that it's
through<00:05:38.200> the<00:05:38.290> first<00:05:38.470> hole<00:05:38.710> but<00:05:39.100> I<00:05:39.400> have<00:05:39.610> to

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
through the first hole but I have to

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.320 
through the first hole but I have to
push<00:05:39.940> that<00:05:40.090> down<00:05:40.450> to<00:05:40.870> get<00:05:41.050> it<00:05:41.170> under<00:05:41.470> and<00:05:42.330> there

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330

simple job and then the last thing to do

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.810 
simple job and then the last thing to do
is<00:07:19.230> just<00:07:19.530> pump<00:07:19.830> the<00:07:19.890> lever<00:07:20.160> that<00:07:20.430> comes<00:07:20.610> back

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:20.820 
is just pump the lever that comes back

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.810 
is just pump the lever that comes back
to<00:07:20.940> the<00:07:21.000> bars<00:07:21.500> and<00:07:22.500> now<00:07:22.980> it's<00:07:23.160> now<00:07:23.400> it's<00:07:23.550> okay

because I have to pump the pads back out
onto<00:07:26.010> the<00:07:26.190> disc<00:07:26.960> one<00:07:27.960> final<00:07:28.380> thing<00:07:28.530> to<00:07:28.590> do

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:28.860 
onto the disc one final thing to do

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.940 
onto the disc one final thing to do
that's<00:07:29.550> a<00:07:29.700> safety<00:07:29.970> measure<00:07:30.270> I<00:07:30.630> always<00:07:31.620> do<00:07:31.800> this

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:31.950 
that's a safety measure I always do this

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.880 
that's a safety measure I always do this
when<00:07:32.160> I<00:07:32.280> replace<00:07:32.580> my<00:07:32.720> brake<00:07:33.720> pads<00:07:33.990> but<00:07:34.650> you<00:07:34.770> get

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:34.890 
when I replace my brake pads but you get

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:38.710 
when I replace my brake pads but you get
a<00:07:34.920> post-it<00:07:35.430> note<00:07:35.460> and<00:07:35.880> you<00:07:36.450> write<00:07:36.720> new<00:07:37.170> pads

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 
a post-it note and you write new pads

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.530 
a post-it note and you write new pads
and<00:07:39.720> just<00:07:39.930> stick<00:07:40.170> that<00:07:40.200> post-it<00:07:40.830> note<00:07:41.390> on<00:07:42.390> the

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:42.540 
and just stick that post-it note on the

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.590 
and just stick that post-it note on the
dashboard<00:07:42.990> just<00:07:43.230> like<00:07:43.410> that<00:07:44.330> because<00:07:45.330> if<00:07:45.480> you

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:45.600 
dashboard just like that because if you

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.690 
dashboard just like that because if you
forget<00:07:45.900> that<00:07:46.050> you've<00:07:46.200> put<00:07:46.410> new<00:07:46.590> pads<00:07:46.860> in<00:07:47.100> and

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:47.700 
forget that you've put new pads in and

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.040 
forget that you've put new pads in and
