00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.769
 welcome to the north of Quito 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.699
 this action is aimed at if the student understands the relationship that 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.579
 exists between the atomic structures of the elements and their position 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:35.210
 on the street to ask 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.210
 as well as the meeting shivering the storm 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.060
 the periodic table that result of the work of several hundred 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.550
 who tried to classify traces in a useful way 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.670
 like the boy with fognini tinayre 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:52.670
 and the German 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.890
 I did not see her 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.290
 15 thousand 862 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.170
 They classified 76 known elements at that time 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.460
 they highlighted 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.980
 than the only ones of the physical and chemical properties of ee 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.210
 occurs periodically if you are to place huge and growing suspense 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.600
 actor 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.660
 merge 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.330
 deco that did not occupy for items that had not yet been 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.300
 discovered 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.670
 but he predicted his property 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.770
 called these elements eca in a child who almost full 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.680
 that would be placed under the hoop 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.890
 and decision in their respective groups 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.000
 today it is known as karim benzema 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.520
 when those elements were discovered 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.080
 it was found that their properties coincided with the hurries with itínere 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.930
 so the value of the periodic table there is lived 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.300
 but nevertheless 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.260
 classify the elements in increasing order of their atomic weights 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
 had some irregularities 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.190
 like the one that occurs when placing the bow instead of potash 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.249
 in the opinion of santo domingo - ap 

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:05.750
 when arriving 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.029
 which would represent a year 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:11.039
 since the properties of both elements are very different 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.349
 if on this occasion very active metal 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.829
 and the bow a similar case 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.109
 these drawbacks were overcome 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:21.119
 when in 1913 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:23.599
 the English physicist want to live 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.439
 assign a whole number to each element 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:28.539
 called marathon 

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:29.659
 what is the same 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:34.769
 to the number of protons that someone in a shot in equal amount of electrons that 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.659
 they are in the act mónica gangemi 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:39.270
 a unique contract 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.730
 determines the structure of atoms 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.039
 and the civic behavior of the viewers 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:49.949
 the modern penal law establishes that the properties of the elements 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:52.949
 they are periodic crucials of their atomic numbers 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.899
 the periodic table consists of seven horizontal rows 

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:03.509
 called periods 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:08.479
 that correspond to each of the seven stages with energy levels of the 

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:11.629
 antonyms where the electrons are 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:16.549
 that is, the number of the period where an element is found indicates the 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.340
 maximum energy level 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.349
 where he took it from this element has readers 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:26.379
 for example the sodium whose electronic configuration airs 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:30.899
 has an electron in the third energy level 

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:32.120
 Thus 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.120
 is in period 3 of the periodic table 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:43.609
 the elements with similar chemical properties are forming groups 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:44.789
 with families 

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:47.789
 which are the vertical columns of the periodic table 

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:52.019
 to groups that assign them Roman numerals from one to eight 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:58.329
 so that the elements with similar properties are placed some work of 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.139
 others the groups that have divided into active groups 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.589
 the elements of the groups 

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:10.469
 they are called representative elements and two of the groups b elements of 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:12.139
 transition 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.930
 the group number where an item is found match the number of 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.229
 electrons that took it from this element have at the maximum energy level 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.550
 so in the case of sodium 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.520
 who have electoral in the third level of energy 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.389
 is located in group 1ra 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:31.870
 the chlorine 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.870
 has the electronic configuration 

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:41.009
 As you can see it has 17 electrone distributed in three energy levels 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.940
 Thus 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.539
 is in period 3 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:50.309
 there are seven electrons that are at the highest level and 

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:53.129
 this reason is located in group 7 a
