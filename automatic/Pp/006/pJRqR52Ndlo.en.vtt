photographers for many years I think I
bought<00:01:13.020> my<00:01:13.170> first<00:01:13.200> one

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
bought my first one

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.609 
bought my first one
you<00:01:14.460> know<00:01:14.580> maybe<00:01:15.330> 20<00:01:15.840> years<00:01:15.990> ago<00:01:16.259> maybe<00:01:16.470> even

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
you know maybe 20 years ago maybe even

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.940 
you know maybe 20 years ago maybe even
longer<00:01:17.009> ago<00:01:17.520> it's<00:01:18.450> been<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.840> standard<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
longer ago it's been a standard in the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.520 
longer ago it's been a standard in the
industry<00:01:20.240> you<00:01:21.240> know<00:01:21.330> for<00:01:21.750> easily<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.290> long

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
industry you know for easily that long

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.399 
industry you know for easily that long
so<00:01:23.280> what<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.909> it's<00:01:24.210> an<00:01:24.360> indirect<00:01:24.900> softbox

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
so what it is it's an indirect softbox

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.070 
so what it is it's an indirect softbox
most<00:01:26.220> softboxes<00:01:26.850> are<00:01:27.000> direct<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.659> lamp<00:01:27.869> head

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
most softboxes are direct the lamp head

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.410 
most softboxes are direct the lamp head
goes<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.130> softbox<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.759> points<00:01:30.119> towards

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
goes in the softbox and points towards

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.109 
goes in the softbox and points towards
the<00:01:30.479> subject<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.740> enormous<00:01:32.310> softbox

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
the subject in this enormous softbox

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.929 
the subject in this enormous softbox
the<00:01:33.540> lamp<00:01:33.840> head<00:01:34.020> gets<00:01:34.320> turned<00:01:34.619> around<00:01:34.880> okay<00:01:35.880> so

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
the lamp head gets turned around okay so

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.030 
the lamp head gets turned around okay so
the<00:01:36.210> strobe<00:01:36.509> head<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.020> flash<00:01:37.290> head<00:01:37.590> actually

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
the strobe head the flash head actually

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.429 
the strobe head the flash head actually
radiates<00:01:38.670> away<00:01:38.970> from<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.299> subject<00:01:39.689> into<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
radiates away from the subject into the

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.350 
radiates away from the subject into the
silver<00:01:40.829> interior<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.520> box<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.000> then

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
silver interior of the box and then

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.359 
silver interior of the box and then
radiates<00:01:42.869> through<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.320> diffusion<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.189> very

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
radiates through the diffusion in a very

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.450 
radiates through the diffusion in a very
smooth<00:01:44.670> even<00:01:44.909> way<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:46.079> can<00:01:46.380> ramp<00:01:47.040> up<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
smooth even way you can ramp up the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.700 
smooth even way you can ramp up the
power<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.390> softness<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.290> by

power of this the softness of it by

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.370 
power of this the softness of it by
moving<00:01:49.950> your<00:01:50.100> subject<00:01:50.610> close<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.570> here<00:01:51.869> I'm<00:01:52.049> on
