totally handmade we just for fought for
the<00:00:37.110> original<00:00:37.710> flaw<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.760> could<00:00:38.940> use<00:00:39.059> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
the original flaw so I could use the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.410 
the original flaw so I could use the
title<00:00:39.660> for<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.110> right<00:00:40.559> we<00:00:41.160> use<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.489> roof<00:00:41.670> but

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
title for it right we use the roof but

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.310 
title for it right we use the roof but
then<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.570> chopped<00:00:42.899> it

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
then I chopped it

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.440

I made this gold wing door out of it and

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.330 
I made this gold wing door out of it and
put<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> spoiler<00:00:46.110> on<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.649> there's<00:00:47.190> nothing

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
put the spoiler on so there's nothing

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.910

horsepower<00:01:48.799> now<00:01:49.799> if<00:01:49.950> we<00:01:50.299> we<00:01:51.299> can<00:01:51.479> make<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.720> more

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
horsepower now if we we can make it more

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.570 
horsepower now if we we can make it more
by<00:01:52.049> put<00:01:52.290> more<00:01:52.500> nitrous<00:01:52.890> through<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.460> stage

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
by put more nitrous through that stage

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.820 
by put more nitrous through that stage
we<00:01:55.330> can<00:01:55.480> easily<00:01:55.720> make<00:01:55.870> these<00:01:55.990> six<00:01:56.350> with<00:01:56.470> a<00:01:56.560> boss

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
we can easily make these six with a boss

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.520 
we can easily make these six with a boss
if<00:01:57.100> you<00:01:57.130> went<00:01:57.400> crazy<00:01:57.580> but<00:02:00.930> just<00:02:01.930> a<00:02:01.990> nice<00:02:02.140> number

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
if you went crazy but just a nice number

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.090 
if you went crazy but just a nice number
and<00:02:03.400> in<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.550> cart<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:03.910> holy<00:02:04.090> weighs<00:02:05.100> 200

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
and in the cart the holy weighs 200

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.660 
and in the cart the holy weighs 200
pounds

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
pounds

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.230 
pounds
it's<00:02:07.660> the<00:02:08.560> power-to-weight<00:02:08.890> ratio<00:02:09.460> is<00:02:09.700> more

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
it's the power-to-weight ratio is more

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.880
