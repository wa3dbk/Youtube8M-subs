my in-laws over the summer of 2014 is

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.250 
my in-laws over the summer of 2014 is
very<00:02:12.599> difficult<00:02:13.020> too

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260

a<00:02:13.290> 3d<00:02:13.769> character<00:02:13.980> on<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:14.489> hungry<00:02:15.030> car<00:02:16.040> ride

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.660 
a 3d character on a hungry car ride
maybe<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.120> why<00:02:18.269> foxy<00:02:18.720> looks<00:02:18.959> so<00:02:19.110> torn<00:02:19.409> up

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
maybe this is why foxy looks so torn up

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.869 
maybe this is why foxy looks so torn up
while<00:02:20.670> we<00:02:20.909> were<00:02:21.090> there<00:02:21.299> visiting<00:02:21.750> my<00:02:22.260> kids<00:02:22.879> got

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
while we were there visiting my kids got

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.740 
while we were there visiting my kids got
to<00:02:25.430> experience<00:02:26.430> Fox's<00:02:27.060> jumps<00:02:27.360> here<00:02:27.480> for<00:02:27.659> the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
to experience Fox's jumps here for the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.300 
to experience Fox's jumps here for the
first<00:02:27.989> time<00:02:29.599> so<00:02:30.599> I<00:02:30.959> think<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.920> game<00:02:32.069> might<00:02:32.280> be

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
first time so I think the game might be

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.520 
first time so I think the game might be
over<00:02:32.430> like<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.239> trilogy<00:02:33.690> it<00:02:33.780> says<00:02:33.959> here<00:02:34.319> in

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530
