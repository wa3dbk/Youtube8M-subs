00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.290
 hard bump on the different stages 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.330
 the frosting deco the deco I 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.259
 precise before sending the images 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.689

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.899

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.350
 simply make apple brownies 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.689
 I also wanted to show you what 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.210
 I found today yesterday and 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.159
 today in my calendar of 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.549
 the advent so it's a chocolate 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.619
 black of the mini bar of dark chocolate 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.960
 ginger lemon from Sri Lanka and 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.150
 nerds and youth is always the 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.670
 case but this time in version 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.260
 gold to realize my tree I will therefore 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.120
 first prepare my brownies without 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.520
 butter I did not film the preparation 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.480
 since you can find it on my 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.580
 main chain 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.650
 you can of course use 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.570
 any classic recipe from 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.630
 brownies can be found everywhere on the web 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.670
 and even cheated and buy a brownie 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.560
 already done that you will only have to cut out 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.030
 and ice cream and I have reduced 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.520
 proportions for this video for 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.259
 prepare a tiny little brawn will go for 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.710
 that triangles be easier to 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.720
 cut 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.610
 but that will think fine but I will 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.320
 advise to prepare a brownie well 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.070
 at least one centimeter thick 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.050
 thick 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.760
 respect the proportions of the 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.390
 recipe from my main channel and this 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.370
 will be perfect 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.920
 you can even double them to do 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.330
 a good big thick brownie for 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.550
 to realize these fir trees he will have to 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.959
 prepare a glaze usually for 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.900
 kind of deco we prepare what we 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.970
 calls a royal icing this is a 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.590
 icing with icing sugar and white 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.090
 Eggs personally for 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.080
 pastries that I will keep off 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.840
 from the refrigerator 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.420
 I prefer to prepare them with water from 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.519
 milk or lemon juice here I use 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.950
 lemon juice that I mix with my 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.320
 icing sugar for the frosting had a 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.160
 tablespoon of lemon juice for 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.840
 so good tablespoon of icing sugar 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.550
 do not hesitate if necessary added 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.830
 one or two spoons of icing sugar 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.600
 you have to get a paste that does not 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.640
 dripping rappaz from your brownies 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.160
 then add your green dye 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.080
 red yellow no dye if you 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.880
 want a white frosting when your 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.280
 brownies and cooked and completely 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.620
 chilled cut out small triangles 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.209
 being careful not to crumble too much 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.430
 the brownie once you have 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.050
 cut out your triangle it will suffice in 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.390
 cuts and also the edges up 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.280
 get the shape you want them 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.750
 edges you're going to eat why 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.820
 because we must not spoil 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.200
 so here I cut small fir trees 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.600
 but you can use 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.970
 cookie cutters cut out stars from 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.090
 Hearts rocket devotee of lap 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.280
 eco pages chicken fields of the kitchen 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.900
 absolutely everything you want when 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.580
 you will have cut out your shapes this will be 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.799
 the icing step you can use 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.810
 for that simple bags of 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.570
 freezing you will have cut 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.639
 the ends and of course a pocket to 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.769
 socket choose for contours and 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:57.440
 the small patterns the tips the most 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.450
 possible endings here i'm going to use a 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.400
 sleeve pocket for glass and a bag 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.660
 freezing for red like that 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.299
 you will see how I proceed 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.100
 with both for the deco use 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.109
 absolutely everything you want and 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.820
 they are preferably edible 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:12.380
 I always have a pot of 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.690
 vermicelli sugar and christmas and some 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.400
 express icing tubes but you can 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.700
 use absolutely everything you 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.700
 want 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.570

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.479
 then fill in the interior of the 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:44.370
 form that you will draw the 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.860
 outline will have slightly dry and 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:50.479
 will prevent the rest of the frosting from 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.479
 dripping from your brownies 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.900
