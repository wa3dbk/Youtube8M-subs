00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.089
 by 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:14.900
 Hello friends with you de space 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.709
 finally engaged in the passage of personal 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.810
 combat missions 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:19.789
 debt and of course was going to a little 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.000
 prompted me to get 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.759
 promotion t-55a and here are a few days already 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.919
 torment tasks for a light tank so what am I 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.410
 I can say for a long time I could not complete the tasks 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:33.620
 where you need platoon artillery and now 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.140
 stuck on 15 tasks by itself I am so 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.420
 a player that is not particularly professional on lt 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.550
 shines all my attempts to illuminate 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.860
 comes in the end some kind of meat grinder 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.260
 I mostly just do not have enough 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.870
 patience to stand somewhere and somewhere not 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.090
 shoot so it turns out that 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.430
 me to shoot homework much easier than 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.740
 in the world but the problem is that even 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.600
 when I try to bargain nasvete fifth 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.820
 point so to say giving light 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.190
 shoot at him just no one either 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.320
 allies in the second minute everyone dies 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.780
 or how madmen go all forward 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.060
 pushing everything in its path in any 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.610
 the case is all a matter of chance and very 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.390
 much depends on the card which 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.700
 will fall 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.280
 when here I took some task and 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.929
 try and try and do as on 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.749
 evil for some reason does not work 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:22.700
 Of course it is not with all the tasks so to 

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:25.189
 but more so 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.679
 problem number two is what's for this 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.359
 desirable but he is not even as desirable 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:31.340
 need good lt 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:33.350
 I personally have only one in the hangar 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.689
 the representative of the given eye never 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.020
 I didn’t play much on them and therefore 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:41.450
 have to ride amx-13 75 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.450
 French would not say that this is one of 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.789
 my favorite cars or whatever it is 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.469
 of the best light tanks many of his 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.290
 in general, only mud watered 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.330
 and I am personally neutral 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.700
 I would not say about him that he is straight 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.980
 frank slice of brown but 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.110
 this is a tank from the discharge well, you know how 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.870
 come in and vangar such a strip 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.870
 scrolling over here over here over 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.510
 I thought and remember, but to me , lt-15 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.830
 need to make a small grimace in 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.510
 clicking on 13 75 and sent him to battle 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.750
 some time ago its kind of like even 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.390
 apn promised and whether to patch almost 960 iv 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.250
 97 I don’t remember exactly but now we 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.740
 we'll probably wait the same 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.350
 how many are already coming to here is a new physics and 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.870
 wait tanks and skirmishes cards what about 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.390
 tank itself speed and maneuverability not 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.270
 the best yes I would say at all she 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.490
 even not very much seems to me that 13 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.770
 75 there would be a lot of fans 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.380
 if he was given the same maneuverability 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.050
 but at least as in ltb for example so that he 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.120
 become so bright and at least 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.010
 quietly circle the enemy so he does not have 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.290
 it turns out and there is no armor at all and 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.870
 maneuverability and you really broneprobitie 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.300
 no his weapon if i'm not mistaken have 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.220
 somewhere 100 44 millimeter pierce and 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.530
 and from the pluses then remains only 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.450
 the drum personally I myself ride only 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.970
 Goldie well, I have of course one 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.430
 a cassette with babes can someone for me 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.980
 I judged it but not really having any 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.440
 pluses need at least for sure to drink 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.420
 of enemies 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.790
 Of course, not all even Golda dozens 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.790
 make their way through every projectile but this though 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.620
 would already have something one plus 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.280
 the fact that I can not go so long 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.470
 Tasks on lt precisely on 13 75 and plus this 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.410
 is that before that he then 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.310
 there was a tank was rusted covered in dust 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.350
 me in the hangar 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.750
 and now I have only a couple left 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:36.080
 tens of thousands before the discovery of all to the pain 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:39.860
 famous mx 1390 and I already without hope 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.140
 something to go to 1375 dokachivat to 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.510
 devinyastika and then something better think everything 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.090
 in a row I generally wait and see on 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.190
 this I will finish you successfully today 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.890
 performance of tasks and of course less 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:56.620
 plums random on this all new 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.620
 meetings with you was de space bye bye
