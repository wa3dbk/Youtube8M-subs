00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.659 
and all real I think for the most fans
if<00:05:27.270> Lawler<00:05:27.990> had<00:05:28.259> just<00:05:28.919> been<00:05:29.070> a<00:05:29.099> little<00:05:29.460> more

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
if Lawler had just been a little more

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.159 
if Lawler had just been a little more
active<00:05:29.910> he<00:05:30.360> could<00:05:30.570> be<00:05:30.720> the<00:05:30.840> welterweight

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
active he could be the welterweight

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.260 
active he could be the welterweight
champion<00:05:31.830> now<00:05:32.280> he<00:05:32.340> has<00:05:32.639> something<00:05:33.150> to<00:05:33.180> prove
