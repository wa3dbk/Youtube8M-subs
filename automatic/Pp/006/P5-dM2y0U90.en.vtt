00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:20.230
 Only those who talk about hyper tutorials 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.480
 First of all, I apologize for the 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.910
 delay of the video for some time that I 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.970
 I did not like a video on the channel either. 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.310
 so come on and I'll show you this today. 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.610
 tool that I as a technician considers 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.050
 one of the best is the combo fix and dance 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.260
 symbol that looks like one of those 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.850
 I doubt thundercat for who remembers 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.190
 I'm not that old so personal but it's 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.160
 I was going to repeat 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.949
 so folks that the combo fixed but he is 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.230
 one of the best best removers 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.469
 both of problems in system programs 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.929
 on windows how much of a virus it 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.179
 removes some viruses as well and even some 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:03.039
 from those to me those praguinhas de 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:07.090
 browser knows web type to be x that 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:08.950
 123 everything is not always there not 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.600
 more indicated but it is very indicated 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.280
 for when your computer workshops 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.520
 speak my windows alert and have no 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.200
 explanation is that you have to 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.430
 run as fix it can find 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.369
 various problems 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.380
 the only measure you have that you have 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.590
 to take before executing it is to 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.750
 to use antivirus just like my avast 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.299
 You click will control the motorcycles. 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.119
 control modules and has disable 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:37.270
 until you restart your computer for how long 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.009
 Do you want to fix it? It depends. 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.750
 the size of your hd also if you 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.799
 you have many files to search 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:47.229
 it can take up to 20 minutes half an hour 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.340
 but usually is a little less 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.719
 I'll start running it here more. 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.969
 I do not know what's going to happen because 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:56.469
 he has it close the programs then 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:59.409
 it may close until the recording 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:01.659
 this recording I'm doing but the 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.810
 Fixed exchange is simple you accept 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.090
 continues it opens one up 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.899
 Blue stays that blue screen and goes 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.420
 showing progress of one up to 100% 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.400
 When it is finished, it restarts the 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.340
 computer or just a few blinks in the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.190
 screen and generates a huge text file 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.769
 a crazy end report that he did 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.230
 when this final report this file 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.239
 the notepad appears is 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.880
 finished and you can close the 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.870
 notes and the computer talimping you go 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.870
 see that something is going to change 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.600
 so let's run the cool combo here 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.440
 with this is the little screen he shows 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.440
 during startup 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:03:01.560
 it's all normal he does all this 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:03:08.910
 progress really come on come on let's go 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:10.650
 let personal else is normal 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.470
 time you have to run as fixed 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.530
 it makes an initial progress and 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.989
 It takes everything to appear until 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.609
 blue line that is the screen that it shows 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.780
 then where it will show the progress 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.780
 one to one hundred percent 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.560
 he is starting to prepare for 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.560
 start 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.260
 the staff, that's it, I will not let it 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.450
 continue here otherwise it will disturb 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.400
 even the video recording but that's what he 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.049
 does he close everything will try 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.359
 stop the antivirus or ask for it 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:58.290
 you can use it there it will start the progress 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.290
 one to one hundred percent
