00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 or the slope I already had here bad manuel 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.370
 in word of the two today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:12.360
 to get it logan's run yes where 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.509
 We are at the end of the line if we have 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.670
 thrown from tundra express we have 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.770
 come here this piece what 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.010
 will recognize because basically we're going to 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.680
 have to go before or after we 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.930
 like it or not and the boss is also going to 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.060
 have to find which one is virgin yes 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.710
 As I'm saying, we're not going to have them 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.470
 what find we like more or we like 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.980
 less because because he is a boss is part 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.710
 of the adventure so well at least 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.780
 we are going to have to face him yes 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.940
 but you do not need to unlock it any 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.850
 mission or any weird story so 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.879
 nothing here we do not have anymore 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:56.149
 we started and how we started this boss there 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.920
 to be quick fast fast attacking them 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.210
 you are not seeing here how he attacked the most 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.280
 fast possible because you have to be fast 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.890
 because this boss in a mijita gives us the 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.009
 can roll your attack range let's say 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.930
 which is from near and far is to say 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.000
 we are going to have to be at a 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.759
 half distance so he does not attack us 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.740
 if we are very close will use this the 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.850
 rotating fists and if we are far 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.759
 will shoot missiles or start calling more 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:29.450
 hyperion repair robots so 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.960
 which will give him more shield and we 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.240
 it will make much much much more bad 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.990
 but good if you follow these tips more 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.710
 or less we can take 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:45.850
 It will make the task a bit easier for us here 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.670
 how are they watching we attack you fast and 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.540
 with corrosive weapons because with weapons 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.670
 corrosive 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.460
 put if you have the red bar 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.500
 that means it 's human not that clear 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.140
 is what this enemy means but not 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.479
 it's armored so the best weapons 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.140
 against limited objectives is how 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:09.399
 I have always been hitting them with weapons 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.410
 corrosive or with explosive weapons and 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.569
 It's that easy, so you know 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.610
 look for your best corrosive weapon or 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.549
 better explosive they have and attack you 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.950
 fast as every enemy has its point 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.959
 weak and its weak point is basically the 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.110
 head what we are seeing if 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.959
 basically the head you have to kill him 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.790
 fast because you have to kill him fast yes 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.480
 I know that he has repeated me again because 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:38.950
 it will simply create more stevedores and 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.569
 how it starts there all over the whole 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.270
 scenario for all this scenario and 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.680
 start to 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.650
 dig up the train cars to 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.900
 raise them and then you will have 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.780
 reinforcements of hyperion robots and 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.500
 other people and we will be more 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.970
 difficult the task so eye on the data and 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.130
 stay with that 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.290
 here we are seeing it in example if 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.330
 I'm fighting against him very well 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.970
 removed the view is defending very 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.070
 well there is no robot that repairs or anything and 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.900
 now look at me they are launching missiles me 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.280
 has left a lot now is hitting me 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.710
 almost body to body because it has 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.720
 approached a lot and what is going to 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:21.530
 look for now let's say that your 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:25.160
 reinforcements was going to unearth the trains 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.650
 the wagons of trains or throws it to us 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.380
 there you have more robots and more help but 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:34.490
 good so you already know fast with him and 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.690
 here what would spoil the logan's run and 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.050
 logan's boom 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.660
 the truth is that a good damage to do 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.670
 a gun is not very high very high but 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.980
 good within what fits precision 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.100
 very good rate of normal fire and 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.360
 is and 24 the size of charger the 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.940
 description is much more than a weapon 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.430
 go go with the gun has a good end 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.790
 accuracy of the good good weapon does not pass 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.690
 nothing the bullet that consumes when shooting is 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.360
 increases the accuracy 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:11.550
 well let's see let's tell him to see 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.550
 what is your effect what are you seeing 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:18.340
 a wall is shot at an object 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.770
 solid and bursts the bullet after here 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.360
 you are watching me you have to be careful 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:24.730
 because I can kill myself 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.670
 same unintentionally when firing this weapon 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.460
 then life not so let's say a 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.740
 combination of torque and hyperion almost no 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.220
 if the truth is that we could say that 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:39.130
 it's a combination the truth is that this 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.600
 weapon only comes out in two effects in effect 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:47.260
 and neutral is to say without effect and in 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:50.440
 fire igneous effect remember only those 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:53.170
 two effects then clear if we shoot 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.110
 the objective directly is going to be like 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:58.200
 a normal shot 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:01.110
 go no yes yes the truth is that yes go 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:04.470
 go go however if we shoot at 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.810
 I am the granaditas that throws the 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.660
 bullet will then explode under the 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.850
 enemy and do not see what show here 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.720
 they have me using one of fire and one 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:18.540
 normal and go go what way 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.520
 true of causing the mess to mess up that 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.440
 it is not messing up the one that is not 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:27.040
 written the truth is yes 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.840
 It is very fun to use and also very 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.990
 funny 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.150
 but I are just over here watching the 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:37.300
 gun could kill me with it like I did not 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.520
 realize it does not hurt much that's what 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.349
 bad and the shot 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.229
 if it is given directly as I am 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:46.300
 saying there's going to be almost no harm 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.819
 you have to point to the ground and wait for 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.979
 exploit what the truth makes this 

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:52.979
 weapon is very tedious to use 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:59.110
 if it has a separate probability it has 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.860
 a very low probability of being 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:05.260
 1 percent or less so it's going to 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:07.900
 worth the gun itself deserves the 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:10.600
 worth the truth the truth is not 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:13.420
 because what is the effect of a 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.670
 truth is that it takes away a lot of much 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.770
 grace to the weapon 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.690
 for whom truth is recommended 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.170
 which is a legendary weapon that is that 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.550
 I almost do not recommend it to anyone 

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:27.040
 happen to them well then and if 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.440
 chance does not come out well too well 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.820
 because in any case here it is clear 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.740
 that I am fighting with enemies of 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.810
 maximum level up there is well worth it 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.270
 I understand but within what is not 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:41.290
 the weapon is not worth much, so 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:43.270
 nothing even with the weak improves a 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.640
 little even with the drink so 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.560
 look at you and you have to have that 

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.830
 Be careful not to kill him 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.830
 alone 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:55.809
 so friends then you recommend 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.879
 Well, who are you watching only for 

00:06:55.809 --> 00:07:00.520
 enemies that go melee and 

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:02.860
 for all the fauna in general of Pandora 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.659
 all the enemies in short to all 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.180
 the enemies and that every attack on body 

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:10.360
 to body it will be necessary to have them more or less 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.860
 at a prudential distance and calculate 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.499
 that they do not tie us that as it has done to me 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:17.199
 fish fossil and is already starting to 

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:19.509
 plant the bombs under him shoot 

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:22.419
 shoot shoot they are exploding 

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:23.620
 go exploding and the enemies look like 

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:26.889
 that what are floating between 

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:29.529
 explosions and little else because the truth 

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:32.080
 the weapon as I have been saying, no no 

00:07:29.529 --> 00:07:35.289
 it's really worth the truth is yes 

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:38.729
 it's an incredible disappointment has a 

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:41.849
 small damage the effect the truth is that 

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:45.260
 It takes away a lot of grace and apart is a 

00:07:41.849 --> 00:07:49.220
 weapon very hard to get 

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:53.090
 so nothing and I'll let that go to paul 

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:56.780
 virgin remember they have little chance 

00:07:53.090 --> 00:08:01.560
 of European this weapon only two come out 

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:04.380
 igneous effects and without elementary effects 

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:08.120
 and that's basically not a weapon that I 

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:10.310
 strongly recommends nor 

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.130
 and that I really like the truth is that 

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:14.630
 is one of the ones that disappointed me the most 

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:18.699
 and now nothing as I always say thank you 

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:18.699
 for having seen me and a hug to all
