characters<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.190> think<00:01:08.220> women<00:01:09.180> will<00:01:09.390> really

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
characters I think women will really

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.020 
characters I think women will really
relate<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.440> actually<00:01:10.799> women<00:01:11.400> will<00:01:11.729> enjoy

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
relate to and actually women will enjoy

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.160 
relate to and actually women will enjoy
seeing<00:01:12.890> in<00:01:13.890> movies<00:01:14.479> and<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.540> think<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.020> people

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
seeing in movies and I think the people

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.600 
seeing in movies and I think the people
who<00:01:16.290> are<00:01:16.440> sort<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.710> best<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.190> choose<00:01:17.399> those

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
who are sort of best to choose those

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.940 
who are sort of best to choose those
kinds<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.090> things<00:01:18.420> are<00:01:18.600> women<00:01:19.200> themselves<00:01:19.409> so

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
kinds of things are women themselves so

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.649 
kinds of things are women themselves so
I<00:01:20.190> think<00:01:20.520> it's<00:01:20.729> really<00:01:20.940> I<00:01:21.090> think<00:01:21.210> it'll<00:01:21.479> be

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
I think it's really I think it'll be

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:22.789 
I think it's really I think it'll be
very<00:01:21.810> clear<00:01:22.140> when<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.350> audience<00:01:22.530> sees<00:01:22.649> the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
very clear when the audience sees the

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.710 
very clear when the audience sees the
movie<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.159> Sophia<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.700> really<00:01:24.119> chose

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
movie that Sophia and I really chose

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.120 
movie that Sophia and I really chose
these<00:01:24.960> characters<00:01:25.380> when<00:01:25.619> we<00:01:25.740> thought<00:01:25.920> this

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
these characters when we thought this

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.969 
these characters when we thought this
was<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.580> great<00:01:26.700> story<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.299> think<00:01:28.170> always<00:01:28.560> when

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
was a great story I think always when

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.410 
was a great story I think always when
you're<00:01:29.130> making<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.490> choice<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.729> comes<00:01:30.210> from

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
you're making a choice that comes from

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.899 
you're making a choice that comes from
your<00:01:30.539> heart<00:01:30.600> people<00:01:31.590> respond<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.070> that
