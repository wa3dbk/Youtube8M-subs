00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.140 
well this is a microwave that works that
is<00:00:15.330> not<00:00:15.890> so<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:16.920> realize<00:00:17.730> that<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:17.940> could<00:00:18.060> just

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
is not so I realize that you could just

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.179 
is not so I realize that you could just
use<00:00:18.359> furnaces<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:19.529> cook<00:00:19.710> me<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.039> everything

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
use furnaces to cook me and everything

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.670 
use furnaces to cook me and everything
like<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.460> but<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.910> like<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:22.199> method<00:00:22.650> a

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
like that but I like this method a

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.620 
like that but I like this method a
little<00:00:22.830> bit<00:00:22.920> more<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.850> one<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.180> just<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:24.570> you

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
little bit more this one is just so you

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.480 
little bit more this one is just so you
can<00:00:24.720> have<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.900> little<00:00:25.050> prop<00:00:25.350> in<00:00:25.500> your<00:00:25.619> house<00:00:25.769> but

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
can have a little prop in your house but

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.240 
can have a little prop in your house but
this<00:00:26.760> one<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.210> real<00:00:27.359> deal<00:00:27.599> so<00:00:28.380> basically

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
this one is the real deal so basically

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.669 
this one is the real deal so basically
how<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.460> works<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.720> can<00:00:31.050> see<00:00:31.230> inside<00:00:31.529> the

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
how it works is you can see inside the

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.420 
how it works is you can see inside the
glass<00:00:31.859> right<00:00:32.070> there<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.719> cook's<00:00:33.719> via<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:35.130> kills

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
glass right there a cook's via and kills

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.100 
glass right there a cook's via and kills
it's<00:00:35.969> like<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.120> slaughterhouse<00:00:36.600> basically

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
it's like a slaughterhouse basically

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.650 
it's like a slaughterhouse basically
inside<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.500> thing<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:38.460> what<00:00:38.579> happens<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.149> when

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
inside the thing so what happens is when

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.290 
inside the thing so what happens is when
you<00:00:39.750> press<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.170> button<00:00:40.430> it<00:00:41.430> goes<00:00:41.489> ahead<00:00:41.910> and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
you press the button it goes ahead and

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.200 
you press the button it goes ahead and
it<00:00:42.480> sends<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.870> signal<00:00:43.350> down<00:00:43.590> here<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:45.059> it

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
it sends the signal down here I have it

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.080 
it sends the signal down here I have it
set<00:00:45.390> up<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:45.739> when<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.070> button<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.640> pressed<00:00:47.850> it

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
set up so when the button is pressed it

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.430 
set up so when the button is pressed it
also<00:00:48.329> lights<00:00:48.510> up<00:00:48.629> some<00:00:48.809> lights<00:00:49.020> like<00:00:49.289> your

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
also lights up some lights like your

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.350 
also lights up some lights like your
microwave<00:00:49.739> does<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.340> your<00:00:50.460> house<00:00:50.579> basically

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
microwave does in your house basically

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.850 
microwave does in your house basically
so<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.840> goes<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.140> different<00:00:52.289> lights<00:00:52.590> both

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
so it goes to different lights both

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.910 
so it goes to different lights both
above<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.640> below<00:00:53.760> but<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.480> main<00:00:55.350> thing<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.649> it

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
above and below but the main thing is it

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.560 
above and below but the main thing is it
splits<00:00:56.160> into<00:00:56.250> two<00:00:56.550> directions<00:00:57.030> above<00:00:57.360> and

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
splits into two directions above and

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.319 
splits into two directions above and
below<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.010> below<00:00:59.010> thing<00:00:59.340> we'll<00:00:59.520> get<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.789> it<00:01:00.000> in

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
below the below thing we'll get to it in

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.060 
below the below thing we'll get to it in
a<00:01:00.750> second<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.410> above<00:01:01.620> thing<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:01.949> right

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
a second and the above thing is right

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.650 
a second and the above thing is right
here<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.059> press<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.329> button<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.629> goes

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
here so you press the button it goes

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.240 
here so you press the button it goes
across<00:01:04.019> here<00:01:04.379> then<00:01:04.559> comes<00:01:04.739> over<00:01:04.949> here<00:01:05.129> and

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
across here then comes over here and

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.440 
across here then comes over here and
that<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.610> could<00:01:05.700> split<00:01:05.939> off<00:01:06.030> into<00:01:06.210> two

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
that it could split off into two

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.330 
that it could split off into two
different<00:01:06.689> directions<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.799> first<00:01:08.010> direction

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
different directions the first direction

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.510 
different directions the first direction
is<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.939> instant<00:01:09.750> contact<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.740> instantly<00:01:11.280> goes

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
is a instant contact it instantly goes

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.330 
is a instant contact it instantly goes
here<00:01:11.880> whereas<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.180> second<00:01:12.479> direction<00:01:12.630> is

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
here whereas the second direction is

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.210 
here whereas the second direction is
like<00:01:14.340> delayed<00:01:14.900> so<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.049> first<00:01:16.290> connection

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
like delayed so the first connection

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.010 
like delayed so the first connection
goes<00:01:17.490> ahead<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.850> these<00:01:17.970> repeaters<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.450> powers

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
goes ahead to these repeaters and powers

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.890 
goes ahead to these repeaters and powers
these<00:01:19.320> dispensers<00:01:19.920> with<00:01:20.159> cows<00:01:20.970> down<00:01:21.420> here<00:01:21.689> and

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
these dispensers with cows down here and

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.570 
these dispensers with cows down here and
fire<00:01:22.110> charges<00:01:22.590> inside<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.220> these<00:01:23.340> all<00:01:23.400> have

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
fire charges inside so these all have

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.399 
fire charges inside so these all have
fire<00:01:23.939> charges<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:24.600> them<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:25.020> put<00:01:25.170> as<00:01:25.290> many

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
fire charges in them you can put as many

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.780 
fire charges in them you can put as many
as<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.680> want<00:01:25.890> or<00:01:26.009> anything<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.580> want

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
as you want or anything that you want

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.960 
as you want or anything that you want
but<00:01:27.509> fire<00:01:27.689> charges<00:01:28.110> work<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:29.310> basically<00:01:29.759> what

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
but fire charges work so basically what

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.010 
but fire charges work so basically what
they're<00:01:30.090> going<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.270> do<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.540> they're<00:01:30.689> going<00:01:30.720> to

happen<00:01:43.890> but<00:01:44.220> because<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.579> has<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.970> happens<00:01:45.450> in

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
happen but because it has it happens in

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.910 
happen but because it has it happens in
the<00:01:45.780> pc<00:01:46.200> version<00:01:46.229> right<00:01:46.590> now<00:01:47.180> but<00:01:48.180> basically<00:01:48.390> a

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
the pc version right now but basically a

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.109 
the pc version right now but basically a
least<00:01:49.920> kills<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.399> cow<00:01:50.520> right<00:01:50.700> now<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.000> you'll

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
least kills the cow right now so you'll

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.210 
least kills the cow right now so you'll
get<00:01:51.329> raw<00:01:51.509> beef<00:01:51.720> but<00:01:51.930> not<00:01:52.079> cooked<00:01:52.350> beef<00:01:52.590> sadly

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
get raw beef but not cooked beef sadly

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.730 
get raw beef but not cooked beef sadly
so<00:01:53.909> anyways<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.720> goes<00:01:54.869> ahead<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.229> kills<00:01:55.530> these

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
so anyways it goes ahead and kills these

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.670 
so anyways it goes ahead and kills these
ones<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.880> since<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.360> since<00:01:57.899> normally<00:01:58.380> takes

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
ones and since it since normally takes

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.520 
ones and since it since normally takes
two<00:01:59.100> shots<00:01:59.490> from<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.240> fire<00:02:00.509> charges<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.200> kill

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
two shots from the fire charges to kill

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.260 
two shots from the fire charges to kill
them<00:02:01.710> that's<00:02:02.219> why<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.430> have<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.850> second

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
them that's why I have the second

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.959 
them that's why I have the second
splitter<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.590> goes<00:02:04.740> ahead<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.250> since<00:02:05.820> this

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
splitter so it goes ahead and since this

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.300 
splitter so it goes ahead and since this
one<00:02:06.149> goes<00:02:06.329> instantly<00:02:06.890> it's<00:02:07.890> going<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.099> hit<00:02:08.250> the

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
one goes instantly it's going to hit the

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.309 
one goes instantly it's going to hit the
cows<00:02:08.580> instantly<00:02:09.119> then<00:02:09.690> they're<00:02:09.899> going<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.080> you

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
cows instantly then they're going to you

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.229 
cows instantly then they're going to you
know<00:02:10.410> still<00:02:10.800> be<00:02:10.979> on<00:02:11.069> low<00:02:11.310> health<00:02:11.580> but<00:02:11.819> survived

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
know still be on low health but survived

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.010 
know still be on low health but survived
so

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
so

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.690 
so
second<00:02:13.380> one<00:02:13.500> after<00:02:13.680> being<00:02:14.070> delayed<00:02:14.310> by<00:02:14.490> a

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
second one after being delayed by a

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.090 
second one after being delayed by a
little<00:02:14.970> bit<00:02:15.120> goes<00:02:15.540> ahead<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.050> finally<00:02:16.830> sends

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
little bit goes ahead and finally sends

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.740 
little bit goes ahead and finally sends
a<00:02:17.160> signal<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.520> hear<00:02:17.760> thus<00:02:18.180> killing<00:02:18.450> them

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
a signal to hear thus killing them

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.750 
a signal to hear thus killing them
finally<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.380> then<00:02:19.890> after<00:02:20.160> that<00:02:20.280> happens<00:02:20.640> I

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
finally and then after that happens I

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.090 
finally and then after that happens I
have<00:02:20.790> more<00:02:21.510> delayed<00:02:21.870> down<00:02:22.080> here<00:02:22.440> or<00:02:22.920> goes

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
have more delayed down here or goes

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.420 
have more delayed down here or goes
ahead<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.550> let<00:02:23.970> me<00:02:24.060> get<00:02:24.270> behind<00:02:24.420> here<00:02:25.220> to<00:02:26.220> show

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
ahead and let me get behind here to show

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.680 
ahead and let me get behind here to show
you<00:02:26.490> guys<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:27.270> is<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.510> little<00:02:28.020> bit<00:02:28.170> easier<00:02:28.530> so

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
you guys that is a little bit easier so

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.030 
you guys that is a little bit easier so
it<00:02:30.690> comes<00:02:30.930> from<00:02:31.140> back<00:02:31.350> here<00:02:31.590> then<00:02:31.770> goes<00:02:31.920> over

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
it comes from back here then goes over

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.460 
it comes from back here then goes over
here<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.460> hits<00:02:32.940> this<00:02:33.270> which<00:02:33.750> inverts<00:02:34.470> the

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
here and hits this which inverts the

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.150 
here and hits this which inverts the
torch<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.250> powers<00:02:35.940> off<00:02:36.150> all<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:37.320> Pistons

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
torch and powers off all the Pistons

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.800 
torch and powers off all the Pistons
that<00:02:38.820> are<00:02:38.940> currently<00:02:39.300> powered<00:02:39.720> on<00:02:39.990> and<00:02:41.810> it

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
that are currently powered on and it

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.040 
that are currently powered on and it
pulls<00:02:43.080> out<00:02:43.290> this<00:02:43.500> bottom<00:02:43.920> block<00:02:44.160> right<00:02:44.460> here

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
pulls out this bottom block right here

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.600 
pulls out this bottom block right here
okay<00:02:46.050> so<00:02:46.470> pulls<00:02:46.710> out<00:02:46.860> that<00:02:47.010> bottom<00:02:47.250> block<00:02:47.400> so

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
okay so pulls out that bottom block so

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.120 
okay so pulls out that bottom block so
all<00:02:47.850> either<00:02:48.750> burning<00:02:49.410> cows<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:49.860> are<00:02:49.920> almost

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
all either burning cows that are almost

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.790 
all either burning cows that are almost
dead<00:02:50.520> or<00:02:50.700> just<00:02:51.150> pieces<00:02:51.540> of<00:02:51.570> pork<00:02:51.990> fall<00:02:52.560> down

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
dead or just pieces of pork fall down

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.150 
dead or just pieces of pork fall down
into<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.280> water<00:02:53.430> below<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:54.530> then<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.590> have<00:02:55.890> it

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
into the water below and then I have it

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.160 
into the water below and then I have it
set<00:02:56.400> up<00:02:56.460> so<00:02:56.610> just<00:02:57.030> get<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.480> current<00:02:57.780> carries

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
set up so just get the current carries

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.560 
set up so just get the current carries
it<00:02:58.350> and<00:02:58.500> then<00:02:59.100> it<00:02:59.580> runs<00:02:59.790> out<00:03:00.030> past<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.420> 8th

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
it and then it runs out past the 8th

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.090 
it and then it runs out past the 8th
block<00:03:00.720> so<00:03:01.080> that<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.230> just<00:03:01.500> have<00:03:01.590> a<00:03:01.620> piece<00:03:01.830> of<00:03:01.860> ice

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
block so that I just have a piece of ice

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.220 
block so that I just have a piece of ice
so<00:03:02.370> once<00:03:02.730> they<00:03:02.910> get<00:03:03.060> here<00:03:03.270> they<00:03:03.450> slide<00:03:03.900> right

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
so once they get here they slide right

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.320 
so once they get here they slide right
on<00:03:04.320> to<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.560> next<00:03:04.770> one<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.160> slider<00:03:05.880> it<00:03:06.090> on<00:03:06.180> to

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
on to the next one and slider it on to

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.450 
on to the next one and slider it on to
the<00:03:06.420> next<00:03:06.570> one<00:03:06.660> then<00:03:07.050> just<00:03:07.320> go<00:03:07.440> forward<00:03:07.800> so

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
the next one then just go forward so

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.430 
the next one then just go forward so
when<00:03:08.610> you<00:03:08.670> press<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.000> button<00:03:09.030> after<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:10.230> little

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
when you press the button after a little

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.160 
when you press the button after a little
bit<00:03:10.530> of<00:03:10.620> time<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:11.310> will<00:03:11.430> get<00:03:11.580> your<00:03:11.790> beef<00:03:12.170> right

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
bit of time you will get your beef right
