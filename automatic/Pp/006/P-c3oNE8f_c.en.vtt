00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 Hello dear friends with you I yuri 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.839
 amarth ended a week ago 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.389
 it means it's time to finally 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.330
 to sum it up well what are we looking at 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.790
 the top ten games of the past month and 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.190
 Like video and today's top 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.320
 opens the game for the quest keeper at all 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.960
 quite rare including time killers in 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.830
 Tops are the best but this game is really 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.900
 I was impressed and proved that she 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.880
 legally is to buy game crossy 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.160
 road which probably many people know and 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.829
 many have played what is this game better in 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.930
 The first here is more than a mission location 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.579
 there are more varied items 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.070
 which affects not only the appearance 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.960
 but also on the various abilities of the characters 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.210
 for example, I bought shoes in which 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.489
 you can walk on the water and the staff which 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.920
 automatically open all the chests this 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.840
 cool and the game is not a child draws 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.329
 I think the developers will develop 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.160
 project add new missions quests and 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.859
 thanks to this, probably for a long time 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.629
 will be able to keep their triumph on the ninth 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.629
 place I put the game project slender 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.799
 online what is this game firstly like 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.530
 you probably already guessed from the name 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.510
 this is an online game yes there is 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.119
 multiplayer and play you can only with 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.159
 absolutely real people in this game 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.290
 you will need to be or ordinary 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.060
 a person who is looking for notes and 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.420
 actually a team of three people 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.750
 find all the notes and not get caught with andrew 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.780
 but the task of the slender is to catch the little people and 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.360
 don't let them get to your notes 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.490
 the game is very interesting of course the match 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.470
 sometimes delayed for very long 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.810
 time and this is probably 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.090
 the only minus and so the game is very 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.939
 interesting and unusual for eighth place 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.310
 hit the game project parkour is a simulator 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.259
 Parkour, in principle, very good 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.869
 vaguely reminiscent of the world 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.759
 speech that is, we run on some white 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.040
 roofs overcome various 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.560
 obstacles and our ultimate goal 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.130
 collect checkpoints to get to the finish 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.020
 point 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.180
 and it must be done in the allotted time 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.040
 otherwise you just can't 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.100
 unlock 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.530
 the next mission to fall you will be many 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.420
 fall will hurt but get to 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.950
 finish necessarily 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.670
 In March , the long-awaited sequel 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.020
 credan john hunter and fifth 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.020
 It turned out only in seventh place 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.500
 why so despite pretty 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.330
 the shell on a variety of locations is all 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.160
 the same stupid flash in which to us 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.980
 you only need to tap on one 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.590
 button of course it might be interesting 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.690
 and fascinating but nonetheless it can 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.630
 personally bother me games of this genre 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.239
 already become boring they sit in the liver yes 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.209
 do you finally have a normal lpg with 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.069
 interesting quests and I think people themselves 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.549
 will be willing to pay for it 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:50.190
 but for this donatnoe brainchild I can give 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.350
 only 7th place in sixth place was 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.989
 no less loud game called lego 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.360
 marvel super heroes and despite all 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.360
 its loudness coolness game in my 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.280
 opinion deserved only 6 place now I 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.060
 I will try to explain to you this game weighs 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.530
 very much and its weight in the first place 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.290
 justified by the abundance of videos and 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.480
 videos taken from older version yet 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.030
 but compared to the pc version of the game 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.970
 looks very black shedding game more 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.130
 just missions are shorter and if you 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.040
 played the full version on pc from 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.590
 This version will disappoint you more than 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.930
 glad but if you haven't played elder 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.420
 the version is basically this game for you 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.790
 show quite interesting and nice and 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.130
 the top five games of March open 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.980
 physical puzzle feed me oil 2 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.019
 but there is one but the game is only available in 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.480
 samsung application store that is in 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.880
 google play and in amazon this game to 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.790
 Unfortunately until you can find but the 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.459
 no less game bombing game cult and 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.500
 if you remember what feed me oil is 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.900
 played the first part the second part 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.090
 you will surely like it because 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.579
 graphically, the game is significantly 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.910
 improved missions became more interesting and 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:05.190
 more diverse and even more puzzling 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.560
 no so if you like puzzles 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.870
 don't miss this release march also 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.000
 was marked by the release of the third part 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.160
 most popular horror of five nights at 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.200
 freddy's we're going to again 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.390
 pizzerias not only this no longer pizza restaurants 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.270
 it's a kind of room of fear but we 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.460
 working as a security guard again this time us 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:25.470
 can kill only one animatronic all 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.220
 the rest of animatronics are 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.310
 phantoms 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.530
 and can only scare us very much in 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.710
 the game has naturally new buns 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.840
 well, and some kind of plot outcome but 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.090
 at least in the end there will be a small clue 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.450
 which hints at a possible appearance 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.820
 even 4 series but I do not know and we will see 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.020
 the third place of my hit parade is 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.240
 chrono lodgy game 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.640
 this port is pretty steep and 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.160
 interesting platformer SEC in which we 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.350
 We will play for the old man who will 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.930
 try to stop the catastrophe which 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.490
 happen on earth and what will it be for 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.950
 we will need to do this 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:05.660
 travel in the past in the future 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:08.010
 in order to recover the real ones 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.420
 platformer is very interesting despite 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.880
 what basically 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.740
 the puzzles in it are light enough but 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.560
 several puzzles really 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.320
 will be able to put you in a dead end and break 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.230
 your brains in March came out also another 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.960
 port of the most popular game and specifically 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.940
 point n-click quest syberia 2 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.280
 she went to google play absolutely 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.040
 officially and everyone can download it and 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.900
 play but there is one thing but the game for now 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.450
 available only in English 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:39.180
 localized version with Russian language 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:41.880
 will be released separately from another publisher but 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.950
 yet nonetheless we can play and 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.270
 English version I think it does not hurt 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.010
 get pleasure from passing 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.050
 this cult games 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.360
 that already the first place I did not notice 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.160
 as we approached first position on 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.740
 the first position I put the game 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.500
 wayne glory is a mobile mob for now 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.290
 it is in a closed beta test but 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.180
 very soon it will come out of it and everyone 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.340
 not even the beta test of its will 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.710
 quietly download from google play market 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.110
 but for now for those who love it 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.540
 become a beta tester or download it from 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.570
 third-party resource is moba as I already 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:18.000
 spoke and and done very 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:20.760
 impressive in places reminiscent of low 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.130
 in some places dota but there is in it and its 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.920
 some unusual even 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.630
 most kraken whose mom 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.030
 you win and lure on your 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.780
 side to blow the tower 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.210
 rival 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.680
 the game looks interesting heroes here 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.070
 constantly added 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.320
 the game develops and maybe in the future 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:42.170
 there will also be new maps and i think 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:44.660
 while the moba genre is at its peak 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.790
 this game has every chance of becoming better 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.860
 mobile myboy oh dear friends 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.710
 thank you very much for your attention thank you 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:54.050
 who looked my top by the way how are you already 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.210
 probably noticed the beginning of April was 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.970
 marked by the release of cool toys 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:01.040
 I hope April will not let us down 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.890
 because mortal kombat is coming out soon 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.320
 x and many other interesting new products 

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:08.900
