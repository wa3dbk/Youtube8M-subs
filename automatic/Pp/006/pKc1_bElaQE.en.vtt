in any conditions the only setback of

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.380 
in any conditions the only setback of
this<00:00:18.510> weapon<00:00:18.750> in<00:00:19.020> comparison<00:00:19.590> with<00:00:19.880> ak-47<00:00:20.880> is

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
this weapon in comparison with ak-47 is

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.990 
this weapon in comparison with ak-47 is
a<00:00:21.449> noticeably<00:00:22.109> lower<00:00:22.410> killing<00:00:22.949> power<00:00:23.189> which

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
a noticeably lower killing power which

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.939 
a noticeably lower killing power which
results<00:00:24.510> in<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.630> fact<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.080> one<00:00:25.350> shot<00:00:25.650> in<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
results in the fact that one shot in the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.160 
results in the fact that one shot in the
head<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.609> not<00:00:26.910> enough<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.449> kill<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.840> enemy

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
head is not enough to kill the enemy

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.259 
head is not enough to kill the enemy
when<00:00:28.619> he<00:00:28.650> has<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> bulletproof<00:00:29.400> vest<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.119> a

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
when he has a bulletproof vest and a

when he has a bulletproof vest and a
helmet<00:00:30.300> equipped<00:00:31.040> let's<00:00:32.040> have<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.250> look<00:00:32.460> at<00:00:32.610> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
helmet equipped let's have a look at the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.870 
helmet equipped let's have a look at the
recoil<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:33.390> all<00:00:33.540> four<00:00:33.870> ways<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.410> shooting<00:00:34.880> full

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
recoil in all four ways of shooting full

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.470 
recoil in all four ways of shooting full
auto<00:00:36.090> as<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:37.500> may<00:00:37.680> see<00:00:37.739> recall<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.940> not<00:00:39.120> as<00:00:39.270> bad

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
auto as you may see recall is not as bad

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.950 
auto as you may see recall is not as bad
as<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.899> case<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.340> ak-47<00:00:41.420> the<00:00:42.420> first<00:00:42.660> three

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
as in the case of ak-47 the first three

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.860 
as in the case of ak-47 the first three
bullets<00:00:43.379> hit<00:00:43.559> more<00:00:43.829> or<00:00:43.950> less<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.250> same<00:00:44.399> spot

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
bullets hit more or less the same spot

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.660 
bullets hit more or less the same spot
then<00:00:45.870> recoil<00:00:46.350> drags<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.860> weapon<00:00:47.129> upwards

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
then recoil drags the weapon upwards

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.630 
then recoil drags the weapon upwards
while<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.480> bullets<00:00:48.840> go<00:00:48.989> sideways<00:00:49.550> in<00:00:50.550> order

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
while the bullets go sideways in order

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.850 
while the bullets go sideways in order
to<00:00:50.789> compensate<00:00:51.180> for<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.660> recoil<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.559> have<00:00:52.739> to

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
to compensate for the recoil you have to

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.860 
to compensate for the recoil you have to
gradually<00:00:53.280> lower<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.730> crosshair<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.539> steer

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
gradually lower the crosshair and steer

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.229 
gradually lower the crosshair and steer
it<00:00:54.989> sideways<00:00:55.289> as<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:56.520> shown<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.030> slow

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239

motion single shots as we see all the
bullets<00:01:01.890> hit<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.100> same<00:01:02.340> spot<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:03.629> have<00:01:03.750> to

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
bullets hit the same spot you have to

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.020 
bullets hit the same spot you have to

keep in mind however that good precision

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.149 
keep in mind however that good precision
is<00:01:06.360> guaranteed<00:01:06.930> only<00:01:07.200> while<00:01:07.500> staying<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:08.040> one

serious one might say that this is just

bullet series in order to benefit from
this<00:01:27.960> way<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.290> shooting<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:29.009> have<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.340> lower

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
this way of shooting you have to lower

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.370 
this way of shooting you have to lower
the<00:01:29.700> crosshair<00:01:30.210> after<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.780> third<00:01:30.990> or<00:01:31.140> fourth

the crosshair after the third or fourth

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.770 
the crosshair after the third or fourth
shot<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.790> recoil<00:01:33.150> looks<00:01:33.450> more<00:01:33.689> or

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
shot so that the recoil looks more or

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.069 
shot so that the recoil looks more or
less<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.170> way<00:01:34.670> as<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.939> our<00:01:36.090> habit<00:01:36.390> we<00:01:36.960> will

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
less this way as is our habit we will

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.390 
less this way as is our habit we will
examine<00:01:37.350> how<00:01:37.590> each<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.130> aforementioned

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
examine how each of the aforementioned

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.819 
examine how each of the aforementioned
types<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.150> shooting<00:01:39.540> presents<00:01:40.259> itself<00:01:40.470> during

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
types of shooting presents itself during

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.310 
types of shooting presents itself during
a<00:01:40.920> deathmatch<00:01:41.509> we'll<00:01:42.509> also<00:01:42.659> have<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.049> look<00:01:43.229> at

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
a deathmatch we'll also have a look at

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.609 
a deathmatch we'll also have a look at
all<00:01:43.470> pros<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.040> cons<00:01:44.960> let's<00:01:45.960> first<00:01:46.170> examine<00:01:46.350> a

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
all pros and cons let's first examine a

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.820 
all pros and cons let's first examine a
single<00:01:46.979> shooting

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
single shooting

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.060 
single shooting
as<00:01:48.700> in<00:01:48.910> the<00:01:49.000> case<00:01:49.180> of<00:01:49.440> ak-47<00:01:50.440> this<00:01:50.830> type<00:01:51.040> of

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
as in the case of ak-47 this type of

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.160 
as in the case of ak-47 this type of
shooting<00:01:51.430> pays<00:01:51.790> off<00:01:52.000> at<00:01:52.210> greater<00:01:52.480> distances

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
shooting pays off at greater distances

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.170 
shooting pays off at greater distances
while<00:01:53.770> allowing<00:01:54.100> you<00:01:54.250> to<00:01:54.370> stay<00:01:54.700> in<00:01:54.940> constant

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
while allowing you to stay in constant

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.020 
while allowing you to stay in constant
motion<00:01:55.890> yet<00:01:56.890> due<00:01:57.130> to<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.370> lower<00:01:57.520> power<00:01:57.820> of

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
motion yet due to the lower power of
