AF on in 20 millimeter blue LED and no
it's<00:02:08.849> not<00:02:08.910> really<00:02:09.300> question<00:02:09.780> like<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.050> would

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
it's not really question like you would

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.780 
it's not really question like you would
think<00:02:10.349> with<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.590> blue<00:02:10.739> leds<00:02:11.160> because<00:02:11.640> they're

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
think with the blue leds because they're

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.070 
think with the blue leds because they're
sort<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.120> subtle<00:02:12.390> in<00:02:12.690> there

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
sort of subtle in there

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.990 
sort of subtle in there
so<00:02:13.650> we<00:02:13.800> taking<00:02:14.100> a<00:02:14.160> little<00:02:14.280> bit<00:02:14.400> of<00:02:14.460> red<00:02:14.700> white

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
so we taking a little bit of red white

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.480
