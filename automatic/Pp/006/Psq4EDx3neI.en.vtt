00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
nollie hard flip down it's pretty easy

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.569 
nollie hard flip down it's pretty easy
to<00:00:30.480> start<00:00:30.960> doing<00:00:31.289> ghetto<00:00:31.529> birds<00:00:31.830> um<00:00:32.570> but<00:00:34.579> the

to start doing ghetto birds um but the

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.180 
to start doing ghetto birds um but the
nollie<00:00:35.790> hard<00:00:36.030> flip<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> pretty<00:00:36.860> tough<00:00:37.860> trick

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
nollie hard flip is a pretty tough trick

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.420 
nollie hard flip is a pretty tough trick
I<00:00:38.430> couldn't<00:00:39.270> get<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.540> for<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.719> long<00:00:39.960> time<00:00:40.430> it's

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
I couldn't get it for a long time it's

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.910 
I couldn't get it for a long time it's
when<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.760> Bert<00:00:41.969> looks<00:00:42.870> like<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.680> slow

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
when you Bert looks like this in slow

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.869 
when you Bert looks like this in slow
motion<00:00:44.190> no<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.820> can't<00:00:45.149> really<00:00:45.390> get<00:00:46.610> your<00:00:47.610> board

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
motion no I can't really get your board

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.819 
motion no I can't really get your board
pops<00:00:49.640> like<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.930> frontside<00:00:51.930> 180<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.620> a

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
pops like that frontside 180 and a

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.510 
pops like that frontside 180 and a
nollie<00:00:53.340> kickflip<00:00:57.079> yeah<00:00:58.100> those<00:00:59.100> two<00:00:59.340> put

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
nollie kickflip yeah those two put

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.889 
nollie kickflip yeah those two put
together<00:00:59.699> will<00:01:00.059> look<00:01:00.210> like<00:01:00.359> an<00:01:00.510> only<00:01:00.690> hard

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
together will look like an only hard

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.820 
together will look like an only hard
flip<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:03.080> suggest<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.290> just<00:01:04.589> have

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
flip so I suggest that you just have

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.060 
flip so I suggest that you just have
your<00:01:05.210> knowledge<00:01:06.210> just<00:01:06.960> your<00:01:07.290> knowledge<00:01:07.650> stuff

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
your knowledge just your knowledge stuff

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.410 
your knowledge just your knowledge stuff
down<00:01:08.670> good<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.270> only<00:01:10.260> flows<00:01:11.150> nollie<00:01:12.150> tre

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
down good and only flows nollie tre

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.840 
down good and only flows nollie tre
flips<00:01:12.750> will<00:01:12.900> help<00:01:13.110> because<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:14.310> movement<00:01:14.729> is

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
flips will help because the movement is

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.120 
flips will help because the movement is
similar<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:16.049> almost<00:01:16.439> feel<00:01:16.650> like<00:01:16.710> when<00:01:17.009> I'm

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
similar I I almost feel like when I'm

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.249 
similar I I almost feel like when I'm
popping<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.759> feel<00:01:18.270> like<00:01:18.390> my<00:01:18.570> finger<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.020> getting

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
popping I feel like my finger is getting

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.140 
popping I feel like my finger is getting
caught<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.189> middle<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.640> board<00:01:20.970> and

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
caught in the middle of the board and

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.450 
caught in the middle of the board and
flicking<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> opposite<00:01:22.229> way<00:01:22.290> which<00:01:23.189> gives

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
flicking it the opposite way which gives

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:34.090 
flicking it the opposite way which gives
me<00:01:27.950> so<00:01:28.950> finger<00:01:29.280> placement<00:01:31.610> um-<00:01:32.610> like<00:01:32.909> this

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
me so finger placement um- like this

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
on the nose just maybe hanging off a

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.380 
on the nose just maybe hanging off a
little<00:01:41.909> bit<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.500> my<00:01:43.500> middle<00:01:44.280> finger<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.909> kind

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
of right in the middle of the board I

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.289 
of right in the middle of the board I
have<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.130> little<00:01:47.250> indent<00:01:47.670> there<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.939> show<00:01:48.119> me

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
have a little indent there to show me

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.770 
have a little indent there to show me
where<00:01:49.909> kind<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.000> right<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.360> middle<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.630> the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
where kind of right in the middle of the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.950 
where kind of right in the middle of the
board<00:01:52.939> maybe<00:01:53.939> even<00:01:54.210> hanging<00:01:54.479> off<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.750> little

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
board maybe even hanging off a little

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.139 
board maybe even hanging off a little
because<00:01:55.560> when<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.890> pop<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.759> need<00:01:56.939> that

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
because when you pop you need that

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.910 
because when you pop you need that
finger<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.659> stop<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:58.229> board<00:01:58.439> from<00:01:58.590> moving

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
finger to stop the board from moving

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.830 
finger to stop the board from moving
back<00:01:59.130> side<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.430> start<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.390> move<00:02:00.540> front

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
back side and start it to move front

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.280 
back side and start it to move front
side<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.079> flick<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:02.689> once<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.810> pop<00:02:04.049> it's

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
side and flick it so once you pop it's

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.960 
side and flick it so once you pop it's
all<00:02:04.439> in<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.710> back<00:02:04.890> fender

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
all in the back fender

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.940 
all in the back fender
you<00:02:07.970> just<00:02:08.179> pop<00:02:08.600> and<00:02:08.899> instead<00:02:09.709> of<00:02:09.740> just

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
you just pop and instead of just

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.949 
you just pop and instead of just
flicking<00:02:10.250> off<00:02:10.490> like<00:02:10.700> a<00:02:10.729> nollie<00:02:10.970> flip<00:02:11.270> kind<00:02:11.840> of

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
flicking off like a nollie flip kind of

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.820 
flicking off like a nollie flip kind of
go<00:02:12.080> straight<00:02:13.069> back<00:02:13.370> onto<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:14.090> tail<00:02:14.300> and

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
go straight back onto the tail and

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.809 
go straight back onto the tail and
that'll<00:02:15.830> give<00:02:15.950> it<00:02:16.069> some<00:02:16.220> of<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.370> front<00:02:16.610> side

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
that'll give it some of the front side

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.940 
that'll give it some of the front side
motion<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.330> kind<00:02:17.480> of<00:02:17.540> just<00:02:17.720> move<00:02:18.470> your<00:02:18.650> wrist

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
motion and kind of just move your wrist

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.630 
motion and kind of just move your wrist
towards<00:02:19.760> yourself<00:02:20.890> that<00:02:21.890> just<00:02:22.220> practice

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
towards yourself that just practice

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:31.540 
towards yourself that just practice
getting<00:02:22.850> it<00:02:23.030> halfway<00:02:28.330> yeah<00:02:29.330> but<00:02:29.720> um<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:30.550> good

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
getting it halfway yeah but um a good

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.920 
getting it halfway yeah but um a good
way<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.730> practice<00:02:31.910> these<00:02:32.300> is<00:02:32.480> to<00:02:32.630> get<00:02:32.780> only

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
way to practice these is to get only

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.490 
way to practice these is to get only
front<00:02:33.230> side<00:02:33.440> books<00:02:38.170> because<00:02:39.170> once<00:02:39.350> you're

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
front side books because once you're

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.750 
front side books because once you're
getting<00:02:39.680> all<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:39.890> frontside<00:02:40.280> flips<00:02:40.550> down

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
getting all the frontside flips down

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.600 
getting all the frontside flips down
it'll<00:02:41.150> be<00:02:41.500> easier<00:02:42.500> her<00:02:42.800> backside<00:02:43.250> whenever

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
it'll be easier her backside whenever

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.850 
it'll be easier her backside whenever
you<00:02:43.760> want<00:02:43.940> to<00:02:44.000> call<00:02:44.150> it<00:02:44.180> there's<00:02:44.570> whatever<00:02:45.140> so

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
you want to call it there's whatever so

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.160 
you want to call it there's whatever so
once<00:02:46.489> you<00:02:46.640> get<00:02:46.760> those<00:02:46.970> down<00:02:47.209> you'll<00:02:47.570> have<00:02:47.959> an

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
once you get those down you'll have an

00:02:48.170 --> 00:03:00.220 
once you get those down you'll have an
idea<00:02:48.500> of<00:02:48.560> what<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:49.040> motion<00:02:49.430> is<00:02:49.550> like<00:02:49.790> so<00:02:59.230> uh

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
idea of what the motion is like so uh

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:07.150 
idea of what the motion is like so uh
whoa<00:03:01.930> sorry<00:03:02.930> it<00:03:03.080> takes<00:03:03.230> a<00:03:03.440> second<00:03:05.920> like<00:03:06.920> that

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
whoa sorry it takes a second like that

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.110 
whoa sorry it takes a second like that
once<00:03:07.940> you<00:03:08.680> I<00:03:09.680> try<00:03:10.280> I<00:03:10.310> was<00:03:10.519> trying<00:03:10.760> to<00:03:10.790> get<00:03:10.940> one

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
once you I try I was trying to get one

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.460 
once you I try I was trying to get one
that<00:03:11.299> could<00:03:11.540> really<00:03:11.720> show<00:03:12.049> the<00:03:12.260> nollie

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
that could really show the nollie

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.960 
that could really show the nollie
hardflip<00:03:12.920> motion<00:03:13.310> and<00:03:13.459> all<00:03:13.549> you<00:03:13.700> really<00:03:13.850> have

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
hardflip motion and all you really have

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.960 
hardflip motion and all you really have
to<00:03:14.180> do<00:03:14.329> is<00:03:14.480> turn<00:03:14.660> your<00:03:14.870> fingers<00:03:15.230> um<00:03:15.820> so<00:03:16.820> it's

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
to do is turn your fingers um so it's

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.940 
to do is turn your fingers um so it's
basically<00:03:17.180> an<00:03:17.510> only<00:03:17.750> back<00:03:18.350> side<00:03:18.620> front<00:03:18.799> side

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
basically an only back side front side

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.170 
basically an only back side front side
with<00:03:19.340> whatever<00:03:20.320> all<00:03:21.320> the<00:03:21.530> way<00:03:21.620> rotated<00:03:22.250> and

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
with whatever all the way rotated and

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.370 
with whatever all the way rotated and
keep<00:03:23.900> your<00:03:24.079> hands<00:03:24.260> forward<00:03:25.720> be<00:03:26.720> patient<00:03:27.260> with

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
keep your hands forward be patient with

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.140 
keep your hands forward be patient with
this<00:03:27.530> trick<00:03:27.799> it<00:03:28.010> took<00:03:28.160> me<00:03:28.370> a<00:03:28.400> few<00:03:28.640> months<00:03:28.820> to

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
this trick it took me a few months to

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.140 
this trick it took me a few months to
get<00:03:29.299> it<00:03:29.360> and<00:03:29.690> it's<00:03:30.310> fun<00:03:31.310> trick<00:03:31.519> to<00:03:31.549> do<00:03:31.790> once<00:03:32.000> you

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
get it and it's fun trick to do once you

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.340 
get it and it's fun trick to do once you
get<00:03:32.329> it<00:03:32.709> but<00:03:34.030> so<00:03:35.030> now<00:03:35.209> moving<00:03:35.540> on<00:03:35.810> to<00:03:36.079> like

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
get it but so now moving on to like

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:43.720 
get it but so now moving on to like
nulli<00:03:36.769> ghetto<00:03:37.070> birds<00:03:37.340> and<00:03:37.549> stuff<00:03:42.670> like<00:03:43.670> that

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
nulli ghetto birds and stuff like that

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.240 
nulli ghetto birds and stuff like that
if<00:03:44.720> you<00:03:44.840> don't<00:03:44.989> know<00:03:45.049> what<00:03:45.200> to<00:03:45.290> get<00:03:45.380> over<00:03:45.620> what

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
if you don't know what to get over what

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.130 
if you don't know what to get over what
a<00:03:46.280> hold<00:03:46.670> on<00:03:48.579> what<00:03:49.579> I<00:03:49.609> get<00:03:49.820> over<00:03:50.060> it<00:03:50.180> is<00:03:50.420> it's

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
a hold on what I get over it is it's

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.990 
a hold on what I get over it is it's
when<00:03:51.410> you<00:03:51.560> do<00:03:51.709> an<00:03:51.829> ollie<00:03:51.980> hard<00:03:52.280> flip<00:03:52.519> and<00:03:52.760> catch

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
when you do an ollie hard flip and catch

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.660 
when you do an ollie hard flip and catch
it<00:03:53.030> into<00:03:53.420> a<00:03:53.450> late<00:03:53.750> backside<00:03:54.709> or<00:03:54.920> frontside<00:03:54.950> 180

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
it into a late backside or frontside 180

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.920 
it into a late backside or frontside 180
so<00:03:56.590> your<00:03:57.590> board<00:03:57.890> is<00:03:57.980> flipping<00:03:58.570> your<00:03:59.570> board<00:03:59.840> is

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
so your board is flipping your board is

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.390 
so your board is flipping your board is
flipping<00:04:00.290> that<00:04:00.440> way<00:04:00.650> and<00:04:00.799> then<00:04:00.890> you<00:04:01.010> catch<00:04:01.220> it

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
flipping that way and then you catch it

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.479 
flipping that way and then you catch it
late<00:04:01.579> and<00:04:02.120> do<00:04:02.269> a<00:04:02.600> frontside<00:04:03.380> 180<00:04:03.769> and<00:04:04.070> force

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
late and do a frontside 180 and force

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.400 
late and do a frontside 180 and force
which<00:04:04.670> it<00:04:04.850> would<00:04:04.910> be<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.690> switch<00:04:05.930> out<00:04:06.140> flip

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
which it would be the switch out flip

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.789 
which it would be the switch out flip
cash<00:04:06.590> Italy<00:04:06.920> backside<00:04:07.730> 180<00:04:08.230> regular<00:04:09.230> it's<00:04:09.680> the

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
cash Italy backside 180 regular it's the

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:14.570 
cash Italy backside 180 regular it's the
same

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:22.040 

thank<00:04:15.580> you<00:04:17.040> you<00:04:18.040> know<00:04:20.250> so<00:04:21.250> it's<00:04:21.580> pretty<00:04:21.880> easy

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.050 
thank you you know so it's pretty easy

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.630 
thank you you know so it's pretty easy
it's<00:04:23.050> kind<00:04:23.230> of<00:04:23.290> self-explanatory<00:04:23.640> actually

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
it's kind of self-explanatory actually

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.550 
it's kind of self-explanatory actually
to<00:04:24.730> be<00:04:24.760> honest<00:04:25.210> I<00:04:25.420> just<00:04:25.720> let<00:04:26.170> that<00:04:26.320> nollie

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
to be honest I just let that nollie

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.310 
to be honest I just let that nollie
hardflip<00:04:27.070> flick<00:04:27.640> and<00:04:27.910> twist<00:04:28.840> your<00:04:28.930> fingers

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
hardflip flick and twist your fingers

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.410 
hardflip flick and twist your fingers
and<00:04:29.370> don't<00:04:30.370> let<00:04:30.520> normally<00:04:30.940> just<00:04:31.090> catch<00:04:31.390> it

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
and don't let normally just catch it

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.130 
and don't let normally just catch it
until<00:04:32.370> the<00:04:33.370> other<00:04:33.490> way<00:04:33.700> the<00:04:33.970> opposite<00:04:34.330> way<00:04:34.540> all

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
until the other way the opposite way all

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.130 
until the other way the opposite way all
right<00:04:35.320> next<00:04:35.530> we<00:04:35.860> have<00:04:35.950> a<00:04:36.010> switch<00:04:36.610> our<00:04:36.790> clips

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
right next we have a switch our clips

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.600 
right next we have a switch our clips
they're<00:04:38.140> a<00:04:38.170> bit<00:04:38.320> of<00:04:38.410> a<00:04:38.470> harder<00:04:38.800> trick<00:04:39.070> to<00:04:39.460> get

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
they're a bit of a harder trick to get

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.400 
they're a bit of a harder trick to get
down<00:04:39.880> then<00:04:40.270> the<00:04:40.450> nollie<00:04:40.660> hard<00:04:40.900> lips<00:04:41.170> because

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
down then the nollie hard lips because

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.470 
down then the nollie hard lips because
you<00:04:41.920> don't<00:04:42.070> have<00:04:42.130> that<00:04:42.430> initial<00:04:42.790> momentum

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
you don't have that initial momentum

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.200 
you don't have that initial momentum
like<00:04:44.140> you<00:04:44.290> do<00:04:44.410> have<00:04:44.560> for<00:04:45.280> an<00:04:45.370> ollie<00:04:45.550> like<00:04:45.970> that

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
like you do have for an ollie like that

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.150 
like you do have for an ollie like that
you<00:04:46.870> kind<00:04:47.080> of<00:04:47.200> hard<00:04:47.380> this<00:04:47.530> going<00:04:47.830> and<00:04:47.980> then<00:04:48.070> you

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
you kind of hard this going and then you

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.390 
you kind of hard this going and then you
pop<00:04:48.340> the<00:04:48.520> switch<00:04:48.760> on<00:04:48.910> foot<00:04:49.590> yeah<00:04:50.590> hold<00:04:51.100> on<00:04:51.190> let

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
pop the switch on foot yeah hold on let

00:04:51.400 --> 00:05:01.110 
pop the switch on foot yeah hold on let
me<00:04:51.430> show<00:04:51.610> you<00:04:58.500> anyways<00:04:59.500> um<00:04:59.830> they're<00:05:00.820> a<00:05:00.850> bit<00:05:01.030> of

me show you anyways um they're a bit of
a<00:05:01.210> harder<00:05:01.510> flick<00:05:01.750> to<00:05:01.960> get<00:05:02.140> down<00:05:02.380> because<00:05:02.890> like

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
a harder flick to get down because like

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:04.860 
a harder flick to get down because like
I<00:05:03.910> said<00:05:03.970> you<00:05:04.210> don't<00:05:04.390> have<00:05:04.450> that<00:05:04.660> initial

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
I said you don't have that initial

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.770 
I said you don't have that initial
momentum<00:05:05.380> that<00:05:05.740> you<00:05:05.860> had<00:05:06.010> from<00:05:06.220> the<00:05:06.340> nollie<00:05:06.780> so

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
momentum that you had from the nollie so

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.480 
momentum that you had from the nollie so
it's<00:05:07.930> pretty<00:05:08.050> much<00:05:08.170> the<00:05:08.290> same<00:05:08.530> thing<00:05:08.830> I<00:05:09.040> feel

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
it's pretty much the same thing I feel

it's pretty much the same thing I feel
like<00:05:09.640> I'm<00:05:09.850> going<00:05:10.000> to<00:05:10.150> do<00:05:10.270> a<00:05:10.300> switch<00:05:10.600> tre<00:05:10.870> flip

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
like I'm going to do a switch tre flip

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.260 
like I'm going to do a switch tre flip
but<00:05:11.290> my<00:05:11.380> finger<00:05:11.680> gets<00:05:11.800> caught<00:05:12.160> and<00:05:12.370> sensible

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
but my finger gets caught and sensible

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.310 
but my finger gets caught and sensible
of<00:05:13.330> the<00:05:13.510> other<00:05:13.660> way<00:05:15.750> like<00:05:16.750> if<00:05:16.870> you<00:05:16.990> can<00:05:17.170> see

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:23.250 
of the other way like if you can see
that<00:05:20.280> same<00:05:21.280> thing<00:05:21.720> frontside<00:05:22.720> flips<00:05:23.020> will

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
that same thing frontside flips will

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.110 
that same thing frontside flips will
definitely<00:05:23.890> help<00:05:24.130> you<00:05:24.220> get<00:05:24.490> down<00:05:24.700> to<00:05:24.880> switch
