00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
first thing you need to figure out is

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.060 
first thing you need to figure out is
what<00:01:54.149> exactly<00:01:54.720> are<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.530> trying<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.860> protect

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
have to say I really learned a lot today

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.590 
have to say I really learned a lot today
it<00:02:33.670> was<00:02:33.760> interesting<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.180> hear<00:02:34.270> the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
it was interesting to hear the

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.150 
it was interesting to hear the
difference<00:02:35.050> in<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.380> safes<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:36.010> the

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
difference in the safes and the

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.490 
difference in the safes and the
different<00:02:36.460> things<00:02:36.670> to<00:02:36.940> look<00:02:37.060> for<00:02:37.500> the

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
different things to look for the

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.930 
different things to look for the
thickness<00:02:38.830> of<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.040> steel<00:02:39.220> is<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.460> very<00:02:39.700> big

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
thickness of the steel is a very big

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.460 
thickness of the steel is a very big
deal<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:41.440> especially<00:02:41.770> if<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.250> safe<00:02:42.460> door

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
deal and especially if the safe door

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.200 
deal and especially if the safe door
does<00:02:44.470> not<00:02:44.650> fit<00:02:45.010> real<00:02:45.310> tight<00:02:45.550> a<00:02:45.760> lot<00:02:45.940> of<00:02:46.060> them

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
does not fit real tight a lot of them

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.910 
does not fit real tight a lot of them
have<00:02:46.480> a<00:02:46.510> big<00:02:46.750> gap<00:02:46.930> around<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.320> door<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:47.800> then

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
have a big gap around the door and then

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.890 
have a big gap around the door and then
especially<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.850> need<00:02:49.030> something<00:02:49.540> that's<00:02:49.570> got

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
especially you need something that's got

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.230 
especially you need something that's got
a<00:02:49.930> lot<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.260> steel<00:02:50.590> in<00:02:50.770> it<00:02:50.860> okay<00:02:51.310> like<00:02:52.000> for

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
a lot of steel in it okay like for

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.820 
a lot of steel in it okay like for
instance<00:02:52.360> if<00:02:52.690> you<00:02:52.780> look<00:02:52.810> at<00:02:53.050> the<00:02:53.200> safe<00:02:53.440> here

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
instance if you look at the safe here

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.530 
instance if you look at the safe here
now<00:02:54.370> this<00:02:54.490> is<00:02:54.550> obviously<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:55.060> pretty<00:02:55.270> tight<00:02:55.510> fit

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
now this is obviously a pretty tight fit

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.170 
now this is obviously a pretty tight fit
there<00:02:55.960> that<00:02:56.110> you<00:02:56.170> can<00:02:56.490> this<00:02:57.490> is<00:02:57.700> a<00:02:57.730> the

buy right now okay you can see from the

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.230 
buy right now okay you can see from the
fit<00:03:02.200> of<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.380> door<00:03:02.620> you<00:03:03.310> can't<00:03:03.550> get<00:03:03.700> a<00:03:03.730> tool<00:03:03.940> in

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
fit of the door you can't get a tool in

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.970 
fit of the door you can't get a tool in
