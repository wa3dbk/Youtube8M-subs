gonna<00:02:36.639> last<00:02:36.879> as<00:02:37.209> long<00:02:37.239> because<00:02:37.810> doesn't<00:02:38.500> have

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
gonna last as long because doesn't have

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.110 
gonna last as long because doesn't have
a<00:02:38.620> base<00:02:38.859> that<00:02:38.889> makes<00:02:39.340> it<00:02:39.459> stick<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.849> it<00:02:39.999> and

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
a base that makes it stick to it and

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.909 
a base that makes it stick to it and
doesn't<00:02:40.329> have<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.569> top<00:02:40.840> coat<00:02:41.109> to<00:02:41.139> protect<00:02:41.499> it

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:41.919 
doesn't have a top coat to protect it

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:44.729 
doesn't have a top coat to protect it
that's<00:02:42.189> why<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:42.489> need<00:02:42.939> a<00:02:43.180> base<00:02:43.930> coat<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:44.409> a

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
that's why you need a base coat and a

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.879 
that's why you need a base coat and a
top<00:02:45.069> coat<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:46.239> I<00:02:46.569> personally<00:02:47.139> just<00:02:47.200> use<00:02:47.590> these

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:47.889 
top coat and I personally just use these

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:50.069 
top coat and I personally just use these
ones<00:02:48.219> I<00:02:48.519> think<00:02:48.819> any<00:02:49.060> top<00:02:49.389> coat<00:02:49.569> and<00:02:49.719> base<00:02:49.870> coat

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
ones I think any top coat and base coat

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:54.500 
ones I think any top coat and base coat
makes<00:02:50.829> your<00:02:51.129> nail<00:02:51.310> polish<00:02:51.489> last<00:02:51.909> longer<00:02:52.389> but<00:02:53.319> I

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
makes your nail polish last longer but I

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.059 
makes your nail polish last longer but I
think<00:02:55.510> any<00:02:55.719> nail-polish<00:02:56.139> topcoat<00:02:56.379> and<00:02:56.889> base

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
think any nail-polish topcoat and base

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.649 
think any nail-polish topcoat and base
coat<00:02:57.310> will<00:02:57.669> make<00:02:57.819> your<00:02:57.939> nail<00:02:58.120> polish<00:02:58.269> last

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:58.659 
coat will make your nail polish last

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.199 
coat will make your nail polish last
longer<00:02:59.109> than<00:02:59.139> it<00:02:59.859> would<00:03:00.069> on<00:03:00.250> its<00:03:00.519> own<00:03:00.790> but

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
longer than it would on its own but

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.330 
longer than it would on its own but
definitely<00:03:01.840> I<00:03:01.870> think<00:03:02.109> that<00:03:02.620> there<00:03:02.889> are<00:03:02.919> some

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
definitely I think that there are some

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.369 
definitely I think that there are some
base<00:03:04.030> coats<00:03:04.299> and<00:03:04.449> top<00:03:04.629> goods<00:03:04.900> that<00:03:05.049> are<00:03:05.079> better

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
base coats and top goods that are better

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.339 
base coats and top goods that are better
than<00:03:05.560> others<00:03:05.739> and<00:03:06.250> I<00:03:06.879> have<00:03:07.540> purchased<00:03:08.230> these

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
than others and I have purchased these

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.559 
than others and I have purchased these
like<00:03:09.040> two<00:03:09.280> weeks<00:03:09.400> ago<00:03:09.819> and<00:03:10.090> I<00:03:10.269> am<00:03:10.389> already

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
like two weeks ago and I am already

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.110 
like two weeks ago and I am already
obsessed<00:03:10.989> I<00:03:11.650> have<00:03:12.400> noticed<00:03:12.760> a<00:03:12.939> huge

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
obsessed I have noticed a huge

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.999 
obsessed I have noticed a huge
difference<00:03:13.239> when<00:03:13.719> applying<00:03:14.290> a<00:03:14.530> base<00:03:14.560> coat

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:15.009 
difference when applying a base coat

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:17.809 
difference when applying a base coat
because<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:16.209> base<00:03:16.419> coat<00:03:16.659> doesn't<00:03:16.900> let<00:03:17.229> the

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
because the base coat doesn't let the

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.640 
because the base coat doesn't let the
color<00:03:18.819> from<00:03:19.329> your<00:03:19.479> nail<00:03:19.629> polish<00:03:19.870> stick<00:03:20.409> onto

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
color from your nail polish stick onto

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.409 
color from your nail polish stick onto
your<00:03:20.919> nails<00:03:21.159> like<00:03:21.579> when<00:03:21.759> you're<00:03:21.939> applying<00:03:22.150> a

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:22.419 
your nails like when you're applying a

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:24.030 
your nails like when you're applying a
red<00:03:22.599> nail<00:03:22.780> polish<00:03:22.989> I<00:03:23.379> know<00:03:23.470> that<00:03:23.739> a<00:03:23.769> lot<00:03:23.889> of

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
red nail polish I know that a lot of

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.629 
red nail polish I know that a lot of
times<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.900> color<00:03:26.139> will<00:03:26.379> stay<00:03:26.560> in<00:03:26.889> my<00:03:27.040> cuticles

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
times the color will stay in my cuticles

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.240 
times the color will stay in my cuticles
and<00:03:27.879> it's<00:03:28.840> just<00:03:29.019> not<00:03:29.319> cute<00:03:29.620> I<00:03:29.829> don't<00:03:30.009> like<00:03:30.040> how

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250
