yourself I'm just thinking certain

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.430 
yourself I'm just thinking certain
things<00:02:45.350> but<00:02:45.590> you<00:02:45.740> can<00:02:45.980> prevent<00:02:46.850> yourself<00:02:47.000> from

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
things but you can prevent yourself from

things but you can prevent yourself from
listening<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.500> them<00:02:48.770> it's<00:02:49.700> like<00:02:49.760> if<00:02:50.000> a<00:02:50.240> thought

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
listening to them it's like if a thought

fine
you<00:02:54.290> can<00:02:54.470> choose<00:02:54.650> to<00:02:54.830> listen<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.250> it<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.460> let

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
you can choose to listen to it and let

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.080 
you can choose to listen to it and let
it<00:02:55.670> tear<00:02:55.970> you<00:02:56.090> down<00:02:56.120> or<00:02:56.630> you<00:02:56.660> can<00:02:57.020> choose<00:02:57.350> to

it tear you down or you can choose to

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.610 
it tear you down or you can choose to
accept<00:02:59.090> that<00:02:59.390> that<00:02:59.450> thought<00:02:59.870> is<00:03:00.050> there<00:03:00.380> but

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
accept that that thought is there but

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.840 
accept that that thought is there but
you<00:03:00.680> don't<00:03:00.830> have<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.160> believe<00:03:01.459> in<00:03:01.610> you<00:03:01.700> don't

to<00:03:04.489> pay<00:03:04.640> attention<00:03:04.730> to<00:03:05.120> it<00:03:05.480> so<00:03:05.660> I<00:03:06.620> just<00:03:06.680> really

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
to pay attention to it so I just really

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.210 
to pay attention to it so I just really
want<00:03:07.130> you<00:03:07.340> guys<00:03:07.489> to<00:03:07.520> keep<00:03:07.670> that<00:03:07.880> in<00:03:08.000> mind<00:03:08.239> and

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
want you guys to keep that in mind and

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.830 
want you guys to keep that in mind and
weight<00:03:10.220> weight<00:03:10.730> loss<00:03:10.940> is<00:03:11.209> really<00:03:11.390> not<00:03:11.690> going

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
weight weight loss is really not going

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.210 
weight weight loss is really not going
to<00:03:11.930> make<00:03:12.050> you<00:03:12.230> any<00:03:12.440> happier<00:03:12.530> than<00:03:12.890> you<00:03:13.100> already

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
to make you any happier than you already

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.510 
to make you any happier than you already
are

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
are

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.710 
are
another<00:03:14.030> example<00:03:14.420> is<00:03:14.510> when<00:03:14.630> I<00:03:15.080> was<00:03:15.980> really

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
another example is when I was really

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.650 
another example is when I was really
sick<00:03:17.720> like<00:03:18.350> last<00:03:18.620> year<00:03:18.890> around<00:03:19.040> this<00:03:19.220> time<00:03:19.280> I

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
sick like last year around this time I

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.660 
sick like last year around this time I
weighed<00:03:20.660> a<00:03:20.989> lot<00:03:21.320> less<00:03:22.090> and<00:03:24.310> this<00:03:25.310> is<00:03:25.459> like

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
weighed a lot less and this is like

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.070 
weighed a lot less and this is like
proof<00:03:26.030> that<00:03:26.390> you<00:03:26.480> know<00:03:26.600> you're<00:03:26.720> eating<00:03:27.020> this

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
proof that you know you're eating this

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.410 
proof that you know you're eating this
or<00:03:27.260> screwing<00:03:27.770> with<00:03:27.890> you<00:03:28.070> because<00:03:29.060> recently

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
or screwing with you because recently

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.820 
or screwing with you because recently
actually<00:03:29.870> I<00:03:30.140> was<00:03:30.260> like<00:03:30.410> looking<00:03:30.680> at<00:03:30.770> all

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
actually I was like looking at all

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.130 
actually I was like looking at all
pictures<00:03:31.370> of<00:03:31.400> myself<00:03:31.880> and<00:03:32.030> I<00:03:32.120> was<00:03:32.209> like<00:03:32.360> well<00:03:33.110> I

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
pictures of myself and I was like well I

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.979 
pictures of myself and I was like well I
wish<00:03:33.500> I<00:03:33.620> was<00:03:33.770> so<00:03:34.010> skinny<00:03:34.370> like<00:03:34.670> that<00:03:34.910> again<00:03:35.239> and

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
wish I was so skinny like that again and

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.870 
wish I was so skinny like that again and
I<00:03:36.170> would<00:03:36.290> be<00:03:36.410> like<00:03:36.560> an<00:03:36.709> ideal<00:03:37.070> body<00:03:37.459> weight<00:03:37.700> for

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
I would be like an ideal body weight for

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.240 
I would be like an ideal body weight for
me<00:03:38.000> but<00:03:38.600> then<00:03:38.750> I<00:03:38.870> was<00:03:39.260> talking<00:03:39.440> to<00:03:39.890> it<00:03:40.040> with<00:03:40.220> my

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
me but then I was talking to it with my

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.240 
me but then I was talking to it with my
about<00:03:40.910> it<00:03:41.060> with<00:03:41.300> my<00:03:41.420> psychologist<00:03:42.140> and<00:03:42.980> we

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
about it with my psychologist and we

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.630 
about it with my psychologist and we
sort<00:03:43.940> of<00:03:43.970> came<00:03:44.150> to<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:44.390> conclusion<00:03:44.570> that<00:03:45.640> when

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
sort of came to the conclusion that when

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.640 
sort of came to the conclusion that when
I<00:03:46.670> was<00:03:46.880> that<00:03:47.090> way<00:03:47.300> I<00:03:47.570> wasn't<00:03:47.780> any<00:03:48.110> happier<00:03:48.530> than

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
I was that way I wasn't any happier than

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.850 
I was that way I wasn't any happier than
I

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
I

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.480 
I
now<00:03:49.480> in<00:03:50.480> fact<00:03:50.750> I<00:03:50.960> had<00:03:51.110> a<00:03:51.140> lot<00:03:51.440> less<00:03:51.470> energy<00:03:51.890> I

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
now in fact I had a lot less energy I

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.760 
now in fact I had a lot less energy I
wasn't<00:03:53.180> able<00:03:53.330> to<00:03:53.480> go<00:03:53.720> to<00:03:53.780> school<00:03:53.960> at<00:03:54.320> all

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
wasn't able to go to school at all

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.250 
wasn't able to go to school at all
like<00:03:55.310> now<00:03:55.460> I<00:03:55.490> go<00:03:55.640> to<00:03:55.700> school<00:03:56.120> and<00:03:56.570> I<00:03:56.840> might<00:03:57.140> not

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
like now I go to school and I might not

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.810 
like now I go to school and I might not
be<00:03:57.440> perfect<00:03:57.920> but<00:03:58.010> at<00:03:58.250> least<00:03:58.340> I'm<00:03:58.520> going<00:03:58.730> to

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
be perfect but at least I'm going to

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.060 
be perfect but at least I'm going to
school<00:03:59.180> and<00:04:00.020> last<00:04:00.260> year<00:04:00.410> at<00:04:00.470> this<00:04:00.590> time<00:04:00.800> I<00:04:00.860> had

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
school and last year at this time I had

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.850 
school and last year at this time I had

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
to cancel my school year because I was

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.630 
to cancel my school year because I was
too<00:04:04.100> weak<00:04:04.310> and<00:04:04.550> sick<00:04:05.350> and<00:04:06.350> so<00:04:06.680> our<00:04:07.370> eating

I was a lot thinner

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.800 
I was a lot thinner

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.180 
that's what I'm really working on right
now<00:04:56.090> because<00:04:57.020> I<00:04:57.260> know<00:04:57.320> that<00:04:57.620> weight<00:04:57.800> loss<00:04:57.980> is

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
now because I know that weight loss is

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.880 
now because I know that weight loss is
not<00:04:58.340> a<00:04:58.370> solution<00:04:58.730> and<00:04:59.150> I<00:04:59.210> know<00:04:59.270> that<00:04:59.690> if<00:05:00.500> I<00:05:00.680> lose

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
not a solution and I know that if I lose

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.180 
not a solution and I know that if I lose
my<00:05:01.070> weight<00:05:01.250> I<00:05:01.430> won't<00:05:01.669> be<00:05:01.820> happy<00:05:01.970> and<00:05:02.919> even<00:05:03.919> when
