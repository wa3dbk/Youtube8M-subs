been asking me why does this freeze up

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.720 
been asking me why does this freeze up
when<00:00:22.119> I<00:00:22.179> open<00:00:22.599> up<00:00:22.689> the<00:00:22.749> ipod<00:00:23.320> or<00:00:23.980> whatever<00:00:24.490> and

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
when I open up the ipod or whatever and

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.819 
when I open up the ipod or whatever and
I<00:00:24.789> start<00:00:25.060> playing<00:00:25.269> music<00:00:25.689> the<00:00:26.320> reason<00:00:26.679> it's

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:26.829 
I start playing music the reason it's

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:28.470 
I start playing music the reason it's
like<00:00:26.980> that<00:00:27.160> is<00:00:27.189> because<00:00:27.460> it's<00:00:27.820> designed<00:00:28.269> to

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
like that is because it's designed to

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.569 
like that is because it's designed to
stop<00:00:28.810> so<00:00:29.140> it<00:00:29.320> does<00:00:29.499> not<00:00:29.650> use<00:00:29.890> up<00:00:30.039> your<00:00:30.070> random

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
stop so it does not use up your random

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.850 
stop so it does not use up your random
if<00:00:30.730> it<00:00:31.089> kept<00:00:31.329> on<00:00:31.449> going<00:00:31.779> as<00:00:32.079> you<00:00:32.110> were<00:00:32.619> using

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
if it kept on going as you were using

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.880 
if it kept on going as you were using
your<00:00:33.070> music<00:00:33.430> it<00:00:34.270> would<00:00:34.420> cause<00:00:34.690> your<00:00:35.140> ipod<00:00:35.710> to

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
your music it would cause your ipod to

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.950 
your music it would cause your ipod to
skip<00:00:36.220> whenever<00:00:36.910> you're<00:00:37.090> playing<00:00:37.360> songs<00:00:37.660> and
