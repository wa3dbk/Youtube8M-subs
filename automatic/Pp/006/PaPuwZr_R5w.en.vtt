00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
to the weapon now if you remove the

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.729 
to the weapon now if you remove the
helmet<00:04:05.639> it'll<00:04:06.600> move<00:04:06.780> to<00:04:06.959> chest<00:04:07.230> piece<00:04:07.500> as<00:04:07.709> well

helmet it'll move to chest piece as well

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:13.900 
helmet it'll move to chest piece as well
because<00:04:08.609> this<00:04:08.790> attaches<00:04:09.239> to<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:09.750> helmet

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.130 

and<00:04:14.120> this<00:04:14.420> is<00:04:14.570> what<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:15.050> favor<00:04:15.260> looks<00:04:15.530> like

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
and this is what the favor looks like

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.380 
and this is what the favor looks like
here<00:04:18.140> in<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:18.410> back<00:04:18.790> and<00:04:19.790> there's<00:04:20.030> going<00:04:20.300> to

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
here in the back and there's going to

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:25.210 
here in the back and there's going to
look<00:04:20.480> at<00:04:20.660> the<00:04:20.810> helmet<00:04:21.260> and<00:04:22.480> I<00:04:23.480> think<00:04:23.870> if<00:04:24.590> you

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
look at the helmet and I think if you

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.670 
look at the helmet and I think if you
don't<00:04:25.400> have<00:04:25.580> a<00:04:25.610> coupon<00:04:25.910> it<00:04:26.270> causes<00:04:26.720> 40<00:04:27.380> bucks

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
don't have a coupon it causes 40 bucks

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.490 
don't have a coupon it causes 40 bucks
which<00:04:28.460> i<00:04:28.610> think<00:04:28.670> is<00:04:28.910> kind<00:04:29.090> of<00:04:29.240> a<00:04:29.360> rip<00:04:29.630> off<00:04:29.810> 40

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
which i think is kind of a rip off 40

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.980 
which i think is kind of a rip off 40

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790
