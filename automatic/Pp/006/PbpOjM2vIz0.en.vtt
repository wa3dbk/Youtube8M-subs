when<00:00:04.140> coming<00:00:04.650> up<00:00:04.799> with<00:00:04.859> ideas<00:00:05.040> for<00:00:05.370> fidget<00:00:06.210> toy

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:06.620 
when coming up with ideas for fidget toy

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.980 
when coming up with ideas for fidget toy
I<00:00:07.620> just<00:00:08.460> took<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:09.030> piece<00:00:09.150> of<00:00:09.330> paper<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:09.900> just

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
I just took a piece of paper and just

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.250 
I just took a piece of paper and just
started<00:00:10.740> folding<00:00:11.120> and<00:00:12.120> from<00:00:12.540> there

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.260 
started folding and from there

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.200 
started folding and from there
I<00:00:14.350> just<00:00:14.950> wanted<00:00:15.160> to<00:00:15.280> see<00:00:15.460> what<00:00:15.700> kind<00:00:15.940> of<00:00:15.970> like

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:16.210 
I just wanted to see what kind of like

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.730 
I just wanted to see what kind of like
shapes<00:00:16.570> and<00:00:16.840> forms<00:00:16.960> that<00:00:17.200> I<00:00:17.320> could<00:00:17.470> get<00:00:17.590> out<00:00:17.710> of

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
shapes and forms that I could get out of

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.260 
shapes and forms that I could get out of
it<00:00:17.980> and<00:00:18.670> from<00:00:18.910> that<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:20.800> know<00:00:20.830> that<00:00:21.270> folding

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.270 
it and from that you know that folding

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.679 
it and from that you know that folding
paper<00:00:22.570> had<00:00:23.470> a<00:00:23.500> very<00:00:23.740> like<00:00:23.950> efficient<00:00:24.369> quality

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
paper had a very like efficient quality

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.550 
paper had a very like efficient quality
you're<00:00:25.689> just<00:00:25.869> sort<00:00:26.020> of<00:00:26.080> like<00:00:26.230> having

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
you're just sort of like having

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.750 
you're just sort of like having
something<00:00:26.740> in<00:00:26.950> your<00:00:27.040> hands<00:00:27.400> and<00:00:27.520> you're<00:00:27.640> just

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
something in your hands and you're just

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.420 
something in your hands and you're just
kind<00:00:27.939> of<00:00:27.970> playing<00:00:28.180> around<00:00:28.330> with<00:00:28.660> it<00:00:28.720> and<00:00:29.650> from

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
kind of playing around with it and from

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.890 
kind of playing around with it and from
there<00:00:30.640> I<00:00:30.670> thought<00:00:30.970> you<00:00:31.270> know<00:00:31.360> this<00:00:31.539> is<00:00:31.660> a<00:00:31.690> lot

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
there I thought you know this is a lot

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.680 
there I thought you know this is a lot
like<00:00:32.140> or<00:00:32.770> about<00:00:33.040> me<00:00:33.190> how<00:00:33.850> you<00:00:33.910> you<00:00:34.420> know<00:00:34.480> it's<00:00:34.629> a

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
like or about me how you you know it's a

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.960 
like or about me how you you know it's a
folding<00:00:35.110> paper<00:00:35.350> into<00:00:36.040> like<00:00:36.220> different<00:00:36.699> shapes

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
folding paper into like different shapes

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.439 
folding paper into like different shapes
that<00:00:37.239> are<00:00:37.390> representative<00:00:38.199> like<00:00:38.470> a<00:00:38.500> bird<00:00:38.830> or

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:39.449 
that are representative like a bird or

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:42.479 
that are representative like a bird or
like<00:00:40.449> a<00:00:40.570> star<00:00:40.809> or<00:00:40.960> something<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:42.250> so<00:00:42.460> I

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
like a star or something and so I

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.660 
like a star or something and so I
thought<00:00:42.730> well<00:00:43.000> what<00:00:43.210> if<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:44.770> can<00:00:45.040> take<00:00:45.489> this

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
thought well what if you can take this

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.759 
thought well what if you can take this
paper<00:00:45.940> and<00:00:46.600> create<00:00:46.900> these<00:00:47.080> different<00:00:47.470> shapes

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:47.769 
paper and create these different shapes

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:50.040 
paper and create these different shapes
but<00:00:48.250> then<00:00:48.400> once<00:00:49.150> you're<00:00:49.330> finished<00:00:49.510> with<00:00:49.809> it

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
but then once you're finished with it

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.070 
but then once you're finished with it
you<00:00:50.680> can<00:00:50.979> unfold<00:00:51.309> it<00:00:51.790> and<00:00:52.030> use<00:00:52.629> it<00:00:52.809> over<00:00:52.900> and

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.080 
you can unfold it and use it over and

00:00:53.080 --> 00:01:04.200 
you can unfold it and use it over and
over<00:00:53.170> again<00:01:02.549> basically<00:01:03.549> that's<00:01:03.820> more<00:01:04.059> like

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
over again basically that's more like

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.360 
over again basically that's more like
the<00:01:04.330> first<00:01:04.510> additional<00:01:05.409> idea<00:01:05.650> came<00:01:05.890> from<00:01:05.920> it

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
the first additional idea came from it

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.860 
the first additional idea came from it
was<00:01:06.520> a<00:01:06.729> sort<00:01:07.150> of<00:01:07.210> idea<00:01:07.510> of<00:01:07.570> like<00:01:07.750> an

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
was a sort of idea of like an

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.359 
was a sort of idea of like an
indestructible<00:01:08.729> paper<00:01:09.729> where<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:12.040> has<00:01:12.220> these

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
indestructible paper where it has these

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.560 
indestructible paper where it has these
like<00:01:12.580> pre<00:01:12.850> bent<00:01:14.040> creases<00:01:15.040> that<00:01:15.880> can<00:01:16.330> create

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
like pre bent creases that can create

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.630 
like pre bent creases that can create
these<00:01:16.720> like<00:01:16.960> different<00:01:17.320> forms<00:01:17.740> but<00:01:18.340> then<00:01:18.520> when

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
these like different forms but then when

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.010 
these like different forms but then when
you're<00:01:18.730> finished<00:01:19.030> with<00:01:19.090> it<00:01:19.270> is<00:01:19.450> you<00:01:19.630> can<00:01:19.810> fold

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
you're finished with it is you can fold

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.170 
you're finished with it is you can fold
it<00:01:20.140> back<00:01:20.320> flat<00:01:20.710> and<00:01:21.220> then<00:01:21.640> it<00:01:21.730> like<00:01:21.850> sort<00:01:22.090> of

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
it back flat and then it like sort of

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:29.250 
it back flat and then it like sort of
returns<00:01:22.540> to<00:01:22.810> like<00:01:22.960> a<00:01:23.050> home<00:01:23.530> state

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.650 

when<00:01:29.920> we<00:01:30.100> started<00:01:30.460> researching<00:01:31.030> fidget<00:01:31.630> toys

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
when we started researching fidget toys

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.010 
when we started researching fidget toys
a<00:01:32.170> lot<00:01:32.860> of<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.040> people<00:01:33.190> that<00:01:33.430> I<00:01:33.460> showed

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
a lot of the people that I showed

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.900 
a lot of the people that I showed
different<00:01:35.020> ones<00:01:35.380> really<00:01:35.770> gravitated<00:01:36.490> towards

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
different ones really gravitated towards

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.670 
different ones really gravitated towards
things<00:01:37.690> that<00:01:37.840> they<00:01:37.960> could<00:01:38.140> create<00:01:38.350> anything

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
things that they could create anything

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.050 
things that they could create anything
they<00:01:38.950> wanted<00:01:39.220> to<00:01:39.280> and<00:01:39.550> then<00:01:39.640> they<00:01:39.730> can<00:01:39.880> break

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
they wanted to and then they can break

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.960 
they wanted to and then they can break
it<00:01:40.240> down<00:01:40.270> at<00:01:41.050> any<00:01:41.230> moment<00:01:41.380> and<00:01:41.860> make<00:01:42.850> it

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
it down at any moment and make it

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.320 
it down at any moment and make it
somebody<00:01:43.240> entirely<00:01:43.480> new<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:45.330> something

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
somebody entirely new so something

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.150 
somebody entirely new so something
that's<00:01:46.360> unique<00:01:46.810> about<00:01:46.900> origami<00:01:47.470> is<00:01:47.770> that<00:01:48.040> it

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
that's unique about origami is that it

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.010 
that's unique about origami is that it
has<00:01:48.810> this<00:01:49.810> paper<00:01:50.110> folding<00:01:50.560> thing<00:01:51.250> that<00:01:51.550> that's

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
has this paper folding thing that that's

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.550 
has this paper folding thing that that's
starting<00:01:53.020> from<00:01:53.170> something<00:01:53.470> that's

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
starting from something that's

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.890 
starting from something that's
completely<00:01:53.860> ambiguous<00:01:54.310> and<00:01:54.760> flat<00:01:55.390> and

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
completely ambiguous and flat and

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.680 
completely ambiguous and flat and
turning<00:01:56.290> is<00:01:56.380> something<00:01:56.680> has<00:01:56.890> identity<00:01:57.490> and<00:01:58.480> it

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
turning is something has identity and it

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.770 
turning is something has identity and it
also<00:01:58.900> has<00:01:59.670> incredible<00:02:00.670> like<00:02:00.910> artistry<00:02:01.480> and

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
also has incredible like artistry and

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.470 
also has incredible like artistry and
imagination<00:02:02.710> to<00:02:02.860> it<00:02:03.010> but<00:02:03.940> the<00:02:04.030> thing<00:02:04.210> that<00:02:04.390> it

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
imagination to it but the thing that it

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.460 
imagination to it but the thing that it
has<00:02:04.990> when<00:02:05.410> it<00:02:05.500> that<00:02:05.770> limits<00:02:06.160> it<00:02:06.340> is<00:02:06.520> that<00:02:07.470> once

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
has when it that limits it is that once

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.590 
has when it that limits it is that once
you<00:02:08.619> make<00:02:08.860> say<00:02:09.430> ah<00:02:09.460> the<00:02:09.640> cat<00:02:09.970> or<00:02:10.240> you<00:02:10.360> make<00:02:10.570> a

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
you make say ah the cat or you make a

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.620 
you make say ah the cat or you make a
dog<00:02:11.200> or<00:02:11.500> some<00:02:11.680> some<00:02:12.040> sort<00:02:12.190> of<00:02:12.340> form<00:02:12.610> you<00:02:13.390> can't

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
dog or some some sort of form you can't

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.360 
dog or some some sort of form you can't
break<00:02:13.810> it<00:02:13.870> down<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.590> make<00:02:14.710> it<00:02:14.920> something<00:02:15.100> till

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.720 
break it down and make it something till
I<00:02:15.490> knew<00:02:15.670> so<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:17.680> thing<00:02:17.860> that<00:02:18.010> we<00:02:18.130> wanted<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.490> do

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
I knew so the thing that we wanted to do

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.780 
I knew so the thing that we wanted to do
is<00:02:19.230> some<00:02:20.230> sort<00:02:20.530> of<00:02:20.590> ability<00:02:20.890> that<00:02:21.100> it<00:02:21.490> never

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
is some sort of ability that it never

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.590 
is some sort of ability that it never
would<00:02:22.060> run<00:02:22.240> out<00:02:22.420> of<00:02:22.500> lifespan<00:02:23.730> our<00:02:24.730> objective

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
would run out of lifespan our objective

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.210 
would run out of lifespan our objective
was<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:25.960> find<00:02:26.170> a<00:02:26.710> material<00:02:27.310> that<00:02:27.730> that<00:02:29.220> was

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
was to find a material that that was

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.750 
was to find a material that that was
sort<00:02:30.550> of<00:02:30.610> indestructible<00:02:31.030> so<00:02:31.750> it<00:02:31.990> was<00:02:32.110> able<00:02:32.200> to

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
sort of indestructible so it was able to

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.430 
sort of indestructible so it was able to
cut<00:02:33.760> easily<00:02:34.230> into<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.260> square<00:02:36.220> shape<00:02:36.280> but<00:02:37.060> also

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
cut easily into a square shape but also

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.160 
cut easily into a square shape but also
not<00:02:38.440> tear<00:02:38.860> at<00:02:39.280> all<00:02:39.430> easily<00:02:39.700> associated<00:02:40.420> so<00:02:41.080> be

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
not tear at all easily associated so be

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.460 
not tear at all easily associated so be
found<00:02:41.380> in<00:02:41.470> Tyvek<00:02:41.890> which<00:02:42.820> you<00:02:43.630> can't<00:02:43.900> cut<00:02:44.290> it

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
found in Tyvek which you can't cut it

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.460 
found in Tyvek which you can't cut it
and<00:02:44.770> and<00:02:45.160> no<00:02:45.910> fold<00:02:46.209> but<00:02:46.810> then<00:02:46.989> if<00:02:47.110> you<00:02:47.230> try<00:02:47.350> to

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
and and no fold but then if you try to

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.530 
and and no fold but then if you try to
tear<00:02:47.860> it<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:49.900> can't<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:51.580> so<00:02:51.610> in<00:02:52.239> order<00:02:52.360> to

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
tear it you can't and so in order to

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.260 
tear it you can't and so in order to
bring<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:53.590> like<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:53.890> next<00:02:54.130> level<00:02:54.280> we

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
bring it to like the next level we

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.370 
bring it to like the next level we
wanted<00:02:55.600> to<00:02:55.750> put<00:02:56.250> these<00:02:57.250> sort<00:02:57.430> of<00:02:57.459> triangle

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
wanted to put these sort of triangle

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.180 
wanted to put these sort of triangle
panels

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
panels

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.710 
panels
to<00:03:02.190> kind<00:03:02.370> of<00:03:02.400> give<00:03:02.580> it<00:03:02.730> more<00:03:03.000> weight<00:03:03.360> and

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
to kind of give it more weight and

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.089 
to kind of give it more weight and
should<00:03:03.930> be<00:03:04.050> you<00:03:04.620> know<00:03:04.650> sturdier<00:03:05.129> so<00:03:05.989> me<00:03:06.989> off<00:03:07.560> of

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
should be you know sturdier so me off of

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:13.790 
should be you know sturdier so me off of
square<00:03:09.030> grid<00:03:10.790> there<00:03:11.790> are<00:03:11.940> these<00:03:12.800> triangle

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
square grid there are these triangle

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.790 
square grid there are these triangle
panel<00:03:14.580> shapes<00:03:14.849> that<00:03:15.300> we<00:03:15.420> glued<00:03:16.050> on<00:03:16.379> to<00:03:16.680> the

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
panel shapes that we glued on to the

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.280 
panel shapes that we glued on to the
Tyvek<00:03:17.090> and<00:03:18.090> so<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.569> Tyvek<00:03:18.750> is<00:03:19.019> sort<00:03:19.230> of

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
Tyvek and so the Tyvek is sort of

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.729 
Tyvek and so the Tyvek is sort of
sandwiched<00:03:19.830> in<00:03:20.640> between<00:03:21.319> and<00:03:22.319> it<00:03:22.440> allows<00:03:22.709> it

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
sandwiched in between and it allows it

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:28.009 
sandwiched in between and it allows it
to<00:03:23.040> be<00:03:23.580> have<00:03:23.849> the<00:03:24.060> sort<00:03:24.299> of<00:03:24.360> flexibility<00:03:25.019> to<00:03:27.019> to

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
to be have the sort of flexibility to to

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.289 
to be have the sort of flexibility to to
vary<00:03:28.890> it<00:03:28.950> around<00:03:29.220> so<00:03:29.580> that<00:03:29.610> you<00:03:29.819> can<00:03:29.970> create

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
vary it around so that you can create

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:36.319 
vary it around so that you can create
these<00:03:30.450> different<00:03:30.780> shapes<00:03:33.410> so<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.920> think<00:03:35.819> the

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
these different shapes so I think the

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.289 
these different shapes so I think the
beauty<00:03:36.630> in<00:03:36.780> is<00:03:37.470> that<00:03:37.799> it<00:03:37.860> it<00:03:38.700> is<00:03:38.849> the<00:03:39.000> sort<00:03:39.239> of

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
beauty in is that it it is the sort of

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.080 
beauty in is that it it is the sort of
blank<00:03:39.810> piece<00:03:40.110> of<00:03:40.140> paper<00:03:40.459> and<00:03:41.459> then<00:03:41.700> just<00:03:41.730> by

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
blank piece of paper and then just by

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.780 
blank piece of paper and then just by
folding<00:03:42.510> it<00:03:42.690> it<00:03:43.019> has<00:03:43.230> a<00:03:43.260> sort<00:03:43.590> of<00:03:43.790> magical

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
folding it it has a sort of magical

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
folding it it has a sort of magical
quality<00:03:45.269> where<00:03:45.780> it<00:03:46.069> you<00:03:47.299> it<00:03:48.299> becomes<00:03:48.540> a<00:03:48.629> sort

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
quality where it you it becomes a sort

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.199 
quality where it you it becomes a sort
of<00:03:48.870> artistic<00:03:49.170> shape<00:03:49.560> where<00:03:49.769> you<00:03:50.069> start<00:03:50.970> flat

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
of artistic shape where you start flat

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.960 
of artistic shape where you start flat
but<00:03:51.420> then<00:03:51.510> as<00:03:51.629> soon<00:03:51.780> as<00:03:51.870> you<00:03:51.959> fold<00:03:52.170> it<00:03:52.349> it<00:03:52.970> makes

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
but then as soon as you fold it it makes

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.910 
but then as soon as you fold it it makes
all<00:03:54.150> these<00:03:54.269> different<00:03:55.079> forms<00:03:55.290> and<00:03:55.410> shapes<00:03:55.470> and

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
all these different forms and shapes and

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.130 
all these different forms and shapes and
now<00:03:56.040> it<00:03:56.910> totally<00:03:57.450> transforms<00:03:57.660> it<00:03:58.110> to

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
now it totally transforms it to

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.050 
now it totally transforms it to
something<00:03:58.530> else<00:03:58.680> and<00:03:59.099> that<00:03:59.160> the

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
something else and that the

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.670 
something else and that the
possibilities<00:04:00.750> are<00:04:00.780> endless<00:04:00.930> so<00:04:01.349> it's<00:04:01.530> like

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
possibilities are endless so it's like

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.670 
possibilities are endless so it's like
you<00:04:02.489> have<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.360> power<00:04:03.780> and<00:04:04.019> the<00:04:04.140> creativity<00:04:04.440> to

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
you have the power and the creativity to

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.129 
you have the power and the creativity to
use<00:04:04.829> your<00:04:04.920> imagination<00:04:05.579> to<00:04:05.790> create<00:04:06.720> all<00:04:06.959> these

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
use your imagination to create all these

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.470 
use your imagination to create all these
new<00:04:07.680> forms

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
new forms

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.540 
new forms
