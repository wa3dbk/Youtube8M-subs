obviously<00:01:43.460> pretty<00:01:43.760> good<00:01:44.090> I<00:01:44.300> mean<00:01:44.570> I<00:01:44.870> wouldn't

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
obviously pretty good I mean I wouldn't

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.480 
obviously pretty good I mean I wouldn't
be<00:01:45.350> I<00:01:45.620> don't<00:01:45.950> think<00:01:46.160> it<00:01:46.220> would<00:01:46.310> have<00:01:46.400> had

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
be I don't think it would have had

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.860 
be I don't think it would have had
nearly<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:46.880> success<00:01:47.270> I<00:01:47.450> would<00:01:47.510> have<00:01:47.720> it

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
nearly the success I would have it

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.230 
nearly the success I would have it
wasn't<00:01:48.200> for<00:01:48.350> for<00:01:48.710> him<00:01:48.860> and<00:01:49.280> his<00:01:49.520> style<00:01:50.180> of

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
wasn't for for him and his style of

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.260 
wasn't for for him and his style of
goaltending<00:01:50.450> so<00:01:51.440> you<00:01:52.400> know<00:01:52.520> I've<00:01:52.640> changed<00:01:52.940> a
