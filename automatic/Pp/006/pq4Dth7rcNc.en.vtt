it<00:00:38.530> in<00:00:38.559> time<00:00:38.650> before<00:00:39.100> the<00:00:39.190> bus<00:00:39.339> moved<00:00:39.640> and<00:00:40.440> to

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
it in time before the bus moved and to

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.810 
it in time before the bus moved and to
do<00:00:41.559> the<00:00:41.710> second<00:00:42.129> glitch<00:00:42.309> which<00:00:42.519> is<00:00:42.640> in<00:00:42.729> the

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
do the second glitch which is in the

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.490 
do the second glitch which is in the
power<00:00:43.000> room<00:00:43.330> you<00:00:43.540> have<00:00:43.659> to<00:00:43.809> go<00:00:44.019> all<00:00:44.049> the<00:00:44.290> way<00:00:44.409> to

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
power room you have to go all the way to

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.689 
power room you have to go all the way to
the<00:00:44.620> last<00:00:44.769> bus<00:00:45.040> location<00:00:45.549> anyways<00:00:45.970> so<00:00:46.870> I

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
the last bus location anyways so I

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:49.469 
the last bus location anyways so I
figured<00:00:48.699> I<00:00:48.760> might<00:00:48.879> as<00:00:48.940> well<00:00:49.119> just<00:00:49.239> have<00:00:49.360> it

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:49.479 
figured I might as well just have it

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:52.140 
figured I might as well just have it
sped<00:00:49.690> up<00:00:49.869> until<00:00:50.379> then<00:00:50.530> so<00:00:51.369> anyways<00:00:51.820> yeah<00:00:52.030> the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
should have been a big thing that you

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.020 
should have been a big thing that you
just<00:02:11.830> saw<00:02:11.950> zombie<00:02:12.280> killer<00:02:12.490> put<00:02:12.670> there<00:02:12.880> and

just saw zombie killer put there and

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.910 
just saw zombie killer put there and
then<00:02:13.480> right<00:02:13.630> where<00:02:13.780> he<00:02:13.900> just<00:02:14.020> ran<00:02:14.380> also

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
then right where he just ran also

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.309 
then right where he just ran also
there's<00:02:15.100> enough<00:02:15.340> is<00:02:15.490> a<00:02:15.520> switch<00:02:15.910> now<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:16.900> flip

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
there's enough is a switch now you flip

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.960 
there's enough is a switch now you flip
on<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.440> power<00:02:17.770> it<00:02:18.370> should<00:02:18.550> be<00:02:18.640> right<00:02:18.730> there

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
on the power it should be right there

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.570 
on the power it should be right there
you<00:02:19.090> flip<00:02:19.240> on<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.450> power

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
you flip on the power

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.330 
you flip on the power
and<00:02:20.810> then<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:22.080> simply<00:02:22.350> just<00:02:22.530> walk<00:02:22.890> up<00:02:23.070> to<00:02:23.100> this

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
and then you simply just walk up to this

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.150 
and then you simply just walk up to this
thing<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.700> Crouch<00:02:24.000> just<00:02:24.270> like<00:02:24.420> this<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:25.160> move

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
thing and Crouch just like this and move

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.530 
thing and Crouch just like this and move
all<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.460> way<00:02:26.490> to<00:02:26.700> your<00:02:26.820> left<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.390> make<00:02:27.510> sure

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
all the way to your left and make sure

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.540 
all the way to your left and make sure
you're<00:02:27.750> staying<00:02:27.960> in<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.170> your<00:02:28.290> left<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.800> if

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
you're staying in to your left and if

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.830 
you're staying in to your left and if
you<00:02:29.580> do<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:29.910> zombies<00:02:30.270> will<00:02:30.420> just<00:02:30.570> pile<00:02:30.810> up

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
you do that zombies will just pile up

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.080 
you do that zombies will just pile up
right<00:02:31.380> where<00:02:32.100> you'll<00:02:32.220> see<00:02:32.400> them<00:02:32.550> pile<00:02:32.760> up<00:02:32.940> in<00:02:33.000> a

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
right where you'll see them pile up in a

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.760 
right where you'll see them pile up in a
second<00:02:33.510> guess<00:02:34.140> I'd<00:02:34.320> make<00:02:34.470> sure<00:02:34.590> you're<00:02:34.710> all

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
second guess I'd make sure you're all

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.560 
second guess I'd make sure you're all
the<00:02:34.830> way<00:02:34.890> through<00:02:35.040> your<00:02:35.160> left<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.670> if<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.480> do

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
the way through your left and if you do

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.700 
the way through your left and if you do
it<00:02:36.690> right<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.990> zombies<00:02:37.230> will<00:02:37.260> just<00:02:37.500> pile<00:02:37.680> up

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
it right the zombies will just pile up

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.630 
it right the zombies will just pile up
and<00:02:38.070> they<00:02:38.130> will<00:02:38.250> not<00:02:38.340> hit<00:02:38.550> you<00:02:38.790> um<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:40.640> suggest

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
and they will not hit you um I suggest

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.220 
and they will not hit you um I suggest
not<00:02:41.790> letting<00:02:42.150> them<00:02:42.270> pile<00:02:42.480> up<00:02:42.630> too<00:02:42.810> much<00:02:42.930> like

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
not letting them pile up too much like

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.690 
not letting them pile up too much like
try<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.620> kill<00:02:43.860> them<00:02:43.950> before<00:02:44.010> they<00:02:44.340> get<00:02:44.550> to<00:02:44.670> that

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
try to kill them before they get to that

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.210 
try to kill them before they get to that
spot<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.390> use<00:02:46.260> this<00:02:46.380> more<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.740> security

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
spot and use this more of a security

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.440 
spot and use this more of a security
measure<00:02:47.460> so<00:02:47.820> this<00:02:47.970> way<00:02:48.120> like<00:02:48.240> you<00:02:48.330> know<00:02:48.420> like

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
measure so this way like you know like

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.540 
measure so this way like you know like
if<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:48.870> run<00:02:49.290> if<00:02:49.410> you're<00:02:49.740> reloading<00:02:50.100> see<00:02:50.490> if

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
if you run if you're reloading see if

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.760 
if you run if you're reloading see if
they<00:02:50.640> go<00:02:50.760> pile<00:02:51.000> up<00:02:51.270> but<00:02:51.630> I'm<00:02:52.260> just<00:02:52.500> worried<00:02:52.710> if

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
they go pile up but I'm just worried if

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.260 
they go pile up but I'm just worried if
there's<00:02:52.980> too<00:02:53.130> much<00:02:53.160> of<00:02:53.490> them<00:02:53.610> a<00:02:53.640> whole<00:02:54.000> swarm

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
there's too much of them a whole swarm

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.790 
there's too much of them a whole swarm
of<00:02:54.420> zombies<00:02:54.720> they<00:02:54.840> will<00:02:55.050> break<00:02:55.380> past<00:02:55.620> that

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
of zombies they will break past that

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.720 
of zombies they will break past that
little<00:02:55.980> barrier<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.460> hit<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:56.970> kill<00:02:57.180> you

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
little barrier and hit you and kill you

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.280 
little barrier and hit you and kill you
but<00:02:59.730> yeah<00:02:59.880> as<00:03:00.090> far<00:03:00.240> as<00:03:00.360> credit<00:03:00.660> goes<00:03:00.780> I<00:03:00.900> have<00:03:01.110> no

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
but yeah as far as credit goes I have no

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
idea who found these probably I'm pretty

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.040 
idea who found these probably I'm pretty
sure<00:03:05.070> are<00:03:05.220> spk<00:03:05.580> is<00:03:05.700> found<00:03:05.910> this<00:03:06.000> one<00:03:06.270> and<00:03:06.600> the

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050
