00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:14.300 
read an almost bored this was this is a

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.489 
read an almost bored this was this is a
actually<00:00:15.019> wrote<00:00:15.230> 7.6<00:00:16.070> for<00:00:16.279> so<00:00:16.699> long<00:00:16.939> I<00:00:17.119> mean<00:00:17.499> 10

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:18.499 
actually wrote 7.6 for so long I mean 10

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:20.259 
actually wrote 7.6 for so long I mean 10
plus<00:00:18.739> years<00:00:19.009> pretty<00:00:19.220> much<00:00:19.310> and<00:00:19.820> I<00:00:20.239> just

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:20.269 
plus years pretty much and I just

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:21.579 
plus years pretty much and I just
finally<00:00:20.720> started<00:00:20.989> writing<00:00:21.169> a<00:00:21.199> seven<00:00:21.470> point

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:21.589 
finally started writing a seven point

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:24.130 
finally started writing a seven point
seven<00:00:21.890> not<00:00:22.429> much<00:00:22.579> of<00:00:22.699> a<00:00:22.759> huge<00:00:22.909> jump<00:00:23.239> but<00:00:23.480> makes

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
seven not much of a huge jump but makes

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.859 
seven not much of a huge jump but makes
a<00:00:24.230> difference<00:00:24.560> so<00:00:24.739> seven<00:00:25.699> point<00:00:25.880> seven<00:00:26.089> this

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
a difference so seven point seven this

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.239 
a difference so seven point seven this
is<00:00:27.019> like<00:00:27.169> some<00:00:27.349> new<00:00:27.499> board<00:00:27.769> that<00:00:27.919> came<00:00:28.099> out

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:28.249 
is like some new board that came out

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:31.630 
is like some new board that came out
it's<00:00:28.669> like<00:00:28.849> some<00:00:29.060> collab<00:00:29.659> with<00:00:29.810> DVS<00:00:30.140> a<00:00:30.640> couple

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
it's like some collab with DVS a couple

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.220 
it's like some collab with DVS a couple
of<00:00:31.699> days<00:00:31.849> my<00:00:32.059> board<00:00:32.300> so<00:00:32.570> like<00:00:32.780> slid<00:00:33.079> down

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
of days my board so like slid down

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.890 
of days my board so like slid down
anyways<00:00:33.680> but<00:00:34.190> I<00:00:34.430> do<00:00:34.670> like<00:00:34.910> colors<00:00:35.300> bright

weird but I do like bright colors like
just<00:00:41.060> something<00:00:41.300> while<00:00:41.450> it's<00:00:41.600> flipping<00:00:41.990> I

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
just something while it's flipping I

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.650 
just something while it's flipping I
like<00:00:42.410> reds<00:00:42.680> blacks<00:00:43.100> I<00:00:43.400> ride<00:00:43.940> the<00:00:44.090> tensor<00:00:44.480> low

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
like reds blacks I ride the tensor low

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.460 
like reds blacks I ride the tensor low
magnesium's<00:00:45.380> new<00:00:45.740> ones<00:00:46.360> black<00:00:47.360> I<00:00:47.750> ride<00:00:48.320> my

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
magnesium's new ones black I ride my

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.910 
magnesium's new ones black I ride my
trucks<00:00:49.180> barely<00:00:50.180> loose<00:00:50.390> like<00:00:51.230> I<00:00:51.350> read<00:00:51.530> my<00:00:51.680> front

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
trucks barely loose like I read my front

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.640 
trucks barely loose like I read my front
one<00:00:52.010> a<00:00:52.040> lot<00:00:52.310> looser<00:00:52.520> than<00:00:53.050> did<00:00:54.050> my<00:00:54.170> back<00:00:54.350> one<00:00:54.620> I

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
one a lot looser than did my back one I

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.400 
one a lot looser than did my back one I
read<00:00:54.860> my<00:00:54.950> back<00:00:55.100> one<00:00:55.310> medium<00:00:55.960> just<00:00:56.960> so<00:00:57.050> I<00:00:57.079> don't

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
read my back one medium just so I don't

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.780 
read my back one medium just so I don't
know<00:00:57.470> it's<00:00:57.710> like<00:00:57.770> a<00:00:57.860> stabilizer<00:00:58.400> like<00:00:58.670> I

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
know it's like a stabilizer like I

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.700 
know it's like a stabilizer like I
stable<00:00:59.120> back<00:00:59.300> here<00:00:59.600> but<00:01:00.020> then<00:01:00.170> I'm<00:01:00.260> squirrely

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
stable back here but then I'm squirrely

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.400 
stable back here but then I'm squirrely
up<00:01:00.800> front<00:01:01.070> and<00:01:01.489> I<00:01:01.579> put<00:01:01.820> a<00:01:01.850> I<00:01:02.360> put<00:01:02.870> two<00:01:03.020> washers

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
up front and I put a I put two washers

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.980 
up front and I put a I put two washers
on<00:01:03.560> top<00:01:03.800> only<00:01:04.790> and<00:01:05.239> then<00:01:05.329> I<00:01:05.360> have<00:01:05.540> my<00:01:05.689> bottom

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
on top only and then I have my bottom

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.080 
on top only and then I have my bottom
bushing<00:01:06.380> so<00:01:06.979> I<00:01:07.009> get<00:01:07.189> that<00:01:07.280> little<00:01:07.429> wobble<00:01:07.880> and

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
bushing so I get that little wobble and

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.349 
bushing so I get that little wobble and
it's<00:01:08.420> still<00:01:08.630> with<00:01:09.170> the<00:01:09.289> washers<00:01:09.649> on<00:01:09.799> top<00:01:10.359> it

00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:11.359 
it's still with the washers on top it

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:13.120 
it's still with the washers on top it
kind<00:01:11.600> of<00:01:11.659> helps<00:01:11.869> to<00:01:11.960> because<00:01:12.409> I<00:01:12.619> get<00:01:12.799> like<00:01:12.950> a

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
kind of helps to because I get like a

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.249 
kind of helps to because I get like a
little<00:01:13.369> pinch<00:01:13.850> point<00:01:14.210> where<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:14.810> washers

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
little pinch point where the washers

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.230 
little pinch point where the washers
helps<00:01:15.590> be<00:01:16.130> right<00:01:16.369> before<00:01:16.670> it<00:01:16.729> gets<00:01:16.850> wheel<00:01:16.999> bite

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
helps be right before it gets wheel bite

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.730 
helps be right before it gets wheel bite
I<00:01:17.270> get<00:01:17.539> like<00:01:17.689> a<00:01:17.719> split<00:01:18.020> second<00:01:18.289> like<00:01:18.350> up<00:01:18.530> wheel

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
I get like a split second like up wheel

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.319 
I get like a split second like up wheel
bite<00:01:18.979> but<00:01:19.189> I<00:01:19.219> get<00:01:19.399> that<00:01:19.520> split<00:01:19.939> second<00:01:20.270> to

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:20.329 
bite but I get that split second to

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:22.510 
bite but I get that split second to
think<00:01:20.569> and<00:01:20.749> then<00:01:20.840> it<00:01:20.990> will<00:01:21.109> bite<00:01:21.350> so<00:01:21.740> it's<00:01:21.920> kind

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
think and then it will bite so it's kind

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.859 
think and then it will bite so it's kind
of<00:01:22.549> a<00:01:22.639> good<00:01:22.759> thing<00:01:22.969> so<00:01:23.119> you<00:01:23.210> guys<00:01:23.329> should<00:01:23.479> try

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
of a good thing so you guys should try

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.349 
of a good thing so you guys should try
it<00:01:23.929> out<00:01:24.109> test<00:01:24.649> it<00:01:24.770> out<00:01:24.859> maybe<00:01:25.159> hit<00:01:25.340> a<00:01:25.369> hill<00:01:25.700> as

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:26.359 
it out test it out maybe hit a hill as

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:27.849 
it out test it out maybe hit a hill as
fast<00:01:26.420> as<00:01:26.749> you<00:01:26.840> can<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:27.200> try<00:01:27.319> that<00:01:27.469> wheel<00:01:27.649> bite

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:27.859 
fast as you can and try that wheel bite

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:32.010 
fast as you can and try that wheel bite
at<00:01:27.979> the<00:01:28.069> bottom<00:01:28.310> of<00:01:28.429> it

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.569 

Lanyon<00:01:32.380> start<00:01:32.710> doing<00:01:32.890> my<00:01:32.950> back<00:01:33.130> truck<00:01:33.430> with

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
Lanyon start doing my back truck with

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:36.270 
Lanyon start doing my back truck with
just<00:01:33.759> the<00:01:34.149> top<00:01:34.329> washers<00:01:34.750> -<00:01:34.930> but<00:01:35.170> how<00:01:35.950> -<00:01:35.979> come

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
just the top washers - but how - come

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.600 
just the top washers - but how - come
soon<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:37.659> actual<00:01:38.049> the<00:01:38.320> actual<00:01:38.560> truck<00:01:38.799> being

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
soon the actual the actual truck being

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.310 
soon the actual the actual truck being
like<00:01:39.820> that<00:01:40.030> messes<00:01:40.329> me<00:01:40.570> up<00:01:40.600> on<00:01:40.810> some<00:01:41.049> tricks

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
like that messes me up on some tricks

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.749 
like that messes me up on some tricks
like<00:01:41.619> tricks<00:01:41.860> I<00:01:41.950> used<00:01:42.100> to<00:01:42.159> be<00:01:42.250> able<00:01:42.369> to<00:01:42.429> do

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
like tricks I used to be able to do

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.459 
like tricks I used to be able to do
McNally<00:01:43.390> back<00:01:43.600> hills<00:01:43.869> and<00:01:44.079> stuff<00:01:44.170> like<00:01:44.289> that

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:44.469 
McNally back hills and stuff like that

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:46.560 
McNally back hills and stuff like that
all<00:01:44.649> the<00:01:44.799> time<00:01:45.009> and<00:01:45.310> now<00:01:45.939> I<00:01:45.969> try<00:01:46.119> them<00:01:46.479> and

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
all the time and now I try them and

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.639 
all the time and now I try them and
sometimes<00:01:46.750> it<00:01:46.960> looks<00:01:47.020> like<00:01:47.170> I've<00:01:47.259> never<00:01:47.500> done
