learned so far and navigate this course
as<00:00:16.260> fast<00:00:16.740> as<00:00:16.950> you<00:00:17.040> can<00:00:17.279> watch<00:00:17.730> your<00:00:17.970> altitude

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
as fast as you can watch your altitude

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.810 
as fast as you can watch your altitude
though<00:00:18.599> this<00:00:19.110> is<00:00:19.380> really<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.800> test<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.310> how<00:00:20.490> low

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
though this is really a test of how low

though this is really a test of how low
you<00:00:20.880> can<00:00:21.180> go<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.660> how<00:00:21.990> well<00:00:22.290> she<00:00:22.439> commits<00:00:22.740> over

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
you can go and how well she commits over

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.540 
you can go and how well she commits over
the<00:00:23.099> place

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550

okay gear set point marked on the radar

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.010 
okay gear set point marked on the radar
you're<00:02:51.670> gonna<00:02:51.820> practice<00:02:52.390> an<00:02:52.510> emergency

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
you're gonna practice an emergency

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.090 

that<00:03:19.670> was<00:03:19.880> an<00:03:20.030> excellent<00:03:20.240> landing<00:03:21.170> very<00:03:21.740> well

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
that was an excellent landing very well

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.620 
that was an excellent landing very well
done

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.590 

always<00:04:02.730> make<00:04:02.940> sure<00:04:02.970> your<00:04:03.300> plane<00:04:03.569> is

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
always make sure your plane is

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.660 
always make sure your plane is
straightened<00:04:04.200> out<00:04:04.350> before<00:04:04.980> you<00:04:05.130> attempt<00:04:05.580> an

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
now we're talking you're doing good so

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.640 
now we're talking you're doing good so
far<00:04:44.760> I<00:04:45.240> think<00:04:45.600> we<00:04:45.690> can<00:04:45.810> squeeze<00:04:46.050> in<00:04:46.320> one<00:04:46.590> more

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
far I think we can squeeze in one more

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.220 
far I think we can squeeze in one more
stunt<00:04:47.190> will<00:04:47.610> combine<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:48.150> inside<00:04:48.540> loop<00:04:48.840> with
