big whip who cares right
I<00:00:23.660> wouldn't<00:00:24.289> decide<00:00:24.650> on<00:00:25.060> which<00:00:26.060> one<00:00:26.300> to<00:00:26.420> get

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
I wouldn't decide on which one to get

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.510 
I wouldn't decide on which one to get
based<00:00:26.900> on<00:00:27.110> the<00:00:27.199> looks<00:00:27.470> and<00:00:27.740> you<00:00:28.130> shouldn't

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
based on the looks and you shouldn't

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.170 
based on the looks and you shouldn't
either

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180

either
here's<00:00:29.990> the<00:00:30.170> important<00:00:30.650> stuff<00:00:30.830> folks<00:00:31.599> the

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
here's the important stuff folks the

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.219 
here's the important stuff folks the
first<00:00:32.930> thing<00:00:33.109> you<00:00:33.230> need<00:00:33.350> to<00:00:33.410> do<00:00:33.680> is<00:00:33.980> log<00:00:34.969> on<00:00:35.229> to

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:36.229 
first thing you need to do is log on to

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:38.380 
first thing you need to do is log on to
our<00:00:36.260> website<00:00:36.559> and<00:00:37.069> check<00:00:37.460> the<00:00:37.699> coverage<00:00:38.089> maps

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
our website and check the coverage maps

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.129 
our website and check the coverage maps
to<00:00:39.350> see<00:00:39.589> who<00:00:40.159> has<00:00:40.960> 4G<00:00:41.960> coverage<00:00:42.469> in<00:00:42.979> your<00:00:43.429> area

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:44.139 
to see who has 4G coverage in your area

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:47.919 
to see who has 4G coverage in your area
because<00:00:45.139> that<00:00:45.850> is<00:00:46.850> the<00:00:46.999> important<00:00:47.510> thing<00:00:47.539> who

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:47.929 
because that is the important thing who

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:50.590 
because that is the important thing who
has<00:00:48.139> 4G<00:00:48.679> now<00:00:48.920> if<00:00:49.190> neither<00:00:49.460> of<00:00:49.609> them<00:00:49.850> have<00:00:49.999> 4G

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
has 4G now if neither of them have 4G

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.020 
has 4G now if neither of them have 4G
then<00:00:51.440> guess<00:00:51.649> what<00:00:51.859> I<00:00:52.039> would<00:00:52.309> choose<00:00:52.729> the

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
then guess what I would choose the

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.829 
then guess what I would choose the
Verizon<00:00:53.569> card<00:00:53.839> why<00:00:54.909> because<00:00:55.909> it's<00:00:56.120> $10<00:00:56.809> a

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:56.839 
Verizon card why because it's $10 a

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:00.729 
Verizon card why because it's $10 a
month<00:00:56.989> cheaper<00:00:57.709> and<00:00:59.229> they're<00:01:00.229> expanding

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
month cheaper and they're expanding

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.689 
month cheaper and they're expanding
quicker<00:01:01.459> than<00:01:02.289> Sprint<00:01:03.289> is<00:01:03.530> so<00:01:04.339> you're<00:01:04.489> more

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
quicker than Sprint is so you're more

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.930 
quicker than Sprint is so you're more
apt<00:01:04.970> to<00:01:05.150> get<00:01:05.390> 4G<00:01:06.080> sooner<00:01:06.710> with<00:01:07.159> Verizon<00:01:07.820> than

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
apt to get 4G sooner with Verizon than

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.010 
apt to get 4G sooner with Verizon than
you<00:01:08.060> are<00:01:08.180> with<00:01:08.360> Sprint<00:01:09.790> okay<00:01:10.790> now<00:01:11.270> let's<00:01:11.780> say

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
you are with Sprint okay now let's say

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.000 
you are with Sprint okay now let's say
that<00:01:12.670> they<00:01:13.670> both<00:01:14.030> have<00:01:14.390> excuse<00:01:15.350> me<00:01:15.500> they<00:01:15.710> both

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
that they both have excuse me they both

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.990 
that they both have excuse me they both
have<00:01:16.280> 4G<00:01:16.820> coverage<00:01:17.650> ok<00:01:18.650> well<00:01:18.830> then<00:01:18.980> then<00:01:19.700> the

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
have 4G coverage ok well then then the

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.430 
have 4G coverage ok well then then the
question<00:01:20.360> you<00:01:20.450> need<00:01:20.570> to<00:01:20.630> ask<00:01:20.810> yourself<00:01:21.290> is

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
question you need to ask yourself is

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.210 
question you need to ask yourself is
this<00:01:21.880> how<00:01:22.880> much<00:01:23.180> of<00:01:23.240> a<00:01:23.570> power<00:01:23.810> user<00:01:24.230> are<00:01:24.620> you<00:01:24.920> if

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
this how much of a power user are you if

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.940 
this how much of a power user are you if
you<00:01:25.850> are<00:01:26.120> a<00:01:26.150> power<00:01:26.630> user<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:27.410> you<00:01:27.560> want<00:01:27.590> to<00:01:27.830> do

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
you are a power user and you want to do

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.440 
you are a power user and you want to do
all<00:01:28.160> kinds<00:01:28.550> of<00:01:28.610> crazy<00:01:28.880> things<00:01:29.000> on<00:01:29.360> the

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
all kinds of crazy things on the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.410 
all kinds of crazy things on the
internet<00:01:29.780> get<00:01:30.620> sprint<00:01:31.280> because<00:01:32.240> it's

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
internet get sprint because it's

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.860 
internet get sprint because it's
unlimited<00:01:33.350> service<00:01:34.010> as<00:01:34.550> long<00:01:35.120> as<00:01:35.480> you're<00:01:35.660> in<00:01:35.780> a

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
unlimited service as long as you're in a

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.690 
unlimited service as long as you're in a
4G<00:01:36.350> area<00:01:37.330> if<00:01:38.330> you<00:01:39.050> are<00:01:39.320> not<00:01:39.680> a<00:01:40.010> if<00:01:40.430> you're<00:01:40.580> just

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
4G area if you are not a if you're just

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.820 
4G area if you are not a if you're just
a<00:01:40.820> regular<00:01:41.000> Internet<00:01:41.660> user<00:01:41.900> you're<00:01:42.320> not<00:01:42.470> doing

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
a regular Internet user you're not doing

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.760 
a regular Internet user you're not doing
all<00:01:42.920> kinds<00:01:43.310> of<00:01:43.340> crazy<00:01:43.490> stuff<00:01:43.940> and<00:01:44.770> whatnot

all kinds of crazy stuff and whatnot

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.399 
all kinds of crazy stuff and whatnot
then<00:01:46.280> guess<00:01:46.520> what<00:01:46.760> I<00:01:47.030> would<00:01:47.180> get<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.540> Verizon

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
then guess what I would get the Verizon

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.920 
then guess what I would get the Verizon
card<00:01:48.710> because<00:01:49.190> it's<00:01:49.370> $10<00:01:50.090> a<00:01:50.120> month<00:01:50.270> less<00:01:50.690> it's

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
card because it's $10 a month less it's

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.670 
card because it's $10 a month less it's
$50<00:01:51.710> a<00:01:51.740> month<00:01:51.860> instead<00:01:52.400> of<00:01:52.670> 60<00:01:53.390> but<00:01:54.290> there<00:01:54.500> is<00:01:54.650> a

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
$50 a month instead of 60 but there is a

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.440 
$50 a month instead of 60 but there is a
5<00:01:55.130> gigabyte<00:01:55.670> limit<00:01:55.940> on<00:01:56.270> Verizon<00:01:56.990> so<00:01:57.950> you<00:01:58.450> you

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
5 gigabyte limit on Verizon so you you

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.330 
5 gigabyte limit on Verizon so you you
know<00:01:59.570> you<00:02:00.020> do<00:02:00.229> need<00:02:00.380> to<00:02:00.470> watch<00:02:00.650> what<00:02:01.159> you're

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
know you do need to watch what you're

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.780 
know you do need to watch what you're
doing<00:02:01.900> the<00:02:02.900> 5<00:02:03.170> gigabytes<00:02:03.710> is<00:02:03.890> a<00:02:03.920> lot<00:02:04.190> folks<00:02:04.460> in

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
doing the 5 gigabytes is a lot folks in

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.259 
doing the 5 gigabytes is a lot folks in
fact<00:02:05.090> there's<00:02:05.420> a<00:02:05.540> chart<00:02:06.140> on<00:02:06.320> our<00:02:06.440> website<00:02:07.269> that

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
fact there's a chart on our website that

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.570 
fact there's a chart on our website that
explains<00:02:08.780> exactly<00:02:08.959> how<00:02:09.379> much<00:02:09.619> 5<00:02:09.890> gigabytes<00:02:10.369> is

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
explains exactly how much 5 gigabytes is

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.899 
explains exactly how much 5 gigabytes is
if<00:02:11.000> you<00:02:11.360> want<00:02:11.540> to<00:02:11.599> check<00:02:11.840> that<00:02:11.870> out<00:02:12.909> so

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:13.909 
if you want to check that out so

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:15.860 
if you want to check that out so
hopefully<00:02:14.299> that<00:02:14.450> makes<00:02:14.480> sense<00:02:14.989> as<00:02:15.260> far

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
hopefully that makes sense as far

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.170 
hopefully that makes sense as far
which<00:02:16.230> way<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.560> go<00:02:17.159> as<00:02:17.310> far<00:02:17.610> as<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.879> price<00:02:18.120> of

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
which way to go as far as the price of

which way to go as far as the price of
the<00:02:18.450> devices<00:02:19.200> both<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.220> them<00:02:20.370> are<00:02:20.610> free<00:02:21.150> on<00:02:21.420> our
