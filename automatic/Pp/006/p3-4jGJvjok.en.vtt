00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.380
 the lowest rate of your partners and 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.519
 pharma ne her link in the description and not 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.889
 forget to say you came with a locker 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.110
 you lacquer and today we finally 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.839
 starts a new project that will 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.839
 called the dark side of power 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.950
 plays the next match and so well 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.260
 let's go the next match we play the same 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.020
 the very composition absolutely with the same 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.970
 spare and now we must try 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.770
 it is necessary to win after all 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.510
 win because the players are not bad 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.480
 really quite manifested in 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.510
 first match sniper but mckormak and 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.080
 the clones were on top 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.940
 so our rival beshiktash 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:58.120
 so try to beat beshiktash 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:02.049
 So look at the composition of beshiktash dumbiya 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:05.440
 and bo we have a lot of players ahead 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:07.270
 from the Turkish championship well, what is 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.280
 The composition of the principle is average but I think 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.430
 will be simpler than the previous match 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.810
 let's go the match starts both what moment 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.810
 what a moment and this is schneider but i 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.810
 but but but 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.760
 Today, Schneider is hitting the ball with us and this 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.310
 getting a score of 10 is in our favor 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.500
 let's see how it was like this 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.930
 made us a sniper whom i just 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.600
 cover criticized for the previous match 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.990
 and now he decided to correct right away 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.120
 let's see how it was and so I look 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.920
 already thought that the moment is lost but here 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.170
 no turns around and punches in 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.070
 the farthest corner from the goalkeeper and displays our 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.750
 team forward 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:54.440
 Excellent 10 and there are again moments 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:58.250
 you again dreams and oak doin on this and 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:01.280
 making 20 double scored the second goal in 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.870
 us sneijder here everything was principle 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.149
 just but he didn't miss his chance 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:13.280
 let's see this goal let's get it 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:15.620
 let's see immediately immediately takes shots 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.130
 sniper almost two points at once and 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.260
 just two goals look like it was 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.650
 Well, it's a great start for our 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.200
 teams see what happens next so 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.520
 classes too are getting close to us 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.520
 penalty and claude 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.930
 1930 but in general no chance of an opponent 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.500
 no just no chance he has no me 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.080
 I do not know I do not even have time to no 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.920
 other moments were not even simple 1 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.730
 strike 1 goal 2 strike 2 goal 3 strike and immediately 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.100
 third goal 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.910
 nothing else even happens in the match 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.100
 while only I score gets first 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.940
 the moment the opponent go out and time to the gate 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.780
 and here 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.450
 even applied to both of pancake is not the tax 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.769
 Do I have more time to score one more time to score 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.560
 not failed but it would be already 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:13.890
 completely and rival to be honest in general 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.690
 there is nothing does not surprise me 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.780
 absolutely no dangerous moments 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:22.519
 it does not occur 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.519
 moment shape molecule 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:29.750
 04 role we have such a mystery is just 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.490
 and there is glad that you look at all 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.690
 defended no he rests and just don't care 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:39.330
 put say speak from form four balls 4 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.640
 swords shipped to rival in the first half 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.000
 and already no doubt that this 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:48.300
 that this is not enough for you to win and 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.250
 colossi eye yes eye blows and barbell 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.890
 in terms of some intrigue 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.630
 absolutely boring match because but 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.390
 there is no chance of an opponent 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.190
 in general, I can not even even 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.530
 I don't have to worry because 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.720
 that he does not have any dangerous 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:11.490
 moments but from the point of view of rolling 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:14.490
 this is a great match that will bring us 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:20.580
 corner is suitable again nigga got me 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:23.430
 here and here and this is a penalty 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.770
 should be and it's free though honestly 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.569
 saying don't know why let's see 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.729
 repeat that with johnson eyes 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:33.520
 johnson hides some terrible secret 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:36.229
 i'm sure look at his look 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.479
 look at this guy's look guys 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:41.719
 be careful not to joke with this chop and 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:44.599
 Julie enters the penalty and here the ball 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:47.020
 keeps and here kick and operation kick 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:50.169
 and no, not necessarily the ball remains with us 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:54.949
 can we screw everyone here and and 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:56.349
 soft how best to express that 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:05:01.699
 further what's next 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:06.499
 corner so excellent head and flank 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:08.389
 here we have not yes I will find and kick yes 

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:11.659
 why they put a penalty that tomorrow 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.999
 no look who it is what options and 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:15.860
 for some reason, the McCormack has already hit 10 times 

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:19.129
 I don't even pay attention to the crossbar 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.349
 what can i say perhaps this match was 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:24.979
 very so easy very simple and 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:27.709
 win easily 40 and so sum up y 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:31.459
 we were scored by two swords 

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:32.330
 Claude scored two swords and two more 

00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:34.939
 sword on scoring 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.879
 sneider so all inform and which we 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:39.379
 bought scored except Pesaro but from him 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:42.589
 waited for nothing as he at all 

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:44.209
 It is not clear where she played and did not exist at all 

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:47.559
 so why thank you all for watching 

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:49.879
 and wait for the next release 

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:52.399
 the dark side of power I really hope there 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:57.039
 they will not be a form of robin ibrahimovic 

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:57.039
 and so on and so forth all bye
