now inside there's the pump and in there
it's<00:03:06.010> a<00:03:06.220> filter<00:03:07.260> well<00:03:08.260> unfortunately<00:03:08.620> I<00:03:08.950> am

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
it's a filter well unfortunately I am

jammed<00:03:12.790> in<00:03:13.000> there<00:03:13.709> causing<00:03:14.709> it<00:03:14.799> not<00:03:15.010> to<00:03:15.190> flow

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
jammed in there causing it not to flow

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.900 
jammed in there causing it not to flow
