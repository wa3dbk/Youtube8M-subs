00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
that out I know a lot of you were

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.100 
that out I know a lot of you were
waiting<00:01:20.549> for<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.299> didn't<00:01:21.570> John<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.810> did

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
waiting for it and we didn't John I did

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.170 
waiting for it and we didn't John I did
not<00:01:22.229> have<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> chance<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:23.009> do<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.909> yesterday

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
not have a chance to do that yesterday

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.969 
not have a chance to do that yesterday
simply<00:01:24.810> because<00:01:25.049> we<00:01:25.080> were<00:01:25.229> streaming<00:01:25.590> all<00:01:25.830> day

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
simply because we were streaming all day

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.130 
simply because we were streaming all day
so<00:01:26.040> he<00:01:26.220> couldn't<00:01:26.400> encode<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.939> video<00:01:27.060> ok<00:01:27.960> and

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
so he couldn't encode the video ok and

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.830 
so he couldn't encode the video ok and
as<00:01:28.259> we<00:01:28.409> stream<00:01:28.680> we<00:01:28.829> can't<00:01:29.070> encode<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:30.360> that's

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
as we stream we can't encode so that's

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.870 
as we stream we can't encode so that's
going<00:01:31.170> on<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.380> king<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.590> Han<00:01:31.770> vlogs<00:01:32.070> later
