00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.919
 hello to the video on the topic 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.019
 first we go to the cancer 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.210
 features one of cancer cells 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.240
 then we go over tumors and the 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.949
 tumor progression 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.590
 Afterwards we discuss the control of the 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.010
 Cell division and go to the causes 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.990
 on 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.109
 why is an uncontrolled 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.090
 cell division of the cancer cells we come 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.039
 also discuss which genes in the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.039
 cancer development play a role 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.559
 The requirements for the video are ideal 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:49.739
 To understand are the knowledge of the 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:52.190
 gene expression mutations and the 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.190
 cell cycle 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.260
 By cancer one understands one 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.080
 Collective term for diseases in which 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.410
 the cells divide uncontrollably 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.600
 and lose their normal function 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:16.050
 to the characteristic features of 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.970
 So cancer cells are uncontrolled 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.700
 cell division and controls that 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.250
 Cell growth loss of function and 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.940
 the specialization and it comes to 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.620
 a deactivation apoptosis 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.620
 discussed programmed cell deaths 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.530
 by the uncontrolled multiplication of the 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:41.040
 cancer cells creates a tumor, so one 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.050
 Tuberculosis of the body tissue 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:48.440
 complete movie and many more 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:51.479
 you can find on sofatutor.com about 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.290
 7,000 videos tell you what you are up to 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:58.440
 Good grades need to know about testing 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.930
 your knowledge after every video real 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.930
 Teachers help you in daily live chat 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.790
 immediately with your problems 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.770
 You can also attend private lessons 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.440
 book your personal online tutor 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.620
 to dive deeper into a topic 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.500
 So we help you with your censorship without 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.110
 great effort to improve
