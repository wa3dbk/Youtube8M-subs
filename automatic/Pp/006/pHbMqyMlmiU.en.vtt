frogs I don't think the fish care a

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.910 
frogs I don't think the fish care a
great<00:06:24.500> deal<00:06:25.010> but<00:06:26.080> I'm<00:06:27.080> sure<00:06:27.320> most<00:06:27.560> of<00:06:27.770> you<00:06:27.860> guys

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:27.920 
great deal but I'm sure most of you guys

have<00:06:28.100> been<00:06:28.640> in<00:06:28.730> a<00:06:28.820> situation<00:06:29.510> where<00:06:29.690> color

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
have been in a situation where color

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.140 
have been in a situation where color
really<00:06:30.320> mattered<00:06:30.800> and<00:06:30.980> you've<00:06:31.820> been<00:06:32.030> in

really mattered and you've been in

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.580 
really mattered and you've been in
situations<00:06:32.810> where<00:06:33.020> it<00:06:33.140> didn't<00:06:33.350> seem<00:06:33.470> to

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
situations where it didn't seem to

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:34.420 
situations where it didn't seem to
matter<00:06:33.770> at<00:06:34.010> all

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
matter at all

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.720 
matter at all
I<00:06:34.750> think<00:06:35.750> one<00:06:36.590> of<00:06:36.620> the<00:06:36.740> most<00:06:36.860> important<00:06:37.490> things

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:37.730 
I think one of the most important things

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:41.260 
I think one of the most important things
with<00:06:38.470> creating<00:06:39.470> a<00:06:39.560> fly<00:06:39.830> is<00:06:40.280> that<00:06:40.670> it<00:06:40.880> matches

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.270 
with creating a fly is that it matches

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.630 
with creating a fly is that it matches
the<00:06:41.570> hatch<00:06:41.890> it<00:06:42.890> needs<00:06:43.130> to<00:06:43.370> look<00:06:43.580> like

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:43.640 
the hatch it needs to look like

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.450 
the hatch it needs to look like
something<00:06:44.390> that<00:06:44.570> they<00:06:44.870> are<00:06:45.080> eating<00:06:45.470> there<00:06:46.340> you

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:46.460 
something that they are eating there you

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.050 
something that they are eating there you
have<00:06:46.640> it

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:47.060 
have it

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.690 
have it
the<00:06:47.600> Frog<00:06:47.810> isn't<00:06:48.460> like<00:06:49.460> that<00:06:50.740> ribbit<00:06:51.740> ribbit<00:06:51.920> I
