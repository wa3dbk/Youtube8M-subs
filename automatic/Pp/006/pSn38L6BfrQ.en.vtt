00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.939
 Colo Colo Colo Colo means what it is 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.349
 one of the great advertising creation careers in recent times has 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:13.539
 there was 24 danilo 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.539
 more experienced the steering wheel 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.000
 one of the things that speak of the united states the advertiser of his proposal 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.539
 of purchase of Brazilians 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.659
 various utilities takes seriously 

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.420
 the herbaceous cotton powerful business 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.780
 we move a lot the guy more and more common today I try to understand 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.320
 more and more my client's business 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.160
 they understood that formerly but what they are doing for his business 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.600
 will then increasingly close to the former president of the press roads but 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.750
 face of the lightness of one thing has nothing to do with the other but they are not 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.930
 mobral lost another 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.850
 and I think this is a big problem if when the guy starts to take a lot of 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:59.639
 Really 

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:01.470
 he ceases to be who he is 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.160
 Mandela has twitter. 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.190
 the following advertising advertising is the Argentine of the potato professions 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.080
 to attack the stereotype of the advertiser on the wheels of journalists 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.700
 it's a people 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.480
 they have a lot of nice people 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.150
 in the previous matter it is difficult to speak with the advertising event I think 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.010
 who does not have much debt 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.400
 and not only diva value 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.620
 I really liked the intern of the initiative. 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.140
 the full of wine coffee arrived as it was ea david yates 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.150
 At that time 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.600
 Dude, I said 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.430
 I want to have another as the Sunday game is very maybe it will be easier 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.430
 to answer this I prefer the first job 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.810
 I like my job, I want my brother-in-law to be very strong. 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.600
 I think mine has to appear later so I start putting women 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.010
 mentor natacha so and I think very dangerous returning to the stage of the diva the 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.220
 always put me in a laboratory and I think mine has to be 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.370
 know that at any time 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.220
 and I do not have a method I do not have the process is disputed I understand each 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.700
 he begins to understand the client's business more 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:11.070
 and understood everything 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.350
 makes you get faster and faster this yes but I think 30 seconds 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.639
 dies I think 67 years died 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.959
 I do not think they're the river I think I can do a lot 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:21.690
 cool 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.850
 just look different from that environment and they do not pay me now it's over 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.750
 now this internet I think this 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.950
 I do not think that this is the same as what people are related to 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.560
 environment in which is the important thing I think this digital thing for example 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.719
 digital digitalis and 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:39.159
 they criticized the attitude 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:44.069
 of such an attitude because the piece asks the ministry is able to 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.549
 with which the human being has a new type of nautical relationship is what 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.459
 relates to people a new way of relating to information 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.639
 is changing human being run the race as if they were meters tô 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.389
 tired without vetoes 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:01.330
 if you stumble as a marathon 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.649
 What's up? 

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:07.289
 but I came to the end a quiet guy I think has a lot of good stuff 

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:11.959
 because I think this is quickly I think I like the power 

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:15.529
 Reporter chat to search for things 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:20.959
 so this happens fast that hence the fox that breeds a respect I heard a 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.219
 little more in him is talking a cool thing then this power to achieve 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:30.169
 Put things on the street, this power to make this viable I love. 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:34.139
 and that title directs right to devise action just as it may be 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.009
 fast help 

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:39.119
 they are doing that in their home 

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:42.279
 It was very beautiful when things did not go away. 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.870
 for all the way it is these people 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.330
 I remember he can get an idea of ​​the agency now come up with the idea of 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.239
 make a song take me but can not prune to do this day care 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.669
 The old woman's birthday is the photo of washing. 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:58.069
 is the first edible paper 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.499
 so let's do it unless I think the important faculty of our 

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:04.609
 advertising faculty. 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:08.090
 I think college the moment in the academy who are they who know the 

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:11.149
 both of them played studying and weighing on some things that 

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:13.819
 will hardly think later 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.199
 and I think the gym has this thing of 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.729
 thing that guy and understands that will change the world that he will mess with the 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.010
 So I think this is the moment. 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.620
 have to go through this 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.000
 - I think it does not have to be propagating I made journalism go well 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:32.280
 There's a career that has never been a problem for me. 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.340
 Really 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.770
 but I think it will be back six months to a year never 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.430
 Brazil produces coffee with the president
