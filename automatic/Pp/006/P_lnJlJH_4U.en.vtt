00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:07.560
 continuing my favorite books of 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.460
 Life has some here with video that I 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.790
 I'll show 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.750
 so I will not stop like you ignore your 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.090
 lady chatterley's lover and just like 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.090
 It happens with tips and with two t ask me 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.980
 I read a lot of money now if more 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.619
 if I went to a lonely island alone 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.769
 could choose one of his works still 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.439
 that I wanted to take others would be the 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.550
 Right Czech lover has the video I will 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.550
 leave link below 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.340
 there are the works of the boss who has until 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.350
 little thing still on the channel I want to see if 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.280
 I improve this over the course of this year if 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.489
 give it away 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:58.079
 but there are already some who have video review 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:01:05.189
 for example the first piece here kinect 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:06.450
 is also a video review and two that 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:14.159
 I have not done it yet 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:16.290
 has no review video yet in reads and 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.369
 between the comedies because I showed three 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.479
 tragedies 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.159
 the first to break this book that is 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:27.030
 too much noise at all 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.310
 which, by the way, is a delicious movie and I 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.590
 I separated these four pieces because 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.979
 they are probably the check parts 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.250
 because I like two more than hamlet and 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.710
 macbeth already has video review on channel 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.619
 now the comedy a lot of noise for nothing 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.110
 still does not deserve but does not yet have 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.180
 and the other tragedy that I reread until 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.920
 I want to see if it still until the end of the year I 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.070
 I revealed I make a video I will not promise 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.079
 but I would like 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.420
 to continue in the British 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.950
 This one also has video review on 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.100
 channel also one of my books 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.869
 life favorites I've spoken until the 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.329
 book that puts the smile on my face 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.860
 when I look on the shelf and when I 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.200
 I remember this story when I look 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.470
 in this hood when I remember the 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:18.600
 matilda in a movie also the movie 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.410
 cute but the book is cuter yet who 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.510
 did not read 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:27.960
 read and reread the way I read Bathilda gather and 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.860
 reli let me see how many times already six 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.130
 times 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.400
 already as an adult is not that thing of ah 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.930
 I had a taste as a child and there 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.000
 When we are children we do not 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.790
 Much has changed anything, dung. 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.650
 it's not the one I think matilda satisfies 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.410
 very well very well our side of 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.050
 child because he has grown up and jales 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:54.120
 six times is now 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:56.040
 and to close two volumes of a collection 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.209
 that I do not have all the books until now 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.690
 I know you have new issues in 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:06.420
 bookstores and here is a volume that is a 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.060
 book that which we reread various parts 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.950
 I have read in full and reread several 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.050
 parts that we consult history of 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.110
 literature here in the edition of 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:21.330
 leandra's great wonderful 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:24.209
 Spectacular great to take hood and here 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.739
 I was buying in your then to mine 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.560
 volume are from different editions 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.700
 Western Literature History of the Hood 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:40.050
 in the edition of the cruise came out in the 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:43.380
 1957 came out in the 1990s and 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:46.260
 Western literature is a book I 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.500
 I do not think there is until now how far I 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:54.269
 I know it does not exist in any language I do not 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:57.420
 I am aware of a volume of one 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:01.049
 series of volumes to account for 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.959
 history of Western literature that 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.940
 It's so complete that you have to 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.830
 literature from europe that the 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.720
 people know you have the literature 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.140
 including authors who are not 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:16.019
 well-known that you have is works 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.970
 written in Norwegian, right? 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.919
 in several languages ​​that we even know 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.860
 who has more literature than we 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.180
 hardly know the limitation is that 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.790
 deals with the history of literature 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.980
 western 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:31.670
 the car makes an introduction in the first 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:36.610
 explaining this but I think the 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:39.170
 work that I know more about 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.210
 literature about a history of being 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.310
 a history of literature encompassing 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.100
 Yes indeed Western literature 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.960
 including our Brazilian literature 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.590
 which is not placed as an appendix 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.420
 Do not stay there because I was already in Brazil, right? 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.980
 more than ten years ago that he was already 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.250
 here it comes from the time of the second 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:00.470
 and settled in Brazil and he has already 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.410
 was studying ours in our language 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.000
 and our literature then you have 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.890
 perfectly here ax of ass you 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.360
 You have josé de alencar you have graciliano 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.440
 Branches do you have carlos drumond de andrade 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.930
 huh 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.210
 as he moves toward the 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.020
 times of these authors are these 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.400
 Brazilian authors inserted in 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.690
 chronologically within the history of 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.030
 western literature 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:26.210
 the body does not make an appendix there 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.220
 these are the authors of the 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.380
 Brazilian literature not like the people 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.080
 often found in stories of the 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:36.200
 literature that are more comprehensive 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.800
 I think this hood work in 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:42.410
 any language remains as far as 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:46.490
 I am informed and beaten has no 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:48.800
 same and we should have at least 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.160
 a video of my favorite books from 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.160
 life
