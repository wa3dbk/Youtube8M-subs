00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.400
 hello people welcome to another 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.200
 Turn on video of me then certainly 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.900
 and today it's about one again 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:15.150
 itunes has been smaller and that 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:19.910
 eurofighter from yes suspect imperial 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.619
 eurofighter or accident in german so 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.760
 to announce something immediately there was 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.529
 an old version of life in the 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.740
 republican design say it now 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.630
 thus also gram and especially dark red 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.099
 prevail so that now the imperial 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.850
 Variant I would say from the time 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.309
 or 66 and later than the boys in tai 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.510
 were converted 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.170
 but I'll come to that and 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.500
 first to the figures 24 clock a gray 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.260
 astro powerful stays in this set 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:53.280
 very nice printed and everything completely 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.010
 normal and get an imperial pilot 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.930
 and as you can see it is 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.359
 d-mark pilots after recommended and indeed 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:05.309
 but of course such a gray helmet and 2 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:07.310
 and here the head praised and then 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.030
 I have this helmet 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:18.210
 endangered body blaster very good thing 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.979
 then to the rest so as I have noted 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.320
 there was an early while out of the 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.930
 year 2006 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:29.600
 this is the later variant 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.460
 episode 3 so later episode 3 and rest 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.170
 and there you can paint what that looks like 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.909
 the lead the timer and there are 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.250
 an options I think I stand 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.500
 the camera off shortly has something weird 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.229
 or difficult though, there is one here 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.430
 option on the side and you can not 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.430
 a lot in it 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.460
 and the whole thing is like that and you 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.950
 it already has a certain look 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.700
 similarity with the usa active forward 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:01.600
 pretty long 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:03.009
 So that was the biggest clinic that said 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.060
 I'm pretty much more 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.149
 You really can not block it 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.170
 otherwise there is still the word work 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:13.450
 full armor folds for the protection of the 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.050
 decks and up here you can the 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:21.330
 Astronomical Lower Rhine of resp 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:26.140
 You can see the ball of the trick up here 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:28.750
 put on it and then his astro powers 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.720
 All I have to do is age 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:36.310
 action is a pity 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:44.340
 well, so over all signs behind 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:46.930
 drives yes the pilots fold this well 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.790
 since you can use to flood the 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.790
 a human that is pretty short 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.840
 By the way, one can also use the wings 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:11.350
 understand and everything possible and that is 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.530
 difficult yes but that was it 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.810
 even that was already in this set 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.859
 I know that apocalypse is still up 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.900
 they wait but really write me 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:24.329
 researched somehow supports hose 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.480
 ideas for this video business 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.829
 turn on 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.829
 I say goodbye and goodbye
