are balanced and aligned and when

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.110 
are balanced and aligned and when
they're<00:00:40.710> not<00:00:40.739> that's<00:00:41.520> what<00:00:41.700> makes<00:00:41.879> websites

so let's come back in here and try
adding<00:02:00.119> whoops<00:02:02.240> 25<00:02:03.240> pixels<00:02:03.540> all<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.619> way

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
adding whoops 25 pixels all the way

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.180 
adding whoops 25 pixels all the way
around<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.280> apply<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:07.069> that's<00:02:08.069> a

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
around and apply that and that's a

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.270 
around and apply that and that's a
little<00:02:08.280> bit<00:02:08.550> too<00:02:08.970> much<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.479> see<00:02:09.929> it's<00:02:10.050> not

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.640 
little bit too much you see it's not
lining<00:02:11.280> up<00:02:11.520> there<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.750> we<00:02:13.290> can<00:02:13.410> either

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
lining up there so we can either

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.580 
lining up there so we can either
do<00:02:13.709> trial<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.159> error<00:02:14.370> or<00:02:14.909> you<00:02:15.480> can<00:02:16.260> take<00:02:16.439> that

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
do trial and error or you can take that

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.110 
do trial and error or you can take that
out<00:02:16.879> click<00:02:17.879> okay<00:02:18.269> we<00:02:18.840> can<00:02:19.019> open<00:02:19.230> up<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.769> header

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
out click okay we can open up the header

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.229 
out click okay we can open up the header
and<00:02:21.120> go<00:02:21.269> down<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.450> box<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.110> check<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:23.370> see<00:02:23.670> what

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
and go down to box and check to see what

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.059 
and go down to box and check to see what
we<00:02:24.390> had<00:02:24.540> put<00:02:24.720> in<00:02:24.780> before<00:02:25.019> because<00:02:25.739> we<00:02:25.890> don't

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
we had put in before because we don't

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.949 
we had put in before because we don't
want<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.459> be<00:02:26.610> off<00:02:26.760> by<00:02:26.790> one<00:02:27.030> or<00:02:27.299> two<00:02:27.420> pixels<00:02:27.810> we

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
want to be off by one or two pixels we

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.949 
want to be off by one or two pixels we
might<00:02:28.230> not<00:02:28.470> immediately<00:02:28.860> see<00:02:29.430> but<00:02:30.000> something

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
might not immediately see but something

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.690 
might not immediately see but something
might<00:02:31.140> feel<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.709> little<00:02:32.040> bit<00:02:32.189> off<00:02:32.310> so<00:02:32.489> we<00:02:32.549> want

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
might feel a little bit off so we want

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.069 
might feel a little bit off so we want
to<00:02:32.760> make<00:02:32.849> sure<00:02:32.970> that's<00:02:33.090> matched<00:02:33.450> up<00:02:33.689> exactly

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
to make sure that's matched up exactly

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.240 
to make sure that's matched up exactly
so<00:02:34.260> it's<00:02:34.409> 20<00:02:34.739> pixels<00:02:34.980> all<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.909> way<00:02:36.030> around<00:02:37.250> so

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
so it's 20 pixels all the way around so

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.000 
so it's 20 pixels all the way around so
we're<00:02:38.640> going<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.879> open<00:02:39.150> up<00:02:40.760> container<00:02:43.010> content

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
we're going to open up container content

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.970 
we're going to open up container content
P<00:02:44.280> again<00:02:46.879> coming<00:02:47.879> down<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.120> box<00:02:48.359> and<00:02:48.980> here

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
P again coming down to box and here

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.449 
P again coming down to box and here
we're<00:02:50.370> gonna<00:02:50.459> put<00:02:50.670> in<00:02:50.790> 20<00:02:51.769> 20<00:02:52.769> padding<00:02:53.250> all<00:02:53.400> the

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
we're gonna put in 20 20 padding all the

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.000 
we're gonna put in 20 20 padding all the
way<00:02:53.670> around<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.090> we're<00:02:54.180> gonna<00:02:54.299> apply<00:02:54.450> that

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
way around and we're gonna apply that

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.740 
way around and we're gonna apply that
and<00:02:56.010> there<00:02:56.159> you<00:02:56.190> can<00:02:56.400> see<00:02:56.609> it's<00:02:57.329> now<00:02:57.629> lined<00:02:58.409> up

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
and there you can see it's now lined up

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.379 
and there you can see it's now lined up
however<00:03:00.750> we've<00:03:01.139> got<00:03:01.290> this<00:03:01.409> large<00:03:01.799> space

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:02.389 
however we've got this large space

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.240 
however we've got this large space
between<00:03:03.389> them<00:03:03.629> this<00:03:04.230> is<00:03:04.379> this<00:03:04.560> is<00:03:04.709> 20<00:03:05.040> pixels

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
between them this is this is 20 pixels

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.009 
between them this is this is 20 pixels
all<00:03:05.579> the<00:03:05.730> way<00:03:05.849> around<00:03:06.090> so<00:03:06.480> what<00:03:06.569> I'm<00:03:06.659> gonna<00:03:06.780> do

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
all the way around so what I'm gonna do

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.410 
all the way around so what I'm gonna do
is<00:03:07.260> step<00:03:08.010> back<00:03:08.189> in<00:03:08.310> here<00:03:08.459> again<00:03:08.489> and<00:03:09.000> I'm<00:03:09.299> gonna

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
is step back in here again and I'm gonna

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.879 
is step back in here again and I'm gonna
change<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.959> background<00:03:10.379> color<00:03:10.590> just

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889 
change the background color just

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:12.679 
change the background color just
temporarily<00:03:11.489> so<00:03:12.060> that<00:03:12.090> we<00:03:12.239> can<00:03:12.359> explain

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:12.689 
temporarily so that we can explain

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.910 
temporarily so that we can explain
what's<00:03:13.049> going<00:03:13.170> on<00:03:13.620> with<00:03:13.920> margins<00:03:14.849> and<00:03:14.970> padding

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
what's going on with margins and padding

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.470 
what's going on with margins and padding
so<00:03:16.920> now<00:03:17.099> you<00:03:17.159> can<00:03:17.430> see<00:03:17.639> the<00:03:17.790> background<00:03:18.000> color

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
so now you can see the background color

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.170 
so now you can see the background color
for<00:03:19.019> these<00:03:19.169> paragraphs<00:03:19.849> everything<00:03:20.849> in<00:03:20.940> red

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
for these paragraphs everything in red

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.289 
for these paragraphs everything in red
is<00:03:21.389> part<00:03:21.930> of<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.199> paragraph<00:03:22.769> element<00:03:23.489> so

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
is part of the paragraph element so

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.960 
is part of the paragraph element so
padding<00:03:24.840> is<00:03:25.019> this<00:03:25.680> space<00:03:26.040> between<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.730> edge

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
padding is this space between the edge

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.960 
padding is this space between the edge
of<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.599> element<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:28.290> whatever<00:03:29.010> is<00:03:29.220> inside<00:03:29.459> it

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
of the element and whatever is inside it

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.439 
of the element and whatever is inside it
in<00:03:30.120> this<00:03:30.569> case<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:31.470> text<00:03:32.060> so<00:03:33.060> you<00:03:33.150> can<00:03:33.269> see

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:33.449 
in this case the text so you can see

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:34.819 
in this case the text so you can see
that<00:03:33.569> it's<00:03:33.690> padding<00:03:33.989> there<00:03:34.199> and<00:03:34.409> there's

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
that it's padding there and there's

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.949 
that it's padding there and there's
padding<00:03:35.010> there<00:03:35.370> we<00:03:35.909> also<00:03:36.120> have<00:03:36.299> this<00:03:36.629> space

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
padding there we also have this space

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.369 
padding there we also have this space
here<00:03:37.530> between<00:03:37.949> the<00:03:38.459> paragraphs<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.239> that<00:03:39.900> is

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
here between the paragraphs and that is

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.099 
here between the paragraphs and that is
the<00:03:40.829> margin<00:03:41.400> so<00:03:41.940> if<00:03:42.000> we<00:03:42.120> open<00:03:42.359> this<00:03:42.419> up<00:03:42.599> and

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
the margin so if we open this up and

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.319 
the margin so if we open this up and
come<00:03:43.379> down<00:03:43.409> to<00:03:43.560> box<00:03:43.889> we<00:03:44.639> can<00:03:44.790> see<00:03:44.909> that<00:03:45.000> we<00:03:45.120> also

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
come down to box we can see that we also

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.409 
come down to box we can see that we also
have<00:03:45.659> a<00:03:45.690> margin<00:03:46.139> here<00:03:46.940> so<00:03:47.940> what<00:03:48.030> we<00:03:48.120> could<00:03:48.269> do

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
have a margin here so what we could do

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:52.550 
have a margin here so what we could do
is<00:03:48.750> set<00:03:49.409> that<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.739> zero<00:03:50.069> and<00:03:50.459> apply<00:03:51.440> and<00:03:52.440> that

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
is set that to zero and apply and that

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.259 
is set that to zero and apply and that
would<00:03:52.709> tighten<00:03:53.159> that<00:03:53.280> up<00:03:53.340> so<00:03:53.940> that<00:03:53.970> there<00:03:54.180> was

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
would tighten that up so that there was

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.680 
would tighten that up so that there was
no<00:03:54.540> space<00:03:55.349> in<00:03:55.650> between<00:03:56.159> these<00:03:56.549> elements<00:03:57.239> so

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
no space in between these elements so

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.809 
no space in between these elements so
one<00:03:57.930> paragraph<00:03:58.260> touches<00:03:58.889> the<00:03:59.040> next<00:03:59.400> and<00:03:59.669> the

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
one paragraph touches the next and the

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.920 
one paragraph touches the next and the
only<00:04:00.090> gap<00:04:00.750> is<00:04:01.049> being<00:04:01.229> caused<00:04:01.500> by<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:02.129> padding

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
only gap is being caused by the padding

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.379 
only gap is being caused by the padding
but<00:04:03.930> we<00:04:04.049> might<00:04:04.290> also<00:04:04.500> decide<00:04:05.190> we<00:04:06.060> could<00:04:06.209> change

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
but we might also decide we could change

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:11.180 
but we might also decide we could change
this<00:04:06.690> to<00:04:06.989> 10<00:04:07.859> pixels<00:04:08.510> above<00:04:09.510> and<00:04:09.720> below<00:04:09.959> and<00:04:10.829> 20

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
this to 10 pixels above and below and 20

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.399 
this to 10 pixels above and below and 20
pixels<00:04:11.690> from<00:04:12.690> side-to-side<00:04:15.139> and<00:04:16.139> when<00:04:16.289> we

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:16.409 
pixels from side-to-side and when we

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:20.539 
pixels from side-to-side and when we
apply<00:04:16.680> this<00:04:17.810> we<00:04:18.810> tighten<00:04:19.199> it<00:04:19.260> up<00:04:19.380> and<00:04:19.590> we<00:04:20.370> could

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
apply this we tighten it up and we could

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.149 
apply this we tighten it up and we could
get<00:04:20.729> rid<00:04:21.000> of<00:04:21.030> this<00:04:21.690> change<00:04:22.409> to<00:04:22.620> our<00:04:22.680> margins

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:23.159 
get rid of this change to our margins

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:25.670 
get rid of this change to our margins
and<00:04:23.340> return<00:04:23.610> to<00:04:23.789> the<00:04:23.880> default<00:04:24.389> margins<00:04:25.349> for

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
and return to the default margins for

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.200 
and return to the default margins for
paragraphs<00:04:26.190> so<00:04:26.880> we're<00:04:27.000> not

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
paragraphs so we're not

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.020 
paragraphs so we're not
overruling<00:04:27.930> this<00:04:28.229> with<00:04:28.740> our<00:04:28.889> custom<00:04:29.220> CSS<00:04:29.729> and

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
overruling this with our custom CSS and

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.830 
overruling this with our custom CSS and
now<00:04:30.660> we<00:04:30.720> have<00:04:31.139> the<00:04:31.710> default<00:04:32.690> margins<00:04:33.690> in

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
now we have the default margins in

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.990 
now we have the default margins in
between<00:04:34.199> there<00:04:34.410> as<00:04:34.620> well<00:04:35.220> as<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:35.400> padding<00:04:35.910> in

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
between there as well as the padding in

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.589 
between there as well as the padding in
place<00:04:37.190> so<00:04:38.190> we<00:04:38.310> can<00:04:38.400> take<00:04:38.550> that<00:04:38.669> right<00:04:38.940> down<00:04:39.150> to

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
place so we can take that right down to

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:41.990 
place so we can take that right down to
zero<00:04:39.900> if<00:04:40.169> we<00:04:40.590> wanted<00:04:40.830> to<00:04:41.009> zero<00:04:41.580> above<00:04:41.880> and

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
zero if we wanted to zero above and

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.980 
zero if we wanted to zero above and
below<00:04:42.270> and<00:04:43.340> then<00:04:44.340> the<00:04:44.580> only<00:04:44.789> gap<00:04:45.240> would<00:04:45.870> be

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
below and then the only gap would be

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.760 
below and then the only gap would be
caused<00:04:46.229> by<00:04:46.590> our<00:04:46.860> margins<00:04:48.169> now<00:04:49.169> when<00:04:49.440> we<00:04:49.590> don't

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
caused by our margins now when we don't

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.939 
caused by our margins now when we don't
have<00:04:49.889> any<00:04:50.009> background<00:04:50.250> color<00:04:50.699> in<00:04:50.849> there<00:04:51.949> we

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
have any background color in there we

00:04:52.949 --> 00:05:01.219 
have any background color in there we
apply<00:04:53.190> this<00:04:59.389> it<00:05:00.389> can<00:05:00.509> be<00:05:00.599> hard<00:05:00.810> to<00:05:00.840> tell

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
apply this it can be hard to tell

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.580 
apply this it can be hard to tell
whether<00:05:01.860> something<00:05:02.370> is<00:05:02.520> a<00:05:03.150> gap<00:05:03.570> because<00:05:03.900> of<00:05:04.349> a

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
whether something is a gap because of a

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.909 
whether something is a gap because of a
margin<00:05:05.340> or<00:05:05.729> because<00:05:06.419> of<00:05:06.690> padding<00:05:07.259> and<00:05:07.440> that's

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
margin or because of padding and that's

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.290 
margin or because of padding and that's
why<00:05:08.070> when<00:05:08.220> I'm<00:05:08.310> doing<00:05:08.520> my<00:05:08.550> design<00:05:08.910> work<00:05:09.090> I

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
why when I'm doing my design work I

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.610 
why when I'm doing my design work I
often<00:05:09.660> like<00:05:09.810> to<00:05:09.900> change<00:05:10.169> the<00:05:10.440> background

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
often like to change the background

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.040 
often like to change the background
color<00:05:11.130> to<00:05:11.400> something<00:05:12.000> really<00:05:12.330> bright<00:05:12.810> and

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
color to something really bright and

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.080 
color to something really bright and
contrast<00:05:13.710> II<00:05:13.889> so<00:05:14.280> that<00:05:14.400> I<00:05:14.430> can<00:05:14.610> see<00:05:14.820> if<00:05:14.970> I'm

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
contrast II so that I can see if I'm

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.150 
contrast II so that I can see if I'm
dealing<00:05:15.330> with<00:05:15.630> something<00:05:15.870> that's<00:05:16.169> creating<00:05:16.979> a

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
dealing with something that's creating a

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.310 
dealing with something that's creating a
lot<00:05:17.190> of<00:05:17.370> extra<00:05:17.580> padding<00:05:17.970> or<00:05:18.360> a<00:05:18.419> lot<00:05:18.870> of<00:05:19.020> extra

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
lot of extra padding or a lot of extra

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.140 
lot of extra padding or a lot of extra
margins<00:05:19.770> now<00:05:20.310> the<00:05:20.400> other<00:05:20.610> reason<00:05:20.789> you<00:05:20.909> want<00:05:21.090> to

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
margins now the other reason you want to

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.810 
margins now the other reason you want to
pay<00:05:21.270> attention<00:05:21.509> to<00:05:21.720> this<00:05:21.960> is<00:05:22.169> the<00:05:23.159> way<00:05:23.400> that

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
pay attention to this is the way that

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.350 
pay attention to this is the way that
widths<00:05:24.750> are<00:05:24.930> calculated<00:05:25.680> using<00:05:26.190> margins<00:05:27.180> and

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
widths are calculated using margins and

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.240 
widths are calculated using margins and
padding<00:05:27.780> so<00:05:28.169> what<00:05:28.259> I'm<00:05:28.319> gonna<00:05:28.409> do<00:05:28.620> now<00:05:28.770> is<00:05:29.009> just

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
padding so what I'm gonna do now is just

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.559 
padding so what I'm gonna do now is just
step<00:05:29.550> back<00:05:29.729> in<00:05:29.880> here<00:05:30.000> for<00:05:30.150> a<00:05:30.210> minute

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:30.569 
step back in here for a minute

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:34.159 
step back in here for a minute
and<00:05:31.409> I'm<00:05:31.530> going<00:05:31.650> to<00:05:31.680> remove<00:05:32.840> I'm<00:05:33.840> going<00:05:34.110> to

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
and I'm going to remove I'm going to

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.350 
and I'm going to remove I'm going to
remove<00:05:34.440> these<00:05:34.909> settings<00:05:35.909> that<00:05:36.060> we've<00:05:36.180> just

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
remove these settings that we've just

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.379 
remove these settings that we've just
put<00:05:36.630> in<00:05:36.830> apply<00:05:37.830> this<00:05:37.889> so<00:05:38.729> this<00:05:38.849> takes<00:05:39.060> us<00:05:39.210> back

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 
put in apply this so this takes us back

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:41.839 
put in apply this so this takes us back
to<00:05:39.419> where<00:05:39.690> we<00:05:39.810> were<00:05:39.930> before<00:05:40.280> now<00:05:41.280> we<00:05:41.699> were

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:41.849 
to where we were before now we were

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:45.649 
to where we were before now we were
applying<00:05:42.240> that<00:05:43.250> margins<00:05:44.250> and<00:05:44.400> padding<00:05:44.880> on<00:05:45.000> the

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:45.659 
applying that margins and padding on the

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:48.439 
applying that margins and padding on the
paragraph<00:05:46.139> element<00:05:47.120> so<00:05:48.120> that's<00:05:48.300> the

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:48.449 
paragraph element so that's the

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:52.010 
paragraph element so that's the
paragraph<00:05:48.960> here<00:05:50.539> what<00:05:51.539> we<00:05:51.659> could<00:05:51.810> have<00:05:51.900> also

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
paragraph here what we could have also

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.120 
paragraph here what we could have also
looked<00:05:52.409> to<00:05:52.590> do<00:05:52.770> was<00:05:53.370> apply<00:05:53.699> it<00:05:53.820> on<00:05:54.090> the<00:05:54.780> actual

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
looked to do was apply it on the actual

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.510 
looked to do was apply it on the actual
div<00:05:56.130> itself<00:05:56.849> we<00:05:57.389> could<00:05:57.539> have<00:05:57.659> applied<00:05:57.900> some

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
div itself we could have applied some

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.640 
div itself we could have applied some
padding<00:05:59.520> right<00:05:59.699> on<00:06:00.180> that<00:06:00.360> div<00:06:00.630> but<00:06:01.500> what

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
padding right on that div but what

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.680 
padding right on that div but what
happens<00:06:02.099> when<00:06:02.280> we<00:06:02.400> do<00:06:02.610> that<00:06:02.789> we'll<00:06:03.270> try<00:06:03.479> that

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
happens when we do that we'll try that

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.830 
happens when we do that we'll try that
right<00:06:03.870> now<00:06:04.039> we<00:06:05.039> come<00:06:05.250> down<00:06:05.280> to<00:06:05.460> box<00:06:05.820> and<00:06:06.659> we'll

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
right now we come down to box and we'll

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.159 
right now we come down to box and we'll
put<00:06:07.080> on<00:06:07.370> 20<00:06:08.370> padding<00:06:08.789> all<00:06:08.940> the<00:06:09.240> way<00:06:09.330> around<00:06:09.630> you

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
put on 20 padding all the way around you

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:11.629 
put on 20 padding all the way around you
would<00:06:10.289> think<00:06:10.530> that<00:06:10.680> this<00:06:10.889> would<00:06:11.070> do<00:06:11.219> exactly

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:11.639 
would think that this would do exactly

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:14.510 
would think that this would do exactly
what<00:06:11.820> we're<00:06:11.940> looking<00:06:12.240> for<00:06:12.919> but<00:06:13.919> what<00:06:14.070> actually

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
what we're looking for but what actually

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.529 
what we're looking for but what actually
happens<00:06:14.969> is<00:06:15.210> that<00:06:15.509> our<00:06:15.780> layout<00:06:16.110> breaks

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:17.539 
happens is that our layout breaks

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:21.129 
happens is that our layout breaks
because<00:06:18.539> Dreamweaver<00:06:19.530> and<00:06:19.680> many<00:06:20.219> browsers

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:21.139 
because Dreamweaver and many browsers

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:25.040 
because Dreamweaver and many browsers
calculate<00:06:22.139> the<00:06:22.349> width<00:06:23.030> with<00:06:24.030> the<00:06:24.479> extra

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
calculate the width with the extra

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:29.120 
calculate the width with the extra
padding<00:06:25.800> added<00:06:26.490> on<00:06:26.610> top<00:06:27.050> so<00:06:28.050> this<00:06:28.349> content

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130 
padding added on top so this content

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.029 
padding added on top so this content
area<00:06:29.280> is<00:06:29.610> now<00:06:30.180> too<00:06:30.240> wide<00:06:30.870> and<00:06:31.289> it<00:06:31.620> won't<00:06:31.830> fit

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 
area is now too wide and it won't fit

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:34.760 
area is now too wide and it won't fit
side<00:06:32.280> by<00:06:32.460> side<00:06:32.699> with<00:06:32.880> our<00:06:32.909> menu<00:06:33.349> so<00:06:34.349> that<00:06:34.560> if<00:06:34.650> we

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:34.770 
side by side with our menu so that if we

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.830 
side by side with our menu so that if we
had<00:06:34.889> wanted<00:06:35.190> to<00:06:35.250> do<00:06:35.580> this

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.710 

we<00:06:39.560> would<00:06:39.680> have<00:06:39.770> had<00:06:39.919> to<00:06:40.070> adjust<00:06:40.190> the<00:06:41.120> width<00:06:41.480> of

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 
we would have had to adjust the width of

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:47.530 
we would have had to adjust the width of
the<00:06:42.350> content<00:06:42.860> div<00:06:43.570> les<00:06:44.570> 20<00:06:45.080> on<00:06:45.290> either<00:06:46.010> side<00:06:46.540> so

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:47.540 
the content div les 20 on either side so

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:53.010 
the content div les 20 on either side so
instead<00:06:47.810> of<00:06:47.870> 350<00:06:48.620> we'd<00:06:49.430> have<00:06:49.580> to<00:06:49.669> put<00:06:49.820> in<00:06:49.940> 310

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.580 

when<00:06:54.020> we<00:06:54.139> apply<00:06:54.410> that<00:06:55.930> now<00:06:56.930> everything<00:06:57.230> fits

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:57.590 
when we apply that now everything fits

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.200 
when we apply that now everything fits
again<00:07:00.010> so<00:07:01.010> there's<00:07:01.190> different<00:07:01.370> ways<00:07:01.610> of

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.210 
again so there's different ways of

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.920 
again so there's different ways of
controlling<00:07:03.639> the<00:07:04.639> space<00:07:05.030> between<00:07:05.330> elements

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:05.930 
controlling the space between elements

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.530 
controlling the space between elements
on<00:07:06.050> the<00:07:06.139> page<00:07:06.380> but<00:07:07.250> you<00:07:07.520> have<00:07:07.760> to<00:07:07.910> be<00:07:08.000> careful

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:08.540 
on the page but you have to be careful

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.270 
on the page but you have to be careful
that<00:07:08.990> you're<00:07:09.139> not<00:07:09.169> going<00:07:09.680> to<00:07:09.770> break<00:07:10.130> your

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.280 
that you're not going to break your

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.659 
that you're not going to break your
layout<00:07:10.669> so<00:07:11.000> I<00:07:11.210> actually<00:07:11.660> prefer<00:07:12.200> applying<00:07:12.860> my

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:13.669 
layout so I actually prefer applying my

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:15.900 
layout so I actually prefer applying my
margins<00:07:14.030> and<00:07:14.180> padding<00:07:14.419> on<00:07:14.479> the<00:07:14.540> paragraphs

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:15.910 
margins and padding on the paragraphs

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:20.110 
margins and padding on the paragraphs
that's<00:07:16.910> all<00:07:17.060> for<00:07:17.210> tonight<00:07:17.330> thanks<00:07:17.930> again
