game but once you master picking up
humans<00:01:23.460> with<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.759> Pteranodon<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:24.990> hard<00:01:25.259> to

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
humans with the Pteranodon it's hard to

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.980 
when running they can also jump higher
than<00:05:31.919> most<00:05:32.250> but<00:05:32.759> not<00:05:32.969> as<00:05:33.180> high<00:05:33.360> as<00:05:33.419> the<00:05:33.659> Nova
