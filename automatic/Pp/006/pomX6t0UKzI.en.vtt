00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:06.890
 Hello Today um 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.990
 That also when making a pain 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:13.519
 Always say 8-1 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:16.020
 Hospital this Well no bone grinded tape 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:20.820
 I would like to introduce this 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:30.800
 What kind of place do you use this? 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:33.870
 It is a seam but if it is true these days , this line between this child's black and this color 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:40.610
 We have used because this is no breath tape 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.610
 In Well this is what that disease Pu of the it from said explanation 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.820
 That kind of 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:56.320
 With a cutter knife a marker if you wear a seat 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:58.809
 If the wear from the top, which was stuck on that well the body in this way in which I'd usually of such 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.200
 There is a risk of damaging the body 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:06.990
 That sure 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:08.040

 2 types found, and Anomaa is inside here is usually the body play or 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:20.290

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:29.570
 I will explain from now that it will grow well and the shape will disappear quite importantly 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.570
 This is it 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.240

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.969
