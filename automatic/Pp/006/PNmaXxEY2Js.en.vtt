00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.300
 Today as you are now so many I 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.500
 keep asking for photos or videos 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.880
 etc 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.800
 I decided it was time for 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.680
 sponsor other youtube channels 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.050

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.520
 even their videos of this type with 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.870

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.650
 in this way I try to give you different 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:55.060
 hints and therefore different people from which 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:56.890
 get a lot of information first 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.930

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.239
 they know yet on facebook where there is 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.650
