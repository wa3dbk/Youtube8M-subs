00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.780
 Hey, what's up, beauty 's a tip. 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.210
 I just asked how do you do it? 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.550
 We'll need to ask, here's how. 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.529
 update control of this gold xbox 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.390
 Only update the console is up 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.759
 ready does not justify updating the 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.179
 control too and how will we do 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:26.640
 this and make a usb console connection 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:30.570
 and control via a USB cable 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.980
 obviously and in an ordinary car is the house 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.550
 it 's a little different I do not know if the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.900
 camera will focus very well that there is a 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.490
 here I do not know if it will be 11 or 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.710
 I do not deserve to have a little bit different 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.750
 just right 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:56.430
 Are we going to connect in control? 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:01:14.149
 first is not only with the games 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:19.429
 applications update settings 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:21.569
 control there will ask for the connection today 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:23.219
 would keep the headphones 

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:26.659
 connected to takako's history culture 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:26.659
 the headset it 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.200
 continue and now will do the process 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.119
 sometimes customize the 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.399
 console does not know it has to be done 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.140
 this control update also 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.170
 nothing else is a calibration you go 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.390
 calibrate the analogue 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.039
 according to the new stated ware that was 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.869
 released by microsoft so every time 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.899
 that you upgrade the console is good you 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.670
 see that updating the control is also 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.429
 that this will provide a better 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.829
 gaming experience for the games 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.200
 example, how do you navigate? 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.810
 obtained by the person him a greater 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.549
 control analog sensitivity 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.380
 So that's what's being calibrated. 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:13.810
 control then it 's good you always do 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.340
 every time you use the dashboard of the 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.069
 of the console 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.049
 you have seen the settings and 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.599
 driver certainly also improve 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:26.049
 as the gambling experience says then 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.880
 the process is fast it will only take the 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.280
 staff does not know they have this option if they 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.349
 is playing against attacking battery arrives 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.000
 another said alone against a fault in the 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.340
 logic of your part is faulty 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.040
 control how much you actually had 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:43.410
 to come here only and update the control 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.950
 also enormous since it determines 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.510
 updated 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.910
 if you have more than one control you 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.519
 will do the same process there update 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.489
 other or if you have already finished 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.590
 click exit and that's it and it's here 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.500
 asking for hypnosis is sure not to 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.540
 knew how to update xbox control 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.760
 which he is said to have liked to have physical 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.900
 been useful any how is until 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.900
 the next one we spoke
