through the board same in the back the
front<00:02:00.450> wheels<00:02:00.660> flex<00:02:01.140> just<00:02:01.410> like<00:02:01.620> a<00:02:01.650> longboard

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
feels more like a typical bike that

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.710 
feels more like a typical bike that
turns<00:02:06.300> from<00:02:06.510> the<00:02:06.570> front<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:08.210> it's<00:02:09.210> much<00:02:09.450> more

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
turns from the front and it's much more

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.530 
turns from the front and it's much more
comfortable<00:02:10.440> than<00:02:10.820> having<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:11.940> back<00:02:12.120> turn

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
comfortable than having the back turn

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.260 
comfortable than having the back turn
too<00:02:13.190> otherwise<00:02:14.190> or<00:02:14.550> you<00:02:14.820> could<00:02:14.970> do<00:02:15.060> tight

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
too otherwise or you could do tight

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
circles but I don't recommend it it's

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.660 
circles but I don't recommend it it's
not<00:02:17.700> fun<00:02:17.910> at<00:02:18.090> all<00:02:18.860> these<00:02:19.860> are<00:02:19.980> lame<00:02:20.130> tricks<00:02:20.490> you

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
not fun at all these are lame tricks you
