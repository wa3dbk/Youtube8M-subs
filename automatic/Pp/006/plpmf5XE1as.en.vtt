okay I just managed to UM do it I needed

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.020 
okay I just managed to UM do it I needed
it<00:04:21.510> because<00:04:21.600> all<00:04:22.590> right<00:04:23.100> there's<00:04:23.550> a<00:04:23.670> lot<00:04:23.910> of

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
it because all right there's a lot of

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.780 
it because all right there's a lot of
noise<00:04:24.240> in<00:04:24.360> my<00:04:24.420> house<00:04:24.750> in<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.110> day<00:04:25.320> and<00:04:25.650> I<00:04:26.070> think
