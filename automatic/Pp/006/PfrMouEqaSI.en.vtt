choose<00:01:13.950> from<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.670> think<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.970> best<00:01:15.150> part<00:01:15.390> about

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.240 
choose from I think the best part about
this<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.930> Samsung<00:01:16.320> claims<00:01:16.860> there<00:01:17.130> will

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
this is that Samsung claims there will

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.249 
this is that Samsung claims there will
be<00:01:17.280> zero<00:01:17.689> advertisements<00:01:18.689> played<00:01:18.930> throughout

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
be zero advertisements played throughout

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.990 
be zero advertisements played throughout
the<00:01:19.380> listening<00:01:20.040> experience<00:01:20.189> which<00:01:20.790> is

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
the listening experience which is

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.969 
the listening experience which is
awesome<00:01:21.509> because<00:01:21.830> advertisements<00:01:22.830> on

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
awesome because advertisements on

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.740 
awesome because advertisements on
streaming<00:01:23.640> apps<00:01:23.790> tend<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.150> get<00:01:24.240> annoying<00:01:24.479> and

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
streaming apps tend to get annoying and

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.679 
streaming apps tend to get annoying and
you're<00:01:25.170> also<00:01:25.409> allowed<00:01:25.890> 6<00:01:26.400> skips<00:01:27.030> per<00:01:27.390> station

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
you're also allowed 6 skips per station

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.289 
you're also allowed 6 skips per station
per<00:01:28.350> hour<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:28.890> if<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.460> counter<00:01:29.880> kind<00:01:30.210> of

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
per hour so if that counter kind of

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.840 
per hour so if that counter kind of
clicks<00:01:30.600> down<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.170> zero<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.829> want<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.579> skip

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
clicks down to zero and you want to skip

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.490 
clicks down to zero and you want to skip
tracks<00:01:33.360> well<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.750> can<00:01:33.900> just<00:01:34.049> change<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
tracks well you can just change the

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.100 
the fact that I wish it was available on
more<00:03:42.800> than<00:03:43.070> just<00:03:43.130> Galaxy<00:03:44.030> smartphones<00:03:44.540> maybe

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
more than just Galaxy smartphones maybe

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.780 
more than just Galaxy smartphones maybe
they'll<00:03:45.290> bring<00:03:45.410> it<00:03:45.560> to<00:03:45.710> galaxy<00:03:46.160> tablets<00:03:46.640> in

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790

the<00:03:46.880> future<00:03:47.180> but<00:03:47.630> I<00:03:47.780> don't<00:03:47.840> think<00:03:48.560> Samsung

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
the future but I don't think Samsung

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.830 
the future but I don't think Samsung
will<00:03:49.310> be<00:03:49.430> bringing<00:03:49.670> it<00:03:49.880> to<00:03:49.970> other<00:03:50.150> Android

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
will be bringing it to other Android

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.360 
will be bringing it to other Android

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.280 
devices another thing I wanted to point
out<00:03:52.550> is<00:03:52.670> I<00:03:52.820> did<00:03:53.030> find<00:03:53.330> a<00:03:53.480> small<00:03:53.540> advertisement

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
out is I did find a small advertisement

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.980 
out is I did find a small advertisement
but<00:03:54.770> it<00:03:54.980> was<00:03:55.160> for<00:03:55.400> milk<00:03:55.610> music<00:03:56.180> itself<00:03:56.600> as<00:03:56.810> you

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
but it was for milk music itself as you

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.390
