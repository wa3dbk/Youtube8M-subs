00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.949 
know a longtime goal would probably be
to<00:03:25.189> direct<00:03:26.189> a<00:03:26.340> movie<00:03:26.519> or<00:03:26.819> star<00:03:27.120> in<00:03:27.239> a<00:03:27.329> movie<00:03:27.449> but

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
to direct a movie or star in a movie but

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.050 
to direct a movie or star in a movie but
the<00:03:28.109> chances<00:03:28.470> of<00:03:28.530> that<00:03:28.680> are<00:03:28.829> so<00:03:29.159> slim<00:03:29.519> so<00:03:29.759> just

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
the chances of that are so slim so just

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.659 
the chances of that are so slim so just
anything<00:03:30.359> in<00:03:30.569> entertainment<00:03:31.199> would<00:03:31.349> be

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
anything in entertainment would be

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:35.270
