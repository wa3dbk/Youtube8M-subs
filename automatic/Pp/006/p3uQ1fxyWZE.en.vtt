00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.479

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:39.950

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.540
 that I did not know what to do I could not find 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.200

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.200
 in the suitcase 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.060
 I try with all his strength but not 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.430
 he managed to close the suitcase he had to 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.050
 get something out but could not decide that 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.330
 it was what was going to stay at home 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.610
 he preferred to take all his things 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.490
 favorites 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.760

 I suppose you've thought very well everything 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.430
 that you want to take and that's very 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.710
 important but I think you have 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.750
 too many toys we're just going to be 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.060

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.770

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.920
 you're going to put on when you go for a walk 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:40.020

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.020

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.900

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.900
