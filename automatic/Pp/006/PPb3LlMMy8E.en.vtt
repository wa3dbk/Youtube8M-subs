00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
library card of mine you don't

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.500 
library card of mine you don't
necessarily<00:00:50.589> need<00:00:51.190> a<00:00:51.250> card<00:00:51.549> this<00:00:51.790> is<00:00:51.850> optional

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510

for<00:00:52.570> you<00:00:52.839> you<00:00:53.559> could<00:00:53.830> also<00:00:54.010> do<00:00:54.339> it<00:00:54.370> over<00:00:54.879> your

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
for you you could also do it over your

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:00.180 
for you you could also do it over your
hand<00:00:55.360> depending<00:00:55.870> on<00:00:56.260> if<00:00:56.530> this<00:00:58.019> if<00:00:59.019> this<00:00:59.860> height

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
hand depending on if this if this height

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.119 
hand depending on if this if this height
or<00:01:00.640> width<00:01:01.629> for<00:01:01.989> your<00:01:02.110> pom-pom<00:01:02.589> is<00:01:02.739> decent

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
or width for your pom-pom is decent

or width for your pom-pom is decent
enough<00:01:03.159> for<00:01:03.489> you<00:01:03.610> then<00:01:03.879> your<00:01:04.030> hand<00:01:04.239> is<00:01:04.360> fine

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
enough for you then your hand is fine

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.080 
enough for you then your hand is fine
but<00:01:05.320> as<00:01:05.470> you<00:01:05.619> can<00:01:05.830> see<00:01:06.010> the<00:01:06.190> card<00:01:06.460> is<00:01:06.670> a<00:01:06.700> little

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
but as you can see the card is a little

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.230 
but as you can see the card is a little
longer<00:01:07.360> than<00:01:07.540> my<00:01:07.869> hand<00:01:08.290> so<00:01:08.979> I<00:01:09.040> just<00:01:09.310> wanted<00:01:09.610> a

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
longer than my hand so I just wanted a

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.899 
longer than my hand so I just wanted a
bigger<00:01:10.540> reach<00:01:10.869> so<00:01:11.770> I'm<00:01:11.920> gonna<00:01:12.070> do<00:01:12.340> is<00:01:12.460> take<00:01:12.640> it

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
bigger reach so I'm gonna do is take it

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.580 
bigger reach so I'm gonna do is take it
to<00:01:13.060> the<00:01:13.240> side<00:01:13.450> that's<00:01:13.689> attached<00:01:14.079> to<00:01:14.109> the<00:01:14.439> ball

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
to the side that's attached to the ball

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.599 
to the side that's attached to the ball
of<00:01:14.619> yarn<00:01:18.030> back<00:01:19.030> up<00:01:19.240> a<00:01:19.359> little<00:01:19.509> bit<00:01:20.430> take<00:01:21.430> the

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:21.609 
of yarn back up a little bit take the

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:23.429 
of yarn back up a little bit take the
side<00:01:21.820> that's<00:01:22.030> attached<00:01:22.390> to<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:22.719> yarn<00:01:22.990> and<00:01:23.320> I'm

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
side that's attached to the yarn and I'm

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.859 
side that's attached to the yarn and I'm
going<00:01:23.799> to<00:01:24.009> just<00:01:24.280> go<00:01:24.609> ahead<00:01:24.880> and<00:01:25.119> wrap<00:01:25.570> it

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
going to just go ahead and wrap it

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:36.270 
going to just go ahead and wrap it
repeatedly<00:01:26.770> over<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:28.060> card

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.240 

and<00:01:37.060> you're<00:01:38.050> just<00:01:38.200> gonna<00:01:38.380> do<00:01:38.620> this<00:01:38.740> -<00:01:38.920> you<00:01:39.070> get

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
and you're just gonna do this - you get

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.980 
and you're just gonna do this - you get
obviously<00:01:39.610> this<00:01:40.120> is<00:01:40.240> not<00:01:40.390> enough<00:01:40.720> for<00:01:40.750> a

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
obviously this is not enough for a

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.540 
obviously this is not enough for a
beautiful<00:01:42.540> pom-pom<00:01:43.540> the<00:01:44.230> thicker<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:45.070> more

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
beautiful pom-pom the thicker the more

beautiful pom-pom the thicker the more
yarn<00:01:45.880> you<00:01:46.090> wrap<00:01:46.330> around<00:01:46.360> is<00:01:46.930> the<00:01:47.140> thicker<00:01:47.410> your

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
yarn you wrap around is the thicker your

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.080 
yarn you wrap around is the thicker your
pom-pom<00:01:48.130> is<00:01:48.280> gonna<00:01:48.490> be<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:50.580> I'm<00:01:51.580> just<00:01:51.760> going<00:01:52.000> to

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
pom-pom is gonna be so I'm just going to

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.920 
pom-pom is gonna be so I'm just going to
go<00:01:52.210> ahead<00:01:53.550> and<00:01:54.550> continue<00:01:55.270> to<00:01:55.450> wrap<00:01:55.690> this

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
go ahead and continue to wrap this

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.240 
go ahead and continue to wrap this
around<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:57.720> then<00:01:58.720> I'll<00:01:58.869> come<00:01:59.140> back<00:01:59.320> after<00:01:59.830> I

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
around and then I'll come back after I

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.500 
around and then I'll come back after I
reach<00:02:00.520> my<00:02:00.760> desired<00:02:00.820> amount<00:02:02.640> okay<00:02:03.640> so<00:02:03.700> here's

my desired amount so much so that the

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.949 
my desired amount so much so that the
card<00:02:08.380> has<00:02:09.310> decided<00:02:09.700> to<00:02:09.880> bend<00:02:10.209> but<00:02:10.390> you<00:02:10.509> can<00:02:10.720> see

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
that is why I wrapped it around so many

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.690 
that is why I wrapped it around so many
times<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:17.020> have<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:17.590> stop<00:02:17.800> myself<00:02:18.010> from<00:02:18.280> doing

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
times and have to stop myself from doing

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.270 
times and have to stop myself from doing
so<00:02:18.910> so<00:02:19.660> now<00:02:19.930> comes<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:20.620> tricky<00:02:20.770> part<00:02:21.220> because

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
so so now comes the tricky part because

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.490 
so so now comes the tricky part because
I<00:02:21.700> wrapped<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.480> I<00:02:22.540> wrap<00:02:22.780> really<00:02:23.200> tightly

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
I wrapped and I wrap really tightly

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.210 
I wrapped and I wrap really tightly

around this card it's gonna take me some

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.920 
around this card it's gonna take me some
time<00:02:27.280> to<00:02:27.489> squeeze<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.209> card<00:02:28.450> out<00:02:28.630> now<00:02:28.870> you

could use the tail I apologize

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.980 
could use the tail I apologize
using<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:58.310> tail<00:02:58.640> end<00:02:58.970> because<00:02:59.720> there's

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
using the tail end because there's

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.350 
using the tail end because there's
enough<00:03:00.290> here<00:03:00.470> to<00:03:00.500> go<00:03:00.740> around<00:03:01.010> you<00:03:01.910> want<00:03:02.150> to

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
two ends the long tail and the one

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.110 
two ends the long tail and the one
attached<00:03:59.260> to<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.500> ball<00:03:59.650> of<00:03:59.680> yarn<00:03:59.980> I<00:04:00.340> brought

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
attached to the ball of yarn I brought

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.119 
attached to the ball of yarn I brought
them<00:04:01.390> here<00:04:01.659> you<00:04:01.810> can<00:04:01.959> see<00:04:02.110> that<00:04:02.290> I<00:04:02.319> pulled<00:04:02.680> the

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
one from the ball of yarn I pulled it to

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.720 
one from the ball of yarn I pulled it to
the<00:04:05.290> middle<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:05.709> I<00:04:05.859> just<00:04:06.129> tied<00:04:06.340> it<00:04:06.459> in<00:04:06.609> a<00:04:06.700> knot

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
the middle and I just tied it in a knot

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.640 
the middle and I just tied it in a knot
okay<00:04:07.450> so<00:04:08.439> now<00:04:09.250> comes<00:04:09.939> the<00:04:10.150> fun<00:04:10.540> part<00:04:10.870> of<00:04:11.290> making

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
okay so now comes the fun part of making

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.649 
okay so now comes the fun part of making
the<00:04:11.950> pom-pom<00:04:12.519> and<00:04:12.909> you<00:04:13.000> might<00:04:13.180> make<00:04:13.359> sure<00:04:13.510> you

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:13.659 
the pom-pom and you might make sure you

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:15.539 
the pom-pom and you might make sure you
tie<00:04:14.349> that<00:04:14.590> Center<00:04:14.950> tight<00:04:15.189> because<00:04:15.370> you<00:04:15.430> don't

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
tie that Center tight because you don't

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.279 
tie that Center tight because you don't
want<00:04:15.909> it<00:04:15.970> too<00:04:16.120> loose<00:04:16.299> and<00:04:16.600> like<00:04:16.750> I<00:04:16.900> said<00:04:16.959> get

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
want it too loose and like I said get

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.069 
want it too loose and like I said get
this<00:04:17.440> all<00:04:17.590> over<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.889> place<00:04:18.100> now<00:04:18.880> I<00:04:19.239> know<00:04:19.449> in<00:04:19.930> my

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
this all over the place now I know in my

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.820 
this all over the place now I know in my
materials<00:04:20.979> clip<00:04:21.280> I<00:04:21.430> had<00:04:22.139> these<00:04:23.139> small<00:04:23.410> little

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
materials clip I had these small little

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.040 
materials clip I had these small little
scissors<00:04:24.190> but<00:04:24.400> I<00:04:24.430> just<00:04:24.699> realized<00:04:24.940> you<00:04:25.870> want

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
scissors but I just realized you want

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.320 
scissors but I just realized you want
something<00:04:26.410> kind<00:04:26.590> of<00:04:26.770> big<00:04:27.610> enough<00:04:27.910> especially

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
something kind of big enough especially

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.840 
something kind of big enough especially
if<00:04:28.630> you're<00:04:28.750> doing<00:04:28.870> a<00:04:29.050> big<00:04:29.229> pom-pom<00:04:29.800> that<00:04:30.130> can

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
if you're doing a big pom-pom that can

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.520 
if you're doing a big pom-pom that can
wrap<00:04:31.180> that<00:04:31.210> can<00:04:31.660> get<00:04:31.960> through<00:04:32.139> all<00:04:32.260> these

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
wrap that can get through all these

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.580 
wrap that can get through all these
loops<00:04:32.919> here<00:04:33.310> as<00:04:33.780> much<00:04:34.780> as<00:04:34.960> possible<00:04:35.199> it's

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
loops here as much as possible it's

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.980 
loops here as much as possible it's
