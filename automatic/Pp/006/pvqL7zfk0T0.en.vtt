00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello my life i will be back we 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.670
 can see and yes we have each other 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.280
 I have not seen it for a long time 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.540
 I have my Monday monday plan 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.860
 from the rocker that was not quite 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.440
 currently I have my old one 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.650
 Spaces filmed at home and 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.789
 now i have my own bude and yes 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.170
 you can see that looks like I look 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.270
 Little doctor in the background is out of it 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.880
 definitely brighter and I film that 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.980
 first time without soft boxes testweise 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.109
 honestly not quite test because I 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.330
 must admit the soft boxes 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.070
 behind the back sofa and I'm honest 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.930
 a little bit too woman said that now 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.100
 That's why I thought so 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.660
 just try it 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.610
 daylight and I believe it 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.110
 works quite well or what do you mean 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.230
 yes I am the last three weeks 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.910
 pretty much come around I'm like I said 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.680
 moved and after the exam I was 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.329
 not quite as motivated many new 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.399
 videos to shoot the quasi I 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.660
 At the moment I was able to reach the top positions 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.270
 were not there then I thought to myself 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.710
 york you should be what his class and that 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.180
 I did it now and it 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.559
 actually did quite well, too 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.570
 me because i find it again through videos 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.129
 make but no desire then remember 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.809
 that's what the audience thinks, too 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.280
 You notice that exactly when someone 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.439
 no desire has videos to come to 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.729
 the single total demo we over it and 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.750
 I just did not want that 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.979
 I did not feel well 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.780
 and that we do not end up with you too 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.299
 Well, anyway, I have been back 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.310
 there and mondays already gave the first video 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.810
 from me the lunch menu that you here 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.189
 can see that could can click 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.080
 if you want then there is something with 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.700
 lenses simply check it out a few 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.229
 block and then I'll have you soon 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.330
 show again and I have one 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.610
 intro get a new intro from 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.200
 you will learn the following shows you 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.610
 same and you certainly want to know 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.080
 how it goes on if I really am now 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.190
 back where you are now 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.960
 if I change in the new one now 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.910
 I can do that flat 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.880
 the biggest thing I definitely on 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.530
 antenna countries will come only next 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.990
 Month is expected there is one 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.700
 big change on the channel not 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.320
 necessarily from the themes is 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.480
 So a little bit of other videos give 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.370
 little bit but no fear nothing 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.870
 in the direction of beauty or something else 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.000
 I've already times somehow 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.710
 To do it yourself must be natural cosmetics 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.880
 but that is really only very completely 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.290
 Rarely because I want men too 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.300
 look at the videos that which 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.860
 I get bored and that's why 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.380
 The event is definitely going on 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.660
 around ba 's soles and such things 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.640
 So it really is about body well-being 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.200
 nutrition and so on, so it stays 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.610
 on the subject and maybe it will come 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.140
 little bit psychology towards 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.820
 I have been to it before now 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.170
 decided to and two videos per 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.090
 to do so in any case as 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.740
 Monday menu and then again young video 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.110
 and have me for the departure times 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.160
 So I decided Monday and Thursday 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.050
 I do not want it that way now 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.270
 stiffen but clear that Monday menu 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.769
 on mondays thursday i find one 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.610
 good time I have the feeling that the 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.920
 most spectators on thursday evening 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.750
 are online and that's why I thought times 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.190
 the thursday despite because otherwise was the 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.750
 election Sunday and now I think so 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.670
 sunday and monday video then you have 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.470
 the whole week nothing more of me so 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.910
 We do the monday and thursday and 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.560
 maybe there will be a third 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.420
 video then somehow it will be saturday 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.070
 or otherwise so let's see 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.150
 I want to do a few videos 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.950
 at the moment because I have a fixed one now 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.480
 I got jobs though 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.150
 not 100 percent because I'm still there 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.989
 the training for the holistic 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.890
 make dietitian and there I am 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.640
 I definitely still until november 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.100
 tuned 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.480
 and yes I do that too 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.220
 youtube and I would like to work there as well 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.290
 I would like to give to videos and 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.459
 so on and if you look and feel 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.810
 all whatsoever good friend 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.580
 pulls together and so with one 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.170
 Person pulls together then one has yes 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.400
 also somehow commitment one must 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.350
 also look that a bit clean 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.690
 So everyone looks he has to look that way 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.209
 It somehow looks good at home 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.380
 maybe something to eat 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.360
 In any case you are obliged more 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.950
 to do more than at home and clearly 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.230
 Of course, this also increases again 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.910
 workload at home and at it 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.739
 me now getting used so that one 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.049
 a few things in addition must do 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.540
 and I just want it all 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:40.300
 Under a hat bring cooperation videos 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.340
 education budget and what else 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.840
 this is the case at the end of the year 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.340
 when I am so with the nutritionist 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.780
 I want to finish training 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.069
 E-mail every case an ebook 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.660
 I told you yes about basenfasten 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.400
 I would just set a concept 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.500
 do not invent anything new or have so 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.209
 just write a good guide 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.560
 and possibly also attach recipes that 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.580
 you can just do it better 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.780
 because I already have a lot of videos 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.760
 uploaded but many want too 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.110
 just what they can print out 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.940
 I can send them 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.170
 and I want to do that too 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.610
 and it certainly takes some 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.740
 weeks until the have made ready 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.260
 yes, this is already something of 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.940
 new intro and yes I want you 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.920
 short time now and I would 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.709
 I am very happy if you say so 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.660
 we find the intro like this and below in the 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.880
 infobox is also who that video made 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.860
 that is the sebastian channel high 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.530
 port block also talks a lot about the topic 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.910
 vegan 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.190
 boy reports he has now operation 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.389
 is moby talent behind and then 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.610
 you can definitely take a look 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:33.470
 I love the church portal very much 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.180
 full-day videos and so on 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.419
 is definitely times in its channel 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.419
 purely 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:49.740
 How did you like the intro? 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.419
 it me down in the comments and 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.250
 rated the video as good as failed 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.229
 See you again next week 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.319
 It's about the topic of pimples and what you do 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.669
 can do about it there is such a 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:01.560
 carbon, on the other hand, or a cool one 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.300
 Substance that you can use against it 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.129
 which is pretty good and that does not help 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.080
 only with pimples but more 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:08.159
 not in this video now and then 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.409
 Let's see each other next week 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:12.569
 still fall to another video that 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:14.400
 is so cool moderate or 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:16.379
 well not moderately now he is like that 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.729
 something to try so what I like 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:19.620
 you've tried it that way 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:20.789
 months what I ate so me 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.550
 can already betrayed that is coming 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:25.020
 Eat a video and then yes 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.219
 we'll see what's next 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.879
 I wish you a nice day 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:28.879
 and see you soon
