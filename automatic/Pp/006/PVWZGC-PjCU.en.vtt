00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
their stuff all right so you've got the

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.350 
their stuff all right so you've got the
two<00:00:09.650> logic<00:00:10.650> cubes<00:00:10.860> these<00:00:11.219> are<00:00:11.460> just<00:00:11.880> basically

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
two logic cubes these are just basically

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.640 
two logic cubes these are just basically
spawn<00:00:13.019> points<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.830> didn't<00:00:14.340> even<00:00:14.750> put<00:00:15.750> anything

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
spawn points I didn't even put anything

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.980 
spawn points I didn't even put anything
in<00:00:16.980> there<00:00:17.750> so<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:18.840> spawned<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:21.300> player<00:00:21.570> at

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
in there so you spawned the player at

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.310 
in there so you spawned the player at
the<00:00:22.260> position<00:00:22.439> blah<00:00:23.039> blah<00:00:23.189> blah<00:00:23.630> all<00:00:24.630> three<00:00:25.289> of

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
the position blah blah blah all three of

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.740 
the position blah blah blah all three of
these<00:00:26.390> are<00:00:27.390> templates<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.310> player<00:00:29.310> is

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
these are templates that player is

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.959 
these are templates that player is
actually<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:31.560> default<00:00:32.099> player<00:00:32.309> there's<00:00:32.610> not

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
actually a default player there's not

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.639 
actually a default player there's not
much<00:00:33.210> there<00:00:33.989> it's<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:35.160> default<00:00:35.899> third<00:00:36.899> person

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
much there it's the default third person

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:47.119 
much there it's the default third person
I<00:00:38.610> think<00:00:39.510> yeah<00:00:39.870> third-person<00:00:40.860> adventure<00:00:46.129> okay

I think yeah third-person adventure okay

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.709 
I think yeah third-person adventure okay
what's<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.670> all<00:00:48.000> yeah<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.989> door<00:00:50.719> once

interacted create the empty boat at the
position<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:56.940> cube<00:00:57.539> right<00:00:57.840> here<00:00:58.320> and

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
position of this cube right here and

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.630 
position of this cube right here and
destroy<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.340> door<00:01:00.440> that's<00:01:01.440> too<00:01:02.190> quickly

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
spawn in you can actually choose

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.880 
spawn in you can actually choose
different<00:01:09.390> ways<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.630> spawn<00:01:10.080> them<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.380> anyways

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
different ways to spawn them in anyways

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.440 
different ways to spawn them in anyways
let's<00:01:11.790> get<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.360> real<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:13.049> good<00:01:13.229> stuff<00:01:14.450> so

arrow a bench whatever but you can

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.850 
arrow a bench whatever but you can
pretty<00:01:24.600> much<00:01:24.750> do<00:01:25.369> like<00:01:26.369> use<00:01:26.640> anything<00:01:27.860> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
pretty much do like use anything the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.649 
pretty much do like use anything the
first<00:01:29.220> four<00:01:29.820> codes<00:01:30.299> are<00:01:30.979> for<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.659> swimming

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
first four codes are for the swimming

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.700 
first four codes are for the swimming
fish<00:01:34.189> brain<00:01:35.869> even<00:01:36.869> says<00:01:37.200> they're<00:01:37.439> swimming

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
fish brain even says they're swimming

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.710 
fish brain even says they're swimming
fish<00:01:38.070> brain<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:39.979> just<00:01:40.979> removed<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.430> jump<00:01:42.390> when

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
fish brain I just removed the jump when

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.160 
fish brain I just removed the jump when
not<00:01:43.530> swimming<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:45.860> added<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.610> line<00:01:47.939> here<00:01:48.270> so

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
not swimming and added this line here so

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.649 
not swimming and added this line here so
when<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:49.790> interacted

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
when it's interacted

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.399 
when it's interacted
it<00:01:51.869> will<00:01:52.140> create<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.450> boat<00:01:54.450> with<00:01:55.079> the

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
it will create the boat with the

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.840 
it will create the boat with the
character<00:01:56.539> that's<00:01:57.539> stuck<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.340> at<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.670> same

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
character that's stuck on it at the same

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.919 
character that's stuck on it at the same
position<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.679> it<00:02:01.679> will<00:02:01.859> destroy<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:03.390> player

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
position and it will destroy the player

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.099 
position and it will destroy the player
with<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.590> wooden<00:02:05.270> woodland<00:02:06.270> would<00:02:06.840> land

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:07.109 
with the wooden woodland would land

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:10.809 
with the wooden woodland would land
peasant<00:02:07.679> mail<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:09.119> will<00:02:09.330> destroy<00:02:09.720> itself

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
peasant mail and it will destroy itself

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:17.150 
peasant mail and it will destroy itself
so<00:02:11.819> that<00:02:12.540> will<00:02:13.080> spawn<00:02:13.620> in<00:02:13.970> this<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.920> if<00:02:16.920> the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
so that will spawn in this and if the

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.390 
so that will spawn in this and if the
player<00:02:17.629> sitting<00:02:18.629> on<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.590> but<00:02:19.769> we<00:02:19.920> break<00:02:20.220> this

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
player sitting on the but we break this

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.280 
player sitting on the but we break this
apart<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:21.209> player<00:02:21.540> has<00:02:22.410> an<00:02:23.120> emote<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.480> the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
apart the player has an emote and the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.940 
apart the player has an emote and the
emote<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:26.000> used<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.209> used<00:02:27.540> connect<00:02:28.230> capture<00:02:28.739> and

peasant at the position of the actual
camera<00:03:13.319> and<00:03:14.060> then<00:03:15.060> it'll<00:03:15.389> destroy<00:03:15.930> itself<00:03:16.260> and

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
camera and then it'll destroy itself and

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.860 
camera and then it'll destroy itself and
the<00:03:19.200> cycle<00:03:19.590> goes<00:03:19.769> on<00:03:19.980> from<00:03:20.280> there<00:03:22.700> on<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:24.569> note

the cycle goes on from there on to note

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.600 
the cycle goes on from there on to note
is<00:03:25.250> actually

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
is actually

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:34.970

speed<00:03:57.130> is<00:03:57.930> slower<00:03:58.930> than<00:03:59.290> usual<00:03:59.700> because<00:04:00.700> it's

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
speed is slower than usual because it's

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.100

a<00:04:01.300> boat<00:04:01.510> it<00:04:02.290> has<00:04:02.560> lower<00:04:03.810> turning<00:04:04.810> speed

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
a boat it has lower turning speed

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:12.990 
a boat it has lower turning speed
whatever<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:07.709> then<00:04:08.709> this<00:04:09.550> one<00:04:12.000> brain

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
whatever and then this one brain

physics<00:04:17.260> ok<00:04:18.070> so<00:04:18.130> it's<00:04:18.370> kaleido<00:04:18.760> belen<00:04:19.239> it's<00:04:19.450> a

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
physics ok so it's kaleido belen it's a

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.220 
physics ok so it's kaleido belen it's a
character<00:04:21.000> this<00:04:22.000> one<00:04:22.270> on<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.690> other<00:04:22.900> hand

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
character this one on the other hand

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.920 
character this one on the other hand
it's<00:04:24.930> it's<00:04:25.930> a<00:04:26.940> character<00:04:27.940> but<00:04:28.150> collide<00:04:28.780> the

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
it's it's a character but collide the

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.020 
it's it's a character but collide the
ball<00:04:29.110> is<00:04:29.350> off<00:04:29.620> because<00:04:30.810> when<00:04:31.810> it<00:04:31.930> spawns<00:04:32.320> in<00:04:33.030> on

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
ball is off because when it spawns in on

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.340 
ball is off because when it spawns in on
the<00:04:35.020> same<00:04:35.380> position<00:04:36.130> at<00:04:36.250> this<00:04:36.490> thing<00:04:36.940> it<00:04:37.840> will

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
the same position at this thing it will

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:45.690 
the same position at this thing it will
actually<00:04:40.590> like<00:04:41.880> eject<00:04:43.890> the<00:04:44.890> character<00:04:45.490> or

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
actually like eject the character or

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.350 
actually like eject the character or
something<00:04:46.210> it'll<00:04:47.140> be<00:04:47.290> it's<00:04:47.710> chaos<00:04:48.280> let's<00:04:49.060> just

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
something it'll be it's chaos let's just

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.969 
something it'll be it's chaos let's just
put<00:04:49.570> it<00:04:49.600> at<00:04:49.840> that<00:04:49.990> and<00:04:50.760> that's<00:04:51.760> pretty<00:04:52.330> much<00:04:52.479> it

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
put it at that and that's pretty much it

00:04:52.979 --> 00:05:03.469 
put it at that and that's pretty much it
let's<00:04:53.979> go<00:04:54.280> back<00:04:54.460> to<00:04:54.490> test<00:04:54.910> it<00:05:00.300> so<00:05:01.300> you<00:05:01.390> spawn<00:05:01.720> in

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
let's go back to test it so you spawn in

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.830 
let's go back to test it so you spawn in
press<00:05:04.479> be<00:05:04.840> open<00:05:05.560> like<00:05:06.490> the<00:05:06.729> dark<00:05:07.120> or<00:05:07.450> bought<00:05:07.810> a

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
press be open like the dark or bought a

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:14.690 
press be open like the dark or bought a
boat<00:05:08.229> or<00:05:08.500> something<00:05:08.740> and<00:05:09.479> you<00:05:10.479> can<00:05:10.510> drive<00:05:11.050> yay

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:32.730 

and<00:05:15.700> it's<00:05:16.180> much<00:05:16.390> faster

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:40.119 

get<00:05:33.740> in<00:05:33.919> the<00:05:34.069> boat<00:05:35.439> go<00:05:36.439> even<00:05:36.830> faster<00:05:37.280> oh<00:05:39.099> no<00:05:40.099> I

00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:40.129 
get in the boat go even faster oh no I

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:45.909 
get in the boat go even faster oh no I
got<00:05:40.909> stuck<00:05:40.939> ok<00:05:41.860> well<00:05:42.860> you<00:05:43.129> get<00:05:43.280> it<00:05:43.460> a<00:05:44.919> rideable

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
got stuck ok well you get it a rideable

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:49.960 
got stuck ok well you get it a rideable
boat<00:05:46.449> thanks<00:05:47.449> for<00:05:47.569> watching
