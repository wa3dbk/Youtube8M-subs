00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.780 
different ways you can go about this but
I<00:04:02.659> find<00:04:03.109> if<00:04:03.290> you<00:04:03.379> just<00:04:03.560> be<00:04:04.040> the<00:04:04.099> lug<00:04:04.400> nuts<00:04:04.609> with

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
I find if you just be the lug nuts with

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:12.280 
I find if you just be the lug nuts with
a<00:04:04.819> little<00:04:05.120> bit<00:04:08.409> friction<00:04:09.409> try<00:04:09.560> this<00:04:11.079> this<00:04:12.079> is

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
a little bit friction try this this is

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.430 
a little bit friction try this this is
still<00:04:12.439> gonna<00:04:12.650> be<00:04:12.709> stubborn<00:04:17.049> now<00:04:18.049> when<00:04:18.199> you<00:04:18.320> go

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
still gonna be stubborn now when you go

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.650 
still gonna be stubborn now when you go
to<00:04:18.470> do<00:04:18.709> this<00:04:19.060> and<00:04:20.060> you're<00:04:20.180> pulling<00:04:20.449> on

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
to do this and you're pulling on

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.469 
to do this and you're pulling on
something<00:04:20.720> like<00:04:21.049> this<00:04:21.139> make<00:04:21.380> sure<00:04:21.410> you<00:04:21.650> have<00:04:21.829> a

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
something like this make sure you have a

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:32.580 
something like this make sure you have a
car<00:04:23.479> supported<00:04:24.020> correctly<00:04:25.690> get<00:04:26.690> over<00:04:26.930> on<00:04:27.020> you

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.140 

okay<00:04:34.360> we<00:04:35.360> won<00:04:36.400> now<00:04:37.400> that<00:04:37.520> I've<00:04:37.610> got<00:04:37.820> that<00:04:37.970> off

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
okay we won now that I've got that off

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.640 
okay we won now that I've got that off
of<00:04:38.330> there<00:04:39.159> you<00:04:40.159> can<00:04:40.280> see<00:04:40.460> all<00:04:40.610> this<00:04:40.729> corrosion

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
of there you can see all this corrosion

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.460 
of there you can see all this corrosion
and<00:04:42.650> inside<00:04:43.039> the<00:04:43.220> string<00:04:43.490> right<00:04:43.639> here<00:04:44.470> you

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
and inside the string right here you

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.850 
and inside the string right here you
need<00:04:45.590> to<00:04:45.650> clean<00:04:45.949> this<00:04:46.099> out<00:04:46.310> really<00:04:46.610> good<00:04:47.860> and

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
need to clean this out really good and

need to clean this out really good and
all<00:04:49.250> this<00:04:49.490> surface<00:04:50.050> and<00:04:51.050> then<00:04:51.229> over<00:04:51.440> here<00:04:51.470> on

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
all this surface and then over here on

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.600 
all this surface and then over here on
the<00:04:51.770> top<00:04:52.010> when<00:04:52.250> the<00:04:52.430> hub<00:04:53.360> and<00:04:53.570> the<00:04:53.659> brake<00:04:53.870> drum

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
the top when the hub and the brake drum

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.010 
the top when the hub and the brake drum
you<00:04:55.610> need<00:04:55.760> to<00:04:55.849> clean<00:04:56.030> around<00:04:56.270> this<00:04:56.449> slip<00:04:56.840> right

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
you need to clean around this slip right

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.500 
you need to clean around this slip right
here<00:04:57.370> and<00:04:58.370> then<00:04:58.849> I'll<00:04:59.000> put<00:04:59.180> a<00:04:59.210> little<00:04:59.300> bit<00:04:59.389> of

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
here and then I'll put a little bit of

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.839 
here and then I'll put a little bit of
never<00:04:59.690> sees<00:05:00.020> around<00:05:00.800> this<00:05:01.070> before<00:05:01.490> I<00:05:01.550> put<00:05:01.729> that

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849 
never sees around this before I put that

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:05.290 
never sees around this before I put that
tire<00:05:02.150> back<00:05:02.389> on<00:05:03.550> so<00:05:04.550> that's<00:05:04.669> one<00:05:04.880> way<00:05:05.060> to<00:05:05.120> get

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
tire back on so that's one way to get

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.529 
tire back on so that's one way to get
your<00:05:05.419> tire<00:05:05.630> off<00:05:05.870> if<00:05:06.080> it's<00:05:06.229> stuck<00:05:07.270> okay<00:05:08.270> now

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
your tire off if it's stuck okay now

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:09.879 
your tire off if it's stuck okay now
before<00:05:08.659> putting<00:05:09.080> this<00:05:09.169> tire<00:05:09.409> back<00:05:09.650> on<00:05:09.860> I

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
before putting this tire back on I

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:12.070 
before putting this tire back on I
sanded<00:05:10.310> that<00:05:10.430> ring<00:05:11.120> on<00:05:11.270> the<00:05:11.419> axle<00:05:11.810> they're<00:05:11.930> all

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
sanded that ring on the axle they're all

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.800 
sanded that ring on the axle they're all
down<00:05:12.349> and<00:05:12.680> never<00:05:13.550> seized<00:05:13.940> it<00:05:14.150> a<00:05:14.210> little<00:05:14.360> bit<00:05:14.539> I

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
down and never seized it a little bit I

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.810 
down and never seized it a little bit I
cleaned<00:05:15.349> all<00:05:15.500> the<00:05:15.530> loose<00:05:15.800> stuff<00:05:16.070> off<00:05:16.250> of<00:05:16.310> here

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
cleaned all the loose stuff off of here

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.240 
cleaned all the loose stuff off of here
and<00:05:16.909> this<00:05:17.659> inside<00:05:18.139> circle<00:05:18.590> I<00:05:18.650> cleaned<00:05:18.949> drill

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
and this inside circle I cleaned drill

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.279 
and this inside circle I cleaned drill
bit<00:05:19.400> with<00:05:19.550> sandpaper<00:05:20.000> and<00:05:20.690> then<00:05:20.810> I<00:05:20.900> put<00:05:21.080> a<00:05:21.110> real

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
bit with sandpaper and then I put a real

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.050 
bit with sandpaper and then I put a real
thin<00:05:21.530> coating<00:05:21.979> and<00:05:22.070> never<00:05:22.220> seeds<00:05:22.490> inside<00:05:22.849> that

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
thin coating and never seeds inside that

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.029 
thin coating and never seeds inside that
circle<00:05:23.240> so<00:05:24.139> that<00:05:24.289> ought<00:05:24.409> to<00:05:24.440> help<00:05:24.650> you<00:05:24.830> from
