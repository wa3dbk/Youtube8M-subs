00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:28.829 
model let me go ahead and check out back
here<00:00:20.599> it's<00:00:21.289> the<00:00:22.509> the<00:00:23.509> Ju<00:00:25.900> s500<00:00:26.900> IV<00:00:27.859> and

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:28.839 
here it's the the Ju s500 IV and

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:32.350 
here it's the the Ju s500 IV and
basically<00:00:29.839> it's<00:00:30.050> 500<00:00:30.499> amp<00:00:30.679> it's<00:00:31.609> a<00:00:31.820> peak<00:00:32.090> of

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
basically it's 500 amp it's a peak of

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.660 
basically it's 500 amp it's a peak of
1,000<00:00:33.050> and<00:00:35.590> pretty<00:00:36.590> much<00:00:36.680> has<00:00:36.890> all<00:00:37.100> the<00:00:37.280> same

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
1,000 and pretty much has all the same

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.299 
1,000 and pretty much has all the same
features<00:00:37.699> as<00:00:38.149> the<00:00:38.180> Electra<00:00:38.600> made<00:00:38.750> 400<00:00:39.309> they

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
features as the Electra made 400 they

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.799 
features as the Electra made 400 they
obviously<00:00:41.090> change<00:00:41.660> the<00:00:41.870> style<00:00:42.170> of<00:00:42.379> this<00:00:43.420> it<00:00:44.420> is

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
obviously change the style of this it is

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:46.479 
obviously change the style of this it is
easy<00:00:45.019> to<00:00:45.230> carry<00:00:45.500> around<00:00:45.590> with<00:00:45.949> the<00:00:46.100> handle

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
easy to carry around with the handle

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.270 
easy to carry around with the handle
here<00:00:46.820> it<00:00:46.940> is<00:00:47.239> a<00:00:47.269> little<00:00:47.570> bit<00:00:47.690> lighter<00:00:48.070> so<00:00:49.070> that

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
here it is a little bit lighter so that

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.990 
here it is a little bit lighter so that
part<00:00:49.579> I<00:00:49.670> do<00:00:49.789> like<00:00:49.969> bedroom<00:00:50.379> as<00:00:51.379> well<00:00:51.440> as<00:00:52.100> the

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
part I do like bedroom as well as the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.700 
part I do like bedroom as well as the
cables<00:00:53.449> are<00:00:53.570> on<00:00:53.840> each<00:00:53.989> side<00:00:54.199> so<00:00:54.410> you<00:00:54.500> got<00:00:54.620> the

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
cables are on each side so you got the

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.040 
cables are on each side so you got the
black<00:00:54.920> and<00:00:55.219> the<00:00:56.120> red<00:00:56.269> cables<00:00:56.629> on<00:00:56.809> the<00:00:56.840> other

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
black and the red cables on the other

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.610 
black and the red cables on the other
side<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:57.620> they<00:00:58.339> are<00:00:58.460> attached<00:00:58.820> and<00:00:59.440> so<00:01:00.440> that

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
side and they are attached and so that

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.250 
side and they are attached and so that
makes<00:01:00.800> a<00:01:00.980> lot<00:01:01.010> easier<00:01:01.160> before<00:01:01.910> with<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:02.719> older

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
makes a lot easier before with the older

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.030 
makes a lot easier before with the older
model<00:01:03.589> it<00:01:03.920> was<00:01:04.550> a<00:01:04.580> separate<00:01:05.620> accessory<00:01:06.620> where

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
model it was a separate accessory where

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.510 
model it was a separate accessory where
you<00:01:07.940> would<00:01:08.090> have<00:01:08.240> to<00:01:08.270> you<00:01:09.230> know<00:01:09.320> try<00:01:10.040> to<00:01:10.100> store

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
you would have to you know try to store

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.120 
you would have to you know try to store
it<00:01:10.670> elsewhere<00:01:11.210> and<00:01:11.600> then<00:01:11.810> you<00:01:11.990> would<00:01:12.200> have<00:01:13.010> to

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
it elsewhere and then you would have to

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.120 
it elsewhere and then you would have to
plug<00:01:13.370> it<00:01:13.490> in<00:01:13.660> so<00:01:14.660> this<00:01:14.900> seems<00:01:15.140> a<00:01:15.230> lot<00:01:15.410> a<00:01:15.680> lot

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
plug it in so this seems a lot a lot

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.450 
plug it in so this seems a lot a lot
easier<00:01:17.020> just<00:01:18.020> with<00:01:18.290> so<00:01:18.410> as<00:01:18.500> far<00:01:18.650> as<00:01:18.710> storage<00:01:18.920> so

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
easier just with so as far as storage so

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.270 
easier just with so as far as storage so
that<00:01:19.850> it<00:01:20.270> is<00:01:20.660> not<00:01:20.840> going<00:01:20.990> to<00:01:21.110> you<00:01:21.620> know<00:01:21.650> ripple

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
that it is not going to you know ripple

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.270 
that it is not going to you know ripple
Park<00:01:22.490> is<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:23.390> last<00:01:23.630> one<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.830> Electra<00:01:25.130> make

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
Park is the last one the Electra make

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.480 
Park is the last one the Electra make
400<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:26.120> jumper<00:01:26.570> cables<00:01:26.800> ended<00:01:27.800> up<00:01:27.950> coming

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
400 the jumper cables ended up coming

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.640 
400 the jumper cables ended up coming
off<00:01:28.790> and<00:01:29.210> I<00:01:29.330> think<00:01:29.540> just<00:01:29.690> because<00:01:29.810> of<00:01:30.230> having

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
off and I think just because of having

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.220 
off and I think just because of having
to<00:01:30.920> take<00:01:31.790> it<00:01:31.940> off<00:01:32.120> and<00:01:32.360> store<00:01:32.510> somewhere<00:01:33.020> or

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
to take it off and store somewhere or

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.200 
to take it off and store somewhere or
just<00:01:33.500> constantly<00:01:33.950> being<00:01:34.160> moved<00:01:35.090> around<00:01:35.240> so

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
just constantly being moved around so

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.640 
just constantly being moved around so
the<00:01:38.210> one<00:01:38.360> thing<00:01:38.480> I<00:01:38.570> don't<00:01:38.720> like<00:01:38.840> about<00:01:38.990> this<00:01:39.410> is

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
the one thing I don't like about this is

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.220 
the one thing I don't like about this is
the<00:01:40.010> light<00:01:40.790> that<00:01:40.820> comes<00:01:41.510> with<00:01:41.660> it<00:01:41.810> I<00:01:41.840> mean<00:01:41.990> you

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 
the light that comes with it I mean you

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.610 
the light that comes with it I mean you
press<00:01:42.710> it<00:01:42.860> on<00:01:43.010> off<00:01:43.700> but<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.840> other<00:01:45.050> one<00:01:45.290> was<00:01:45.320> on

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
press it on off but the other one was on

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.770 
press it on off but the other one was on
the<00:01:45.650> side<00:01:45.980> so<00:01:46.640> you<00:01:46.670> can<00:01:46.760> aim<00:01:47.090> it<00:01:47.120> towards<00:01:47.600> say<00:01:47.750> a

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
the side so you can aim it towards say a

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.290 
the side so you can aim it towards say a
wheel<00:01:48.110> when<00:01:48.380> your<00:01:48.580> your<00:01:49.580> car<00:01:49.790> tire<00:01:50.000> for<00:01:50.180> need

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
wheel when your your car tire for need

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.230 
wheel when your your car tire for need
to<00:01:50.360> pump<00:01:50.570> it<00:01:50.690> up<00:01:50.830> so<00:01:51.830> that<00:01:51.860> one<00:01:52.610> I<00:01:52.640> like<00:01:52.790> better

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
to pump it up so that one I like better

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.460 
to pump it up so that one I like better
than<00:01:53.330> this<00:01:53.510> one<00:01:53.660> because<00:01:53.840> it<00:01:53.930> just<00:01:53.960> kind<00:01:54.380> of

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
than this one because it just kind of

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.650 
than this one because it just kind of
just<00:01:54.590> goes<00:01:54.770> straight<00:01:55.100> up<00:01:55.160> and<00:01:55.490> you<00:01:56.360> can<00:01:56.540> only

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
just goes straight up and you can only

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.540 
just goes straight up and you can only
point<00:01:56.900> it<00:01:57.020> at<00:01:57.140> something<00:01:58.660> it<00:01:59.660> has<00:01:59.840> the<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:01.130> psi

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
point it at something it has the the psi

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.810 
point it at something it has the the psi
gauge<00:02:02.000> right<00:02:02.270> here<00:02:03.070> and<00:02:04.070> it<00:02:04.190> lights<00:02:04.370> up<00:02:04.550> when

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
gauge right here and it lights up when

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.420 
gauge right here and it lights up when
you<00:02:04.910> go<00:02:05.120> to<00:02:05.210> pump<00:02:05.540> I<00:02:06.070> one<00:02:07.070> thing<00:02:07.190> he<00:02:07.250> doesn't

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
you go to pump I one thing he doesn't

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.580 
you go to pump I one thing he doesn't

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
400 and it works just this is good I

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.740 
400 and it works just this is good I
think<00:04:51.520> the<00:04:51.580> battery<00:04:51.819> doesn't<00:04:52.150> last<00:04:52.419> as<00:04:52.599> long

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
think the battery doesn't last as long

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.570 
think the battery doesn't last as long
but<00:04:52.990> it<00:04:53.289> still<00:04:53.560> works<00:04:53.770> really<00:04:53.919> well<00:04:54.129> I<00:04:54.189> use<00:04:54.430> it
