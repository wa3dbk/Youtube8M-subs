bronzer<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.030> something<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.720> I<00:00:36.900> would

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
bronzer is something that I would

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.130 
bronzer is something that I would
recommend<00:00:37.590> using<00:00:38.190> either<00:00:38.940> instead<00:00:39.720> of<00:00:39.870> blush

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
recommend using either instead of blush

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.280 
recommend using either instead of blush
or<00:00:40.530> if<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.130> do<00:00:41.340> use<00:00:41.550> blush<00:00:42.330> use<00:00:42.990> it<00:00:43.140> after

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
or if you do use blush use it after

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.230 
or if you do use blush use it after
blush<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.220> that<00:00:44.430> way<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.670> will<00:00:44.880> end<00:00:45.120> up

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:45.240 
blush and that way you will end up

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.910 
blush and that way you will end up
looking<00:00:45.570> like<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.900> have<00:00:46.050> too<00:00:46.230> much<00:00:46.380> color<00:00:46.680> on

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
looking like you have too much color on

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.810 
looking like you have too much color on
the<00:00:47.040> skin<00:00:47.690> the<00:00:48.690> ideal<00:00:49.380> way<00:00:49.740> to<00:00:50.070> apply<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
the skin the ideal way to apply the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.030 
the skin the ideal way to apply the
bronzer<00:00:51.150> is<00:00:51.450> to<00:00:51.630> take<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.810> big<00:00:52.200> nice<00:00:52.590> fluffy

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
bronzer is to take a big nice fluffy

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.110 
bronzer is to take a big nice fluffy
brush<00:00:53.400> like<00:00:53.730> this<00:00:53.760> one<00:00:55.160> that<00:00:56.160> way<00:00:56.490> it<00:00:56.790> avoids

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
brush like this one that way it avoids

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.030 
brush like this one that way it avoids
the<00:00:57.390> streaky<00:00:57.990> look<00:00:58.200> if<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.530> use<00:00:58.650> a<00:00:58.680> brush

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
the streaky look if you use a brush

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.160 
the streaky look if you use a brush
that's<00:00:59.100> too<00:00:59.550> small<00:00:59.790> you<00:01:00.510> can<00:01:00.660> end<00:01:00.810> up<00:01:00.900> looking

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
that's too small you can end up looking

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.540 
that's too small you can end up looking
like<00:01:01.200> you<00:01:01.470> might<00:01:01.620> have<00:01:01.650> stripes<00:01:02.070> on<00:01:02.250> your<00:01:02.370> face

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
like you might have stripes on your face

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.460 
like you might have stripes on your face
so<00:01:03.060> just<00:01:03.270> get<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.450> little<00:01:03.600> bit<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.019> kind<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.260> tap

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
so just get a little bit and kind of tap

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.770 
so just get a little bit and kind of tap
off<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.739> excess<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.729> we're<00:01:06.390> just<00:01:06.509> going<00:01:06.630> to

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
off the excess and we're just going to

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.760 
off the excess and we're just going to
sweep<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.350> across<00:01:07.469> the<00:01:07.740> skin<00:01:08.399> I<00:01:09.619> like<00:01:10.619> to

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
sweep it across the skin I like to

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.310 
sweep it across the skin I like to
concentrate<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.579> on<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.450> areas<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.020> skin

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
concentrate it on the areas of the skin

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.609 
concentrate it on the areas of the skin
where<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.490> Sun<00:01:14.759> naturally<00:01:15.359> hits<00:01:15.630> if<00:01:15.899> you're

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
where the Sun naturally hits if you're

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.090 
where the Sun naturally hits if you're
outside<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:17.609> that<00:01:17.789> would<00:01:17.969> be<00:01:17.999> the<00:01:18.149> forehead

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
outside so that would be the forehead

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.859 
outside so that would be the forehead
maybe<00:01:20.100> just<00:01:20.399> a<00:01:20.520> little<00:01:20.700> bit<00:01:20.880> down<00:01:21.119> on<00:01:21.179> the<00:01:21.509> chin

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
maybe just a little bit down on the chin

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.249 
maybe just a little bit down on the chin
and<00:01:22.969> then<00:01:23.969> you<00:01:24.090> can<00:01:24.270> use<00:01:24.420> just<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.749> little<00:01:25.109> bit

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
and then you can use just a little bit

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.050 
and then you can use just a little bit
on<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.590> cheek<00:01:25.890> bones<00:01:26.130> but<00:01:26.399> be<00:01:26.579> very<00:01:26.609> careful

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
on the cheek bones but be very careful

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.529 
on the cheek bones but be very careful
here<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:28.109> you're<00:01:28.229> not<00:01:28.350> applying<00:01:28.619> too<00:01:29.070> much

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
here that you're not applying too much

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.870 
here that you're not applying too much
another<00:01:30.539> quick<00:01:30.810> tip<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.280> can<00:01:32.520> apply

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
another quick tip is that you can apply

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.090 
another quick tip is that you can apply
the<00:01:33.030> bronzer<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:34.140> slightly<00:01:35.149> under<00:01:37.100> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
the bronzer just slightly under the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.639 
the bronzer just slightly under the
blush<00:01:38.429> area<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.149> it<00:01:39.569> helps<00:01:39.899> to<00:01:40.049> create<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.380> nice

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
blush area and it helps to create a nice

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.529 
blush area and it helps to create a nice
hollow<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.219> the<00:01:41.490> cheek<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:41.789> it<00:01:42.060> really<00:01:42.210> helps

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
hollow to the cheek and it really helps

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:48.859 
hollow to the cheek and it really helps
to<00:01:42.630> define<00:01:43.079> your<00:01:43.409> cheekbones<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:47.600> again<00:01:48.600> I

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
to define your cheekbones and again I

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.069 
to define your cheekbones and again I
like<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.560> use<00:01:49.710> bronzer<00:01:50.420> sometimes<00:01:51.420> as<00:01:51.600> my<00:01:51.749> last

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
like to use bronzer sometimes as my last

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.679 
like to use bronzer sometimes as my last
step<00:01:52.619> before<00:01:52.979> I'm<00:01:53.369> stepping<00:01:53.850> out<00:01:53.999> so<00:01:54.329> do<00:01:54.479> all

of your makeup and just add a little bit

of your makeup and just add a little bit
at<00:01:57.389> the<00:01:57.420> last<00:01:57.749> moment<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.649> then<00:01:59.039> you'll<00:01:59.219> be

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
at the last moment and then you'll be

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.940 
at the last moment and then you'll be
fine<00:01:59.639> you<00:01:59.850> won't<00:01:59.880> have<00:02:00.209> overkill<00:02:00.950> don't

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
fine you won't have overkill don't

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.179 
fine you won't have overkill don't
forget<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.459> neck<00:02:02.609> area<00:02:02.819> either<00:02:03.920> just<00:02:04.920> maybe<00:02:05.069> a

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
forget the neck area either just maybe a

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:11.000 
forget the neck area either just maybe a
little<00:02:05.459> bit<00:02:05.670> on<00:02:05.819> either<00:02:06.030> side

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.410 

there's<00:02:12.010> a<00:02:12.099> lot<00:02:12.310> of<00:02:12.340> liquid<00:02:12.819> bronzers<00:02:13.239> out

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
there's a lot of liquid bronzers out

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.780 
there's a lot of liquid bronzers out
there<00:02:13.599> those<00:02:13.780> are<00:02:13.959> fantastic<00:02:14.139> as<00:02:14.769> well<00:02:14.799> but

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
there those are fantastic as well but

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.209 
there those are fantastic as well but
for<00:02:16.659> my<00:02:16.780> money<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:17.079> think<00:02:17.349> a<00:02:17.439> powder<00:02:17.680> is<00:02:17.889> much

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:18.219 
for my money I think a powder is much

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:21.089 
for my money I think a powder is much
easier<00:02:18.249> to<00:02:18.969> use<00:02:19.329> and<00:02:19.599> much<00:02:20.200> easier<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.829> control

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
easier to use and much easier to control

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.550 
easier to use and much easier to control
as<00:02:21.579> well<00:02:23.969> fantastic<00:02:24.969> now<00:02:25.900> she<00:02:25.959> has<00:02:26.139> a<00:02:26.230> bronze

healthy<00:02:26.980> glow
