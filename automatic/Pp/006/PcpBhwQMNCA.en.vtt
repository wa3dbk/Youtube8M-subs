00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:19.859 

Oh

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.240 

now<00:00:20.869> if<00:00:20.960> you<00:00:21.080> fail<00:00:21.350> the<00:00:21.529> fuel<00:00:21.710> pressure<00:00:21.949> test

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
now if you fail the fuel pressure test

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.120 
now if you fail the fuel pressure test
like<00:00:22.460> I<00:00:22.610> did<00:00:22.939> in<00:00:23.150> a<00:00:23.240> previous<00:00:23.390> video<00:00:23.779> the<00:00:24.740> very

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
like I did in a previous video the very

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.740 
like I did in a previous video the very
next<00:00:25.430> step<00:00:25.610> the<00:00:25.849> immediate<00:00:26.300> next<00:00:26.450> step<00:00:26.720> that

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
next step the immediate next step that

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.630 
next step the immediate next step that
you're<00:00:26.960> going<00:00:27.110> to<00:00:27.200> do<00:00:27.349> is<00:00:27.890> a<00:00:27.950> fuel<00:00:28.369> pressure

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
you're going to do is a fuel pressure

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.060 
you're going to do is a fuel pressure
regulator<00:00:29.180> hold<00:00:29.869> test<00:00:30.230> so<00:00:30.650> what<00:00:30.770> you<00:00:30.860> do<00:00:30.950> is

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
regulator hold test so what you do is

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.710 
regulator hold test so what you do is
you<00:00:31.160> start<00:00:31.310> the<00:00:31.490> car<00:00:31.640> pinch<00:00:31.910> off<00:00:32.059> the<00:00:32.270> return

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
you start the car pinch off the return

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.450 
you start the car pinch off the return
line<00:00:32.960> and<00:00:33.200> then<00:00:33.590> wait<00:00:33.800> five<00:00:34.010> minutes<00:00:34.190> it's

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
line and then wait five minutes it's

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.979 
line and then wait five minutes it's
basically<00:00:34.730> the<00:00:34.879> same<00:00:35.000> exact<00:00:35.360> test<00:00:35.600> except

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
basically the same exact test except

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:37.330 
basically the same exact test except
you're<00:00:36.110> pinching<00:00:36.379> off<00:00:36.530> the<00:00:36.680> return<00:00:36.949> line<00:00:37.160> is

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
you're pinching off the return line is

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.070 
you're pinching off the return line is
this<00:00:37.820> going<00:00:38.090> to<00:00:38.150> be<00:00:38.239> pinched<00:00:38.570> off<00:00:38.720> enough<00:00:39.050> to

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
this going to be pinched off enough to

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.160 
this going to be pinched off enough to
not<00:00:39.680> allow<00:00:40.010> bleed<00:00:40.340> through<00:00:40.580> I<00:00:41.080> don't<00:00:42.080> know

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
not allow bleed through I don't know

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.430 
not allow bleed through I don't know
we'll<00:00:42.440> find<00:00:42.650> out<00:00:42.769> and<00:00:43.040> again<00:00:43.519> I<00:00:43.580> have<00:00:43.910> my

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
we'll find out and again I have my

to<00:01:03.409> find<00:01:03.680> your<00:01:04.580> fuel<00:01:05.239> pump<00:01:05.360> in<00:01:05.630> which<00:01:05.810> I

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
to find your fuel pump in which I

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.300 
to find your fuel pump in which I
believe<00:01:06.200> is<00:01:06.409> the<00:01:07.810> defendant<00:01:08.810> f<00:01:08.990> en<00:01:09.260> pin<00:01:09.979> and

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
believe is the defendant f en pin and

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.060 
believe is the defendant f en pin and
ground<00:01:10.880> so<00:01:11.510> you<00:01:11.570> round<00:01:12.229> that<00:01:12.409> directly<00:01:12.830> to

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
ground so you round that directly to

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.880 
ground so you round that directly to
body<00:01:13.460> ground<00:01:13.909> and<00:01:14.210> then<00:01:14.450> jumper<00:01:15.080> this<00:01:15.470> side<00:01:15.740> of

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
body ground and then jumper this side of

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.609 
body ground and then jumper this side of
the<00:01:15.950> pen<00:01:16.130> with<00:01:16.310> use<00:01:16.670> a<00:01:16.700> t<00:01:16.939> pin<00:01:17.150> into<00:01:18.080> the<00:01:18.110> Fenton

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
the pen with use a t pin into the Fenton

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.289 
the pen with use a t pin into the Fenton
make<00:01:19.040> sure<00:01:19.189> that<00:01:19.340> you<00:01:19.490> look<00:01:19.640> up<00:01:19.790> your<00:01:19.909> factory

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
make sure that you look up your factory

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:21.940 
make sure that you look up your factory
specs<00:01:20.600> to<00:01:21.110> ensure<00:01:21.380> that<00:01:21.530> that's<00:01:21.680> how<00:01:21.890> you

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
specs to ensure that that's how you

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.679 
specs to ensure that that's how you
operate<00:01:22.399> your<00:01:22.549> fuel<00:01:22.759> pump<00:01:22.969> and<00:01:23.210> this<00:01:23.509> is

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
operate your fuel pump and this is

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.419 
operate your fuel pump and this is
basically<00:01:24.020> in<00:01:24.170> diagnostic<00:01:24.829> mode<00:01:24.979> so<00:01:25.159> that<00:01:25.280> all

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:25.429 
basically in diagnostic mode so that all

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:27.219 
basically in diagnostic mode so that all
I<00:01:25.460> have<00:01:25.700> to<00:01:25.759> do<00:01:25.909> is<00:01:26.119> turn<00:01:26.359> on<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.600> key<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:27.140> the

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
I have to do is turn on the key and the

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.069 
I have to do is turn on the key and the
fuel<00:01:27.500> pump<00:01:27.710> will<00:01:27.890> continue<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:29.479> operate<00:01:29.869> you

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
fuel pump will continue to operate you

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.260 
fuel pump will continue to operate you
know<00:01:30.109> just<00:01:30.380> continual<00:01:31.130> pressure<00:01:31.399> and<00:01:32.119> that's

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
know just continual pressure and that's

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.039 
know just continual pressure and that's
what<00:01:32.479> this<00:01:32.600> is<00:01:32.659> about

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
what this is about

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.389 
what this is about
you're<00:01:33.530> not<00:01:33.649> going<00:01:33.799> to<00:01:33.859> be<00:01:33.920> able<00:01:33.979> to<00:01:34.100> hear<00:01:34.310> it

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
you're not going to be able to hear it

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:35.739 
you're not going to be able to hear it
you<00:01:34.490> might<00:01:34.640> hear<00:01:34.820> some<00:01:34.999> solenoids<00:01:35.450> click<00:01:35.630> or

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:35.749 
you might hear some solenoids click or

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:36.849 
you might hear some solenoids click or
something<00:01:36.020> like<00:01:36.109> that<00:01:36.170> when<00:01:36.499> I<00:01:36.530> turn<00:01:36.740> it<00:01:36.770> to

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
something like that when I turn it to

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:38.620 
something like that when I turn it to
the<00:01:37.039> off<00:01:37.130> position<00:01:37.210> then<00:01:38.210> I'm<00:01:38.299> going<00:01:38.420> to<00:01:38.450> come

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
the off position then I'm going to come

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.810 
the off position then I'm going to come
clamp<00:01:38.899> that<00:01:38.960> hose<00:01:39.200> off<00:01:39.409> you<00:01:39.979> will<00:01:40.130> also<00:01:40.490> notice

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
clamp that hose off you will also notice

00:01:40.820 --> 00:02:00.529 
clamp that hose off you will also notice
that<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:41.740> that<00:01:42.740> the<00:01:42.859> gauge<00:01:43.070> will<00:01:43.369> rise

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:07.109 

so<00:02:01.539> we're<00:02:01.689> going<00:02:01.780> to<00:02:01.840> wait<00:02:02.020> until<00:02:06.030> it's<00:02:07.030> the

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
so we're going to wait until it's the

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.280 
so we're going to wait until it's the
max<00:02:07.390> pressure<00:02:09.599> trying<00:02:10.599> to<00:02:10.660> find<00:02:10.840> a<00:02:10.929> way<00:02:11.049> to<00:02:11.110> get

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
max pressure trying to find a way to get

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:18.220 
max pressure trying to find a way to get
in<00:02:11.470> here<00:02:12.480> clamp<00:02:13.480> this<00:02:13.690> who's

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.920 

try<00:02:19.230> something<00:02:19.500> like<00:02:19.620> that<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:21.060> then<00:02:21.299> pull

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
try something like that and then pull

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.789 
try something like that and then pull
your<00:02:22.019> jumper<00:02:23.780> so<00:02:24.780> that<00:02:24.930> should<00:02:25.170> disengage<00:02:25.530> the

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
your jumper so that should disengage the

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.490 
your jumper so that should disengage the
fuel<00:02:26.010> pump<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.480> shouldn't<00:02:27.480> be<00:02:27.599> any<00:02:28.200> bleed

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
fuel pump and shouldn't be any bleed

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.920 
fuel pump and shouldn't be any bleed
down<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:29.040> I'm<00:02:29.159> getting<00:02:29.280> bleed<00:02:29.549> down<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:30.060> lot<00:02:30.750> of

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
down and I'm getting bleed down a lot of

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.750 
down and I'm getting bleed down a lot of
bleed<00:02:31.140> downs<00:02:31.379> that's<00:02:31.889> too<00:02:32.099> quick<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:32.579> have

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
bleed downs that's too quick I have

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.000 
bleed downs that's too quick I have
these<00:02:33.239> they're<00:02:33.659> straight<00:02:33.989> JA<00:02:34.230> but<00:02:34.620> as<00:02:34.739> you<00:02:34.889> can

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
these they're straight JA but as you can

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.509 
these they're straight JA but as you can
see<00:02:35.219> they're<00:02:35.400> too<00:02:35.670> large<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.480> fit<00:02:37.219> any<00:02:38.219> rubber

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
see they're too large to fit any rubber

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:39.800 
see they're too large to fit any rubber
hose<00:02:38.670> off<00:02:38.909> so<00:02:39.060> I'm<00:02:39.120> going<00:02:39.239> to<00:02:39.269> end<00:02:39.389> up<00:02:39.450> marring

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
hose off so I'm going to end up marring

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.170 
hose off so I'm going to end up marring
that<00:02:39.989> when<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:40.709> clamp<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.639> there's<00:02:41.909> still<00:02:42.030> a

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
that when I clamp it and there's still a

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.959 
that when I clamp it and there's still a
little<00:02:42.359> bit<00:02:42.540> of<00:02:42.629> space<00:02:42.840> in<00:02:43.049> there<00:02:43.670> you<00:02:44.670> connect

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:44.969 
little bit of space in there you connect

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:55.610 
little bit of space in there you connect
your<00:02:45.090> jumper<00:02:50.720> goes<00:02:51.720> on<00:02:51.959> body<00:02:52.349> ground

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.030 

as<00:02:56.159> soon<00:02:56.280> as<00:02:56.310> you<00:02:56.430> put<00:02:56.549> it<00:02:56.640> on<00:02:56.700> body<00:02:56.909> ground

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
as soon as you put it on body ground

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.589 
as soon as you put it on body ground
that<00:02:59.040> starts<00:02:59.370> raising<00:02:59.700> up<00:03:01.909> see<00:03:02.909> how<00:03:03.000> high

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
that starts raising up see how high

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.170 
that starts raising up see how high
what's<00:03:03.870> my<00:03:04.049> max<00:03:04.319> pressure<00:03:04.680> at<00:03:04.980> yeah<00:03:05.879> just

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
what's my max pressure at yeah just

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.160 
what's my max pressure at yeah just
about<00:03:06.390> square<00:03:06.659> on<00:03:06.780> 25<00:03:08.690> all<00:03:09.690> right

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
about square on 25 all right

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.259 
about square on 25 all right
see<00:03:11.099> if<00:03:11.190> this<00:03:11.340> works<00:03:11.580> that's<00:03:11.790> clamped<00:03:12.150> off

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
see if this works that's clamped off

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:24.030 
see if this works that's clamped off
pretty<00:03:12.480> well<00:03:14.420> nope<00:03:22.430> regular

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
pretty well nope regular

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.980 

let's<00:03:36.830> see<00:03:36.980> if<00:03:37.100> I<00:03:37.190> can<00:03:37.370> plug<00:03:37.610> that

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.490 

okay

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
okay

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.940 
okay

unlike standard Anderson

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.710 
unlike standard Anderson
at<00:03:48.160> a<00:03:48.190> port<00:03:48.520> I<00:03:48.700> take<00:03:49.060> a<00:03:49.090> couple<00:03:49.330> minutes

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720

and<00:03:54.680> that<00:03:55.690> part<00:03:56.690> now<00:03:56.870> fuel

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:29.629 

might<00:04:00.430> be<00:04:00.640> very<00:04:01.000> well<00:04:01.240> my<00:04:01.450> case

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.520 

my<00:04:30.180> fuel<00:04:30.419> pressure<00:04:30.599> regulator<00:04:30.900> has<00:04:31.259> failed

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
my fuel pressure regulator has failed

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.219 
my fuel pressure regulator has failed
this<00:04:31.710> test<00:04:32.210> so<00:04:33.210> I'm<00:04:33.629> gonna<00:04:33.780> have<00:04:33.930> to<00:04:34.020> replace

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
this test so I'm gonna have to replace

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:35.779 
this test so I'm gonna have to replace
that<00:04:34.319> so<00:04:34.800> that's<00:04:34.979> all<00:04:35.099> there<00:04:35.189> is<00:04:35.250> to<00:04:35.400> this<00:04:35.520> test

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
that so that's all there is to this test

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.110 
that so that's all there is to this test
it's<00:04:36.389> pretty<00:04:36.569> easy<00:04:36.750> pretty<00:04:37.139> straightforward

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
it's pretty easy pretty straightforward
