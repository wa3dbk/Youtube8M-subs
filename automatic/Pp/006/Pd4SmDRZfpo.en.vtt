I'm<00:01:31.020> kidding<00:01:31.680> me<00:01:32.240> that's<00:01:33.240> how<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:34.020> begins

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
I'm kidding me that's how it begins

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.219 
I'm kidding me that's how it begins
either<00:01:34.890> buddies<00:01:35.280> y'all<00:01:36.180> keep<00:01:36.540> them<00:01:36.780> throwing

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
either buddies y'all keep them throwing

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.069 
either buddies y'all keep them throwing
balls<00:01:37.530> around<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.250> well<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.150> it's<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.689> Kaiser

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
balls around in well so it's a Kaiser

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.940 
balls around in well so it's a Kaiser
like<00:01:40.470> level<00:01:41.180> that's<00:01:42.180> great<00:01:43.159> just<00:01:44.159> fantastic

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
like level that's great just fantastic

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.670 
like level that's great just fantastic
this<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.280> really<00:01:48.060> how<00:01:48.420> we're<00:01:48.780> starting<00:01:49.439> this

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
this is really how we're starting this

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.609 
this is really how we're starting this
spring<00:01:50.640> indeed<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:52.670> maybe<00:01:54.079> that's<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.320> best

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
spring indeed so maybe that's the best

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.140 
spring indeed so maybe that's the best
solution<00:01:56.310> for<00:01:56.610> all<00:01:57.240> your<00:01:57.950> environments

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
solution for all your environments

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.760 
solution for all your environments
maybe<00:02:01.150> I<00:02:01.270> should<00:02:01.540> put<00:02:01.570> a<00:02:01.780> hoops<00:02:02.260> that's<00:02:02.560> right

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
maybe I should put a hoops that's right

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.070 
maybe I should put a hoops that's right
I'm<00:02:02.920> supposed<00:02:03.070> to<00:02:03.430> go<00:02:03.670> somewhere<00:02:04.000> this<00:02:04.870> is

going pretty well and also will make a

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.560 
going pretty well and also will make a
wonderful<00:02:08.230> level<00:02:08.890> I<00:02:09.130> can<00:02:09.340> tell<00:02:09.760> there's<00:02:10.480> a

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
wonderful level I can tell there's a

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.370 
wonderful level I can tell there's a
reason

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
reason

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.220

and<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:22.510> YouTube<00:02:22.990> level<00:02:23.530> as<00:02:23.860> possible<00:02:24.750> possible

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
and a YouTube level as possible possible

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.530 
and a YouTube level as possible possible
we<00:02:26.320> like<00:02:26.770> p.m.<00:02:27.220> me<00:02:27.460> tell<00:02:27.820> me<00:02:27.970> that<00:02:28.000> you<00:02:28.330> the

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
we like p.m. me tell me that you the

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.890 
we like p.m. me tell me that you the
good<00:02:28.660> level<00:02:29.020> is<00:02:29.170> part<00:02:30.070> well<00:02:30.910> there's<00:02:31.450> no<00:02:31.630> wall

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
good level is part well there's no wall

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.290 
good level is part well there's no wall
zo<00:02:32.260> she's<00:02:32.680> so<00:02:32.950> it's<00:02:33.130> hard<00:02:33.370> not<00:02:33.550> to<00:02:33.610> break<00:02:33.910> into

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
zo she's so it's hard not to break into

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.370 
zo she's so it's hard not to break into
it<00:02:34.510> this<00:02:35.260> is<00:02:35.500> why<00:02:35.650> society<00:02:36.060> invented<00:02:37.060> walls

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
it this is why society invented walls

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.470 
it this is why society invented walls
and<00:02:38.380> so<00:02:38.650> then<00:02:39.040> we<00:02:39.220> could<00:02:39.430> stop<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.970> cry<00:02:40.270> at

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
and so then we could stop to cry at

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.350 
and so then we could stop to cry at
nights<00:02:40.920> I'm<00:02:41.920> pretty<00:02:42.310> sure<00:02:42.610> I<00:02:45.060> wondered<00:02:46.060> if<00:02:46.240> it

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
nights I'm pretty sure I wondered if it

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.810 
nights I'm pretty sure I wondered if it
would<00:02:46.540> have<00:02:46.630> been<00:02:46.780> feasible<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:48.370> just<00:02:48.550> kind<00:02:48.730> of

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
would have been feasible to just kind of

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.930 
would have been feasible to just kind of
slip<00:02:49.030> in<00:02:49.060> after<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.600> balls<00:02:50.490> be<00:02:51.490> a<00:02:51.520> lot<00:02:51.760> more

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
slip in after the balls be a lot more

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.700 
slip in after the balls be a lot more
doable<00:02:52.240> than<00:02:52.330> outrunning<00:02:53.020> the<00:02:53.170> shell<00:02:53.440> that's

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
doable than outrunning the shell that's

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:54.330 
doable than outrunning the shell that's
for<00:02:53.890> sure

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
for sure

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.950 
for sure
let's<00:02:55.270> try<00:02:55.840> it<00:02:55.900> out<00:02:56.260> by<00:02:57.060> snorkeling<00:02:58.060> yeah<00:02:58.900> you

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
let's try it out by snorkeling yeah you

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.350 
let's try it out by snorkeling yeah you
can<00:02:59.380> do<00:02:59.530> that<00:02:59.680> okay<00:03:00.040> I'm<00:03:00.280> going<00:03:00.850> to<00:03:00.940> assume

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
can do that okay I'm going to assume

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.860 
can do that okay I'm going to assume
that<00:03:01.420> was<00:03:02.170> on<00:03:02.590> purpose<00:03:02.950> for<00:03:03.460> some<00:03:03.850> reason<00:03:04.330> and

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
that was on purpose for some reason and

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.360 
that was on purpose for some reason and
now<00:03:05.200> I<00:03:05.230> don't<00:03:05.800> know<00:03:06.100> where<00:03:06.459> I'm<00:03:06.820> at<00:03:07.530> I'm<00:03:08.530> above

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
now I don't know where I'm at I'm above

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.510 
now I don't know where I'm at I'm above
the<00:03:09.670> world<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.390> I'm<00:03:10.690> building<00:03:11.050> a<00:03:11.620> bridge<00:03:12.100> and
