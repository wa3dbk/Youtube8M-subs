standard board in the set and he wanted

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.950 
standard board in the set and he wanted
to<00:00:39.460> add<00:00:39.580> the<00:00:39.760> crater<00:00:40.030> board<00:00:40.360> which<00:00:40.540> has<00:00:40.720> been

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
to add the crater board which has been

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.619 
to add the crater board which has been
in<00:00:41.559> the<00:00:41.830> verdant<00:00:42.309> board<00:00:42.820> set<00:00:43.120> which<00:00:43.270> is<00:00:43.390> in<00:00:43.510> the

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
in the verdant board set which is in the

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.500

green sort of motif with grasses another

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.139 
green sort of motif with grasses another
foliage<00:00:46.899> so<00:00:47.469> it's<00:00:48.250> an<00:00:48.340> easy<00:00:48.489> thing<00:00:48.789> to<00:00:48.940> shift

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
foliage so it's an easy thing to shift

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.959 
foliage so it's an easy thing to shift
over<00:00:49.390> to<00:00:49.690> match<00:00:49.870> the<00:00:50.079> Martian<00:00:50.469> set<00:00:50.739> and<00:00:50.969> what

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
over to match the Martian set and what

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:53.880 
over to match the Martian set and what
I've<00:00:52.059> done<00:00:52.270> is<00:00:52.660> also<00:00:53.440> I've<00:00:53.530> been<00:00:53.649> kind<00:00:53.829> of

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
I've done is also I've been kind of

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.729 
I've done is also I've been kind of
experimenting<00:00:54.489> with<00:00:54.520> adding<00:00:55.239> blast<00:00:55.739> markers

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
experimenting with adding blast markers

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.029 
experimenting with adding blast markers
blast<00:00:57.550> sort<00:00:57.789> of<00:00:57.879> imagery<00:00:58.270> in<00:00:58.539> the<00:00:58.809> craters<00:00:59.590> by

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
blast sort of imagery in the craters by

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.689 
blast sort of imagery in the craters by
using<00:01:00.250> some<00:01:00.730> weathering<00:01:01.449> powders<00:01:01.930> and<00:01:02.699> i'm

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
using some weathering powders and i'm

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.460 
using some weathering powders and i'm
still<00:01:04.030> perfecting<00:01:04.629> i<00:01:04.989> think<00:01:05.170> this<00:01:05.259> looks<00:01:05.410> a

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
still perfecting i think this looks a

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.570 
still perfecting i think this looks a
little<00:01:05.560> bit<00:01:05.710> better<00:01:05.800> than<00:01:06.070> some<00:01:06.310> of<00:01:06.399> the<00:01:06.460> ones

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
little bit better than some of the ones

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.680 
little bit better than some of the ones
i've<00:01:06.729> done<00:01:06.880> the<00:01:07.000> past<00:01:07.210> I've<00:01:07.420> really<00:01:07.600> been

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
i've done the past I've really been

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:08.880 
i've done the past I've really been
trying<00:01:07.840> to<00:01:08.020> dark<00:01:08.229> in<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.440> center<00:01:08.649> and<00:01:08.770> give

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
trying to dark in the center and give

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.490 
trying to dark in the center and give
that<00:01:09.039> radial<00:01:09.820> spray<00:01:10.210> look<00:01:10.539> that<00:01:10.990> you<00:01:11.200> know<00:01:11.350> as

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
that radial spray look that you know as

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.680 
that radial spray look that you know as
pieces<00:01:12.220> of<00:01:12.340> debris<00:01:12.460> have<00:01:12.759> flown<00:01:13.149> out<00:01:13.390> they've

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
pieces of debris have flown out they've

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.380 
pieces of debris have flown out they've
left<00:01:13.930> scorch<00:01:14.320> marks<00:01:14.679> and<00:01:14.890> you<00:01:15.819> can<00:01:15.970> see<00:01:16.179> how

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
left scorch marks and you can see how

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.680 
left scorch marks and you can see how
that<00:01:16.420> is<00:01:16.599> in<00:01:17.080> its<00:01:17.200> current<00:01:17.410> state<00:01:17.560> and<00:01:18.420> also<00:01:19.420> he

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
that is in its current state and also he

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.630 
that is in its current state and also he
wanted<00:01:20.349> me<00:01:20.470> to<00:01:20.500> make<00:01:20.709> a<00:01:20.770> set<00:01:21.099> of<00:01:21.280> jungle

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
wanted me to make a set of jungle

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.430 
wanted me to make a set of jungle
foliage<00:01:21.819> to<00:01:22.270> match<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:22.630> Martian<00:01:22.990> board<00:01:23.200> set

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
foliage to match the Martian board set

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.449 
foliage to match the Martian board set
so<00:01:23.619> I<00:01:23.649> based<00:01:24.069> it<00:01:24.310> on<00:01:24.750> some<00:01:25.750> foam<00:01:26.020> to<00:01:26.530> allow<00:01:27.280> me

00:01:27.449 --> 00:01:27.459 
so I based it on some foam to allow me

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:30.359 
so I based it on some foam to allow me
to<00:01:27.780> implant<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:28.959> foliage<00:01:29.319> into<00:01:29.800> the<00:01:29.890> base<00:01:30.069> and

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
to implant the foliage into the base and

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.910 
to implant the foliage into the base and
then<00:01:30.880> then<00:01:31.090> my<00:01:31.240> typical<00:01:31.810> jungle<00:01:32.440> scheme<00:01:32.679> which

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
then then my typical jungle scheme which

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.639 
then then my typical jungle scheme which
involves<00:01:33.459> Oh<00:01:33.780> picking<00:01:34.780> from<00:01:34.990> over<00:01:35.380> a<00:01:35.410> dozen

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
involves Oh picking from over a dozen

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.540 
involves Oh picking from over a dozen
different<00:01:35.950> kinds<00:01:36.610> of<00:01:37.619> artificial<00:01:38.619> foliage<00:01:39.069> to

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
different kinds of artificial foliage to

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.859 
different kinds of artificial foliage to
give<00:01:40.030> it<00:01:40.179> a<00:01:40.360> very<00:01:40.569> dense<00:01:40.959> very<00:01:41.170> varied<00:01:42.869> what's

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
give it a very dense very varied what's

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.510 
give it a very dense very varied what's
the<00:01:43.959> word<00:01:44.110> I'm<00:01:44.170> looking<00:01:44.229> for<00:01:44.520> biologically

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
the word I'm looking for biologically

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.449 
the word I'm looking for biologically
rich<00:01:45.929> sort<00:01:46.929> of<00:01:47.020> piece<00:01:47.229> he's<00:01:48.190> actually

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
rich sort of piece he's actually

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:50.430 
rich sort of piece he's actually
produced<00:01:48.970> some<00:01:49.149> jungle<00:01:49.390> foliage<00:01:49.630> for<00:01:50.050> his<00:01:50.200> own

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
highlights in them to sort of break that

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.880 
highlights in them to sort of break that
up<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:57.640> give<00:02:58.480> it<00:02:58.630> a<00:02:58.660> more<00:02:59.170> interesting<00:02:59.440> visual

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
up and give it a more interesting visual

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.070 
up and give it a more interesting visual
appeal<00:03:00.100> so<00:03:00.730> what<00:03:00.910> I<00:03:00.940> did<00:03:01.150> then<00:03:01.360> is<00:03:01.540> I<00:03:01.690> sort<00:03:01.990> of

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
appeal so what I did then is I sort of

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.810 
appeal so what I did then is I sort of
modified<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.500> color<00:03:02.709> of<00:03:02.800> the<00:03:02.980> rocks<00:03:03.190> brought

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
modified the color of the rocks brought

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.250 
modified the color of the rocks brought
them<00:03:04.000> up<00:03:04.150> to<00:03:04.300> be<00:03:04.390> a<00:03:04.420> little<00:03:04.630> bit<00:03:04.720> brighter<00:03:04.900> so

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
them up to be a little bit brighter so

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.170 
them up to be a little bit brighter so
they<00:03:05.380> stand<00:03:05.680> out<00:03:05.920> from<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.280> overall<00:03:06.700> base

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
they stand out from the overall base

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.570 
they stand out from the overall base
color<00:03:07.570> which<00:03:08.110> I've<00:03:08.260> done<00:03:08.440> with<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.800> Mesa<00:03:09.190> as

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
color which I've done with the Mesa as

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.330 
color which I've done with the Mesa as
well<00:03:09.880> the<00:03:10.510> mine<00:03:10.840> opening<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.500> I<00:03:11.980> did<00:03:12.130> a<00:03:12.160> little

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
well the mine opening and I did a little

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.370 
well the mine opening and I did a little
experimenting<00:03:12.880> with<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.480> colors<00:03:14.110> I've<00:03:14.260> been

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
experimenting with the colors I've been

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.150 
experimenting with the colors I've been
trying<00:03:14.680> to<00:03:14.800> use<00:03:15.010> a<00:03:15.390> stain<00:03:16.390> on<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:17.260> wood<00:03:17.470> which

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
trying to use a stain on the wood which

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.710 
trying to use a stain on the wood which
it<00:03:18.400> didn't<00:03:18.640> really<00:03:18.760> come<00:03:18.850> out<00:03:19.060> dark<00:03:19.330> enough<00:03:19.540> so

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
it didn't really come out dark enough so

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.540 
it didn't really come out dark enough so
I<00:03:19.750> actually<00:03:19.900> went<00:03:20.140> back<00:03:20.350> over<00:03:20.380> it<00:03:20.860> and<00:03:21.010> re

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
I actually went back over it and re

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.100 
I actually went back over it and re
highlighted<00:03:22.209> it<00:03:22.360> with<00:03:22.390> some<00:03:22.750> de<00:03:22.870> louvre<00:03:22.990> in

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
highlighted it with some de louvre in

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.620 
highlighted it with some de louvre in
mud<00:03:23.380> from<00:03:23.590> GW<00:03:24.160> and<00:03:24.340> then<00:03:24.730> use<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.240> weathering

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
mud from GW and then use the weathering

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.979 
mud from GW and then use the weathering
stain<00:03:25.900> that<00:03:25.930> i<00:03:26.140> purchased<00:03:26.670> as<00:03:27.670> a<00:03:27.810> final<00:03:28.810> wash

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
stain that i purchased as a final wash

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.720 
stain that i purchased as a final wash
over<00:03:29.560> that<00:03:29.709> and<00:03:29.950> i<00:03:30.010> think<00:03:30.190> it<00:03:30.250> gave<00:03:30.370> it<00:03:30.489> a<00:03:30.550> very

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
over that and i think it gave it a very

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.910 
over that and i think it gave it a very
nice<00:03:31.000> effect<00:03:31.420> i<00:03:31.540> chipped<00:03:32.170> it<00:03:32.290> a<00:03:32.350> little<00:03:32.500> bit<00:03:32.709> to

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
nice effect i chipped it a little bit to

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.590 
nice effect i chipped it a little bit to
give<00:03:33.160> it<00:03:33.250> a<00:03:33.340> more<00:03:33.670> of<00:03:33.760> a<00:03:33.820> warrant<00:03:34.180> appearance

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
give it a more of a warrant appearance

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.180 
give it a more of a warrant appearance
and<00:03:34.780> then<00:03:35.230> some<00:03:35.440> of<00:03:35.560> that<00:03:35.650> de<00:03:35.769> louvre<00:03:35.890> and<00:03:36.010> mud

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
and then some of that de louvre and mud

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.890 
and then some of that de louvre and mud
can<00:03:36.370> fill<00:03:36.610> in<00:03:36.760> there<00:03:36.970> give<00:03:37.180> it<00:03:37.269> some<00:03:37.450> shadows

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
can fill in there give it some shadows

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.900 
can fill in there give it some shadows
some<00:03:38.440> shading<00:03:38.739> that<00:03:38.920> bring<00:03:39.370> out<00:03:39.489> its<00:03:39.640> visual
