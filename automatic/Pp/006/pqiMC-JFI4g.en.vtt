00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:09.980
 here we are in territory 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:12.660
 university and tampa 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:18.119
 it's not far from the city there by here 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:24.269
 Here children learn and not here to say 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:27.920
 gnaw the language of science and of course we have such 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.380
 in childhood there was nothing to do 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.360
 made for children and cheese and every 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.690
 the parent must do the maximum to 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.020
 push out your rising chat like 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.450
 it is possible above the tree evolution seems to me 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.040
 that when our children study in such 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.239
 places 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:51.329
 do you understand that the world is already united and 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:54.570
 people already think completely differently we 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.920
 In principle, we also want to live differently 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.410
 it is necessary to come to this 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.000
 understanding that this is possible and that 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.359
 once certainly not the people did 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.299
 revolution united states of america 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.670
 and did its founding fathers who 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.900
 suddenly wanted freedom opportunity 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.119
 selfish purpose 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.790
 but above all they abandoned 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.820
 taxes they did not want to pay the king 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.490
 taxes and as a result here is such a country in 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.220
 which people go and here I understood the most 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.549
 most important to americans or american 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.229
 corporations need people they lure on 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.659
 its territory is money and brains 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:35.840
 at the same time creating conditions for them 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.079
 development but nonetheless there is a hunt for 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.970
 by people 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:44.220
 here are students from all countries of the world 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.040
 by gathered here go to the market some 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.140
 a couple to study even though holidays are now 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.080
 winter is very cold here 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.460
 and people are freezing to practically learn 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.659
 freeze learn 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.790
 and of course everyone would probably like to 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.610
 such conditions study is certainly not 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:07.090
 just university of kiev 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.130
 i need to buy credits and this is here 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.080
 paid education normal paid 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.320
 education which sooner or later 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.730
 should go and our country and stop 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.830
 people fooling 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.810
 somehow free education which 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.270
 possible to get with free 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.690
 professors so here i am 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.470
 show how paid looks today 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.800
 education and maybe this is the future 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.300
 Ukraine, there may be people 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.400
 wealthy who may metropolitan 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:43.060
 the goal in the end will refuse to pay 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:45.750
 taxes and people want their people to live 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.750
 in such conditions
