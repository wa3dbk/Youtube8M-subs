00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
doesn't work and it started out as see I

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.530 
doesn't work and it started out as see I
can<00:01:22.140> touch<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.500> power<00:01:22.710> button<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:24.180> usually

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
can touch the power button and I usually

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.950 
can touch the power button and I usually
you<00:01:24.840> can<00:01:24.990> unlock<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:26.240> it<00:01:27.240> started<00:01:27.600> not<00:01:27.780> to

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
you can unlock it and it started not to

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.270 
you can unlock it and it started not to
do<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.439> I'd<00:01:28.560> push<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.979> power<00:01:29.159> button

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
do that so I'd push the power button

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.550 
do that so I'd push the power button
then<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.880> wouldn't<00:01:30.119> unlock<00:01:30.450> us<00:01:30.780> what<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.290> fuck

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
then it wouldn't unlock us what the fuck

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.210 
then it wouldn't unlock us what the fuck
and<00:01:32.479> then<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.990> pushed<00:01:34.530> any<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.040> other

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
and then I pushed any of the other

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.580 
and then I pushed any of the other
buttons<00:01:35.520> they<00:01:35.850> call<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.390> home<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:37.259> windows

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
buttons they call the home the windows

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.850

of<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.860> back<00:01:38.009> button<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:39.290> I'd<00:01:40.290> push<00:01:40.530> any<00:01:40.770> of

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
of the back button and I'd push any of

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.530 
of the back button and I'd push any of
these<00:01:40.950> other<00:01:41.280> four<00:01:41.549> buttons<00:01:41.909> other<00:01:42.090> than<00:01:42.329> the

these other four buttons other than the
red<00:01:42.869> power<00:01:43.079> button<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:44.490> would<00:01:44.579> work<00:01:44.700> fine

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
red power button and it would work fine

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.020 
red power button and it would work fine
and<00:01:45.500> that's<00:01:46.500> that's<00:01:47.070> how<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.790> problem

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
and that's that's how this problem

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.319 
and that's that's how this problem
started<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.439> was<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.880> was<00:01:51.119> about

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.050 
started and that I was that was about
like<00:01:51.570> two<00:01:51.990> weeks<00:01:52.259> where<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:53.220> had<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.880> problem

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
and then all of a sudden my touch screen

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.920 
and then all of a sudden my touch screen
just<00:01:58.469> stopped<00:01:58.740> working<00:01:58.860> just<00:01:59.579> completely<00:02:00.479> out

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
just stopped working just completely out

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.550 
just stopped working just completely out
of<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.140> blue<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:02.689> there's<00:02:03.689> still<00:02:04.049> no<00:02:04.259> sign<00:02:04.500> of

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.150 
of the blue and there's still no sign of
helping<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:06.110> randomly<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.409> will<00:02:07.680> start

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
helping it randomly it will start

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.760 
helping it randomly it will start
working<00:02:08.399> like<00:02:09.090> once<00:02:09.539> every<00:02:09.899> two<00:02:10.289> weeks<00:02:10.319> for

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.740 
working like once every two weeks for
about<00:02:11.039> four<00:02:11.400> hours<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:12.030> works

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
about four hours it works

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.520
