00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.759
 7 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:19.759
 7 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:25.560
 nemo 33 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.439
 i'm sitting by the pool of the world brussels 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.800
 that cannot be corresponded 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.340
 to make the training of divers safer and avoiding serious accidents 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.530
 reduce 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.160
 it was the news broadcast it is we live 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.280
 the match was something to achieve 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.600
 but designer in goals yes when you teach people the dikes 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.810
 and that was this number I think 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.080
 typical week is a very nice sport 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.469
 and 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.609
 the circumstances are challenging 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:59.540
 in terms of you but you have 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.820
 from a normal start to a 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.030
 Layers of hot bath they need to reach coal 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.030
 and totally bargain 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.630
 for energy in terms of discipline visibility 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.250
 with obstacles and then we have so many courteous ones 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.880
 he who participated 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.930
 that pool is designed so 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.420
 A bitter one follows 7 and certainly better safety 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.960
 that the bath has different levels what is the shallow end it was 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.940
 deepest part 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.940
 To begin with the surveying is that is one 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.579
 and those for them two meters 50 then the 5 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.060
 and then 10 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.789
 and the last one on normal 33 milk is slightly more than the 82 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.700
 yk 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.420
 what is the inside temperature in the water 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.580
 now the 33 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.980
 how do you get that warm that is pure by heating this winter or pound 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:07.999
 everyone out of here 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:10.699
 and w takes it to cream in the summer 

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:14.059
 you have a birthday for six months 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:18.029
 production year with the sun 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:21.299
 they mean that it took hours so it came to terms literally natural 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.400
 from the air and stick in the water and that is not enough for me 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.020
 an important part of the year we are allowed to get the temperature on to marry that 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.179
 that helps for that 

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:34.439
 I can tm temperature that her children in the winter certainly stomach but that is not 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.269
 Enough for sure we have to do something for a weapon 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.819
 different source of energy 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.059
 then he would go down there is a very nice gift say value the 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:45.159
 solar power and so is spent on bridge 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.619
 part of it also had the big number on it 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:51.069
 That's that number that wasn't so in the hundreds of thousands of heads 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.389
 now that is 200,000 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:59.560
 that 100,000 kilowatts that is perfectly perfectly fastest 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:03.249
 but well the 

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:05.559
 it was just a saving 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:09.120
 The deepest point of the bathtub is in a little bit more than it 

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:12.119
 33 meters 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.069
 a tunnel connects the different levels with each other 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:26.520
 air chambers are sort of good on either side of the corridor 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.520
 her home can be met 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.569
 so 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:41.169
 the 

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:51.259
 beh 

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:54.259
 beh 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.269
 a 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:13.410
 getting in and out 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.679
 happens to be the cook on the top floor 

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:18.679
 just swimming pool at first sight 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:28.129
 just to put about a thousand and whatever and sail it anyway 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:30.809
 main diving area of ​​the effects of europe 

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:34.430
 the church is that in the dutch comes to me 9 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.620
 but the Dutch are coming boom came
