00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
just yet sake I would imagine is going

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.529 
just yet sake I would imagine is going
to<00:00:59.309> be<00:00:59.370> able<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.640> block<00:01:00.000> off<00:01:00.120> any<00:01:00.270> kind<00:01:00.480> of

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
to be able to block off any kind of

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.689 
to be able to block off any kind of
expansion<00:01:01.170> play<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.710> would<00:01:02.039> be<00:01:02.160> surprising<00:01:02.520> to

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
expansion play it would be surprising to

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.429 
expansion play it would be surprising to
see<00:01:02.879> no<00:01:03.030> geo<00:01:03.239> try<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.750> pull<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:03.960> off<00:01:04.110> against

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
see no geo try and pull that off against

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.039 
see no geo try and pull that off against
protoss<00:01:04.830> yeah<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.670> mean<00:01:06.240> I'm<00:01:06.479> not<00:01:06.600> sure<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.930> can

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
protoss yeah I mean I'm not sure you can

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.480 
protoss yeah I mean I'm not sure you can
do<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.290> really<00:01:07.500> but<00:01:07.799> we'll<00:01:07.950> see<00:01:08.130> he<00:01:08.280> might

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
do that really but we'll see he might

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.730 
do that really but we'll see he might
have<00:01:08.790> what<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.689> takes<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.080> do<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.470> if<00:01:10.530> he<00:01:10.619> feels

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
have what it takes to do so if he feels

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.620 
have what it takes to do so if he feels
comfortable<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.460> play<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.060> also<00:01:12.360> here's

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
comfortable this play and also here's

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.910 
comfortable this play and also here's
one<00:01:12.780> behind<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.350> might<00:01:13.530> want<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.710> take<00:01:13.860> a

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
one behind so you might want to take a

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.710 
one behind so you might want to take a
bit<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.310> gamble<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.729> get<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.240> economic

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
bit of a gamble to get that economic

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.179 
bit of a gamble to get that economic
advantage<00:01:16.140> early<00:01:16.229> on<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> possibility

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
advantage early on it is a possibility

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.679 
advantage early on it is a possibility
you<00:01:17.700> could<00:01:17.820> stop<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.180> spawning<00:01:18.390> pool<00:01:18.570> that's

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
you could stop the spawning pool that's

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.940 
you could stop the spawning pool that's
exactly<00:01:19.049> what<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:19.259> going<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.409> do<00:01:19.530> right<00:01:19.740> here

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
to get down a hatchery on 15 and

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.460 
to get down a hatchery on 15 and
depending<00:01:27.450> if<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:27.689> blocked<00:01:27.869> or<00:01:28.110> not<00:01:28.320> will

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
then follow up by an ovoid into gas and

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.929 
then follow up by an ovoid into gas and
we'll<00:01:31.680> have<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.860> see<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.130> sake<00:01:32.490> decide<00:01:32.820> to

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
we'll have to see the sake decide to

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.219 
we'll have to see the sake decide to
plant<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.299> pylon<00:01:33.600> down<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.930> don't<00:01:34.110> actually

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
plant the pylon down I don't actually

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.020 
plant the pylon down I don't actually
like<00:01:34.619> planting<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.369> pile<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.579> down<00:01:35.790> anymore

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
like planting a pile and down anymore

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.910 
like planting a pile and down anymore
because<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.990> kind<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.200> messes<00:01:37.350> up<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.619> build<00:01:37.829> a

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
because it kind of messes up the build a

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.109 
because it kind of messes up the build a
little<00:01:38.070> bit<00:01:38.280> but<00:01:38.400> we'll<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.610> see<00:01:38.700> if<00:01:38.820> sake

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
little bit but we'll have to see if sake

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.550 
little bit but we'll have to see if sake
does<00:01:39.479> like<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.960> he's<00:01:40.079> just<00:01:40.170> going<00:01:40.470> to

Excalibur will probably check up there
anyway<00:02:08.970> once<00:02:09.239> he<00:02:09.360> realizes<00:02:09.720> okay<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.140> haven't

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.270 
anyway once he realizes okay you haven't
taken<00:02:10.590> gasps<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.069> haven't<00:02:11.340> expanded

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
taken gasps you haven't expanded

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.559 
taken gasps you haven't expanded
you<00:02:12.370> have<00:02:12.520> to<00:02:12.640> have<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.790> hatchery<00:02:13.000> somewhere<00:02:13.480> he

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
you have to have a hatchery somewhere he

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.420 
you have to have a hatchery somewhere he
might<00:02:13.690> check<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:13.990> gold<00:02:14.200> as<00:02:14.380> well<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:15.340> I'm

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
might check the gold as well and I'm

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.590 
might check the gold as well and I'm
sure<00:02:15.459> he<00:02:15.580> will<00:02:15.790> Scout<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.120> eventually<00:02:16.330> but

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
sure he will Scout it eventually but

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.000 
sure he will Scout it eventually but
it's<00:02:16.750> not<00:02:16.870> going<00:02:16.990> to<00:02:17.080> really<00:02:17.230> change<00:02:17.560> sakis

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
it's not going to really change sakis

interesting because he didn't even go

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.460 
interesting because he didn't even go
into<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.060> base<00:02:43.239> of<00:02:43.450> nacho<00:02:43.810> didn't<00:02:44.170> scout<00:02:44.410> the

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
into the base of nacho didn't scout the

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.990 
into the base of nacho didn't scout the
gas<00:02:44.739> so<00:02:45.040> I<00:02:45.220> mean<00:02:45.430> if<00:02:45.519> he<00:02:45.640> sends<00:02:45.820> out<00:02:45.970> a

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
gas so I mean if he sends out a

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.729 
gas so I mean if he sends out a
follow-up<00:02:46.420> probe<00:02:46.720> which<00:02:46.930> somehow<00:02:47.200> manages<00:02:47.739> to

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
follow-up probe which somehow manages to

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.460 
follow-up probe which somehow manages to
get<00:02:47.950> around<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:48.580> he's<00:02:49.180> like<00:02:49.360> oh<00:02:49.540> no<00:02:49.989> oh<00:02:50.260> no

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
get around and he's like oh no oh no

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.170 
get around and he's like oh no oh no
there's<00:02:50.680> no<00:02:50.769> natural<00:02:50.890> there<00:02:51.250> what<00:02:51.730> all<00:02:51.940> in

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
there's no natural there what all in

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.790 
there's no natural there what all in
aggression<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:52.810> then<00:02:53.200> all<00:02:53.320> of<00:02:53.350> a<00:02:53.410> sudden<00:02:53.440> hood

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
aggression and then all of a sudden hood

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.229 
aggression and then all of a sudden hood
she<00:02:53.980> was<00:02:54.130> loling<00:02:54.400> you<00:02:54.730> know<00:02:54.820> he's<00:02:54.940> got<00:02:55.000> to<00:02:55.120> fit

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
she was loling you know he's got to fit

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
base up he's transferring drones there

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.920 
base up he's transferring drones there
can<00:02:57.400> get<00:02:57.519> quite<00:02:57.790> a<00:02:57.850> large<00:02:58.120> advantage<00:02:58.750> because

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
can get quite a large advantage because

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.840 
can get quite a large advantage because

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
not check that this is a really risky

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.290 
not check that this is a really risky
map<00:03:09.160> to<00:03:09.310> do<00:03:09.430> it<00:03:09.550> on<00:03:09.670> though<00:03:09.790> surely<00:03:10.000> I<00:03:10.180> mean

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
map to do it on though surely I mean

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.690 
map to do it on though surely I mean
this<00:03:10.390> is<00:03:10.450> so<00:03:10.870> close<00:03:11.140> to<00:03:11.440> your<00:03:11.560> natural<00:03:11.739> yeah<00:03:12.670> I

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
this is so close to your natural yeah I

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.400 
this is so close to your natural yeah I
mean<00:03:13.060> we'll<00:03:13.330> have<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.600> see<00:03:13.750> how<00:03:13.780> that<00:03:14.080> works

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
mean we'll have to see how that works

mean he's expecting this new show to

mean he's expecting this new show to
open<00:03:40.480> up<00:03:40.600> with<00:03:40.720> speed<00:03:40.989> now<00:03:41.200> because<00:03:41.530> of<00:03:41.560> that

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
open up with speed now because of that

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.289 
open up with speed now because of that
block<00:03:41.980> of<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.220> hatch<00:03:42.370> hatchery<00:03:43.000> she's<00:03:43.150> going

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
block of the hatch hatchery she's going

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.030 
block of the hatch hatchery she's going
to<00:03:43.359> just<00:03:43.510> pull<00:03:43.660> back<00:03:43.690> place<00:03:44.079> safe<00:03:44.350> and<00:03:44.590> now<00:03:44.920> as

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
to just pull back place safe and now as

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.470 
to just pull back place safe and now as
we<00:03:45.130> can<00:03:45.280> see<00:03:45.430> it<00:03:45.549> is<00:03:45.700> going<00:03:45.940> to<00:03:46.000> be<00:03:46.060> a<00:03:46.150> one

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
we can see it is going to be a one

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.140 
we can see it is going to be a one
gateway<00:03:46.989> into<00:03:47.410> expand<00:03:48.040> this<00:03:48.549> is<00:03:48.730> becoming<00:03:49.120> the

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
gateway into expand this is becoming the

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.789 
gateway into expand this is becoming the
norm<00:03:49.480> in<00:03:49.750> this<00:03:49.900> matchup<00:03:50.109> now<00:03:50.380> the<00:03:50.440> pile

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
norm in this matchup now the pile

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.440 
norm in this matchup now the pile
placement<00:03:51.310> towards<00:03:51.549> the<00:03:51.640> back<00:03:51.850> off<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.269> ramp

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
placement towards the back off the ramp

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.090 
placement towards the back off the ramp
so<00:03:52.780> we<00:03:52.870> can<00:03:52.989> add<00:03:53.170> on<00:03:53.290> the<00:03:53.410> two<00:03:53.560> gateways<00:03:53.799> at<00:03:54.040> the

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
so we can add on the two gateways at the

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.430 
so we can add on the two gateways at the
front<00:03:54.370> nice<00:03:54.850> and<00:03:55.150> safe<00:03:55.390> if<00:03:55.630> any<00:03:55.900> Roach<00:03:56.140> link

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
front nice and safe if any Roach link

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.630 
front nice and safe if any Roach link
does<00:03:56.620> come<00:03:56.769> in<00:03:56.890> and<00:03:57.040> look<00:03:57.160> at<00:03:57.310> that<00:03:57.400> nice

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
does come in and look at that nice

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.060 
does come in and look at that nice
earlier<00:03:58.150> oh<00:03:58.269> yes<00:03:58.570> base<00:03:59.049> that<00:03:59.530> is<00:03:59.650> sneaky

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
earlier oh yes base that is sneaky

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.490 
earlier oh yes base that is sneaky
because<00:04:00.519> sakae<00:04:00.970> has<00:04:01.180> not<00:04:01.420> scouted<00:04:02.019> by<00:04:02.200> the

because sakae has not scouted by the

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.990 
because sakae has not scouted by the
time<00:04:02.799> that<00:04:02.829> he<00:04:03.100> gets<00:04:03.130> there<00:04:03.579> I<00:04:03.609> would<00:04:03.820> imagine

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
time that he gets there I would imagine

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.580

he's not going to suspect this base at
all<00:04:05.739> admittedly<00:04:06.370> is<00:04:06.640> very<00:04:07.060> very<00:04:07.359> close<00:04:07.840> but

it's<00:04:27.930> going<00:04:28.050> to<00:04:28.139> be<00:04:28.229> difficult<00:04:28.380> for<00:04:28.620> a<00:04:29.070> full-on

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
it's going to be difficult for a full-on

it's going to be difficult for a full-on
attack<00:04:29.940> around<00:04:30.360> those<00:04:30.479> gonna<00:04:30.660> have<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:30.840> go

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
attack around those gonna have to go

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.629 
attack around those gonna have to go
around<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:31.229> side<00:04:31.380> which<00:04:31.860> in<00:04:32.400> combination

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
around the side which in combination

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.129 
around the side which in combination
with<00:04:32.940> force<00:04:33.300> fields<00:04:33.660> going<00:04:33.810> to<00:04:33.870> make<00:04:33.960> things

with force fields going to make things

difficult<00:04:34.350> but<00:04:34.800> right<00:04:34.889> now<00:04:35.040> so<00:04:35.250> keep<00:04:35.370> playing

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
difficult but right now so keep playing

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.700 
difficult but right now so keep playing
very<00:04:35.820> defensively<00:04:36.419> and<00:04:36.690> nurture<00:04:37.440> is<00:04:37.530> going<00:04:37.650> to

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
very defensively and nurture is going to

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.500 
very defensively and nurture is going to
be<00:04:37.770> able<00:04:37.860> to<00:04:38.010> gain<00:04:38.190> an<00:04:38.460> economic<00:04:38.910> advantage<00:04:39.360> as

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
be able to gain an economic advantage as

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.700 
be able to gain an economic advantage as
a<00:04:39.540> direct<00:04:39.810> result<00:04:39.900> in<00:04:40.169> fact<00:04:40.320> he<00:04:40.380> already<00:04:40.500> has

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
a direct result in fact he already has

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.580 
a direct result in fact he already has
one<00:04:40.949> it's<00:04:41.190> 29<00:04:41.729> probes<00:04:41.970> 237<00:04:42.840> drones<00:04:43.110> and<00:04:43.320> that's

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
one it's 29 probes 237 drones and that's

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:44.930 
one it's 29 probes 237 drones and that's
only<00:04:43.770> going<00:04:43.919> to<00:04:44.010> get<00:04:44.100> more<00:04:44.160> ridiculous<00:04:44.820> as

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
only going to get more ridiculous as

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.430 
only going to get more ridiculous as
this<00:04:44.970> goes<00:04:45.210> on<00:04:45.389> yeah<00:04:45.780> and<00:04:45.990> this<00:04:46.080> is<00:04:46.199> kind<00:04:46.380> of

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
this goes on yeah and this is kind of

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.409 
this goes on yeah and this is kind of
the<00:04:46.500> position<00:04:47.010> every<00:04:47.460> Protoss<00:04:47.790> hates<00:04:48.090> to<00:04:48.300> be

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
the position every Protoss hates to be

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:49.939 
the position every Protoss hates to be
and<00:04:48.540> now<00:04:48.690> because<00:04:48.960> you<00:04:49.050> have<00:04:49.199> no<00:04:49.410> idea<00:04:49.530> what<00:04:49.830> is

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
and now because you have no idea what is

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.520 
and now because you have no idea what is
going<00:04:49.979> on<00:04:50.340> the<00:04:50.760> the<00:04:51.000> one<00:04:51.240> advantage<00:04:52.020> that<00:04:52.080> sake

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
going on the the one advantage that sake

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.260 
going on the the one advantage that sake
has<00:04:52.770> seen<00:04:53.070> is<00:04:53.310> that<00:04:53.340> he<00:04:53.580> saw<00:04:53.790> the<00:04:53.850> circling

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
has seen is that he saw the circling

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.790 
has seen is that he saw the circling
didn't<00:04:54.570> have<00:04:54.720> speed<00:04:55.110> yet<00:04:55.320> which<00:04:55.500> is<00:04:55.590> most

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
didn't have speed yet which is most

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.529 
didn't have speed yet which is most
probably<00:04:56.310> means<00:04:56.699> it<00:04:56.940> is<00:04:57.150> going<00:04:57.240> to<00:04:57.419> be<00:04:57.479> a

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
probably means it is going to be a

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:58.909 
probably means it is going to be a
faster<00:04:57.960> it<00:04:58.080> base<00:04:58.260> so<00:04:58.440> I'm<00:04:58.500> going<00:04:58.680> to<00:04:58.710> guess

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
faster it base so I'm going to guess

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.580 
faster it base so I'm going to guess
that<00:04:59.220> sake<00:04:59.940> realizes<00:05:00.780> that<00:05:00.810> has<00:05:01.139> been<00:05:01.320> a<00:05:01.350> third

that sake realizes that has been a third

that sake realizes that has been a third
base<00:05:01.800> taken<00:05:02.190> he<00:05:02.550> might<00:05:02.699> push<00:05:02.970> out<00:05:03.120> shortly

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479

awful chest nice force field up too many
in<00:06:31.400> my<00:06:31.610> opinion<00:06:31.940> many<00:06:32.210> units<00:06:32.570> coming<00:06:32.840> out

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020 
in my opinion many units coming out

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.090 
in my opinion many units coming out
there<00:06:33.139> from<00:06:33.290> the<00:06:33.350> hatcheries<00:06:33.650> channelings

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:34.100 
there from the hatcheries channelings

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.379 
there from the hatcheries channelings
and<00:06:34.280> more<00:06:34.400> roaches<00:06:34.580> coming<00:06:35.000> you<00:06:35.090> should<00:06:35.120> be

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:35.389 
and more roaches coming you should be

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:36.879 
and more roaches coming you should be
able<00:06:35.449> to<00:06:35.570> defend<00:06:35.690> this<00:06:35.930> you<00:06:36.110> take<00:06:36.320> the<00:06:36.710> nice

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:36.889 
able to defend this you take the nice

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 
question about that look at do you see

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.620 
question about that look at do you see
how<00:06:39.949> many<00:06:40.100> force<00:06:40.430> fields<00:06:40.790> sake<00:06:41.090> drew<00:06:41.479> out

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:41.630 
how many force fields sake drew out
