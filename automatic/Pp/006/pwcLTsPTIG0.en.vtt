00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
wasting so much product that was the

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.540 
wasting so much product that was the
only<00:04:40.449> difference<00:04:40.810> we're<00:04:41.319> a<00:04:41.349> fan<00:04:41.590> brush<00:04:41.740> starts

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
only difference we're a fan brush starts

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.279 
only difference we're a fan brush starts
out<00:04:42.699> by<00:04:43.000> picking<00:04:43.360> up<00:04:43.479> the<00:04:43.720> amount<00:04:43.930> of<00:04:43.990> product

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
out by picking up the amount of product

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:45.570 
out by picking up the amount of product
would<00:04:44.379> actually<00:04:44.680> want<00:04:44.830> but<00:04:45.340> obviously

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
would actually want but obviously

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.580 
would actually want but obviously
something<00:04:46.300> like<00:04:46.419> a<00:04:46.449> blush<00:04:46.720> bronzer<00:04:47.229> of

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
something like a blush bronzer of

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.230 
something like a blush bronzer of
contour<00:04:47.979> a<00:04:48.069> highlight<00:04:48.400> you<00:04:48.580> can<00:04:48.759> build<00:04:49.000> them

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
contour a highlight you can build them

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.969 
contour a highlight you can build them
so<00:04:49.750> using<00:04:50.139> a<00:04:50.229> fan<00:04:50.409> brush<00:04:50.560> will<00:04:50.770> actually

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
so using a fan brush will actually

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:52.860 
so using a fan brush will actually
conserve<00:04:51.340> your<00:04:51.490> product<00:04:51.940> and<00:04:52.090> that<00:04:52.690> way<00:04:52.810> you

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
conserve your product and that way you

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.629 
conserve your product and that way you
get<00:04:53.139> it<00:04:53.289> on<00:04:53.440> and<00:04:53.740> you<00:04:53.800> can<00:04:53.919> apply<00:04:54.129> more<00:04:54.370> if

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
get it on and you can apply more if

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.270 
get it on and you can apply more if
you're<00:04:54.970> somebody<00:04:55.210> who<00:04:55.479> once<00:04:55.659> Clown<00:04:55.930> cheeks
