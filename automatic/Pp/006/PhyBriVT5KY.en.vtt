00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:16.950

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.950
 fly silver and vÃ©lez went to buy 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.810

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.430

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:40.160
 Water half seriously 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.160

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.990
 seriously are you telling me mx 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.130
 I do not know how to put the line 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.470
 if it's little by little 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.530
 my mother, my mother, my mother's mate 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.380
 that is but now I'm going in a direction to 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.900
 see I hope to get there 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.550
 I think I'm going in the right direction, I think 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:29.780
 I think it's worth it if you believe it you think you know what 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:38.330
 that is the belief in the air the point 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:40.700
 it's just been swimming you're not going to 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.300
 take science 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.810
 ok but is that to get to the point 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.010
 uncle already takes a lot here nothing happens 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.730
 the goal is here next I am 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.860
 stopped looking at the heights eye me down 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.950
 of the bike to observe that no 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.770
 I have francs 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.720
 If I see you 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.020
 we do not have said 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.680
 that's a bird is a plane where 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.680
 goes after 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.640
 after that point you have to go up 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.090
 a mountain and you have to make a jump 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.090
 and it is already 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:35.600
 it does not motivate me anymore it happened on the side 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.490
 that I do not get anywhere near it is that I 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.500
 I hate to wear that there is here because 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.450
 now I read it 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.740
 but I'm in a trick this fly but 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:50.500
 this my 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:53.740
 Now I think you also have to lift 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.600
 the camera yes that's why I was not 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.840
 lifting before exactly now if it is 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.840
 A) Yes 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.500
 yes 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.590
 but very good very well very well 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.790
 and then I can not believe it 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:27.990
 raining my mother madryn as one 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.990
 about libya do not get caught 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:32.130
 it's really hard 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.150
 the days 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.240
 as a general measure that technique thought 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.240
 companions 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:55.450

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.010
 fellow vettel fellow of post there 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.510

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.510
 the place trick 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.820
 eye 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.490
 How do you say 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.240

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.460
 19a I tell you that we get the kid 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.260
