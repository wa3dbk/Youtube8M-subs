00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.890
 kenting a boy in his last year of 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.600
 institute that weird most of the 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.100
 last protagonists of books that you 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.500
 they helped and their last in the institute 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.970
 because not having a protagonist that already 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.650
 come to college sometimes when 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.390
 new book of those because these with the 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.560
 fingers with the amount of 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.750
 fun things that happen to the 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.240
 university parties drunkenness comas 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.759
 ethyl that more parties and teachers 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.800
 evil and suspense and suspense and 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.050
 license plates of dreams I think that 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.430
 was what you can draw a lot and the 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.869
 last in the institute is so cool but 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:41.300
 there is more life after and before there is life 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.100
 there I saw the part of the 16 and 17 years what 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.830
 I promise through this in his last year 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.350
 of high school and is a normal boy in the 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.360
 up down the American step of 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.670
 the hyper popular fears is not the 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.679
 good winning quarterback could be 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.520
 animator could not be that of a 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:02:02.300
 man girl and neither is a hyper pariah 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.979
 social to which they have papers and not 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.259
 he is not always a normal boy with two 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.119
 friends rosarinas very images the two me 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.729
 I'm watching music bands but 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.440
 kevin as he says has always had a 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.750
 kind of miracle of his life and that 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.209
 Miracle is bitter its neighbor angle 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.700
 belonging to the supreme race of 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.890
 institute is super popular probably 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.050
 Dancing is the rule not know if it 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.000
 cheerleader but I sure want that yes 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.880
 who is friends with them has a boyfriend 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.040
 super handsome with one has everything and is that 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.319
 had already lived a special situation 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.300
 when they were little and they were both 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.740
 very friends and one day they met in 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.720
 half of his neighborhood a corpse of a 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.030
 man who had just died to this new 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.650
 police and that more than joining us separated them 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.239
 because everyone has reacted 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.310
 very different and they realized what 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.890
 different that it was very risky and 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.569
 how cautious you were then just 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.819
 they returned to give the story begins 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.200
 energy plus something from the life of kenting and 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.299
 is that apart from going to the institute of 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.510
 to be late as always is to overcome 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:01.220
 classes notes friends dialogues is much 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.260
 and very special past and that is that 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.909
 go wrong to your window to live a 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.799
 night full of adventures 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.569
 That night, it takes revenge 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.430
 best friends that seems to be not 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.799
 they were from her boyfriend who was putting 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.440
 of the horns of the boy who bothers that 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.329
 tim putting them fish shaving 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.889
 lesson of not sleeping warning their 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.450
 parents of the bad things they have done 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:22.190
 and even sneaks into a park 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.870
 attractions we go to that night is a 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.329
 unforgettable night for those who have a 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.769
 chance is that 50 years later I remember 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.060
 well as one of the best nights of 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.980
 his life even though at the time 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.439
 The poor man suffered because he is a boy 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.030
 how many emotions do you please? 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:36.319
 quentin think that from that 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.659
 moment your life is going to change and that 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.360
 burn today at the institute are going to be 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:43.220
 friends that probably up 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.590
 I'm not getting your boyfriend to be something like that 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.210
 but the next day he gets up and frames 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.590
 no further back or here would be holding 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.660
 next or the next day and that is 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.100
 bitter be a story to play at home and 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.630
 is that he had already done other times but 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.120
 that time it seems that it will not seem like 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.920
 the dim obsesses with margo and starts 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.780
 to believe that she has left clues 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.880
 to find it 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.950
 all those clues start with the poster 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.660
 of a singer who is hanging on the 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.700
 blind of the room of something that 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.500
 he only knows about kenny gravitation and 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.140
 from there a song will come to a 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.030
 poem and six hundred things that are going 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.430
 showing the paths that have followed the most 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.470
 when adding house who is obsessed with 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.390
 one way that can not stop until 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.070
 find bitter and it will take you to the 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.470
 ultimate consequences if you have to 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.720
 losing the graduation will be lost if you 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.160
 have to lose 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.919
 doing important things because in you 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.900
 he must be the only American boy of 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.060
 world world that does not want to go to the bathroom 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.490
 of graduation does not want to get in front 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.010
 super mega ortega nor be accompanied by 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.160
 a beautiful or ugly girl or take a 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.830
 Photo 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.310
 they come and dance to get drunk mined 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.980
 that has the weird 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.140
 or special or that has a European soul 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:54.140
 of these 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:56.270
 and there will be more parties at the university and 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.510
 much better so much that they enter as their 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.130
 friends helping him take a trip 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.500
 unstoppable to the other side of the country in 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.300
 looking for mango you will find it or not that is 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.160
 a question that you can only answer 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.260
 if he tells you the book and it is that cities of 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.720
 paper is a book of mystery intrigue 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.330
 of personal discovery and very 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.760
 good very different characters very 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.650
 different and it's letting you say it but it's 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.750
 that a good character makes the book and 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.850
 that you have a good character though 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.670
 Despite not out in the book is a 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:28.490
 brutal character since he is a character 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:30.110
 totally imagined because we know how 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.360
 is a framework thanks to the team that 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.730
 we note how beautiful is the list 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.860
 that is how daring it is tells us a 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.290
 idealized bitter that probably not 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.510
 be her really but we know her and 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.930
 we hate her we love her thanks to Quentin 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.449
 since the book is narrated in first 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.300
 once again that a green got to do 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:51.400
 a book that lives up to my expectations 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.780
 if I had to compare it with under the 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.389
 same star that is the only other 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.860
 book they read me from and I would not say 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:59.560
 is a little below since under the 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.520
 same star is all super top one 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.310
