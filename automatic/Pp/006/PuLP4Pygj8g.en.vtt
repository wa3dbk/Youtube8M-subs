00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
they're copying but they still do pretty

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.420 
they're copying but they still do pretty
well<00:06:25.440> maybe<00:06:25.710> that's<00:06:25.920> just<00:06:25.980> because<00:06:26.130> of<00:06:26.340> the

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
well maybe that's just because of the

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.150 
well maybe that's just because of the
poor<00:06:26.640> and<00:06:26.700> maybe<00:06:27.030> because<00:06:27.240> they're<00:06:27.420> kind<00:06:27.840> of

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160

getting into how ridiculous and funny it
is<00:06:35.630> some<00:06:36.080> of<00:06:36.170> the<00:06:36.260> time<00:06:36.440> right<00:06:36.710> I<00:06:37.010> mean<00:06:37.370> good

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
is some of the time right I mean good

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.160 
is some of the time right I mean good
for<00:06:37.820> them<00:06:37.940> for<00:06:38.150> having<00:06:38.390> an<00:06:38.480> effort<00:06:38.840> to<00:06:38.960> putting

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:39.170 
for them for having an effort to putting

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.440 
for them for having an effort to putting
a<00:06:39.380> script<00:06:39.740> and<00:06:39.920> a<00:06:39.950> plot<00:06:40.160> into<00:06:40.490> a<00:06:40.520> porn<00:06:40.820> there

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:41.450 
a script and a plot into a porn there

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.300 
a script and a plot into a porn there
was<00:06:41.630> a<00:06:41.660> picture<00:06:41.930> out<00:06:42.170> recently<00:06:42.530> of<00:06:42.890> porn

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.310 
was a picture out recently of porn

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.340 
was a picture out recently of porn
wonder<00:06:43.640> woman<00:06:43.940> and<00:06:44.120> her<00:06:44.300> outfit<00:06:44.720> was<00:06:44.750> better

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:45.350 
wonder woman and her outfit was better

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.410 
wonder woman and her outfit was better
than<00:06:45.770> the<00:06:46.040> one<00:06:46.160> that<00:06:46.310> Adrianne<00:06:46.970> Palicki<00:06:47.180> was

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:47.420 
than the one that Adrianne Palicki was

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.270 
than the one that Adrianne Palicki was
going<00:06:47.570> to<00:06:47.630> wear<00:06:47.810> for<00:06:48.020> the<00:06:48.110> CW<00:06:48.680> so<00:06:49.070> you<00:06:49.130> know<00:06:49.250> I

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 
going to wear for the CW so you know I

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.430 
going to wear for the CW so you know I
applaud<00:06:49.790> that<00:06:50.030> shorn<00:06:50.300> studio<00:06:50.750> and<00:06:51.020> I<00:06:51.080> applaud

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 
applaud that shorn studio and I applaud

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.150 
applaud that shorn studio and I applaud
it<00:06:51.650> when<00:06:52.250> the<00:06:53.080> derivative<00:06:54.080> is<00:06:54.290> actually

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:55.160 
it when the derivative is actually

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.550 
it when the derivative is actually
better<00:06:55.730> than<00:06:55.850> the<00:06:56.030> original<00:06:56.260> but<00:06:57.260> that<00:06:57.410> rarely

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 
better than the original but that rarely

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.770 
better than the original but that rarely
happens<00:06:57.770> it's<00:06:58.670> not<00:06:58.910> it's<00:06:59.210> not<00:06:59.330> black<00:06:59.630> and

00:06:59.770 --> 00:06:59.780 
happens it's not it's not black and

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.690 
happens it's not it's not black and
white<00:06:59.870> there's<00:07:00.200> a<00:07:00.260> whole<00:07:00.470> gray<00:07:00.980> spectrum<00:07:01.550> in

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:01.700 
white there's a whole gray spectrum in

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.420 
white there's a whole gray spectrum in
between<00:07:02.120> what<00:07:02.780> is<00:07:02.990> you<00:07:03.410> know<00:07:03.530> we're<00:07:04.010> just<00:07:04.220> here

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:04.430 
between what is you know we're just here

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.550 
between what is you know we're just here
to<00:07:04.580> make<00:07:04.700> a<00:07:04.760> movie<00:07:05.120> or<00:07:05.300> to<00:07:05.390> make<00:07:05.540> a<00:07:05.570> game<00:07:05.840> yes

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 
to make a movie or to make a game yes

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.890 
to make a movie or to make a game yes
its<00:07:06.770> derivative<00:07:07.220> of<00:07:07.340> another<00:07:07.610> game<00:07:07.820> but<00:07:08.120> so<00:07:08.690> be

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:08.900 
its derivative of another game but so be

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.150 
its derivative of another game but so be
it<00:07:08.930> lots<00:07:09.170> of<00:07:09.320> games<00:07:09.470> of<00:07:09.650> derivative<00:07:10.010> other

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 
it lots of games of derivative other

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.370 
it lots of games of derivative other
games<00:07:10.400> so<00:07:10.730> have<00:07:11.000> you<00:07:11.120> purchased<00:07:11.480> a<00:07:11.900> game<00:07:12.080> or

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:12.380 
games so have you purchased a game or

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.670 
games so have you purchased a game or
movie<00:07:12.680> that<00:07:13.160> was<00:07:13.720> derivative<00:07:14.720> of<00:07:15.230> some<00:07:15.530> other

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 
movie that was derivative of some other

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.040 
movie that was derivative of some other
work<00:07:15.950> and<00:07:16.250> was<00:07:17.030> it<00:07:17.150> an<00:07:17.240> accident<00:07:17.390> did<00:07:17.870> you<00:07:17.900> do

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.050 
work and was it an accident did you do
