is<00:04:38.599> so<00:04:38.750> late<00:04:38.960> at<00:04:39.080> night<00:04:39.110> I<00:04:39.289> think<00:04:39.410> all<00:04:39.680> the<00:04:39.860> TV

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:40.099 
is so late at night I think all the TV

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:43.719 
is so late at night I think all the TV
newscast<00:04:40.669> people<00:04:41.000> probably<00:04:41.210> in<00:04:41.449> bed<00:04:41.630> too<00:04:42.729> I'm

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
newscast people probably in bed too I'm

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:45.999 
newscast people probably in bed too I'm
the<00:04:43.880> only<00:04:43.940> reporter<00:04:44.509> out<00:04:44.780> here<00:04:45.050> foolishly

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
the only reporter out here foolishly

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:51.129 
the only reporter out here foolishly
enough<00:04:46.490> to<00:04:46.639> be<00:04:46.789> out<00:04:46.819> in<00:04:47.150> the<00:04:47.270> snow<00:04:50.020> when<00:04:51.020> I'm

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
enough to be out in the snow when I'm

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.279 
enough to be out in the snow when I'm
not<00:04:51.319> a<00:04:51.349> real<00:04:51.530> reporter

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.990 

so<00:04:56.289> looks<00:04:56.710> like<00:04:56.770> the<00:04:56.979> train<00:04:57.190> isn't<00:04:57.370> running<00:04:57.460> I

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
so looks like the train isn't running I

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.460 
so looks like the train isn't running I
think<00:04:58.870> what<00:04:58.990> I'll<00:04:59.110> do<00:04:59.289> is<00:04:59.710> I<00:05:01.289> could<00:05:02.289> probably

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
think what I'll do is I could probably

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.730 
think what I'll do is I could probably
go<00:05:02.680> home<00:05:03.300> my<00:05:04.300> train<00:05:04.599> my<00:05:04.780> last<00:05:05.020> train<00:05:05.319> leaves<00:05:05.349> at
