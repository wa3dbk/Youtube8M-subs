hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.800
welcome back to another session with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com. Today

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.860
I'm going to show you kandha patha baaji

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.490
This is a Maharashtrian preparation using spring onions, in my earlier

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.480
videos i have made one version of cooking spring onions with tomatoes

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.119
but this is a plain spring onions using
some sesame seeds, let's go ahead and make

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.529
this. For this

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.430
tempering with just cumin seeds and
sesame seeds in this add curry leaves

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.190
crushed garlic and crushed green chillies

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.190
you can also add chopped garlic and
green chilli,

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.730
now in this we're going to add a pinch
of hing, turmeric, garam masala powder and

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.460
chili powder all the four spices

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.039
you know cook this on a slow flame now
in this add chopped spring onion that is

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.280
kandha, add salt and then mix it

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.689
do not cover your greens with the lid
because you want to retain all the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.479
goodness of green color and also this is
usually made in the villages in

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.650
Maharashtra because you know if they
don't have any other vegetable available

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.299
they just cut some of the spring leaves
from the onion which is usually there

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.770
in the farms they make this specially
for you know for breakfast

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.700
along with bhakri or roti, you know once this cooks you know you can

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.750
see how the quantity is reduced to
almost quarter of it and also see it

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.579
is oozing out some moisture

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:45.240
and so don't add any water just you know
this garlic and nice til seed flavor this

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.000
and it becomes really really tasty

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.060
you can also add pinch of sugar

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.189
you know that will enhance the taste really good but if you do not want to

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.490
sugar no need to add,  now look at this

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.680
all the moisture is also almost evaporated but the green leaves have retain all the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.530
good color, in this add freshly grated
coconut and also some powder of

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.030
freshly roasted peanuts

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.900
after adding

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.989
coconut and the peanut just let it
simmer for two

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.200
more minutes and this is all done

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.200
Ahhh..such a sweet flavor

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.329
hmm Wow

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.530
very very very very very very tasty

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.709
especially if you have it with jawar ki roti

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.780
God you know the sweetness in the jawar ki roti and this, good god

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.489
