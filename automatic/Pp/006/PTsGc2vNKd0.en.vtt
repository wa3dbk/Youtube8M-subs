00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:07.359
 hi x today we are going to do good to 

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:09.639
 decorate the top pencils for 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.589
 have calm that we are going to 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.889
 serve not boring but also like 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:13.889
 I want 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.619
 we are going to need pencils to decorate 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:24.000
 that some have the rubber band is up 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.000
 because we 're leaving 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:35.450
 and a pencil to draw 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.570
 clean more terribly green 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.990
 scissors 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.230
 A piece of paper 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:49.640
 the moment 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.640
 to the best ever ever mobile eyes 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.800
 and glitter list or we can choose a 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.800
 forest so you do not know it is a 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:04.809
 glue type the tail but better and 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.090
 normal glitter and put it well then 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:11.289
 come on first thing we have to do 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.830
 is to roll 'clean' pipe in our 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:16.330
 pencil 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.330
 leaving a little bit of world 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.560
 and then with a few turns what 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.830
 we have to do is roll this up 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:30.600
 because our pencil is going to be like a 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:33.090
 worm and then well let's roll up 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.840
 this piece to be the head 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.840
 for you 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.390
 also if you want you can pay online 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.470
 pipes in pencil so that it does not escape or 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.660
 below or corality 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.970
 the procession is to be able to put it 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.690
 well and that's it 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.690
 one 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.630
 Well now we need to make eyes after 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.990
 him and the crisis with our eyes that already 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.990
 A while ago 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.940
 hamas doing it flat like in the video 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.780
 of the bracelet and then putting a 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:14.140
 little piece of hama strained and we put it 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:17.650
 oven or we put us movable 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.920
 I'm going to show us how they would look 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.220
 of paper but I'm going to use created the 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.010
 eyes from far is as easy as doing 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.340
 a tiny circle that the head is not 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.340
 very big 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.209
 well more or less and then towards the center 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.209
 circulated average 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.170
 and the other eye we try to make the 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.170
 Same size 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.170
 but with space to not find 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.430
 now cutting you have already done the 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.019
 little eyes of paper because you already have it 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.930
 put a little bit of treatment for 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.680
 back and paste it wherever you want 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.680
 verwest i 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.940
 so with him we go now we put a little 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.940
 of glue 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:45.510
 with the moving eyes would be to treat them 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:49.370
 same but good now I'm going to teach you 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:54.700
 the technique that I have 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:57.700
 Well now with the glitter 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.700
 painting 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.060
 we only do 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:10.040
 is what is between the rubber and also 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.040
 can you put it aint 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:32.900
 when we have it, we put it that way in a 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:32.900
 long or short glass that of course goes 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:41.510
 very good because if it does not stay at all 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.160
 ah 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:56.009
 i 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:58.349
 in the end he decided to put them like that 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:02.720
 If you do not want we will use your 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:05.030
 pencils you can put a flower 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.970
 You can also put players from 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.980
 you can eat like this parrot 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.020
 directly by the car more you like it 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.390
 that in my case there is that is 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.510
 you can put like this in cieza look for this 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:19.730

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:24.100
