 a summary of all 17 rumors 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.200
 There is a lot of fun now 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.050
 hello welcome to a new video 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.890
 from up like with a rumored video too 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.900
 i os 7 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.269
 a summary of all rumors 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.760
 all concepts and all ideas for 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.449
 next apple operating system for the 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.329
 a white for this video contribution who 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.800
 Support our contribution to Apple 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.649
 apple blog so if you are interested 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.600
 be on apple news on all videos and 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.040
 all further reviews in written 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.399
 always punish apple 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.410
 live.com over compared with the 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.200
 First rumor it's always hard 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.510
 to find real rumors about ios 7 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.730
 or if it compares to 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.500
 products like the iphone which he 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.510
 must be produced where apple with 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.670
 Yes, it can be negotiated 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.989
 really programmed directly at apple 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.840
 and that's why it always comes very much 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.790
 a lot of outwardly still many graphic artists 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.170
 sat down at apple experts and 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.470
 some of the times implemented 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.360
 really vivid graphics and 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.610
 found the same times with the rumors for 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.350
 lockscreen as we once see here 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.240
 for example the lockscreen where normal always 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.979
 the weather is what I think if 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.990
 One time to the side is unfortunately so was 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.369
 the weather looks very practical and 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.439
 saves a lot of time 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.750
 Let's keep looking right here too 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.020
 interesting who knows about android 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.240
 with google now what's on google recently 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.040
 Google has done that if you have 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.900
 for example, have a coupon to one 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.689
 Business near this shop 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.920
 time for you with your cellphone yours until 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.930
 now android smartphone 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.890
 automatically that's for that 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.320
 business can go or one 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.390
 coupon can read and that would be 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.280
 really optimal if apple so what 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.340
 he also changed a bit in order to get in too 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.229
 ios is even more intensively involved 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.740
 interesting and must be his 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.040
 Extravagant design for a new one 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.700
 lockscreen must be he is very 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.219
 to get used to if you 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.299
 really something apple so unsaid 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.200
 but we see it in the end 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.940
 really looks like 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.080
 Let's continue to the second point 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.450
 namely the 17 homescreen or the 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.600
 There confesses already from the MC a dashboard 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.040
 if we scroll to the left 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.750
 different widgets from different 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.580
 apps always so one is also reflected in the 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.190
 iphone ago how to get here for example 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.630
 im to the weather calendar or directly 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.150
 the recruitment possibilities at the 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.520
 settings like lte bluetooth and the 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.930
 brightness or the battery indicator will be 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.420
 very practical ever so everything 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.890
 I have an overview with a sweep 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.040
 I have to move on to the third point 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.780
 the notifications or 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.940
 notifications and the banners for that 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.550
 you imagine that at the banner 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.110
 in the future the function and easy 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.090
 click on it and get the message 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.700
 but you have America directly from 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.620
 banner to answer to one 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.700
 message to send back or the app 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.830
 open directly 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.810
 with the button up here or you ask 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.480
 It also becomes a new one directly before 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.790
 message from the notification banner 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.230
 Can also write out in hand here 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.780
 for example, design that directly the 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.300
 Can search apps without opening 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.490
 overall time exciting and great 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.500
 function I have my for the app 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.100
 can not open with her anyway 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.870
 interact and perform functions 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.030
 continue to a very interesting 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.250
 concept with the widgets in belgrade were 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.470
 namely here is a designer 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.239
 before that if you can do it longer 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.850
 presses on an app the right too 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.140
 button has the app to increase to 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.030
 smells like you see here at the 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.400
 for example, and then directly 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.500
 other options has wireless bluetooth 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.970
 to the brightness of the whole rather where that 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.100
 For example, other apps on it like that 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.660
 here at the mail app a direct 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.340
 overview has july last mails 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.959
 All in all, very interesting 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.459
 means she has to end up the app like 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.500
 you already not at the news above 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.940
 open more as I like information 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.340
 but that's already from 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.739
 homescreen a bit short 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.739
 this is the best way to throw it 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:04.400
 solution we now look to the last point 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:06.170
 namely the ios 7 apps so 10 to come 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.540
 or apps are overworked 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.880
 every idea of ​​a dictionary dictionary 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.799
 We all know where everyone is standing 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.799
 with a definition and so you put 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.820
 also integrated into the 7 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.650
 operating system 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.330
 because such apps are of course already 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.680
 always in the app store if you have something 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.330
 really fix installed in the system 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.250
 still integrated with other apps 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.949
 would really have a lot of advantages with that 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.660
 should bring and also the notes should 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.070
 offer to be revised 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.479
 what we are working on 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.639
 I agree with that, too 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:37.590
 current emergency sap he offers so little 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.479
 what you could do really more the 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.070
 there's something else to say there are many 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.990
 apps clearly on the app store that also 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.580
 suffer so we would fix 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.440
 built a better touch 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.240
 but you can make as much as in I 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.130
 this design for example different 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.960
 books that you can create this louis 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.550
 or the milk directly with the 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.009
 to write a finger without right now 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:00.800
 tap commercial and final 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:02.639
 Conclusion of all concepts for a new ie 7 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.199
 Overall, you have to be honest about what 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.720
 Many people think they just want to 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:09.090
 have more information at a glance 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.660
 more information without the app too 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.270
 to open 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.460
 So everything is best from the spear scream 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.039
 so from the lockscreen or homescreen 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.930
 to see everything in the overview too 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:20.460
 I agree with that 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.470
 So what's not the app anymore 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.240
 you have to wait to open it 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.080
 is loaded but all already from the house 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.349
 can go 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.970
 but that is really very useful yes 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:31.229
 Overall, really, really 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.270
 interesting designs as it is in 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:34.710
 end effect will look right white 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.800
 of course not there are still quite 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.510
 little to no information what you 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.310
 as expected when it could be enough 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.919
 such a releasetermin wehrmann 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.199
 expected march april could be a good one 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:48.120
 time to be published at 17 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.650
 Is it really there? 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.930
 We will see that later 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.460
 otherwise it was before this video as I said 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.440
