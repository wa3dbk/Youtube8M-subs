00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.410
 yeah hello everyone ap so I'm lucky my new tutorials to comment 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.410
 luck hours but this forest when script 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:14.889
 see right away see that 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.029
 so the script is called no script so like the cheetah youtube under the 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.849
 pass 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:21.970
 what I have and I do not put it safe 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.970
 the plot us like this finally so these crypt opex 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.589
 sorenson are two folders that will have to be put so 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.689
 in your computer 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.970
 so it's called plus times folder because i mean this 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.450
 new folder for me 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.750
 inches is steam 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.570
 so if you could 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.570
 your counter-strike source account it's stracke 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.490
 and then 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.570
 Adonis 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.260
 mohammed wada ace 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.710
 so that if the ports have created the folder 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.120
 look at it always apavou did that copy and cholet 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.160
 so at home and in the wind it's straika so have taken over the record and 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.160
 you paste time scan so that makes you copy 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.520
 and that kids in this case do it 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.990
 so that the football it looks like that the files in progress so she takes it 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.280
 these lands 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.560
 petiet then the second 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.110
 they're right 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.510
 then from the USSR 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.310
 murray the momentum 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.920
 so also the gold so there adituent had ranked law so I'm here 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.210
 where the wolf does copy paste to sundance stray cats 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.640
 and on sale in white 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.080
 rage for law 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.080
 then - franck demaret would cost that source 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.990
 finances that should appear in the console 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.930
 finally it is to mark the script the most of a melody 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.149
 - I'm sorry for returning a dose 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.229
 it has to be marked 5 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:15.679
 Christian 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:18.679
 then chose 105 hours whichever 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.689
 logically insecure quickly 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:24.229
 my son 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:26.979
 we resume the proclamation 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:29.979
 so for you give two super then log in once again 

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:32.789
 you cancel such change 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:36.199
 for its ability actually 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:39.199
 for you cancel 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:43.839
 lead fraud 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:46.839
 in support you write on the console 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:58.239
 you write sarthe 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.759
 open script 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:03.009
 crash space of pau employment 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:06.009
 dorsaf their turn a dose 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.830
 so in the end to the idea I recognize everything under the look of expectations 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:15.979
 savannah on the year only the download is prepared for you 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:19.779

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:22.349
 and no answer 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.809
 so that villa spitting 

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:27.359
 so 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:28.959
