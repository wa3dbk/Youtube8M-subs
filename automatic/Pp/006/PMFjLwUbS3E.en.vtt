00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
they're separate there's this place here

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.429 
they're separate there's this place here
because<00:03:12.239> they<00:03:12.480> tend<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.840> go<00:03:13.019> a<00:03:13.049> little<00:03:13.230> crazy

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:13.439 
because they tend to go a little crazy

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.649 
because they tend to go a little crazy
when<00:03:13.799> they<00:03:13.950> can<00:03:14.129> see<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.790> girls<00:03:15.239> on<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.540> other

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.229 
when they can see the girls on the other
side<00:03:15.959> I<00:03:16.170> might<00:03:16.799> eventually<00:03:17.310> take<00:03:17.609> it<00:03:17.730> down<00:03:17.909> but

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
side I might eventually take it down but

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.210 
side I might eventually take it down but
probably<00:03:18.689> not<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.200> this<00:03:19.409> place<00:03:19.709> is<00:03:19.739> here

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
probably not and this place is here

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.309 
probably not and this place is here
