00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.270
 we are going to prepare puff pastry cakes 

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.999
 stuffed with meat the ingredients that 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.829
 we need are for four people a 

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:12.869
 Puff pastry sheet also bought 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:15.360
 would serve as a broken dough salad 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:18.690
 remains of roast or stew of any 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.180
 class roast sauce or stew or tomato 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.460
 bechamel what we want an egg and 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.800
 grated cheese to taste and we're going to 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.220
 start stretching in our sheet of 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.220
 puff pastry 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:35.140
 and with a cortapastas or ring of plating 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.470
 big let's go cutting four 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.780
 portions because we know that this is the 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.280
 measure that covers our mold well 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.800
 cupcake that we are going to use to 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.480
 then then we have taken a step 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.350
 that has a diameter a little bit 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.140
 lower 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:55.010
 to the previous one and with this we are going to cut 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.760
 four other circles because it's going to 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.760
 serve as a cover 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:06.879
 with a sheet of puff pastry should we 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.879
 give for the eight circulitos sorry 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.170
 once we have them 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.370
 if we see that it does not give us the measure 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.220
 exactly for our molds of 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.220
 Magdalena we stretch a bit 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.030
 and now we are going to adapt that in 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.060
 this case we have used silicone molds 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:34.700
 but you can use the molds that you want 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.890
 let's go adapting the big circle 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.799
 and once we have the four circles 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.079
 put the meat we have cut it with the 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.810
 Scissors help in pieces 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.180
 little ones 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.820
 Fill the mold halfway through 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.820
 meat we cover well with cheese 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.090
 and we take a couple of tablespoons of sauce 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.890
 now we are going to put what comes to 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.340
 be the cover 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:09.970
 and with a lot of sense and a lot of affection 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.970
 to go joining the edges to pinches 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:18.040
 once we have it we are going to cut 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.200
 cross shaped by the center 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.329
 so that the vapors go out in the 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.500
 cooking and do not exploit our 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.500
 meat cupcake 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.330
 and when we already have the four trained 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.990
 we paint them with egg and with the oven 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.690
 hot at 200 degrees we will place it 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.970
 in the lower part of the oven so that 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.390
 the puff will dry well also by 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.360
 down and we will have around 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.670
 about 30 or 40 minutes 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.710
 Once ready, we take them out and 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.290
 we serve with the garnish that most 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.870
 like in our case a gratin of 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.630
 fine potatoes that you have in another 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.810
 video in the information box or in a 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.910
 link on the screen and ready we have 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.740
 our puff pastry cakes filled 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.530
 of meat that as you see more than one 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.140
 strict recipe is an idea so that 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.959
 you may take advantage of this holiday season's 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.690
 remains of roast meat or stew that 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:21.209
 they sobren if it is that you have left and nothing more 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.700
 we will recommend them as 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.700
 always because they are delicious
