and<00:01:02.340> prepare<00:01:02.969> what<00:01:03.180> what<00:01:03.750> both<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:03.960> them<00:01:04.260> have

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
and prepare what what both of them have

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.020 
and prepare what what both of them have
for<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> speed<00:01:05.070> by<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.369> time<00:01:05.549> we<00:01:05.700> get<00:01:05.790> that

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
for a speed by the time we get that

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.120 
for a speed by the time we get that
point<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.570> then<00:01:06.810> we're<00:01:07.560> also<00:01:07.680> going<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:07.979> do<00:01:08.100> a

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
point and then we're also going to do a

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.320 
point and then we're also going to do a
luck<00:01:08.400> test<00:01:08.700> up

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
luck test up

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.620 
luck test up
record<00:01:10.930> them<00:01:11.050> going<00:01:11.230> up<00:01:11.410> a<00:01:11.500> hill<00:01:12.180> show<00:01:13.180> you

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
record them going up a hill show you

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.030 
record them going up a hill show you
know<00:01:13.720> the<00:01:13.840> difference<00:01:14.170> is<00:01:14.320> three<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:14.710> two<00:01:14.860> if

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
know the difference is three the two if

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.100 
know the difference is three the two if
they<00:01:15.190> don't<00:01:15.400> shift<00:01:15.730> how<00:01:16.450> much<00:01:16.630> speed<00:01:16.900> they

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
they don't shift how much speed they

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.510 
they don't shift how much speed they
lose<00:01:17.350> so<00:01:18.280> on<00:01:18.400> its<00:01:18.520> own<00:01:18.640> episode<00:01:19.270> already

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
lose so on its own episode already

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.820 
lose so on its own episode already
alright<00:01:21.520> do<00:01:22.360> here<00:01:23.050> oh<00:01:23.110> to<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.290> bridge<00:01:23.500> this<00:01:23.770> is

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
alright do here oh to the bridge this is

00:01:23.830 --> 00:02:04.340 
alright do here oh to the bridge this is

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.790 

all<00:02:05.350> right<00:02:05.620> our<00:02:05.860> last<00:02:06.100> test<00:02:06.520> was<00:02:07.560> kind<00:02:08.560> of<00:02:08.649> a

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
all right our last test was kind of a

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.360 
all right our last test was kind of a
zero<00:02:09.100> to<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.429> bridge<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:11.170> oh<00:02:11.620> wait<00:02:11.950> with<00:02:12.190> no

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
zero to the bridge the oh wait with no
