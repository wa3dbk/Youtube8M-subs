00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.560
 hello everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:09.539
 tutorial of animals in yulÃ­n this time 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.200
 represents a size it takes away for me already 

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:15.599
 I ate little and well I will teach you 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.670
 how is the soil made that I have in 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.370
 the beach of planks 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.280
 so in this way 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:26.470
 we also very well start 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.390
 I have done it but well I will do 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.040
 that I'm going to modify it enjoy the 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.290
 video quality but very that 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.900
 used to make the videos I was 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.400
 spoiled so for the moment I'll have 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.750
 to be satisfied with this I think that we 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.780
 amount 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.960
 let's go to the other one I'm going to quote so you can see 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.559
 how it is done 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.500
 the baptism done I'm going to erase this 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.010
 part in principle imagine those that 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.010
 they have nothing 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.270
 you have to fill in the whole picture what is 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.520
 all of this dark color 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.520
 do what colors you want 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.009
 we fill one is a very dark brown 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.009
 that is not very good 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.690
 touch 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.690
 we do not have a good look 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.200
 half 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.150
 well now we start this color that is 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.759
 the most clear for what we have to 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.040
 to do is make this square then 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.680
 let's start counting squares by 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.509
 example between between plank and plank 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.299
 there has to be a line of difference 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:44.979
 then we would have to start at all 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:50.000
 case over here here and give the grass is worth 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:51.320
 we started to slowly make our 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.020
 plank 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.120
 leaving a margin here since here goes to 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.450
 represent that it is shade and it will be more 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.450
 sad 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.620
 here 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.290
 with the reigns 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.830
 I do not have it 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.960
 when we have it filled we take 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.870
 this brown cited dark from here of 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.450
 agreement 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.849
 and we make this shadow here that does not 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.580
 it reaches the corner but has to 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:33.010
 have a little dot 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:36.330
 if you want a point of difference 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.330
 now you will see the center 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.150
 because this is the 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:51.099
 and shadows 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:53.500
 that's it, it 's already a little bit 3d effect 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.319
 the grass line we do now 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.370
 she saved us we tell from here here 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:04.569
 3 dots 1 2 3 clicks is here 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:08.730
 same from where the shadow starts 123 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.730
 here and we fill it 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.870
 perfect that what we have to do is 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.060
 shadow piquitos with one more color 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.319
 Dark 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.680
 previously of green we will do it 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:24.650
 little piquito little piquito that 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.660
 It will be very nice for when 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.550
 we have the piquitos made 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.939
 then what we have to do 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:37.879
 this is wrong 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:37.879
 and then the darker color 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.550
 of a color a little darker 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.970
 we have to fill it all in one color 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.160
 clear and then we will use a 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.830
 darker color that shadow this 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.900
 ok in thongs we would use 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.990
 this here for you to see the palette of 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.990
 colors that used 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.570
 extra is the middle one this is here 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.490
 below and this is a here above 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.820
 agreement are three colors that are 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.820
 together 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.599
 and now what we have to do 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:20.699
 we choose with this dark color and 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:24.090
 we counted 3 squares 1 2 and 3 from the 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:26.970
 exit here and fill in everything 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.810
 case the advice that you choose this because 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:33.480
 it's direct 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:36.930
 day 63 squares are here goes 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.700
 very well now sought the individual and 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.510
 we make another line from up here 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.510
 to the bottom 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:54.610
 perfect now we have to do from here 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.610
 down another line of lights to us another line 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.590
 cool 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.140
 and now we have to do the little dots 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:06.210
 of the plank of agreement then we do 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.210
 we count in 4 squares 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:13.050
 4 40 44 and asses 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.870
 so only one line difference 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.720
 this let's say that I had limited a 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.250
 little and it has not been perfect but 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.900
 well here I have been one does not pass 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.789
 nothing will continue and a bankrupt will not go 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.819
 notice since they are tidal planes that do not 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:29.930
 nothing happens we do in one of the dots 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:29.930
 a small shadow 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:37.500
 and now we have our floor 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:37.500
 planks is super handsome 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.370
 if you have any doubt or something or any 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:48.400
 tell me, I think it's going to 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:51.449
 leave as is done this 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.270
 with gems from the list 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:57.840
 it is the same the other the only thing that 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:00.330
 Little pits go up and the shadow you have 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.610
 what to do up in agreement does not have 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:06.420
 much more is simply this good as well 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:09.360
 that even shows us the pixels 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:11.500
 I am very good at doing that they do not look good 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.880
 200 meters 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.540
 but good so nothing ropes 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:20.360
 Finally, thank you so much for watching me 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:23.220
 I feel that having tutors who have it 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:26.370
 more and quite brief 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.440
 I hope you liked it and good and that 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.730
 I have already helped you next time 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.040
 we want something a little more 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:34.260
 complicated because this is very simple 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:37.430
 okay so thank you very much for 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.430
 see me and see you
