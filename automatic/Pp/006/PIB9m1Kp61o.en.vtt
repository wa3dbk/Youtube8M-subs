here<00:00:06.010> we<00:00:06.160> are<00:00:06.540> different<00:00:07.540> day<00:00:07.660> different

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:07.960 
here we are different day different

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.950 
here we are different day different
engine<00:00:08.620> and<00:00:08.860> a<00:00:09.400> different<00:00:09.790> technique<00:00:10.240> for

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:10.960 
engine and a different technique for

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.180 
engine and a different technique for
adjusting<00:00:11.440> the<00:00:11.559> valves<00:00:12.059> now<00:00:14.010> technique<00:00:15.010> may

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
adjusting the valves now technique may

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.140 
adjusting the valves now technique may
be<00:00:15.219> a<00:00:15.369> little<00:00:15.699> bit<00:00:15.820> different<00:00:16.230> but<00:00:17.970> it's<00:00:18.970> all

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
be a little bit different but it's all

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.420 
be a little bit different but it's all
basically<00:00:19.510> the<00:00:19.630> same<00:00:20.070> so<00:00:21.070> what<00:00:21.130> we<00:00:21.250> have<00:00:21.400> here

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.430 
basically the same so what we have here

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.720 
basically the same so what we have here
is<00:00:21.730> got<00:00:21.910> a<00:00:22.440> 312<00:00:23.440> v8<00:00:23.950> Y<00:00:24.850> block<00:00:25.410> it's<00:00:26.410> my<00:00:26.560> 58<00:00:26.920> Ford

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
is got a 312 v8 Y block it's my 58 Ford

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.190 
is got a 312 v8 Y block it's my 58 Ford
f-100<00:00:28.590> v8<00:00:29.590> our<00:00:30.010> 90-degree<00:00:30.940> blocks<00:00:31.270> with<00:00:32.169> the

crank pins arranged 90 degrees off from
each<00:00:34.390> other<00:00:34.660> that<00:00:35.350> way<00:00:35.500> you<00:00:35.560> always<00:00:35.890> have<00:00:36.070> two

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
each other that way you always have two

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.430 
each other that way you always have two
cylinders<00:00:37.060> at<00:00:37.480> top<00:00:37.630> dead<00:00:37.780> center<00:00:38.110> at<00:00:38.200> the<00:00:38.290> same

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
cylinders at top dead center at the same

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.060 
cylinders at top dead center at the same
time<00:00:39.630> firing<00:00:40.630> order<00:00:40.870> on<00:00:41.020> a<00:00:41.050> wide<00:00:41.320> block<00:00:41.620> is<00:00:41.860> one

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
time firing order on a wide block is one

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.970 
time firing order on a wide block is one
five<00:00:42.340> four<00:00:42.700> eight<00:00:42.760> six<00:00:43.239> three<00:00:43.329> seven<00:00:43.750> two<00:00:43.980> but

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
five four eight six three seven two but

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.410 
five four eight six three seven two but
I've<00:00:45.100> done<00:00:45.280> is<00:00:45.399> broken<00:00:45.579> it<00:00:45.820> into<00:00:45.970> two<00:00:46.120> numbers

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
I've done is broken it into two numbers

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.760 
I've done is broken it into two numbers
written<00:00:46.660> it<00:00:46.750> on<00:00:46.840> the<00:00:46.899> hood<00:00:47.170> here<00:00:47.440> and<00:00:47.470> we<00:00:47.680> have

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
written it on the hood here and we have

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.240 
written it on the hood here and we have
one<00:00:47.800> five<00:00:48.489> four<00:00:49.000> eight<00:00:49.300> six<00:00:50.140> three<00:00:50.410> seven<00:00:50.980> two

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
one five four eight six three seven two

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.240 
one five four eight six three seven two
so<00:00:52.239> that<00:00:52.360> means<00:00:52.630> that<00:00:52.930> these<00:00:53.530> two<00:00:53.590> cylinders

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
so that means that these two cylinders

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.430 
so that means that these two cylinders
are<00:00:54.460> tuffets<00:00:54.910> at<00:00:55.059> at<00:00:55.149> the<00:00:55.270> same<00:00:55.450> time<00:00:55.750> these

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
are tuffets at at the same time these

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.080 
are tuffets at at the same time these
two<00:00:56.739> cylinders<00:00:57.190> top<00:00:57.430> dead<00:00:57.640> center<00:00:57.940> at<00:00:58.030> the

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
two cylinders top dead center at the

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.360 
two cylinders top dead center at the
same<00:00:58.239> time<00:00:58.540> these<00:00:59.200> two<00:00:59.500> cylinders<00:00:59.980> are<00:01:00.219> the

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
same time these two cylinders are the

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.800 
same time these two cylinders are the
top<00:01:00.550> at<00:01:00.760> sentencing

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
top at sentencing

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.690 
top at sentencing
these<00:01:01.960> two<00:01:02.290> cylinders<00:01:02.770> are<00:01:02.980> top<00:01:03.220> dead<00:01:03.430> center

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700 
these two cylinders are top dead center

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.940 
these two cylinders are top dead center
at<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:03.820> same<00:01:03.970> time<00:01:04.210> so<00:01:04.900> when<00:01:05.080> one<00:01:05.290> cylinder<00:01:05.800> is

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
at the same time so when one cylinder is

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.650 
at the same time so when one cylinder is
on<00:01:06.100> overlap<00:01:06.670> the<00:01:06.910> other<00:01:07.030> one<00:01:07.300> is<00:01:07.510> on

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
on overlap the other one is on

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.520 
on overlap the other one is on
compression<00:01:08.140> ready<00:01:08.620> to<00:01:08.770> fight<00:01:10.110> if<00:01:11.110> you<00:01:11.200> look

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
compression ready to fight if you look

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.590 
compression ready to fight if you look
at<00:01:11.650> the<00:01:11.740> diagram<00:01:11.920> that<00:01:12.550> I've<00:01:12.640> set<00:01:12.850> up<00:01:12.880> here

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.070 

the<00:01:17.410> two<00:01:17.620> cam<00:01:18.310> lobes<00:01:18.640> are<00:01:18.910> equally<00:01:19.240> spaced<00:01:19.690> and

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
the two cam lobes are equally spaced and

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.820 
the two cam lobes are equally spaced and
the<00:01:20.800> lifters<00:01:21.190> one<00:01:21.730> is<00:01:21.970> rising<00:01:22.690> one<00:01:22.990> is<00:01:23.350> falling

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
the lifters one is rising one is falling

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.310 
the lifters one is rising one is falling
with<00:01:24.550> the<00:01:24.640> right<00:01:24.850> in<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.030> middle<00:01:25.090> that<00:01:25.510> puts

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
with the right in the middle that puts

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.730 
with the right in the middle that puts
the<00:01:26.650> lobes<00:01:26.890> on<00:01:27.190> the<00:01:27.400> other<00:01:27.670> cylinder

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.210 

on<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:33.700> backside<00:01:33.930> not<00:01:34.930> quite<00:01:35.380> opposite<00:01:36.159> to

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
on the backside not quite opposite to

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.030 
on the backside not quite opposite to
toe<00:01:36.490> but<00:01:37.030> they<00:01:37.210> are<00:01:37.300> both<00:01:37.450> on<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:38.380> slack<00:01:38.710> side

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
toe but they are both on the slack side

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.250 
toe but they are both on the slack side
so<00:01:39.340> you<00:01:39.400> can<00:01:39.580> adjust<00:01:39.910> them<00:01:40.000> there<00:01:40.210> so<00:01:40.780> what<00:01:41.170> I'm

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
so you can adjust them there so what I'm

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.560 
so you can adjust them there so what I'm
saying<00:01:41.530> is<00:01:41.710> when<00:01:41.890> one<00:01:42.070> cylinder<00:01:42.460> is<00:01:42.820> on

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
saying is when one cylinder is on

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.710 
saying is when one cylinder is on
overlap<00:01:44.200> then<00:01:45.100> you<00:01:45.280> can<00:01:45.430> adjust<00:01:45.520> both<00:01:46.150> intake

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
overlap then you can adjust both intake

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.660 
overlap then you can adjust both intake
and<00:01:46.869> exhaust<00:01:46.930> at<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.440> same<00:01:47.650> time<00:01:47.950> on<00:01:48.460> the

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
and exhaust at the same time on the

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.580 
and exhaust at the same time on the
cylinder<00:01:48.940> than<00:01:49.180> this<00:01:49.270> top<00:01:49.450> dead<00:01:49.630> center<00:01:49.960> fire

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
cylinder than this top dead center fire

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.820 
cylinder than this top dead center fire
okay<00:01:51.220> I've<00:01:51.340> got<00:01:51.520> my<00:01:51.869> remote<00:01:52.869> starter<00:01:53.530> here

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
okay I've got my remote starter here

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.190 
okay I've got my remote starter here
this<00:01:54.220> is<00:01:54.400> number<00:01:54.580> six<00:01:54.910> we're<00:01:55.750> going<00:01:55.869> to<00:01:55.930> do

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
this is number six we're going to do

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.960 
this is number six we're going to do
number<00:01:56.440> one<00:01:56.800> so<00:01:57.130> we're<00:01:57.280> going<00:01:57.369> to<00:01:57.430> watch<00:01:57.640> the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
number one so we're going to watch the

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.800 
number one so we're going to watch the
valves<00:01:58.420> get<00:01:59.320> them<00:01:59.440> on<00:01:59.500> overlap<00:01:59.950> pop<00:02:00.280> it<00:02:00.460> over

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
valves get them on overlap pop it over

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.870 
valves get them on overlap pop it over
okay<00:02:01.810> that's<00:02:02.050> the<00:02:02.170> intake<00:02:02.530> just<00:02:02.770> closing<00:02:03.700> so

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
okay that's the intake just closing so

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.240 
okay that's the intake just closing so
we<00:02:03.970> go<00:02:04.300> around<00:02:04.390> again<00:02:04.830> watch<00:02:05.830> through<00:02:06.190> the

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
we go around again watch through the

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.690 
we go around again watch through the
exhaust<00:02:06.610> okay<00:02:07.000> das<00:02:07.300> is<00:02:07.330> starting<00:02:07.840> to<00:02:07.899> open<00:02:08.399> now

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
exhaust okay das is starting to open now

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.660 
exhaust okay das is starting to open now
exhaust<00:02:10.660> is<00:02:10.810> closing<00:02:11.410> intakes<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.370> start

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
exhaust is closing intakes and start

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.560 
exhaust is closing intakes and start
opening<00:02:12.880> they're<00:02:13.480> just<00:02:13.840> even<00:02:14.380> okay<00:02:15.340> when<00:02:16.330> the

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570

number five so we're going to watch
number<00:03:02.530> three<00:03:02.800> for<00:03:03.040> it<00:03:03.100> on<00:03:03.220> overlap<00:03:03.670> now<00:03:04.270> it's

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
number three for it on overlap now it's

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.970

we're going through the firing order to

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.320 
we're going through the firing order to
watch<00:03:08.200> the<00:03:08.380> exhaust<00:03:08.680> come<00:03:09.010> up<00:03:11.820> and<00:03:12.820> takes<00:03:13.240> just

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
watch the exhaust come up and takes just

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.900 
watch the exhaust come up and takes just
barely<00:03:13.690> going<00:03:14.020> down<00:03:14.170> there<00:03:14.410> even<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:15.610> three

barely going down there even the three
is<00:03:16.030> on<00:03:16.180> overlap<00:03:16.660> so<00:03:17.200> we'll<00:03:17.350> go<00:03:17.440> just<00:03:17.740> number

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
is on overlap so we'll go just number

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.040 
is on overlap so we'll go just number
five<00:03:18.220> number<00:03:18.700> five<00:03:18.730> is<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.270> farthest<00:03:19.630> forward

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
on the driver's side again we can adjust

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.380 
on the driver's side again we can adjust
the<00:03:22.990> intake<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:23.410> exhaust<00:03:23.590> at<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.130> same<00:03:24.370> time

next in the firing order number four so

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.440 
next in the firing order number four so
we're<00:03:39.250> going<00:03:39.340> to<00:03:39.400> watch<00:03:39.580> number<00:03:39.880> seven<00:03:40.420> for

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
we're going to watch number seven for

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.060 
we're going to watch number seven for
overlap<00:03:41.020> again<00:03:41.590> we're<00:03:41.740> going<00:03:41.860> through<00:03:41.980> the

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
overlap again we're going through the

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.710 
overlap again we're going through the
firing<00:03:42.280> order<00:03:42.460> so<00:03:42.700> exhaust<00:03:43.060> is<00:03:43.300> coming<00:03:43.600> up

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
firing order so exhaust is coming up

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.770 
firing order so exhaust is coming up
watch<00:03:44.380> it<00:03:46.680> they<00:03:47.680> two<00:03:47.740> are<00:03:47.950> even<00:03:48.520> over<00:03:49.510> here<00:03:49.660> and

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
watch it they two are even over here and

00:03:49.780 --> 00:04:07.510 
watch it they two are even over here and
adjust<00:03:49.840> number<00:03:50.320> four

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.580 

before<00:04:08.090> is<00:04:08.240> good<00:04:08.510> okay<00:04:09.280> next<00:04:10.280> is<00:04:10.610> number<00:04:10.820> eight

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
before is good okay next is number eight

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.020 
before is good okay next is number eight
so<00:04:12.590> number<00:04:13.250> two<00:04:13.460> is<00:04:13.490> what<00:04:13.790> we're<00:04:13.880> going<00:04:14.000> to

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
so number two is what we're going to

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.570 
so number two is what we're going to
watch<00:04:14.180> on<00:04:14.330> overlap<00:04:14.750> it's<00:04:14.990> over<00:04:15.260> here<00:04:15.680> exhaust

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
watch on overlap it's over here exhaust

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.680 
watch on overlap it's over here exhaust
is<00:04:16.760> coming<00:04:16.820> up<00:04:17.270> this<00:04:17.480> profit<00:04:18.100> there<00:04:19.100> even<00:04:19.760> we

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
is coming up this profit there even we

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.580 
is coming up this profit there even we
adjust<00:04:21.050> number<00:04:21.410> eight<00:04:22.720> at<00:04:23.720> the<00:04:23.840> block<00:04:24.050> camera

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
adjust number eight at the block camera

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:31.610 
adjust number eight at the block camera
here

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.750 

slip<00:04:32.160> fit<00:04:32.460> feels<00:04:32.850> good

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.570 

come<00:04:38.390> on<00:04:38.480> the<00:04:38.600> exhaust<00:04:39.250> okay<00:04:40.250> now<00:04:40.370> we're<00:04:40.490> going

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
come on the exhaust okay now we're going

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.160 
come on the exhaust okay now we're going
to<00:04:40.640> do<00:04:40.730> number<00:04:40.880> six<00:04:41.240> so<00:04:41.570> that<00:04:41.690> means<00:04:41.870> we<00:04:41.960> watch

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
to do number six so that means we watch

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.860 
to do number six so that means we watch
number<00:04:42.470> one<00:04:42.740> over<00:04:43.250> here<00:04:43.730> exhaust<00:04:44.390> is<00:04:44.570> coming

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
number one over here exhaust is coming

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.070 
number one over here exhaust is coming
up<00:04:45.280> get<00:04:46.280> it<00:04:46.430> the<00:04:46.610> intake<00:04:47.300> and<00:04:47.480> exhaust<00:04:47.540> Origo

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
up get it the intake and exhaust Origo

00:04:48.080 --> 00:05:05.080 
up get it the intake and exhaust Origo
or<00:04:48.290> on<00:04:48.410> overlap<00:04:48.860> now<00:04:49.700> we<00:04:49.760> check<00:04:50.120> number<00:04:50.480> six
