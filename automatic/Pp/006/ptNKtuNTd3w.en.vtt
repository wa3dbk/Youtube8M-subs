that<00:02:10.289> way<00:02:10.530> I've<00:02:10.830> done<00:02:11.069> most<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.549> that<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:12.269> I'm

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
that way I've done most of that so I'm

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.680 
that way I've done most of that so I'm
just<00:02:12.540> going<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.750> give<00:02:12.959> this<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.790> quick<00:02:14.790> chop<00:02:15.150> and

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
just going to give this a quick chop and

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.589 
just going to give this a quick chop and
you<00:02:15.780> want<00:02:15.989> everything<00:02:16.290> in<00:02:17.269> bite-size<00:02:18.269> pieces

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
you want everything in bite-size pieces

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.479 
you want everything in bite-size pieces
you<00:02:19.049> know<00:02:19.139> you<00:02:19.200> can<00:02:19.409> make<00:02:19.590> them<00:02:19.829> a<00:02:20.069> little

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
you know you can make them a little

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.380 
you know you can make them a little
smaller<00:02:20.969> if<00:02:21.239> you<00:02:21.359> like<00:02:21.540> it's<00:02:21.810> really

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
smaller if you like it's really

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.370 
smaller if you like it's really
just<00:02:22.900> your<00:02:23.080> preference<00:02:25.020> so<00:02:26.020> we'll<00:02:26.140> get<00:02:26.200> that

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
just your preference so we'll get that

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.760 
just your preference so we'll get that
chopped<00:02:26.680> up<00:02:26.890> I<00:02:28.140> don't<00:02:29.140> like<00:02:29.290> things<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:29.740> look

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
chopped up I don't like things to look

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.870 
chopped up I don't like things to look
too<00:02:30.580> too<00:02:30.819> perfect<00:02:32.190> it's<00:02:33.190> good<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.459> have<00:02:33.610> it

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
too too perfect it's good to have it

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.460 
too too perfect it's good to have it
really<00:02:34.270> natural<00:02:34.690> plus<00:02:34.900> I<00:02:35.020> think<00:02:35.200> it<00:02:35.290> gets

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
really natural plus I think it gets

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.050 
really natural plus I think it gets
intimidating<00:02:36.220> sometimes<00:02:36.430> when<00:02:36.819> you<00:02:36.910> don't

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
intimidating sometimes when you don't

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.150 
intimidating sometimes when you don't
really<00:02:37.840> know<00:02:37.930> how<00:02:38.050> to<00:02:38.110> use<00:02:38.200> a<00:02:38.350> knife<00:02:38.650> that<00:02:38.950> you

green<00:03:25.900> peas<00:03:26.140> they've<00:03:26.470> been<00:03:26.650> thought<00:03:26.860> out

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
green peas they've been thought out

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.190 
green peas they've been thought out
those<00:03:28.780> look<00:03:28.989> really<00:03:29.019> good<00:03:31.019> we're<00:03:32.019> going<00:03:32.110> to

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
those look really good we're going to

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.120 
those look really good we're going to
mix<00:03:32.890> this<00:03:33.010> all<00:03:33.310> together<00:03:33.489> again<00:03:34.829> you<00:03:35.829> can<00:03:35.980> see

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
mix this all together again you can see

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.720 
mix this all together again you can see
that<00:03:36.160> to<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.930> tabbouleh<00:03:38.380> like<00:03:39.329> quinoa<00:03:40.329> there

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
it's so it's a little corkscrew kind of

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.280 
it's so it's a little corkscrew kind of
look<00:03:45.340> to<00:03:45.370> it<00:03:45.640> it's<00:03:46.000> really<00:03:46.390> good<00:03:46.690> we'll<00:03:47.140> get

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
look to it it's really good we'll get

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.680 
look to it it's really good we'll get
that<00:03:47.410> all<00:03:47.590> incorporated<00:03:48.190> now<00:03:48.940> I'm<00:03:49.090> going<00:03:49.360> to

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
dressing that some of our sea salt I'm

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.250 
dressing that some of our sea salt I'm
not<00:04:03.040> going<00:04:03.220> to<00:04:03.310> use<00:04:03.430> a<00:04:03.459> lot<00:04:03.820> of<00:04:03.850> salt<00:04:04.269> you<00:04:05.140> know

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
not going to use a lot of salt you know

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.810 
not going to use a lot of salt you know
when<00:04:05.440> you<00:04:05.530> do<00:04:05.829> a<00:04:05.860> couple<00:04:06.190> of<00:04:06.280> grains<00:04:06.459> of<00:04:06.670> salt

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
when you do a couple of grains of salt

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.460 
when you do a couple of grains of salt
it's<00:04:07.090> only<00:04:07.329> about<00:04:07.450> a<00:04:07.630> quarter<00:04:08.019> of<00:04:08.170> a<00:04:08.290> teaspoon

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
it's only about a quarter of a teaspoon

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.060 
it's only about a quarter of a teaspoon
but<00:04:08.860> that<00:04:09.010> is<00:04:09.190> sea<00:04:09.430> salt<00:04:09.760> I<00:04:10.030> don't<00:04:10.480> like<00:04:10.630> to<00:04:10.660> use

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
but that is sea salt I don't like to use
