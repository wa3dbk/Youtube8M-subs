00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello good morning let's go 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.210
 getting ready for our parties 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:13.410
 Christmas and today we are going to make some 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:16.260
 christmas spheres recycling cans of 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.509
 minimum I hope that my work you like and 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.720
 Share it and the materials we're going 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:26.810
 to use would be aluminum cans 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.810
 pins chaquira shakiro 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:33.710
 a unicel or styrofoam ball 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.710
 a drilling machine 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.610
 if you read with scissors and it would be all and we're going 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.610
 to start 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.070
 first we will cut our can and 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.110
 having what is the middle part 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.469
 of the can we are going to make 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.649
 our little flowers with my hole punch 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:56.170
 but if you do not have a drill 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.559
 then you can cut them in a circular 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.019
 they would also look nice it would not be the 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.320
 flower shape but you would be very 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:08.470
 all right 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.470
 and then we keep cutting flowers 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.630
 and good already having our little flowers 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:39.810
 cut we're going to take a chaquira 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:43.500
 we introduce it to the pin 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.860
 then we use a chat iron and go 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.350
 to put our pin in the middle of the 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.460
 flower and so we will be doing 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:57.689
 all our little flowers and put them in 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.960
 some or some unicel so that the 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.490
 have ready to follow 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.909
 the next step 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.190
 and all this is repetitive and only 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:13.780
 is to put 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:17.550
 the beating elsa quiroz on the pin and 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.550
 the little flower and that's how we're going 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.310
 now we will only paint our ball 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.400
 of unicel 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.420
 you will not fall like me and more 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.310
 things 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.489
 well let's be painting our 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:47.040
 music ball we are going to paint it very very 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.040
 well and we wait for it to dry 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.470
 we cut 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.340
 We will cut approximately 20 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.930
 centimeters 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.480
 more or less and we cut our cord 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.959
 quoted that I missed 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.110
 of circus in the materials and we're going to 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:17.530
 take a pin and we will introduce it 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.290
 In our Styrofoam ball we are going to 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.549
 apply a little bit of silicon so that 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.549
 be well subject 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.020
 I felt that I was missing a little bit of 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.470
 firmness then 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:41.240
 another the filet and apply silicone and 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:44.150
 came in and you're ready cut me and now 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:47.570
 well you know this is too much 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:51.410
 repetitive but let's take our 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:56.390
 little flowers we apply silicon in the 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:59.030
 puntita and we introduce our pin 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:03.740
 with the flowers we already have 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:08.290
 prepared and then I tell you almost 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:12.400
 our Navi sphere would be ready 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.400
 recycling cans of some 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.500

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.870

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:47.170
