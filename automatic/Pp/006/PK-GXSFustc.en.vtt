hi there DW Berman here with another

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.059 
hi there DW Berman here with another
light<00:00:03.360> wave<00:00:03.659> video<00:00:04.049> this<00:00:04.380> will<00:00:04.710> be<00:00:04.830> a<00:00:04.859> short

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
light wave video this will be a short

light wave video this will be a short
one<00:00:05.430> I<00:00:06.350> think<00:00:07.350> they<00:00:08.280> tend<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:08.820> go<00:00:08.970> longer<00:00:09.269> than

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
one I think they tend to go longer than

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.570 
one I think they tend to go longer than
I<00:00:09.510> expect<00:00:09.840> them<00:00:09.929> to<00:00:10.080> sometimes<00:00:10.469> what<00:00:11.340> I<00:00:11.370> have

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
I expect them to sometimes what I have

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.240 
I expect them to sometimes what I have
here<00:00:11.790> is<00:00:11.849> I<00:00:12.059> have<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.630> sphere<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.590> just<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.070> ball

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
here is I have a sphere is just the ball

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.510 
here is I have a sphere is just the ball
and<00:00:14.660> if<00:00:15.660> i<00:00:15.780> uncheck<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.920> smoothing<00:00:17.369> you'll

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
and if i uncheck the smoothing you'll

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.790 
and if i uncheck the smoothing you'll
see<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:17.730> have<00:00:18.330> all<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.930> facets<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.439> make<00:00:19.650> up

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
see I have all the facets that make up

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.570 
see I have all the facets that make up
the<00:00:19.949> ball<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.449> what<00:00:21.449> if<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.750> would<00:00:22.199> be<00:00:22.619> what<00:00:23.490> if

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
the ball and what if it would be what if

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.040 
the ball and what if it would be what if
you<00:00:23.699> wanted<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.029> kind<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.300> blend<00:00:24.600> between

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
you wanted to kind of blend between

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.679 
you wanted to kind of blend between
these<00:00:25.590> two<00:00:25.800> things<00:00:26.130> how<00:00:26.820> would<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.119> do<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.300> I

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
these two things how would you do that I

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.560 
these two things how would you do that I

had<00:00:36.960> an<00:00:37.140> example<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.770> there<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.100> kind<00:00:38.280> of

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
had an example in there that kind of

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.670 
had an example in there that kind of
gave<00:00:38.489> me<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.640> idea<00:00:38.910> for<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:40.140> basically

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
gave me the idea for this so basically

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.560 
gave me the idea for this so basically
what<00:00:40.890> I'm<00:00:40.980> doing<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.219> I'm<00:00:41.550> running<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:42.210> spot

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570

and<00:00:47.370> i<00:00:47.460> ran<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.700> geometric<00:00:48.329> normal<00:00:48.690> into<00:00:49.050> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
and i ran the geometric normal into the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.319 
and i ran the geometric normal into the
background<00:00:50.100> color<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.520> mixer<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.090> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
background color of a mixer and the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.240 
background color of a mixer and the
smooth<00:00:51.629> normal<00:00:52.110> into<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.559> foreground<00:00:52.829> color

smooth normal into the foreground color

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.540 
smooth normal into the foreground color
of<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> mixer<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.320> i<00:00:55.320> have<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.980> going<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.520> a

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
of the mixer and i have that going to a

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.569 
of the mixer and i have that going to a
transform<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.719> into<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:59.010> normal<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.520> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
transform and into the normal and the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.369 
transform and into the normal and the
reason<00:00:59.879> for<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.239> transform<00:01:00.780> node<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.289> that

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
reason for the transform node and that

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.750 
reason for the transform node and that
is<00:01:01.559> under<00:01:02.100> math<00:01:02.480> vector<00:01:03.710> transform<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.920> i

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
is under math vector transform is i

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.920 
is under math vector transform is i
can't<00:01:06.000> directly<00:01:06.720> plug<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.409> red<00:01:08.159> channel<00:01:08.930> into

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
can't directly plug a red channel into

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.800 
can't directly plug a red channel into
the<00:01:10.500> blue<00:01:10.950> output<00:01:11.549> into<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.450> normal<00:01:12.600> output

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
the blue output into the normal output

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.270 
the blue output into the normal output
so<00:01:13.049> i<00:01:13.080> have<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.290> run<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.560> through<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.770> transform

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
so i have to run it through a transform

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.230 
so i have to run it through a transform
node<00:01:14.869> but<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:16.049> lets<00:01:16.229> me<00:01:16.320> do<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:16.740> lets<00:01:16.979> me

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
node but this lets me do is this lets me

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.520 
node but this lets me do is this lets me
kind<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.590> change<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.770> opacity<00:01:19.860> on<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:21.530> on

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
kind of change the opacity on this on

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.480 
kind of change the opacity on this on
this<00:01:23.180> faceted<00:01:24.770> version<00:01:25.770> like<00:01:26.040> i'm<00:01:26.220> blending

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
this faceted version like i'm blending

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.819 
this faceted version like i'm blending
between<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.240> geometric<00:01:27.960> normal<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
between the geometric normal and the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.569 
between the geometric normal and the
smooth<00:01:29.220> normal<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:31.250> that's<00:01:32.250> kind<00:01:32.520> of

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
smooth normal and that's kind of

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.910 
smooth normal and that's kind of
interesting<00:01:33.060> i<00:01:33.540> can<00:01:33.900> make<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.170> fifty<00:01:34.619> percent

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
interesting i can make it fifty percent

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.830 
interesting i can make it fifty percent
so<00:01:35.159> it's<00:01:35.310> kind<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.700> smooth<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.270> can<00:01:36.329> still<00:01:36.689> see

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
so it's kind of smooth you can still see

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.819 
so it's kind of smooth you can still see
the<00:01:36.869> facets<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.670> can<00:01:38.720> you<00:01:39.720> know<00:01:39.840> pump<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.470> up<00:01:40.590> so

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
the facets I can you know pump it up so

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.260 
the facets I can you know pump it up so
it's<00:01:41.009> almost<00:01:41.220> all<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.700> way<00:01:41.729> gone<00:01:41.939> but<00:01:42.150> not

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
it's almost all the way gone but not

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.679 
it's almost all the way gone but not
completely<00:01:43.070> and<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.369> know<00:01:44.460> that's<00:01:45.180> cool<00:01:45.509> and

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
completely and you know that's cool and

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.020 
completely and you know that's cool and
all<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.049> if<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.680> want<00:01:46.920> if<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.700> have

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
all and if you want if you have

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.160 
all and if you want if you have
something<00:01:48.270> where<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.600> need<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.899> blend

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
something where you need to blend

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.050 
something where you need to blend
between<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.829> two<00:01:49.979> things<00:01:50.280> it's<00:01:50.579> probably

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
between the two things it's probably

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.060 
between the two things it's probably
easier<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.899> quicker<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.290> do<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.649> here<00:01:52.890> than

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
easier and quicker to do it in here than

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.420 
easier and quicker to do it in here than
it<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:54.290> render<00:01:55.290> out<00:01:55.470> two<00:01:55.680> separate<00:01:56.040> passes

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
it is to render out two separate passes

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.480 
it is to render out two separate passes
and<00:01:56.640> blend<00:01:56.820> them<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:57.090> post<00:01:58.250> however<00:01:59.250> since

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
and blend them in post however since

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.359 
and blend them in post however since
this<00:01:59.729> is<00:01:59.939> the<00:01:59.969> node<00:02:00.659> editor<00:02:00.960> we<00:02:01.890> can<00:02:02.130> plug

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
this is the node editor we can plug

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.370 
this is the node editor we can plug
other<00:02:02.640> things<00:02:02.939> into<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.450> opacity<00:02:03.719> instead<00:02:04.259> of

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
other things into the opacity instead of

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.219 
other things into the opacity instead of
just<00:02:06.409> playing<00:02:07.409> with<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:07.680> number<00:02:08.390> i<00:02:09.390> can<00:02:09.629> plug

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
just playing with this number i can plug

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.930 
just playing with this number i can plug
say<00:02:10.709> for<00:02:10.890> instance<00:02:10.950> this<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.730> have<00:02:11.819> this

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
say for instance this I have this

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.190 
say for instance this I have this
turbulence

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
turbulence

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.110 
turbulence
sure<00:02:13.349> hear<00:02:14.239> that<00:02:15.239> it's<00:02:15.810> just<00:02:16.260> black<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.739> white

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
sure hear that it's just black to white

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.190 
sure hear that it's just black to white
I'll<00:02:18.120> just<00:02:18.269> plug<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.599> color<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:18.959> guess<00:02:19.110> I

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
I'll just plug the color and I guess I

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.070 
I'll just plug the color and I guess I
could<00:02:19.349> use<00:02:19.530> opacity<00:02:20.190> or<00:02:20.400> alpha<00:02:21.239> I'll<00:02:21.930> just

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
could use opacity or alpha I'll just

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.530 
could use opacity or alpha I'll just
plug<00:02:22.290> this<00:02:22.440> into<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:23.099> opacity<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:24.209> can<00:02:24.330> see

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
plug this into the opacity you can see

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.839 
plug this into the opacity you can see
now<00:02:25.379> it's<00:02:25.739> smooth<00:02:26.640> in<00:02:26.819> some<00:02:27.000> areas<00:02:27.390> and

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
now it's smooth in some areas and

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.699 
now it's smooth in some areas and
faceted<00:02:29.849> in<00:02:30.030> others<00:02:30.269> so<00:02:30.540> if<00:02:30.690> i<00:02:30.870> scroll<00:02:31.440> through

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
faceted in others so if i scroll through

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.290 
faceted in others so if i scroll through
this<00:02:31.830> i<00:02:32.010> have<00:02:32.130> this<00:02:32.220> texture<00:02:32.670> animating<00:02:33.150> so

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
this i have this texture animating so

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.140 
this i have this texture animating so
you'll<00:02:33.599> see<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.430> smooth<00:02:35.430> areas<00:02:35.940> are

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
you'll see that the smooth areas are

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.390 
you'll see that the smooth areas are
changing<00:02:38.299> so<00:02:39.299> if<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.540> wanted<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:40.069> do<00:02:41.069> some

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
changing so if you wanted to do some

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.570 
changing so if you wanted to do some
weird<00:02:42.390> i<00:02:42.830> don't<00:02:43.830> know<00:02:44.040> what<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:44.250> want<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.489> use

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
weird i don't know what you want to use

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.800 
weird i don't know what you want to use
that<00:02:44.700> for<00:02:44.910> but<00:02:45.090> i'm<00:02:45.269> sure<00:02:45.330> there<00:02:45.690> are<00:02:45.780> some

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
that for but i'm sure there are some

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.780 
that for but i'm sure there are some
special<00:02:46.230> effects<00:02:46.709> kind<00:02:47.340> of<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.549> thing<00:02:47.730> you

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
special effects kind of a thing you

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.589 
special effects kind of a thing you
could<00:02:48.180> use<00:02:48.360> with<00:02:48.510> that<00:02:48.660> we<00:02:49.230> can<00:02:49.349> also<00:02:49.500> add<00:02:49.769> a

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
could use with that we can also add a

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.350 
could use with that we can also add a
what's<00:02:51.599> it<00:02:51.720> called<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:52.440> shader<00:02:53.030> shader<00:02:54.030> shader

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
what's it called a shader shader shader

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.890 
what's it called a shader shader shader
shader<00:02:54.720> where<00:02:55.049> are<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.940> shaders<00:02:56.940> diffuse<00:02:57.750> so

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
shader where are the shaders diffuse so

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.990 
shader where are the shaders diffuse so
I'll<00:02:57.989> just<00:02:58.019> plug<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.470> Lambert<00:02:58.860> in<00:02:59.000> the

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
I'll just plug the Lambert in the

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.270 
I'll just plug the Lambert in the
Lambert<00:03:00.360> is<00:03:00.480> basically<00:03:00.989> what<00:03:01.890> you're<00:03:02.010> seeing

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
Lambert is basically what you're seeing

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.309 
Lambert is basically what you're seeing
here<00:03:02.870> where<00:03:03.870> it's<00:03:04.430> these<00:03:05.430> faders<00:03:05.760> are

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
here where it's these faders are

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.050 
here where it's these faders are
basically<00:03:07.319> how<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.560> light<00:03:08.190> how<00:03:08.579> the<00:03:08.640> surface

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
basically how the light how the surface

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.910 
basically how the light how the surface
interacts<00:03:09.420> with<00:03:09.510> lights<00:03:09.780> coming<00:03:10.019> on<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.709> it<00:03:10.769> so

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
interacts with lights coming on to it so

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.039 
interacts with lights coming on to it so
if<00:03:11.069> i<00:03:11.160> plug<00:03:11.430> this<00:03:11.610> in<00:03:11.790> here<00:03:11.910> you'll<00:03:12.060> see<00:03:12.120> the

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
if i plug this in here you'll see the

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.110 
if i plug this in here you'll see the
area<00:03:13.380> where<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.709> light<00:03:13.980> is<00:03:14.130> hitting<00:03:14.579> this<00:03:14.880> is

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
area where the light is hitting this is

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.039 
area where the light is hitting this is
a<00:03:16.010> smooth<00:03:17.010> and<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.459> area<00:03:17.760> where<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:17.970> goes<00:03:18.900> to

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
a smooth and the area where the goes to

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.009 
a smooth and the area where the goes to
the<00:03:19.170> shadows<00:03:19.560> is<00:03:19.799> not<00:03:20.069> smooth<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.900> if<00:03:22.260> i

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
the shadows is not smooth and if i

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.930 
the shadows is not smooth and if i
rotate<00:03:25.019> a<00:03:25.079> light<00:03:25.350> around<00:03:25.639> you'll<00:03:26.639> see<00:03:26.700> that

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
rotate a light around you'll see that

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:33.890 
rotate a light around you'll see that
changing<00:03:31.370> see<00:03:32.370> how<00:03:32.459> it's<00:03:32.670> smooth<00:03:33.090> in<00:03:33.540> the

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
changing see how it's smooth in the

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.309 
changing see how it's smooth in the
middle<00:03:34.200> but<00:03:34.730> faceted<00:03:35.730> on<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.000> edge<00:03:36.319> and

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
middle but faceted on the edge and

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.809 
middle but faceted on the edge and
that's<00:03:37.500> all<00:03:37.680> kind<00:03:37.920> of<00:03:38.010> cool<00:03:38.160> i<00:03:38.340> mean<00:03:38.579> i'm<00:03:38.790> sure

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
that's all kind of cool i mean i'm sure

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:39.620 
that's all kind of cool i mean i'm sure
you<00:03:39.060> can<00:03:39.150> come<00:03:39.299> up<00:03:39.359> with<00:03:39.600> something

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
you can come up with something

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.229 
you can come up with something
interesting<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.260> do<00:03:40.380> do<00:03:40.680> with<00:03:40.829> that<00:03:40.920> however

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
interesting to do do with that however

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.910 
interesting to do do with that however
i've<00:03:42.239> been<00:03:42.870> experimenting<00:03:43.230> i<00:03:43.590> found<00:03:43.769> some

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
i've been experimenting i found some

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.090 
i've been experimenting i found some
other<00:03:44.069> interesting<00:03:44.340> things<00:03:44.790> i<00:03:45.079> can<00:03:46.079> /<00:03:46.889> pump

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
other interesting things i can / pump

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.590 
other interesting things i can / pump
this<00:03:47.310> if<00:03:48.060> i<00:03:49.049> want<00:03:49.230> to<00:03:49.350> make<00:03:49.530> a<00:03:50.000> pillow<00:03:51.000> defect

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
this if i want to make a pillow defect

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.590 
this if i want to make a pillow defect
around<00:03:52.139> all<00:03:52.350> of<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.790> polygons<00:03:53.790> I<00:03:54.090> just<00:03:54.420> need

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
around all of the polygons I just need

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.339 
around all of the polygons I just need
to<00:03:54.720> increase<00:03:55.319> the<00:03:55.380> opacity<00:03:55.849> and<00:03:57.230> you<00:03:58.230> know<00:03:58.290> of

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
to increase the opacity and you know of

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.020 
to increase the opacity and you know of
course<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.650> higher<00:03:58.859> I<00:03:58.889> crease<00:03:59.340> it<00:03:59.519> increase

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
course the higher I crease it increase

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.039 
course the higher I crease it increase
it<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.440> greater<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.620> effect<00:04:02.630> so<00:04:03.630> now<00:04:03.810> it's

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
it the greater the effect so now it's

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:05.870 
it the greater the effect so now it's
like<00:04:04.349> we<00:04:04.739> have<00:04:04.920> a<00:04:04.950> normal<00:04:05.190> map<00:04:05.519> on<00:04:05.730> there

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
like we have a normal map on there

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.759 
like we have a normal map on there
that's<00:04:06.060> been<00:04:06.269> painted<00:04:06.420> specifically<00:04:07.260> to

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
that's been painted specifically to

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.970 
that's been painted specifically to
cover<00:04:08.299> every<00:04:09.299> single<00:04:09.510> polygon<00:04:10.139> and<00:04:10.560> make<00:04:10.829> it

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
cover every single polygon and make it

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.800 
cover every single polygon and make it
puff<00:04:11.190> out<00:04:11.370> but<00:04:11.669> that's<00:04:11.940> not<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.239> case<00:04:12.419> it's

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
puff out but that's not the case it's

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.250 
puff out but that's not the case it's
just<00:04:13.079> puffing<00:04:13.560> out<00:04:13.799> every<00:04:14.220> single<00:04:14.370> polygon<00:04:15.260> so

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
just puffing out every single polygon so

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.599 
just puffing out every single polygon so
that'd<00:04:16.650> be<00:04:16.829> great<00:04:17.070> for<00:04:17.660> doing<00:04:18.660> a<00:04:18.900> quilted

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
that'd be great for doing a quilted

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.979 
that'd be great for doing a quilted
material<00:04:20.609> or<00:04:20.849> something<00:04:21.840> like<00:04:21.930> that

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
material or something like that

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.810 
material or something like that
especially<00:04:22.860> if<00:04:23.190> you<00:04:23.250> didn't<00:04:23.490> want<00:04:23.610> to<00:04:23.669> add

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
especially if you didn't want to add

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.560 
especially if you didn't want to add
extra<00:04:24.120> geometry<00:04:24.780> we

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
extra geometry we

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.300 
extra geometry we
also<00:04:25.990> run<00:04:26.860> this<00:04:26.950> into<00:04:27.190> the<00:04:27.280> negative<00:04:27.430> and<00:04:29.310> have

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
also run this into the negative and have

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.960 
also run this into the negative and have
the<00:04:30.550> the<00:04:30.970> concave<00:04:31.450> look<00:04:32.100> not<00:04:33.100> exactly<00:04:33.370> a<00:04:33.610> golf

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
the the concave look not exactly a golf

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.130 
the the concave look not exactly a golf
ball<00:04:34.330> but<00:04:35.220> something<00:04:36.220> similar<00:04:36.610> to<00:04:36.640> that<00:04:37.140> sure

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
ball but something similar to that sure

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.860 
ball but something similar to that sure
there<00:04:38.320> are<00:04:38.440> materials<00:04:38.950> like<00:04:39.100> that<00:04:39.300> and<00:04:40.300> again

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
there are materials like that and again

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.280 
there are materials like that and again
if<00:04:41.080> we<00:04:41.700> make<00:04:42.700> it<00:04:42.820> really<00:04:43.120> high<00:04:43.360> we<00:04:43.900> can<00:04:44.050> make<00:04:44.170> it

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
if we make it really high we can make it

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.360 
if we make it really high we can make it
really<00:04:44.470> pronounced<00:04:44.800> to<00:04:44.950> make<00:04:45.130> it<00:04:45.220> look<00:04:45.310> like

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
really pronounced to make it look like

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.630 
really pronounced to make it look like
those<00:04:45.640> are<00:04:45.790> deep<00:04:46.030> and<00:04:47.190> we<00:04:48.190> can<00:04:48.310> also<00:04:48.430> change

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
those are deep and we can also change

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.700 
those are deep and we can also change
the<00:04:48.760> blending<00:04:49.060> mode<00:04:49.090> right<00:04:49.720> pump<00:04:50.230> this<00:04:50.410> up<00:04:50.560> to

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
the blending mode right pump this up to

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.390 
the blending mode right pump this up to
100<00:04:51.190> if<00:04:51.670> I<00:04:52.210> know<00:04:52.990> a<00:04:53.320> lot<00:04:53.800> of<00:04:53.860> a<00:04:53.950> blending<00:04:54.250> modes

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
100 if I know a lot of a blending modes

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.880 
100 if I know a lot of a blending modes
don't<00:04:54.580> seem<00:04:54.730> to<00:04:54.850> do<00:04:54.970> much<00:04:55.170> but<00:04:56.170> subtractive

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
don't seem to do much but subtractive

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.980 
don't seem to do much but subtractive
definitely<00:04:57.340> does<00:04:57.520> and<00:04:58.030> that's<00:04:58.390> an

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
definitely does and that's an

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.140 
definitely does and that's an
interesting<00:04:59.560> effect<00:04:59.950> there's<00:05:00.880> another

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
interesting effect there's another

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.120 
interesting effect there's another
object<00:05:01.420> with<00:05:01.780> another<00:05:02.050> surface<00:05:02.560> on<00:05:02.860> it<00:05:02.980> that

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
object with another surface on it that

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.680 
object with another surface on it that
kind<00:05:03.550> of<00:05:03.640> has<00:05:03.730> a<00:05:03.760> similar<00:05:04.060> thing<00:05:04.360> of<00:05:04.510> course

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
kind of has a similar thing of course

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.630 
kind of has a similar thing of course
with<00:05:05.350> sub<00:05:05.590> patches<00:05:06.010> you<00:05:06.130> don't<00:05:06.280> really<00:05:06.370> see

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
with sub patches you don't really see

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.880 
with sub patches you don't really see
the<00:05:06.760> true<00:05:07.000> wireframe<00:05:07.570> so<00:05:07.900> this<00:05:08.710> would

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
the true wireframe so this would

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.970 
the true wireframe so this would
basically<00:05:09.280> really<00:05:10.240> only<00:05:10.390> work<00:05:10.630> with<00:05:10.900> a<00:05:11.650> wire

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
basically really only work with a wire

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.880 
basically really only work with a wire
frame<00:05:12.340> or<00:05:12.960> in<00:05:13.960> conjunction<00:05:14.170> with<00:05:14.530> another

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
frame or in conjunction with another

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.480 
frame or in conjunction with another
shader<00:05:15.220> that<00:05:15.460> shows<00:05:15.700> the<00:05:16.090> the<00:05:17.020> true<00:05:17.490> geometry

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
shader that shows the the true geometry

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.810 
shader that shows the the true geometry
but<00:05:19.450> yeah<00:05:20.350> I<00:05:20.620> just<00:05:21.460> thought<00:05:21.640> those

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
but yeah I just thought those

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.220 
but yeah I just thought those
interesting<00:05:22.330> if<00:05:22.480> you<00:05:22.510> look<00:05:22.600> down<00:05:22.780> the<00:05:22.960> arms

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
interesting if you look down the arms

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.510 
interesting if you look down the arms
you<00:05:23.350> can<00:05:23.380> kind<00:05:23.680> of<00:05:23.740> get<00:05:24.280> a<00:05:24.310> feel<00:05:24.610> for<00:05:26.460> how<00:05:27.460> you

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
you can kind of get a feel for how you

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.170 
you can kind of get a feel for how you
could<00:05:27.790> do<00:05:27.910> a<00:05:27.940> padded<00:05:29.580> padded<00:05:30.580> clothing<00:05:31.030> thing

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
could do a padded padded clothing thing

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.590 
could do a padded padded clothing thing
so<00:05:31.840> that<00:05:32.050> is<00:05:32.320> the<00:05:32.770> little<00:05:33.760> lesson<00:05:34.240> this<00:05:34.390> week

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
so that is the little lesson this week

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.300 
so that is the little lesson this week
it's<00:05:34.900> not<00:05:35.080> much<00:05:35.350> it's<00:05:35.590> just<00:05:35.770> basically<00:05:36.130> an

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
it's not much it's just basically an

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:42.000 
it's not much it's just basically an
experiment<00:05:36.970> a<00:05:40.290> fun<00:05:41.290> little<00:05:41.410> experiment<00:05:41.740> I

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
experiment a fun little experiment I

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.110 
experiment a fun little experiment I
thought<00:05:42.190> and<00:05:42.370> there<00:05:42.610> might<00:05:42.820> be<00:05:42.850> some

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
thought and there might be some

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.690 
thought and there might be some
interesting<00:05:43.360> applications<00:05:43.780> for<00:05:44.410> this<00:05:44.530> so<00:05:45.340> I

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
interesting applications for this so I

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.420 
interesting applications for this so I
hope<00:05:45.970> this<00:05:46.690> helps<00:05:47.050> somebody<00:05:47.260> get<00:05:47.890> some<00:05:48.070> ideas

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
hope this helps somebody get some ideas

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.270 
hope this helps somebody get some ideas
