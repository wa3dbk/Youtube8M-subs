00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.410
 today we are going to start a little 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.759
 worried about the program because 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.379
 unfortunately a member of the 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.099
 cobras and we regret and had an accident 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.759
 very strong today on the road goodbye 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.309
 Thank you 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.970
 he is physically well it has not happened to him 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.910
 nothing 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.230
 the car obviously that given some 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.390
 means up with pretty photos 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.960
 pretty hit but most important 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.759
 is that if it is not right and that surely 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.890
 let's try to communicate with him in 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.939
 a few minutes to tell us a little 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.920
 what exactly has happened 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.610
 because there are a lot of people worried about 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.070
 we included what was not 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.420
 going to meet a challenge what always 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.809

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.809
 videos 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.910
 and nothing from here the only thing that we can 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.910
 tell them that thank god you're fine 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.370

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.460

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:08.190

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.470

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.720
