00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:10.780
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:14.889
 Hi live band sen 3 minutes is finished Daniel 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:17.610
 Hello from Yoo Sung is now live band with me live drum 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.610
 Let's find out 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.800
 Let's start with the bike name. 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:30.330
 Yes Let's take a look at the name of each instrument 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.330
 It's a red snare drum . 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.720
 Yellow high top. 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:41.220
 It's a green, reliable ride. 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:47.270
 Oh blue Pro Tom. 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.270
 I heard the pace with the foot on top of the peanut. 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.010
 Now I recognize symbol sequences and discard aesim 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.360
 This is a crash symbol . 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.480
 Ride symbol image 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.920
 4 These are the sounds of each instrument. 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:15.299
 Here's how to hold a stick . 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.290
 I'll take a look at this grip. 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.360
 And so. 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.740
 It's a regular group to grab like this. 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.520
 Grips are common. 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.369
 We 'll practice with Match- Grip 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:34.109
 Let's find out about the basic playing position. 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:38.399
 Yes . When you sit on a drum set. You just have to remember a few things . 

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:39.600
 This is the most effective move to play with the snare centered 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:44.369
 It's possible. 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:49.409
 In the case of a right-handed arm, you play with your arms crossed in this way . 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.819
 It is because of the role of dividing the rhythm of the sub- rhythm, 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.759
 I need it. 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:55.759
 So, for example, will usually play a lot with writing hands 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:04.510
 Here is the law pedaling 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:09.610
 2 base also came in slightly raised position, rather than the state attached to the heel 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:14.550
 Babs can be much more relaxed 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.550
 If you think you get the number 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.349
 5 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:31.970
 Peer under the left foot to win less than or equal to the pedal taken place in other early states 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.970
 Sometimes I open up and play like this 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:47.270
 I want you to be proud of live band life. 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:53.440
 Yeah, if you see our paintings . 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.440
 Do you see this bold lines that look doegoyo When you think that a word 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:04.240
 Now there is the word into eight 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:08.830
 It's 8 b2 now. Now we have 4 battles. 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.510
 4 It is easier to understand if you match the existing front on the right 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:15.970
 There is 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:18.130
 4 When I play in a flowerbed, I get a high-end air bass drum. 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.880
 Because I spend a lot of money 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:26.020
 I have gathered more than one place. Please do not confuse me. 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.960
 I'll give you a simple basic playing tip. 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:33.280
 Yes. This pattern has the most basic belief. 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:37.930
 If you know only this pattern, you can play it in Korea for a long time . 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:42.450
 Before we explain it, let's give a very brief description of Vicks. 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.450
 You can think of introducing Buddhahood as Dahn. 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.120
 5 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:59.730
 It can be based on a 4/4 beat. Hi sl So in quarter notes 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.730
 I'm playing 4 bit. 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:10.310
 5 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.310
 If you play in the eighth note unit from the side more , it is called tap 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:25.480
 The bass and the snare are better able to grasp and accent the 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:28.090
 Put your high sl on your right hand. It's 4 b2 now. 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:34.510
 Still now 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:37.020
 Cook just outside the palace will now topped by 8 bits to the right eight times the word 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.020
 I will go in. 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:44.430
 High sm If possible, light and light 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:48.090
 And play this game by giving me the strength 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:53.010
 You can play the rhythm even more. 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:57.050
 If you play with a solid feeling to save the accent coming from the city 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.050
 You can play rhythm quickly 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:03.599
 Now it is. 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:15.100
 Yes, in fact , it's a name that has been uploaded to most countries. 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:15.100
 Let's play what we did according to Yoon Do Hyun's love . 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:30.080
 If you play it, you'll see it. 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:33.670
 You only need to remember this. 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.670
 Yes, I'll keep looking. 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:43.070
 You know I keep the same rhythm that you see constantly repeated 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.820
 Ah 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.090
 5 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.880
 2 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.880
 a 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.050
 U 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:36.700
 It's really easy with two. Yeah, it's not hard. 

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:41.260
 If we live band is playing live I'm coming Scores 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:43.330
 If you do not stick to your score, try playing with this pattern to the end. 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:47.620
 It'll be fun. 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:49.980
 Now let's go to practice and get into the attraction at first. 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.980
 that
