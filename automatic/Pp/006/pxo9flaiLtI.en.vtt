just<00:00:29.519> packaged<00:00:29.849> differently<00:00:30.619> um<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.460> would

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
just packaged differently um so I would

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.240 
just packaged differently um so I would
say<00:00:33.120> get<00:00:33.660> one<00:00:34.020> or<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.500> other<00:00:34.530> don't<00:00:34.950> get<00:00:35.070> both

and<00:02:03.260> he<00:02:03.800> could<00:02:04.070> not<00:02:04.220> tell<00:02:04.490> a<00:02:04.820> difference<00:02:05.360> at

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
and he could not tell a difference at

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.400 
and he could not tell a difference at
all<00:02:05.560> I<00:02:06.790> thought<00:02:07.790> at<00:02:08.090> first<00:02:08.119> from<00:02:08.869> swashing<00:02:09.259> on

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
all I thought at first from swashing on

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.410 
all I thought at first from swashing on
my<00:02:09.500> hand<00:02:09.740> since<00:02:10.490> this<00:02:10.610> one<00:02:10.789> is<00:02:10.819> for<00:02:11.270> the

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
my hand since this one is for the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.270 
my hand since this one is for the
Garnier<00:02:11.840> be<00:02:12.290> be<00:02:12.410> famous<00:02:12.680> for<00:02:12.860> light<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.160> medium

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
Garnier be be famous for light to medium

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.300 
Garnier be be famous for light to medium
and<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:14.870> youth<00:02:15.140> code<00:02:15.380> one<00:02:15.590> just<00:02:15.890> says<00:02:16.040> liked

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
and the youth code one just says liked

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.590 
and the youth code one just says liked
and<00:02:16.520> then<00:02:16.610> they<00:02:16.670> have<00:02:16.790> a<00:02:16.819> separate<00:02:17.150> ball<00:02:17.330> for

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
and then they have a separate ball for

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.120 
and then they have a separate ball for
medium<00:02:17.959> that<00:02:18.530> maybe<00:02:18.740> this<00:02:18.920> would<00:02:19.040> be<00:02:19.069> a

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
medium that maybe this would be a

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.570 
medium that maybe this would be a
lighter<00:02:19.370> because<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:19.880> have<00:02:20.000> extremely<00:02:20.890> pale<00:02:21.890> /

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
lighter because I have extremely pale /

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.880 
lighter because I have extremely pale /
light<00:02:22.820> skin<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.300> when<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:24.290> first<00:02:24.440> put<00:02:24.680> this<00:02:24.740> on

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
light skin and when I first put this on

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.170 
light skin and when I first put this on
looks<00:02:25.070> gray<00:02:25.190> dark<00:02:25.430> when<00:02:25.580> I<00:02:25.640> blown<00:02:25.850> it<00:02:25.970> out<00:02:26.030> you

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
looks gray dark when I blown it out you

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.600 
looks gray dark when I blown it out you
can't<00:02:26.390> really<00:02:26.570> tell<00:02:27.190> but<00:02:28.190> it<00:02:28.490> could

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
can't really tell but it could

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.479 
can't really tell but it could
definitely<00:02:28.760> be<00:02:28.970> a<00:02:29.030> lighter<00:02:29.270> for<00:02:29.810> me<00:02:30.250> so<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.310> got

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
definitely be a lighter for me so I got

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.130 
definitely be a lighter for me so I got
kind<00:02:31.700> of<00:02:31.820> excited<00:02:31.880> like<00:02:32.270> well<00:02:32.420> maybe<00:02:32.510> you<00:02:33.050> know

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
kind of excited like well maybe you know

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.300 
kind of excited like well maybe you know
that'll<00:02:33.440> be<00:02:33.530> different<00:02:33.860> but<00:02:33.980> they're

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
that'll be different but they're

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.880 
that'll be different but they're
identical<00:02:35.000> when<00:02:35.780> you<00:02:35.900> blend<00:02:36.110> them<00:02:36.290> in<00:02:36.470> so<00:02:36.830> you

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
identical when you blend them in so you

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.290 
identical when you blend them in so you
can't<00:02:37.370> even<00:02:37.550> tell<00:02:37.670> you<00:02:37.700> could<00:02:37.910> put<00:02:38.030> this<00:02:38.150> one

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
can't even tell you could put this one

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.370 
can't even tell you could put this one
to<00:02:38.390> have<00:02:38.510> your<00:02:38.660> face<00:02:38.810> this<00:02:39.020> one<00:02:39.200> on<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.320> other

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
to have your face this one on the other

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.660 
to have your face this one on the other
half<00:02:39.680> and<00:02:40.209> no<00:02:41.209> one<00:02:41.390> would<00:02:41.660> know<00:02:42.220> so<00:02:43.220> that<00:02:43.580> was

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
half and no one would know so that was

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.370 
half and no one would know so that was
time<00:02:43.820> a<00:02:43.850> bummer<00:02:44.120> I<00:02:44.420> still<00:02:44.930> think<00:02:45.110> this<00:02:45.200> is<00:02:45.260> a

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
time a bummer I still think this is a

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.570 
time a bummer I still think this is a
great<00:02:45.500> product<00:02:45.800> they're<00:02:46.220> both<00:02:46.340> great

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
great product they're both great

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.900 
great product they're both great
processes<00:02:47.090> are<00:02:47.180> both<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:47.390> same<00:02:47.420> product<00:02:48.019> I

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
processes are both the same product I

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.160 
processes are both the same product I
think<00:02:49.910> they<00:02:50.000> market<00:02:50.360> this<00:02:50.480> one<00:02:50.660> more<00:02:50.989> for

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
think they market this one more for

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.780 
think they market this one more for
anti-aging<00:02:51.560> because<00:02:52.010> it's<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.310> youth<00:02:52.459> code

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
anti-aging because it's the youth code

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.229 
anti-aging because it's the youth code
and<00:02:53.239> then<00:02:54.519> there<00:02:55.519> are<00:02:55.580> new<00:02:55.730> Buick<00:02:55.970> erm<00:02:56.150> I<00:02:56.209> think
