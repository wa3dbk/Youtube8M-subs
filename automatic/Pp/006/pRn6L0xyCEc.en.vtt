00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
this isn't working it's probably because

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.240 
this isn't working it's probably because
you<00:02:44.720> have<00:02:44.840> hidden<00:02:45.050> files<00:02:45.440> turned<00:02:45.830> off<00:02:46.010> because

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
you have hidden files turned off because

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.240 
you have hidden files turned off because
if<00:02:47.030> an<00:02:47.540> average<00:02:47.870> user<00:02:48.140> has<00:02:48.410> it<00:02:48.590> turned<00:02:48.770> on<00:02:48.890> they

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
if an average user has it turned on they

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.640 
if an average user has it turned on they
might<00:02:49.459> go<00:02:49.670> into<00:02:49.820> the<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.900> computer<00:02:51.350> and<00:02:51.530> they

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
might go into the the computer and they

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.350 
might go into the the computer and they
could<00:02:51.830> delete<00:02:52.040> some<00:02:52.400> files<00:02:52.850> which<00:02:53.090> obviously

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
could delete some files which obviously

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.660 
could delete some files which obviously
would<00:02:53.630> screw<00:02:54.170> up<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.410> entire<00:02:54.650> computer<00:02:54.950> so

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
would screw up the entire computer so

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.240 
would screw up the entire computer so
