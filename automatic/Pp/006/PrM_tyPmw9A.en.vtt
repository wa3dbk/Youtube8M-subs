single driver here which is about three
inches<00:01:24.060> four<00:01:24.450> inches<00:01:24.479> across<00:01:25.159> which<00:01:26.159> will

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
inches four inches across which will

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.219 
inches four inches across which will
give<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.820> your<00:01:27.030> sound<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.420> it's<00:01:27.570> not<00:01:27.689> stereo

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.310 
give you your sound so it's not stereo
but<00:01:29.189> again<00:01:29.369> it's<00:01:29.520> not<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.880> mono<00:01:30.390> speaker<00:01:30.840> with

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
but again it's not a mono speaker with

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.789 
but again it's not a mono speaker with
no<00:01:31.590> power<00:01:31.860> either<00:01:32.039> the<00:01:32.520> same<00:01:32.700> does<00:01:32.880> have<00:01:33.060> some

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
no power either the same does have some

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.830 
no power either the same does have some
nice<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.789> it's<00:01:36.330> a<00:01:36.479> pretty<00:01:36.659> good<00:01:36.780> size

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
nice to it and it's a pretty good size

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.300 
nice to it and it's a pretty good size
speaker<00:01:37.350> too<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:37.679> you<00:01:37.770> can<00:01:37.920> carry<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.250> around

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
speaker too so you can carry it around

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.460 
speaker too so you can carry it around
those<00:01:38.700> handle<00:01:39.090> take<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.899> to<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.110> beach<00:01:40.259> who

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
those handle take it to the beach who

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.190 
those handle take it to the beach who
takes<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.890> pool<00:01:41.100> um<00:01:41.420> and<00:01:42.420> it's<00:01:42.780> pretty<00:01:42.929> nice

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
takes the pool um and it's pretty nice

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.100 
takes the pool um and it's pretty nice
so<00:01:43.700> overall<00:01:44.700> i<00:01:44.970> would<00:01:45.000> give<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.420> about<00:01:45.600> four

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
so overall i would give it about four

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.899 
so overall i would give it about four
and<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.259> half<00:01:46.320> stars<00:01:46.470> wish<00:01:47.429> i<00:01:47.549> had<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.729> little

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
and a half stars wish i had a little

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.730 
and a half stars wish i had a little
deeper<00:01:48.330> bass<00:01:48.539> and<00:01:48.869> maybe<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.229> little<00:01:49.409> cleaner

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
deeper bass and maybe a little cleaner

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.800 
deeper bass and maybe a little cleaner
mid-range<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.789> terms<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.149> overall<00:01:51.299> sound

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
mid-range in terms of overall sound

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.230 
mid-range in terms of overall sound
performance<00:01:52.190> but<00:01:53.190> other<00:01:53.459> than<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.700> it's

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
performance but other than that it's

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.899 
performance but other than that it's
pretty<00:01:54.299> good<00:01:55.100> again<00:01:56.100> it's<00:01:56.250> not<00:01:56.459> rechargeable

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
pretty good again it's not rechargeable

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.609 
pretty good again it's not rechargeable
which<00:01:57.330> some<00:01:57.509> people<00:01:57.659> actually<00:01:57.840> like<00:01:58.259> because

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
which some people actually like because

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.570 
which some people actually like because
that<00:01:58.740> means<00:01:58.830> you<00:01:58.979> don't<00:01:59.130> have<00:01:59.220> to<00:01:59.340> worry<00:01:59.490> about

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
that means you don't have to worry about

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.130 
that means you don't have to worry about
when<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.179> rechargeable<00:02:00.569> battery<00:02:00.929> dies

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
when the rechargeable battery dies

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.370 
when the rechargeable battery dies
you've<00:02:02.069> got<00:02:02.280> an<00:02:02.580> anchor<00:02:02.880> at<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.119> point<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:04.020> do

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
you've got an anchor at that point I do

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.809 
you've got an anchor at that point I do
kind<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.770> wish<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.009> did<00:02:05.159> have<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.310> grill<00:02:05.610> cover

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
kind of wish you did have a grill cover

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:07.609 
kind of wish you did have a grill cover
on<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.030> because<00:02:06.420> if<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.780> poke<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.380> speaker

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
on it because if you poke the speaker

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.559 
on it because if you poke the speaker
obviously<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.130> can<00:02:08.280> damage<00:02:08.549> it<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:09.149> pairs

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
obviously you can damage it it pairs

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.750 
obviously you can damage it it pairs
easily<00:02:10.019> so<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.860> speaker<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.250> really

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760
