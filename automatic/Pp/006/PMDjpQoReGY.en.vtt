yes<00:02:47.300> I<00:02:47.330> can't<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:49.790> scanning<00:02:50.060> is<00:02:50.210> actually

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
yes I can't the scanning is actually

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.120 
yes I can't the scanning is actually
pretty<00:02:50.690> difficult<00:02:51.010> because<00:02:52.010> like<00:02:52.600> when<00:02:53.600> you

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
pretty difficult because like when you

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.650 
pretty difficult because like when you
move<00:02:55.130> your<00:02:55.280> crosshairs<00:02:55.670> up<00:02:55.880> and<00:02:56.060> down<00:02:56.210> it's

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
move your crosshairs up and down it's

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.100 
move your crosshairs up and down it's
like<00:02:56.930> normal<00:02:57.740> sensitivity<00:02:58.130> but<00:02:58.970> writing<00:02:59.750> left

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
like normal sensitivity but writing left

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.950 
like normal sensitivity but writing left
is<00:03:00.350> like<00:03:00.530> insane<00:03:00.920> sensitivity<00:03:01.640> so<00:03:01.960> it's

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
is like insane sensitivity so it's

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
is like insane sensitivity so it's
pretty<00:03:03.380> confusing<00:03:03.830> at<00:03:04.040> times<00:03:05.290> and<00:03:06.290> you<00:03:06.440> really

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
pretty confusing at times and you really

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.200 
pretty confusing at times and you really
can't<00:03:07.190> you<00:03:07.310> can't<00:03:07.520> write<00:03:07.760> it<00:03:07.790> on<00:03:07.940> all<00:03:08.060> this

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
can't you can't write it on all this

think that's it is it
yeah<00:04:25.690> I'm<00:04:25.870> just<00:04:26.050> you<00:04:26.229> know<00:04:26.259> I<00:04:27.009> guess<00:04:28.000> we'll

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
yeah I'm just you know I guess we'll

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.580 
yeah I'm just you know I guess we'll
just<00:04:28.210> keep<00:04:28.360> filming<00:04:28.930> and<00:04:29.050> you<00:04:29.080> can<00:04:29.259> watch<00:04:29.380> the

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
just keep filming and you can watch the

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.339 
just keep filming and you can watch the
game<00:04:29.740> play<00:04:32.550> more<00:04:33.550> like<00:04:33.669> game<00:04:33.940> suckage<00:04:34.389> the

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:35.349 
game play more like game suckage the

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:42.149 
game play more like game suckage the
controls<00:04:35.800> on<00:04:35.979> this<00:04:36.099> really<00:04:36.490> do<00:04:36.669> suck

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:42.159 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:44.559 

all<00:04:43.159> right<00:04:43.279> now<00:04:43.399> who<00:04:43.519> are<00:04:43.549> the<00:04:43.699> ally<00:04:44.089> but<00:04:44.359> I

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:44.569 
all right now who are the ally but I

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:46.089 
all right now who are the ally but I
think<00:04:44.839> the<00:04:44.929> axis<00:04:45.439> in<00:04:45.559> this<00:04:45.649> game<00:04:45.859> has<00:04:46.069> the

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:46.099 
think the axis in this game has the

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:48.219 
think the axis in this game has the
advantage<00:04:46.609> because<00:04:47.389> like<00:04:47.599> Call<00:04:47.809> of<00:04:47.839> Duty<00:04:47.899> 5

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
advantage because like Call of Duty 5

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.029 
advantage because like Call of Duty 5
the<00:04:48.439> mp40<00:04:49.069> is<00:04:49.299> really<00:04:50.299> really<00:04:50.599> powerful<00:04:51.039> more

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
the mp40 is really really powerful more

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.969 
the mp40 is really really powerful more
so<00:04:52.249> than<00:04:52.489> the<00:04:52.609> other<00:04:52.759> rifles<00:04:53.239> uh<00:04:53.769> it<00:04:54.769> actually

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
so than the other rifles uh it actually

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:59.019 
so than the other rifles uh it actually
said<00:04:55.429> triangle<00:04:56.299> which<00:04:56.509> is<00:04:56.659> now<00:04:56.959> jump<00:04:57.379> so<00:04:58.309> their

00:04:59.019 --> 00:04:59.029 
said triangle which is now jump so their

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:00.999 
said triangle which is now jump so their
games<00:04:59.239> and<00:04:59.419> this<00:04:59.539> are<00:04:59.719> all<00:04:59.839> fudged<00:05:00.289> up<00:05:00.439> yeah
