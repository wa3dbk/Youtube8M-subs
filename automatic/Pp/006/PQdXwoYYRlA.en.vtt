home screen is pretty much the same as
you<00:00:41.940> saw<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.180> put<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.690> lock<00:00:43.079> screen<00:00:43.260> was<00:00:43.559> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
same everything else is pretty much

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.400

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
going to be the same as well with the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.740 
going to be the same as well with the
few<00:00:49.770> exceptions<00:00:50.489> first<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.510> all<00:00:51.570> as<00:00:51.719> you

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
few exceptions first of all as you

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.170 
few exceptions first of all as you
notice<00:00:52.110> once<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.710> open<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.190> lock<00:00:53.399> screen<00:00:53.579> that

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
notice once I open the lock screen that

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.920 
notice once I open the lock screen that
the<00:00:56.239> camera<00:00:57.239> widget<00:00:57.829> actually<00:00:58.829> animates<00:00:59.340> now

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
the camera widget actually animates now

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.050 
the camera widget actually animates now
so<00:01:00.930> as<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.680> saw<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.670> actually<00:01:03.090> flips<00:01:03.690> in

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
so as you saw the it actually flips in

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.770 
so as you saw the it actually flips in
on<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.840> original<00:01:07.439> stock<00:01:08.159> sense<00:01:08.670> UI<00:01:08.820> from

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
on the original stock sense UI from

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.740 
on the original stock sense UI from
sprint<00:01:10.200> from<00:01:10.950> or<00:01:11.159> from<00:01:11.369> HTC<00:01:11.850> evo<00:01:12.150> hit<00:01:12.390> did<00:01:12.570> not

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
sprint from or from HTC evo hit did not

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.560 
sprint from or from HTC evo hit did not
animate<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.350> just<00:01:13.530> changed<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.130> number<00:01:14.570> which

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
animate it just changed the number which

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.999 
animate it just changed the number which
I<00:01:15.720> thought<00:01:15.900> kind<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.290> sucked<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.830> thought

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
I thought kind of sucked and I thought

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.740 
I thought kind of sucked and I thought
it<00:01:17.159> was<00:01:17.220> like<00:01:17.430> ridiculous<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.600> they

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
it was like ridiculous that they

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.020 
it was like ridiculous that they
wouldn't<00:01:18.990> put<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.409> there<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.939> but<00:01:20.939> they

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
wouldn't put it on there and but they

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.270 
wouldn't put it on there and but they
didn't<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.540> that's<00:01:22.229> one<00:01:22.470> thing<00:01:22.680> that's<00:01:22.950> an

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
didn't so that's one thing that's an

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.990 
didn't so that's one thing that's an
added<00:01:23.729> benefit<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.479> rooting<00:01:25.070> your<00:01:26.070> HTC<00:01:26.520> evo

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
added benefit of rooting your HTC evo

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.249 
added benefit of rooting your HTC evo
another<00:01:27.930> one<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.619> as<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.970> can<00:01:30.119> see<00:01:30.329> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
another one is as you can see the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.170 
another one is as you can see the
battery<00:01:31.740> icon<00:01:31.950> or<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.460> probably<00:01:32.790> can't<00:01:33.090> see

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
battery icon or you probably can't see

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.530 
battery icon or you probably can't see
because<00:01:33.540> again<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.409> camera<00:01:34.770> sucks<00:01:34.799> but<00:01:35.540> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
because again this camera sucks but the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.710 
because again this camera sucks but the
battery<00:01:36.780> icon<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.530> actually<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> number<00:01:38.720> that

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
battery icon is actually a number that

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.260 
battery icon is actually a number that
tells<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.110> how<00:01:40.530> full<00:01:40.920> your<00:01:41.159> battery<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.880> our

charge of battery is which is another
cool<00:01:45.180> feature<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.860> that<00:01:46.860> was<00:01:47.040> added<00:01:47.399> once

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
cool feature that that was added once

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.300 
cool feature that that was added once
you<00:01:47.700> root<00:01:47.909> your<00:01:47.970> phone<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.799> I<00:01:49.799> thought<00:01:50.250> that

other thing is that the pull down menu
actually<00:01:55.619> has<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.210> toggle<00:01:57.210> widgets<00:01:57.570> inside

than the stock i'm going to start one
and<00:04:47.730> I<00:04:47.910> guess<00:04:48.090> I'm<00:04:48.270> out<00:04:48.450> might<00:04:48.900> as<00:04:49.020> well<00:04:49.080> show

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
and I guess I'm out might as well show

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.090 
and I guess I'm out might as well show
you<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:51.140> so<00:04:52.140> you<00:04:52.200> need<00:04:52.410> the<00:04:52.440> mod<00:04:54.800> so<00:04:55.800> the<00:04:55.919> mod

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
you the so you need the mod so the mod

looks<00:04:56.340> like<00:04:56.490> this<00:04:56.730> pretty<00:04:57.150> much<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:57.450> same<00:04:57.630> but

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
looks like this pretty much the same but

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.440 
looks like this pretty much the same but
I<00:04:58.590> guess<00:04:58.830> they<00:04:58.980> modified<00:04:59.490> it<00:04:59.520> in<00:04:59.790> some<00:05:00.030> way<00:05:00.210> I

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
I guess they modified it in some way I

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.640 
I guess they modified it in some way I
think<00:05:00.690> they<00:05:00.780> have<00:05:00.810> smileys<00:05:01.500> now<00:05:03.320> that<00:05:04.320> you<00:05:04.470> can

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.800 
think they have smileys now that you can
add<00:05:04.860> which<00:05:05.370> is<00:05:05.520> cool<00:05:05.700> I<00:05:05.910> guess<00:05:06.210> who<00:05:06.480> I<00:05:06.510> don't

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810
