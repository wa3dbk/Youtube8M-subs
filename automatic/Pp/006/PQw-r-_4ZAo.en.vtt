we<00:00:17.640> basically<00:00:17.850> released<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.480> scratching<00:00:19.199> by

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
we basically released the scratching by

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.029 
we basically released the scratching by
itself<00:00:19.710> as<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.550> standalone<00:00:21.090> sound<00:00:21.570> cause<00:00:22.039> so

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
itself as a standalone sound cause so

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.890 
itself as a standalone sound cause so

capability of doing playback with it as

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.940 
capability of doing playback with it as
well<00:00:39.510> as<00:00:39.660> adding<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.110> file<00:00:40.550> as<00:00:41.550> if<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.910> would

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
well as adding the file as if I would

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:50.779 
well as adding the file as if I would
any<00:00:43.950> regular<00:00:44.219> file<00:00:49.100> and<00:00:50.100> just<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.460> can<00:00:50.610> see

devices because of a CEO we have that
capabilities<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:02.750> something<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.780> little<00:01:03.930> more

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
capabilities so something a little more

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.070 
capabilities so something a little more
exciting

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.270 

another<00:01:07.650> program<00:01:07.980> here<00:01:09.770> called<00:01:10.770> decadence

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
another program here called decadence

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.920 
another program here called decadence
it's<00:01:11.490> like<00:01:11.700> Final<00:01:12.090> Scratch<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.480> theory<00:01:12.810> when

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
it's like Final Scratch in theory when

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.110 
it's like Final Scratch in theory when
you<00:01:12.990> control<00:01:13.470> waveform<00:01:14.190> use<00:01:14.370> a<00:01:14.400> time<00:01:14.700> code

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.330 

actually<00:01:18.900> utilizing<00:01:19.440> the<00:01:19.530> same<00:01:19.740> time<00:01:20.040> called

can<00:01:22.500> manipulate<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:23.100> waveform

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.060 

I<00:01:38.750> want<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.899> use<00:01:40.049> more<00:01:40.259> than<00:01:40.320> one<00:01:40.439> book<00:01:40.740> at<00:01:41.009> the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
I want to use more than one book at the

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:59.680 
I want to use more than one book at the
same<00:01:41.130> time<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.520> have<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:41.939> ability
