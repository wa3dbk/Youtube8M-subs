here this exhibition I guess it's more
relatable<00:01:11.610> because<00:01:11.990> fashions<00:01:12.990> everywhere

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
relatable because fashions everywhere

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.160 
relatable because fashions everywhere
and<00:01:13.710> it's<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.790> huge<00:01:15.119> part<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.570> everyone's<00:01:15.840> lives

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170
