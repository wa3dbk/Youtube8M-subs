00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.109
 with new data to a new video 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.610
 very very important video this great 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:07.589
 generation of people and it really is a 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.719
 video that will not leave indifferent to 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.309
 nobody surely want all that a 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.589
 angel towards the console is already there in 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.299
 electronics already said at the time that 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.679
 the president had actually seen them 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.199
 of the transaction right to health 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:21.300
 district with which good no longer fits 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.300
 there is no longer any doubt that 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.820
 exist with which then we are going to ignore 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.400
 that theme already as a thing and it's obvious 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.259
 ok and let's talk about remedy 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.090
 developers of alan wake that good 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.829
 they already said a month or so ago that 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.629
 they were developing a game for the 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.640
 next generation and such it is presumed that 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:39.899
 can alan wake 2 is very very 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.130
 probable but good is not known by now 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.860
 nothing at all 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.230
 they've talked about the consoles 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.810
 specifically do not know if about not 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.100
 know about x 720 are respect are 4 what 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.680
 we already had access to one or the other 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.530
 anyway talked about the next 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.040
 generation in general have said that 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.290
 good that when a generation is made 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.489
 you really can not imagine what 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.500
 can you do the following have said that 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.810
 the jump is spectacular that the jump is 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.910
 incredible that the jump that is going to give is 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.220
 it's totally not going to everyone at all 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.410
 surprise and really this calls me 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.820
 quite the attention since I 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.340
 I raise the hype enough 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.170
 all that sense that I say the 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.890
 developers and so bad to the beast 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.110
 yes with I suppose a confidentiality that 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.180
 they have to have inside the kits 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.380
 because of you that in the kits 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.940
 development are distributed to 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.290
 developers and such is good their 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.330
 Fifth developments are a kind of 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.530
 very similar computers to 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.720
 characteristics that may have a 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.060
 console but never to the final limit not 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.190
 always low and not only not no to 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.479
 high so that it can develop 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.640
 no problems at first then when 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.770
 I've already left the Taliban testing 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.000
 raising the quality with which if I 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.220
 they are saying 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.380
 a power totally out of what 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.850
 normal or amazing evolving as 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.479
 want to call because he really calls me 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.280
 very much the attention I think so if 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.710
 this is true if they have not gone 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.860
 mouth too much is to say all this I 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.140
 I think of an amazing generation and 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.910
 really expensive not because technology 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.560
 it goes off and the technology is expensive we will see 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.450
 to see what they surprise us with but 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.100
 really I already have a lot of desire in 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.720
 see what can be shown of the truth 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.850
 I already had the short temper with the new 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.050
 generation and such I did not think to leave 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.900
 improve so very much very much 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.760
 very much but seeing this really 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.100
 Well, I want to see it. I want to see what 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.739
 really that they are really going to improve 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.030
 because if there are past games that are 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.950
 leaving villas look like fucking mother 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.090
 I do not know I do not know what I can 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.220
 I can really wait 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.140
 hyperrealistic graphics you do not even know anymore 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.870
 distinguish the reality that really 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.390
 Well, good but we'll see to see the 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.970
 jump they give if they are quantum like 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.500
 as they say or it is not and well nothing else 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.430
 kids that all again in the next 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.430
 video action approximation
