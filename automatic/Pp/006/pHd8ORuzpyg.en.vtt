00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.580
 we used to receive Portuguese and if you already have what it is 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.689
 required 

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:12.689
 after seeing

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.080
 but who he is to imagine the second book and be better than the first 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.720
 here is more reading than it has - character development is more 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.200
 smart and can still be more fun 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.790

 now what really matters to us readers 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.280

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.040
 eike that was exactly the same 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.290

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.019
 third person 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.429
