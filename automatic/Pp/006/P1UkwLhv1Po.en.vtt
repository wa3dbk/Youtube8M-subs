as<00:02:13.270> well<00:02:13.480> I<00:02:13.690> just<00:02:14.080> watched<00:02:14.320> a<00:02:14.500> video<00:02:14.620> on

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
as well I just watched a video on

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.030 
as well I just watched a video on
YouTube<00:02:15.670> about<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:16.150> vfe<00:02:16.600> mermen<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:17.740> I<00:02:17.890> had

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
YouTube about the vfe mermen and I had

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.710 
YouTube about the vfe mermen and I had
to<00:02:18.160> shake<00:02:18.340> my<00:02:18.490> head<00:02:18.670> it<00:02:18.760> sounded<00:02:19.000> terrible<00:02:19.300> and

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
to shake my head it sounded terrible and

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.080 
to shake my head it sounded terrible and
this<00:02:19.900> pedal<00:02:20.200> in<00:02:20.380> no<00:02:20.590> way<00:02:20.830> sounds<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:21.460> bad<00:02:21.700> so

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
this pedal in no way sounds that bad so

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.880 
this pedal in no way sounds that bad so
let's<00:02:22.600> give<00:02:22.780> this<00:02:22.900> a<00:02:22.960> shot<00:02:23.080> against<00:02:23.770> the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
let's give this a shot against the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.100 
let's give this a shot against the

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.040 
relatively low volume and my drive tone

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
will be the Paramount Drive by Emerson

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.470 
will be the Paramount Drive by Emerson
which<00:02:35.680> is<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.130> most<00:02:36.310> transparent<00:02:36.910> overdrive

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
which is the most transparent overdrive

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.540 
which is the most transparent overdrive
pedal<00:02:37.810> that<00:02:37.960> I've<00:02:38.050> got<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:38.590> it<00:02:38.950> sounds<00:02:39.280> great

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
pedal that I've got and it sounds great

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.550 
pedal that I've got and it sounds great
with<00:02:40.030> these<00:02:40.210> type<00:02:40.480> of<00:02:40.510> pedals<00:02:40.900> that<00:02:40.990> are<00:02:41.140> made

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
with these type of pedals that are made

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.470 
with these type of pedals that are made
to<00:02:41.830> either<00:02:41.950> push<00:02:42.250> an<00:02:42.400> amp<00:02:42.520> over<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.030> edge<00:02:43.180> or

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
to either push an amp over the edge or

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.110 
to either push an amp over the edge or
an<00:02:44.110> already<00:02:44.530> slightly<00:02:44.860> dirty<00:02:45.190> sound<00:02:45.580> they<00:02:45.970> can

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
an already slightly dirty sound they can

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.180 
an already slightly dirty sound they can
push<00:02:46.300> it<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:46.570> it<00:02:46.750> will<00:02:46.810> sound<00:02:47.110> even<00:02:47.530> nicer<00:02:47.740> so

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
push it and it will sound even nicer so

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.340 
push it and it will sound even nicer so
let's<00:02:48.730> give<00:02:48.910> this<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.090> shot<00:02:49.210> so<00:02:49.930> let's<00:02:50.110> try<00:02:50.290> this

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
let's give this a shot so let's try this

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.070 
let's give this a shot so let's try this
now<00:02:50.650> without<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.040> backing<00:02:51.250> track<00:02:51.670> and

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
now without the backing track and

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.590 
now without the backing track and
basically<00:02:53.080> I<00:02:53.350> set<00:02:53.950> them<00:02:54.070> up<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.490> my<00:02:55.090> ear<00:02:55.360> so

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
basically I set them up to my ear so

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.810 
basically I set them up to my ear so
they<00:02:55.720> sounded<00:02:56.050> the<00:02:56.170> same<00:02:56.250> volume<00:02:57.250> wise<00:02:57.550> as

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
they sounded the same volume wise as

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.210 
they sounded the same volume wise as
well<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.420> as<00:02:59.080> you<00:02:59.140> can<00:02:59.350> see<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.620> controls<00:03:00.100> are

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
well and as you can see the controls are

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.560 
well and as you can see the controls are
in<00:03:00.280> different<00:03:00.430> spots<00:03:00.730> our<00:03:01.000> different<00:03:01.300> pedals

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
in different spots our different pedals

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.650 
in different spots our different pedals
it's<00:03:02.050> not<00:03:02.230> a<00:03:02.260> direct<00:03:02.680> ripoff<00:03:02.860> so<00:03:03.430> you<00:03:04.360> can't

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
it's not a direct ripoff so you can't

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.080 
it's not a direct ripoff so you can't
really<00:03:05.160> expect<00:03:06.160> them<00:03:06.310> to<00:03:06.370> sound<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:06.910> same

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
really expect them to sound the same

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.000 
really expect them to sound the same
with<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.450> controls<00:03:07.810> in<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.050> same<00:03:08.260> spot<00:03:08.590> these

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
with the controls in the same spot these

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.650 
with the controls in the same spot these
pedals<00:03:09.340> definitely<00:03:09.700> work<00:03:09.850> best<00:03:10.120> pushing<00:03:10.570> an

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
pedals definitely work best pushing an

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.110 
pedals definitely work best pushing an
amp<00:03:10.930> over<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.290> edge<00:03:11.470> or<00:03:12.040> into<00:03:12.580> it<00:03:12.700> just<00:03:12.970> off

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
amp over the edge or into it just off

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.229 
amp over the edge or into it just off
clean<00:03:13.989> tone<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.920> Emerson<00:03:15.519> paramount<00:03:15.970> is

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
clean tone and the Emerson paramount is

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.120 
clean tone and the Emerson paramount is
as<00:03:16.870> good<00:03:17.050> as<00:03:17.140> it<00:03:17.230> gets<00:03:17.350> for<00:03:17.500> that<00:03:17.680> off<00:03:17.830> clean

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
as good as it gets for that off clean

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:30.080 
as good as it gets for that off clean
tone<00:03:18.370> so<00:03:18.700> let's<00:03:18.970> go

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.490 

so<00:03:31.090> that's<00:03:31.240> my<00:03:31.360> clean<00:03:31.570> tone<00:03:31.780> let's<00:03:32.230> try<00:03:32.440> the

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
so that's my clean tone let's try the

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:43.380 
so that's my clean tone let's try the
vfe

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:52.750 

over<00:03:44.390> to<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:44.600> clone

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.240 

that's<00:03:53.760> my<00:03:54.000> ear<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.780> vfe<00:03:55.500> sounds<00:03:55.950> a<00:03:56.070> little

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
that's my ear the vfe sounds a little

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:05.010 
that's my ear the vfe sounds a little
fatter<00:03:56.640> maybe<00:03:57.030> a<00:03:57.120> little<00:03:57.330> darker<00:03:57.690> sound

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:16.880 

and<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:07.280> VFA<00:04:07.640> pedal

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.190 

the<00:04:17.890> benefit<00:04:18.280> of<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.609> vfe<00:04:19.000> is<00:04:19.299> it<00:04:19.570> has<00:04:19.750> a<00:04:19.780> small

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
the benefit of the vfe is it has a small

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.110 
the benefit of the vfe is it has a small
trim<00:04:20.709> pots<00:04:20.920> that<00:04:21.010> you<00:04:21.100> can<00:04:21.310> see<00:04:21.519> the<00:04:21.880> little

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
trim pots that you can see the little

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.240 
trim pots that you can see the little
black<00:04:22.270> controls<00:04:22.840> there<00:04:23.110> to<00:04:23.710> really<00:04:23.890> thicken

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
black controls there to really thicken

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.340 
black controls there to really thicken
it<00:04:24.370> out<00:04:24.490> or<00:04:24.670> give<00:04:24.970> it<00:04:25.090> more<00:04:25.240> compression<00:04:25.750> but

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
it out or give it more compression but

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.990 
it out or give it more compression but
there's<00:04:26.770> something<00:04:27.040> about<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.430> clone<00:04:27.730> it

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
there's something about the clone it

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000 
there's something about the clone it
sounds<00:04:28.480> very<00:04:28.780> open<00:04:29.140> and<00:04:29.260> very<00:04:29.320> clear<00:04:29.710> sounding

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
sounds very open and very clear sounding

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.950 
sounds very open and very clear sounding
so<00:04:30.310> I've<00:04:30.400> just<00:04:30.430> cranked<00:04:30.850> up<00:04:30.910> the<00:04:30.970> gain<00:04:31.300> on<00:04:31.330> both

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
so I've just cranked up the gain on both

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.550 
so I've just cranked up the gain on both
of<00:04:32.170> them

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
of them

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.230 
of them
to<00:04:32.920> see<00:04:33.100> how<00:04:33.250> they<00:04:33.400> fare<00:04:33.670> against<00:04:33.940> each<00:04:34.060> other

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
to see how they fare against each other

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:50.490 
to see how they fare against each other
now

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:05:14.800 

yeah

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.320 

and<00:05:15.980> this<00:05:16.980> is<00:05:17.100> now<00:05:17.250> with<00:05:17.520> the<00:05:17.610> gain<00:05:17.820> all<00:05:18.150> the

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
and this is now with the gain all the

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.790 
and this is now with the gain all the
way<00:05:18.480> up<00:05:18.660> and<00:05:18.840> I'm<00:05:18.990> on<00:05:19.110> my<00:05:19.140> bridge<00:05:19.440> pick<00:05:19.680> up

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
way up and I'm on my bridge pick up

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:35.750 
way up and I'm on my bridge pick up
again

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.040 

so<00:05:36.760> let's<00:05:36.970> give<00:05:37.120> this<00:05:37.240> a<00:05:37.300> shot<00:05:37.390> now<00:05:37.690> a<00:05:37.720> little

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
so let's give this a shot now a little

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.900 
so let's give this a shot now a little
higher<00:05:38.290> gain<00:05:38.650> sound<00:05:39.040> for<00:05:39.370> the<00:05:39.430> rhythm<00:05:39.580> time

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
higher gain sound for the rhythm time

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.480 
higher gain sound for the rhythm time
and<00:05:40.180> I've<00:05:40.690> just<00:05:40.930> substituted<00:05:41.650> the<00:05:41.830> Emerson

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
and I've just substituted the Emerson

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.150 
and I've just substituted the Emerson
Paramount<00:05:43.420> drive<00:05:43.660> for<00:05:44.440> the<00:05:44.650> vomit<00:05:44.950> hound

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
Paramount drive for the vomit hound

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.770 
Paramount drive for the vomit hound
let's<00:05:45.430> give<00:05:45.580> this<00:05:45.700> a<00:05:45.820> go<00:05:45.970> and<00:05:46.360> this<00:05:46.570> is<00:05:46.660> how

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
let's give this a go and this is how

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:59.260 
let's give this a go and this is how
that<00:05:46.960> sounds

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:09.260 

clonk<00:06:00.270> idea

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.190 

back<00:06:10.270> to<00:06:10.420> the<00:06:10.510> rhythm<00:06:10.660> time<00:06:12.870> this<00:06:13.870> is<00:06:13.990> a<00:06:14.020> lot

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.200 
back to the rhythm time this is a lot

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.990 
back to the rhythm time this is a lot
more<00:06:14.230> pronounced<00:06:14.830> lows<00:06:15.040> the<00:06:15.340> clong<00:06:15.550> does<00:06:15.760> cut

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
more pronounced lows the clong does cut

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.120 
more pronounced lows the clong does cut
a<00:06:16.030> little<00:06:16.360> bit<00:06:16.480> of<00:06:16.570> low-end<00:06:16.950> but<00:06:17.950> that

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
a little bit of low-end but that

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:32.200 
a little bit of low-end but that
sometimes<00:06:18.340> works<00:06:18.790> let's<00:06:19.030> try<00:06:19.150> this<00:06:19.210> one

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210

both<00:06:38.540> of<00:06:38.720> these<00:06:38.810> pedals<00:06:39.200> are<00:06:39.290> great<00:06:39.470> they<00:06:39.620> are

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
both of these pedals are great they are

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.530 
both of these pedals are great they are
different<00:06:40.190> to<00:06:40.280> each<00:06:40.430> other<00:06:40.640> it's<00:06:41.300> not<00:06:41.390> a

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.540 
different to each other it's not a

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.500 
different to each other it's not a
direct<00:06:41.900> copy<00:06:42.230> of<00:06:42.590> a<00:06:42.860> clone<00:06:43.100> circuit<00:06:43.610> and<00:06:43.790> all

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:44.510 
direct copy of a clone circuit and all

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.120 
direct copy of a clone circuit and all
so<00:06:45.020> they<00:06:45.260> as<00:06:45.500> you<00:06:45.530> can<00:06:45.740> hear<00:06:45.950> they<00:06:46.070> do

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:46.130 
so they as you can hear they do

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.830 
so they as you can hear they do
different<00:06:46.700> things<00:06:46.730> but<00:06:47.090> they<00:06:47.330> do<00:06:47.390> it<00:06:47.630> in<00:06:47.750> a

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 
different things but they do it in a

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.630 
different things but they do it in a
very<00:06:47.990> similar<00:06:48.380> way<00:06:48.680> which<00:06:48.980> is<00:06:49.130> pretty<00:06:49.400> cool

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:49.640 
very similar way which is pretty cool

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.760 
very similar way which is pretty cool
too<00:06:49.910> the<00:06:50.330> vfe<00:06:50.690> definitely<00:06:51.050> has<00:06:51.200> more<00:06:51.470> options

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:51.770 
too the vfe definitely has more options

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.920 
too the vfe definitely has more options
to<00:06:52.220> climb<00:06:52.430> just<00:06:52.730> sounds<00:06:53.030> great<00:06:53.270> it<00:06:53.480> does<00:06:53.660> cut<00:06:53.900> a

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:53.930 
to climb just sounds great it does cut a

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.290 
to climb just sounds great it does cut a
little<00:06:54.080> bit<00:06:54.290> low<00:06:54.470> end<00:06:54.680> as<00:06:54.860> does<00:06:55.610> the<00:06:55.940> vfe

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:56.300 
little bit low end as does the vfe

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.480 
little bit low end as does the vfe
mermen<00:06:56.780> but<00:06:57.080> you've<00:06:57.590> got<00:06:57.740> the<00:06:57.830> option<00:06:57.950> to<00:06:58.250> roll

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:58.490 
mermen but you've got the option to roll

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.100 
mermen but you've got the option to roll
the<00:06:58.700> lows<00:06:58.910> back<00:06:59.180> in<00:06:59.360> if<00:06:59.480> you<00:06:59.570> choose<00:06:59.810> in<00:07:00.020> the

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.110 
the lows back in if you choose in the

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.570 
the lows back in if you choose in the
mix<00:07:00.320> could<00:07:00.680> you<00:07:00.800> tell<00:07:00.980> the<00:07:01.100> difference<00:07:01.220> I

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:01.580 
mix could you tell the difference I

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.010 
mix could you tell the difference I
guess<00:07:01.610> that's<00:07:01.970> the<00:07:02.120> main<00:07:02.240> thing<00:07:02.510> so<00:07:02.720> let<00:07:02.930> me

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:03.020 
guess that's the main thing so let me

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.450 
guess that's the main thing so let me
know<00:07:03.110> what<00:07:03.230> you<00:07:03.290> think<00:07:03.410> about<00:07:03.530> that<00:07:03.890> I<00:07:04.100> hope

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:04.460 
know what you think about that I hope

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.830 
know what you think about that I hope
you<00:07:04.550> like<00:07:04.700> the<00:07:04.820> backing<00:07:05.120> track<00:07:05.360> to<00:07:05.540> give<00:07:05.660> it<00:07:05.750> in

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:05.840 
you like the backing track to give it in

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.900 
you like the backing track to give it in
a<00:07:05.870> little<00:07:06.080> context<00:07:06.560> as<00:07:06.710> well<00:07:06.890> but<00:07:07.490> to<00:07:07.610> find<00:07:07.790> out

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:07.910 
a little context as well but to find out

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.490 
a little context as well but to find out
more<00:07:08.120> about<00:07:08.180> the<00:07:08.570> vfe<00:07:08.930> head<00:07:09.170> over<00:07:09.320> to<00:07:09.410> my
