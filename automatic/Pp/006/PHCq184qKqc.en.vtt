00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
one that's still on you can see part of

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.340 
one that's still on you can see part of
the<00:02:50.950> gasket<00:02:51.430> that<00:02:51.460> sticks<00:02:51.910> out<00:02:52.120> it's<00:02:52.960> painted

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
the gasket that sticks out it's painted

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.400 
the gasket that sticks out it's painted
red<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:54.490> tells<00:02:54.880> me<00:02:55.090> that<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.690> gaskets<00:02:56.170> on<00:02:56.320> the

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
red it tells me that the gaskets on the

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.810 
red it tells me that the gaskets on the
side<00:02:56.620> plates

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
side plates

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.530 
side plates
more<00:02:58.360> than<00:02:58.540> likely<00:02:58.780> original<00:02:59.530> that's<00:03:00.520> not<00:03:00.670> bad

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.590 

yeah<00:03:04.540> they're<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.870> push<00:03:05.110> rods<00:03:06.300> push<00:03:07.300> rods

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
yeah they're the push rods push rods

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.100 
yeah they're the push rods push rods
they're<00:03:08.160> lifters<00:03:09.160> they're<00:03:09.540> nice<00:03:10.540> and<00:03:10.750> simple

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
they're lifters they're nice and simple

they're lifters they're nice and simple
don't<00:03:12.100> get<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.310> engine<00:03:12.580> another<00:03:12.850> wash<00:03:13.060> when

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
don't get the engine another wash when

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.940 
don't get the engine another wash when
I'm<00:03:13.390> all<00:03:13.510> done<00:03:13.540> this<00:03:14.110> is<00:03:14.290> a<00:03:14.320> look<00:03:14.590> at<00:03:14.680> a<00:03:14.710> dirt

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
I'm all done this is a look at a dirt

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.340 
I'm all done this is a look at a dirt
around<00:03:15.130> it<00:03:15.730> was<00:03:16.330> absolutely<00:03:16.720> horrible

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
around it was absolutely horrible

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.390 
around it was absolutely horrible
the<00:03:17.860> first<00:03:18.130> came<00:03:18.430> in<00:03:19.950> looks<00:03:20.950> like<00:03:21.070> there's<00:03:21.280> a

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
the first came in looks like there's a

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.880 
the first came in looks like there's a
few<00:03:21.610> hands<00:03:21.820> and<00:03:22.000> mounts<00:03:22.360> and<00:03:22.620> whatnot<00:03:23.620> later

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
few hands and mounts and whatnot later

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.350 
few hands and mounts and whatnot later
on<00:03:24.100> I<00:03:24.900> can<00:03:25.900> also<00:03:26.110> see<00:03:27.000> there's<00:03:28.000> the<00:03:28.180> head

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
on I can also see there's the head

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.550 
on I can also see there's the head
gasket<00:03:28.870> man<00:03:29.080> that's<00:03:29.920> also<00:03:30.310> red<00:03:30.690> so<00:03:31.690> that's

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
gasket man that's also red so that's

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.680 
gasket man that's also red so that's
probably<00:03:32.740> original<00:03:33.220> as<00:03:33.340> well

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.840 

when<00:03:38.200> I<00:03:38.260> was<00:03:38.380> fat<00:03:38.560> ones<00:03:38.800> dance<00:03:39.100> name<00:03:39.490> is<00:03:39.640> doing

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
when I was fat ones dance name is doing

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.459 
when I was fat ones dance name is doing
really

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:42.469 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:45.240 

absolu<00:03:43.469> caskets<00:03:43.950> down

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
absolu caskets down

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.070 
absolu caskets down
now<00:03:45.730> I'm<00:03:45.820> going<00:03:46.000> to<00:03:46.120> try<00:03:46.420> and<00:03:46.630> see<00:03:46.780> if<00:03:46.870> I<00:03:46.960> can

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
now I'm going to try and see if I can

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.500 
now I'm going to try and see if I can
put<00:03:47.230> a<00:03:47.260> fuel<00:03:47.560> filter<00:03:47.740> here<00:03:48.360> because<00:03:49.360> suddenly

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
put a fuel filter here because suddenly

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.230 
put a fuel filter here because suddenly
what<00:03:49.750> stand<00:03:50.110> is<00:03:50.320> running<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.680> top<00:03:51.240> and

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
what stand is running the top and

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.330 
what stand is running the top and
because<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:52.780> past<00:03:53.050> steering<00:03:53.560> bracket<00:03:53.830> sort

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
because the past steering bracket sort

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.400 
because the past steering bracket sort
of<00:03:54.430> in<00:03:54.520> the<00:03:54.640> way<00:03:54.760> it's<00:03:54.910> pretty<00:03:55.030> pretty<00:03:55.510> clean<00:03:56.050> I

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.600 

kind<00:03:59.410> of<00:03:59.500> get<00:03:59.950> it<00:03:59.980> out

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.610 

you<00:04:05.360> have<00:04:05.480> to<00:04:05.600> take<00:04:05.780> off<00:04:05.960> this<00:04:06.080> bracket<00:04:06.470> get

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
you have to take off this bracket get

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.190 
you have to take off this bracket get
out<00:04:06.800> clean<00:04:07.100> that<00:04:07.450> and<00:04:08.450> then<00:04:08.600> put<00:04:08.780> an<00:04:08.870> inline

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
out clean that and then put an inline

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.140 
out clean that and then put an inline
filter<00:04:09.710> in<00:04:09.890> it<00:04:10.090> that's<00:04:11.090> only<00:04:11.270> a<00:04:11.420> gauze<00:04:11.980> filter

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
filter in it that's only a gauze filter

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.120 
filter in it that's only a gauze filter
so<00:04:14.150> I'd<00:04:14.240> rather<00:04:14.360> paper<00:04:14.780> element<00:04:15.320> one<00:04:15.470> it's

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
so I'd rather paper element one it's

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.979 
so I'd rather paper element one it's
having<00:04:16.370> Carvey<00:04:16.910> problems<00:04:17.330> when<00:04:17.540> I<00:04:17.630> wanted<00:04:17.870> to

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
having Carvey problems when I wanted to

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:25.510 
having Carvey problems when I wanted to
whine<00:04:21.340> well<00:04:22.340> I<00:04:22.370> got<00:04:22.700> the<00:04:22.970> glass<00:04:23.180> bowl<00:04:23.540> off<00:04:24.520> bit

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
whine well I got the glass bowl off bit

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.090 
whine well I got the glass bowl off bit
dirty<00:04:26.230> the<00:04:27.400> filter<00:04:28.400> gauze<00:04:28.580> isn't<00:04:28.970> too<00:04:29.180> bad<00:04:30.100> the

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
dirty the filter gauze isn't too bad the

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.730 
dirty the filter gauze isn't too bad the
reason<00:04:31.430> you<00:04:31.520> can<00:04:31.640> see<00:04:31.820> it<00:04:31.910> pulsating<00:04:32.480> just<00:04:32.740> see

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
reason you can see it pulsating just see

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.740 
reason you can see it pulsating just see
bubbles<00:04:34.130> coming<00:04:34.160> through<00:04:34.610> these<00:04:35.390> there's<00:04:35.720> a

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
bubbles coming through these there's a

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.720 
bubbles coming through these there's a
little<00:04:35.960> mental<00:04:36.350> and<00:04:36.800> down<00:04:37.040> below<00:04:37.400> so

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
little mental and down below so

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.250 
little mental and down below so
wash<00:04:37.910> that<00:04:38.150> out<00:04:38.210> and<00:04:38.660> yeah<00:04:39.700> yeah<00:04:41.020> that<00:04:42.020> will<00:04:42.140> be

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
wash that out and yeah yeah that will be

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.600 
wash that out and yeah yeah that will be
good<00:04:42.410> hopefully<00:04:42.620> oh<00:04:45.220> that's<00:04:46.220> actually<00:04:46.310> much

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
good hopefully oh that's actually much

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.240 
good hopefully oh that's actually much
dirtier<00:04:47.150> than<00:04:47.300> it<00:04:47.420> first<00:04:47.750> looks<00:04:48.070> the<00:04:49.070> whole

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
dirtier than it first looks the whole

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.870 
dirtier than it first looks the whole
base<00:04:49.550> was<00:04:49.850> full<00:04:50.390> of<00:04:51.640> see<00:04:52.640> a<00:04:52.670> bit<00:04:52.850> of

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
base was full of see a bit of
