00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:09.060
 folio 1040 g1 is the evolution of the 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.580
 Laptop family elitebook inside 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.560
 of the business world hp gets 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.300
 bring the mobile worker all that 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.180
 that in general lines is demanding 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.019
 as the lightness performance autonomy and 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.140
 security 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:24.180
 the new folio 1040 g1 weighs only 14 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.420
 kilograms with a thickness of 15 9 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.039
 millimeters turns out to be 7% lighter 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.289
 than the traditional elitebooks 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.750
 maintaining the characteristic finish of 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.550
 Magnesium alloy in gray tones with 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.010
 a cap that is quite resistant even to 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.649
 liquid splashes the screen of 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.480
 14 inches with a resolution of 1920 x 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.190
 1080 pixels 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.140
 the panel presents some anti-scratch finishes 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.430
 claire what favors its use in 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.770
 offices with lighting 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.780
 fluorescents mitigating the reflections in 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.809
 screen the model that we have evaluated 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.360
 integrates 2.1 core intel i7 processor 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.120
 gigahertz speed with 8 gigabytes 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.219
 of ram memory and ssd disk of 256 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.229
 gigabytes we can choose different 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.299
 configurations including the fact that 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.850
 the screen is tactile which we have 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.860
 analyzed is not the administrators 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.990
 of systems can acquire a fleet of 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.220
 with different configurations for 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.870
 facilitate the deployment of 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.210
 updates or replacement 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.460
 components has surprised us the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.780
 response offered by your trackback with 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.730
 which speeds up the management of the system 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.770
 by deploying gestures in his 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.810
 touch pad zone its functions are 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.979
 similar to those of other trackpad with 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.570
 those who control the cursor 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.390
 allowing fingers to slide 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.580
 slightly on its surface 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.320
 the folio 1040 g1 recognizes different 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.360
 levels of pressure to interpret what 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.890
 what do we want to do as marking the 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.410
 content selection or activate 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.970
 commands the exceptional response of his 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.190
 system makes us forget the fact that 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.170
 its screen does not allow touch operation 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.330
 It is one of the few factors that play 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.530
 against him in return have a 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.720
 wide keyboard with very good layout 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.300
 of keys which offer three 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.170
 led backlight levels 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.820
 different so that they do not affect 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.369
 negatively on the autonomy of the 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.140
 battery also the rest area of the 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.200
 hands is broad in order to feel 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.850
 comfortable during the writing process 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.229
 so fine design happens to certain 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.290
 bill to the connectivity section 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.450
 It has two 30 usb ports one output 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.160
 video display by a mini jack 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.580
 headphones and microphone and a reader 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.980
 card 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.300
 is to mark along with the team it 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.310
 provides an adapter cable as standard 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.590
 that enables an additional output of 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.690
 VGA video as well as network connection 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.210
 gigabit ethernet something fundamental for 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.220
 the company also have the reader 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.900
 of microsd cards and measures 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.180
 additional security that can 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.250
 implemented associated with the reader 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.690
 fingerprints with this we can 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.490
 get more out of the functions 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.650
 advanced allowed by technology 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.020
 web pro for management and administration in 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.370
 windows environments to the scanner system 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.200
 of fingerprints is joined by the 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.050
 possibility of using cards 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.970
 smart-card to access the device like this 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.560
 then the intel core v pro processor 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.630
 offers performance and systems 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.950
 security and management needed to 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.470
 be part of any great 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.240
 organization its limited number of ports 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.740
 and connections are partly alleviated by 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.840
 the external adapter that includes 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.970
 series as well as the docking that we can 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.470
 dock just we would add the 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.020
 possibility of tactile handling of your 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.850
 screen something that in business environments 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.260
 it does not seem so worrisome at least 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.240
 for the moment until the arrival of windows 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.550
 10 if you want to know the performance and 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.350
 autonomy offered by folio 1040 g1 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.190
