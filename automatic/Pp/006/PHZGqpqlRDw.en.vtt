00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:10.580
 I want to talk to who is not in command 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:13.129
 fool anyone 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.759
 when I said that a disaster happened 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.759
 Natural 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.260
 It's a lie, it was not the earthquake. 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.260
 typhoon 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.070
 because the truth is that you are 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.070
 hiding something there 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.380
 This will send us back to the age of 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.380
 stone 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.620
 God help us 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:02.930
 in 1954 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:07.330
 we find something 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.330
 those nuclear tests in the Pacific 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:21.360
 it was not tests were they trying 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:28.850
 kill you have no idea what's coming 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.850
 there will not be 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.780
 the arrogance of man to think that 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.780
 nature is under our control 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.040
 and not the opposite 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.690
 ae
