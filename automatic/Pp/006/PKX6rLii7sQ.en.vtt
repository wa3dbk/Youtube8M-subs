00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.170
 all right 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.370
 every year in different places of the 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.379
 world the salons of the 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.139
 automobile in this particular case 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:14.820
 we are in a really beautiful place 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.070
 in paris and we have vélez that we 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.890
 accompany to walk this room of the 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.890
 Paris car of 2012 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:32.200
 from the paris lounge of 2012 number 1 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.660
 of Argentine ball gabriel cordó 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.050
 Miranda from home, so to speak 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.820
 there is an interesting parallel between what 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.220
 that presents itself that I see that it 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.080
 present here and it is very quickly 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.430
 appears in argentina I think it's one of 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.170
 the strengths we have in argentina 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.200
 which is one of the markets where 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:54.220
 currently joan is better argentina in 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.140
 2002 is going to sell 85 thousand pesos against 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.080
 75,000 last year is a growth 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.030
 of the order of 10 percent with a 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.220
 Argentine market that with luck is going to 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.320
 grow 1 2 percent then the brand 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.979
 is winning and is winning is winning 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.560
 positions 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.720
 that is the end is the result but the 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.400
 origin of that is what you mentioned 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.520
 on your own I could glimpse in your 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.500
 question what is that what what 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.170
 Peugeot thought to redefine his 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.490
 strategy in 2010 that were basically 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.710
 two pillars rise in range means 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.930
 propose increasingly high-quality cars 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.450
 range in any of the segments that 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.620
 let's participate to be one of the pillars and 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.590
 the second one was 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.790
 be a truly international brand 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.350
 processes two pillars of development of 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.260
 peugeot for a dedicated thought of 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.030
 2010 then you go down to the 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.190
 different markets and the thing happens or not 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.950
 occurs occurs more or less quickly in 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.830
 our country happens and is happening from 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.710
 accelerated way because because from the 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.750
 2010 we present all the cars of 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.570
 last generation of pressure are the 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.610
 same ones that are in Europe then already 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.740
 In Argentina this is a reality 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.280
 rise in range if one consumers 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.020
 Argentine lovers or not of the brand 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.300
 compare today's peugeot with the peugeot 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.810
 three or four years ago and really not 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.210
 you can discuss the change that is being 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.240
 perceiving then that raises the 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.100
 image of peugeot and concrete returning 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.470
 at the origin one of the strategic axes 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.000
 Well, what is it to go up in the range but 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.470
 I hope it is accessible to all 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.860
 I think that what Peugeot achieves 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.390
 is to democratize the high range I like 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.830
 that concept because good when it 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.670
 always talking about high - end high 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.620
 range the high range people think of 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.600
 competitors like 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.520
 bmw is high-end I love seeing it in 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.950
 the magazine or see it in your program but 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.390
 I can not buy it ours 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.340
 our rise in we give something else is 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.130
 high-end cars that you can buy 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.040
 and behind us is the 208 notice that 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.650
 208 in the lounge the presentation for 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.810
 Europe for the world but this car today 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.610
 is a commercial reality in europe will be 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.580
 a commercial reality in argentina del 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.690
 2013 without replacing the 207 are over 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.250
 coexist the cars but let's say 208 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.590
 crystallizes the high end in the 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.570
 segment of the cars guys so that 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.730
 anyone can have a car 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.410
 high-end is proportional to its 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.750
 economic capabilities do not need 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.900
 buy yourself a 508 to have a high of 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:26.540
 range the 208 is a high range car 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.760
 as is 308 as it is 408 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.079
 I am about the high range 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.750
 possibilities of all consumers 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:34.519
 I loved that phrase of democratizing the 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.079
 high- end and effectively what is 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.670
 on our backs it is 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.439
 corroborating because seeing these cars 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.459
 imagine them in Argentina I think there 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:42.590
 many people who are going to get very 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.840
 happy if right behind our 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.970
 there are two special series that are being 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.950
 presenting in avant premiere in this 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:54.990
 paris lounge 208 7 and 208 xy are 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.840
 extraordinary special series 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:00.330
 what will make hearts throb 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.540
 I hope they hold that we're going to 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.540
 to have 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.990
 ah 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.360
 has always been recognized for its 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.050
 designs for their incredible designs in 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:03.699
 all kinds of things bikes bikes 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:06.940
 up skateboards and of exquisite quality 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:10.440
 in good taste but this you are 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:14.680
 watching is really amazing too 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.560
 pianos a piano peugeot style no 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:21.780
 only with lines really 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.780
 incredible but also listen 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.820
 unusual unusual to find in the 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:31.660
 motor show a piano designed 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.660
 for them
