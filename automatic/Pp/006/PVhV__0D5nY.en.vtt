right let's go on ahead and head to
orbit<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.440> see<00:01:01.559> what<00:01:01.680> we<00:01:01.770> can<00:01:01.890> do<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.760> now<00:01:02.879> that

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
orbit and see what we can do so now that

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.280 
orbit and see what we can do so now that
we<00:01:03.120> are<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.270> orbit<00:01:03.629> let's<00:01:03.930> pull<00:01:04.080> up<00:01:04.170> our

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
we are in orbit let's pull up our

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.929 
we are in orbit let's pull up our
destination<00:01:04.860> map<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.549> first<00:01:05.790> thing

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
destination map and the first thing

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.490 
destination map and the first thing
we're<00:01:06.060> going<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.210> look<00:01:06.270> at<00:01:06.510> off<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.290> left
