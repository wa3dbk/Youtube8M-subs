another one out and I have all my combo
pieces<00:03:35.940> so<00:03:36.750> I<00:03:37.080> what<00:03:37.920> I<00:03:37.950> do<00:03:38.070> is<00:03:38.400> I<00:03:38.520> have<00:03:39.290> hornet's

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
pieces so I what I do is I have hornet's

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.780 
pieces so I what I do is I have hornet's
nest<00:03:40.380> and<00:03:41.840> basics<00:03:42.840> I'd<00:03:43.020> make<00:03:43.440> him

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
nest and basics I'd make him

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.650 
nest and basics I'd make him
instructable<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.030> then<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:45.150> make<00:03:45.360> all<00:03:45.540> of

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
instructable and then I make all of

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.210 
instructable and then I make all of
essence<00:03:46.050> indestructible<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:46.710> I'd<00:03:46.800> tap<00:03:47.040> them

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
essence indestructible and I'd tap them

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.100 
essence indestructible and I'd tap them
both<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:47.670> yeah<00:03:47.850> and<00:03:48.090> hornets<00:03:48.630> Wonderwall<00:03:49.020> of

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
both and yeah and hornets Wonderwall of

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.110 
both and yeah and hornets Wonderwall of
essence<00:03:49.470> so<00:03:50.100> its<00:03:50.220> infinite<00:03:50.550> like<00:03:50.670> being<00:03:50.940> in

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
essence so its infinite like being in

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.280 
essence so its infinite like being in
different<00:03:51.240> creatures<00:03:51.690> and<00:03:52.200> yeah<00:03:53.690> hey<00:03:54.690> i

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
different creatures and yeah hey i

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:02.120 
different creatures and yeah hey i
abused<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.160> hell<00:03:56.790> out<00:03:57.000> of<00:03:57.030> that<00:03:57.150> okay<00:04:01.130> but

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
abused the hell out of that okay but

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.060 
abused the hell out of that okay but
that<00:04:02.430> rights<00:04:02.640> would<00:04:02.790> be<00:04:03.000> yeah<00:04:03.600> I<00:04:03.630> do<00:04:03.890> not<00:04:04.890> share

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
that rights would be yeah I do not share

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.200 
that rights would be yeah I do not share
in<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.220> tog<00:04:05.400> whether<00:04:05.610> really<00:04:05.850> quick<00:04:06.060> the

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
in the tog whether really quick the

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.880 
in the tog whether really quick the
reason<00:04:06.600> why<00:04:06.720> that<00:04:06.930> doesn't<00:04:07.080> work<00:04:07.380> if<00:04:07.680> you<00:04:07.860> just

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
reason why that doesn't work if you just

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.190 
reason why that doesn't work if you just
understood<00:04:08.670> what<00:04:08.850> i<00:04:08.880> just<00:04:09.000> said<00:04:09.330> is<00:04:09.510> that<00:04:10.050> all

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
understood what i just said is that all

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.870 
understood what i just said is that all
of<00:04:10.350> us<00:04:10.440> and<00:04:10.620> says<00:04:10.860> whenever<00:04:11.070> well<00:04:11.490> of<00:04:11.580> us<00:04:11.700> since

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
of us and says whenever well of us since

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.370 
of us and says whenever well of us since
is<00:04:12.000> dealt<00:04:12.210> combat<00:04:12.630> damage<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:13.200> gain<00:04:13.350> that

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
is dealt combat damage you gain that

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.590 
is dealt combat damage you gain that
much<00:04:13.530> life<00:04:13.800> so<00:04:14.010> it<00:04:14.190> has<00:04:14.520> to<00:04:14.550> be<00:04:14.760> in<00:04:14.940> combat<00:04:15.420> or

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
much life so it has to be in combat or

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.349 
much life so it has to be in combat or
so<00:04:16.020> if<00:04:16.290> it<00:04:16.470> if<00:04:16.680> it<00:04:16.920> was<00:04:17.160> just<00:04:17.190> damage<00:04:17.940> would<00:04:18.299> be

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
so if it if it was just damage would be

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:19.970 
so if it if it was just damage would be
so<00:04:18.780> nice<00:04:18.930> cuz<00:04:19.170> you<00:04:19.260> just<00:04:19.530> that's<00:04:19.890> another

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
so nice cuz you just that's another

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.039 
so nice cuz you just that's another
infinite<00:04:20.580> combo<00:04:20.880> part<00:04:21.299> of<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.450> infinite<00:04:21.810> well

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
infinite combo part of the infinite well

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.180 
infinite combo part of the infinite well
it's<00:04:22.200> not<00:04:22.410> really<00:04:22.590> because<00:04:22.800> you<00:04:22.890> need<00:04:23.100> the

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
it's not really because you need the

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.500 
it's not really because you need the
creatures<00:04:23.520> don't<00:04:23.640> have<00:04:23.940> it<00:04:24.120> but<00:04:24.240> if<00:04:24.360> you<00:04:24.390> have

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
creatures don't have it but if you have

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.300 
creatures don't have it but if you have
that<00:04:25.020> guards<00:04:25.320> out<00:04:25.470> and<00:04:25.680> you<00:04:25.830> both<00:04:26.070> make<00:04:26.280> me

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
that guards out and you both make me

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.010 
that guards out and you both make me
make<00:04:26.730> them<00:04:26.880> both<00:04:27.090> indestructible<00:04:27.420> then<00:04:27.900> you

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
make them both indestructible then you

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.970 
make them both indestructible then you
can<00:04:28.170> use<00:04:28.440> that<00:04:29.300> so<00:04:30.300> I'm<00:04:30.540> revealing<00:04:30.980> burning

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
can use that so I'm revealing burning

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.110 
can use that so I'm revealing burning
anger<00:04:32.780> surprise<00:04:33.780> what's<00:04:34.350> going<00:04:34.590> into<00:04:34.740> my<00:04:34.830> hand

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
but um I was thinking about for the tech

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.690 
but um I was thinking about for the tech
for<00:04:38.280> anybody<00:04:38.550> who<00:04:39.000> like<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:39.990> that<00:04:40.800> deck<00:04:41.340> idea

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
for anybody who like the that deck idea

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.980 
for anybody who like the that deck idea
for<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.000> deck<00:04:42.180> tech<00:04:42.420> because<00:04:42.690> I<00:04:42.750> knew<00:04:42.870> there

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
for the deck tech because I knew there

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.830 
for the deck tech because I knew there
were<00:04:43.050> some<00:04:43.260> of<00:04:43.350> you<00:04:43.500> but<00:04:44.280> um<00:04:44.460> I<00:04:44.940> was<00:04:45.720> thing

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
were some of you but um I was thing

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.540 
were some of you but um I was thing
about<00:04:45.960> taking<00:04:46.260> out<00:04:46.410> either<00:04:46.740> to<00:04:47.160> burning<00:04:47.430> anger

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
about taking out either to burning anger

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.430 
about taking out either to burning anger
22<00:04:47.910> Callias<00:04:48.450> program<00:04:48.780> because<00:04:48.960> it's<00:04:49.080> not

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
22 Callias program because it's not

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.690 
22 Callias program because it's not
really<00:04:50.070> that<00:04:50.730> efficient<00:04:51.240> to<00:04:51.330> have<00:04:51.360> for<00:04:51.990> both

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
really that efficient to have for both

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.470 
really that efficient to have for both
instead<00:04:53.700> of<00:04:53.729> having

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
instead of having

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.720 
instead of having
something<00:04:54.810> else<00:04:54.990> in<00:04:55.140> there<00:04:55.260> so<00:04:55.770> I<00:04:56.010> mean<00:04:56.700> that's

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
something else in there so I mean that's

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:57.950 
something else in there so I mean that's
up<00:04:56.910> to<00:04:57.030> you<00:04:57.120> which<00:04:57.240> one<00:04:57.360> you<00:04:57.450> take<00:04:57.570> out<00:04:57.720> but<00:04:57.900> i

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
up to you which one you take out but i

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.230 
up to you which one you take out but i
would<00:04:58.080> recommend<00:04:58.410> taking<00:04:58.500> up<00:04:58.680> that<00:04:58.830> heli<00:04:58.980> ads

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
would recommend taking up that heli ads

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.530 
would recommend taking up that heli ads
because<00:05:00.350> yeah<00:05:01.350> you<00:05:02.190> know<00:05:02.280> there<00:05:02.820> are<00:05:03.060> mom<00:05:03.510> I
