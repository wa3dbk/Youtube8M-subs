00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
done better certainly but I was doing

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.760 
done better certainly but I was doing
the<00:00:35.190> best<00:00:35.370> with<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.940> tools<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.719> had<00:00:37.020> at<00:00:37.350> my

the best with the tools that I had at my

the<00:00:43.770> audio<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.160> I'm<00:00:44.460> using<00:00:44.640> now<00:00:44.789> at<00:00:45.059> least<00:00:45.239> in

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
the audio that I'm using now at least in

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.209 
conjunction with this very simple
microphone<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.750> think<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.710> little<00:00:49.950> better

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
microphone is I think a little better

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.500 
microphone is I think a little better
than<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.550> audio<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.059> was<00:00:51.239> recording

been<00:00:54.090> argued<00:00:54.510> was<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.899> better<00:00:55.110> camera<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.559> was<00:00:55.649> a

have to like commit that to memory cuz I

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.789 
have to like commit that to memory cuz I
people<00:02:03.600> ask<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:04.049> what<00:02:04.079> Mike<00:02:04.409> I'm<00:02:04.590> using

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
people ask like what Mike I'm using

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.649 
people ask like what Mike I'm using
right<00:02:05.009> now<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.310> it's<00:02:05.430> it's<00:02:05.700> fine<00:02:06.030> it's<00:02:06.450> good

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
right now and it's it's fine it's good

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.210 
right now and it's it's fine it's good
the<00:02:07.290> only<00:02:07.500> thing<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.829> I<00:02:08.550> would<00:02:09.030> say<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.709> a<00:02:10.709> bit

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
the only thing that I would say is a bit

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.400 
the only thing that I would say is a bit
frustrating<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.819> that<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:12.150> don't<00:02:12.239> have<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.569> true

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
frustrating is that I don't have a true

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.710 
frustrating is that I don't have a true
limiter<00:02:13.770> right<00:02:14.340> now<00:02:14.490> so<00:02:15.030> sometimes<00:02:15.360> if<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.570> get

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
limiter right now so sometimes if I get

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.920 
limiter right now so sometimes if I get
really<00:02:16.050> really<00:02:16.170> loud<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.580> gain<00:02:17.820> is<00:02:18.090> not

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
really really loud in the gain is not

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.820 
really really loud in the gain is not
set<00:02:19.260> according<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:20.190> my<00:02:20.970> average<00:02:21.830> speaking

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
set according to my average speaking

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.210 
set according to my average speaking
pattern<00:02:23.160> it<00:02:24.000> can<00:02:24.240> pop<00:02:24.990> you'll<00:02:25.350> hear<00:02:25.560> pops<00:02:25.920> in

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
pattern it can pop you'll hear pops in

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.220 
pattern it can pop you'll hear pops in
the<00:02:26.640> audio<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.180> that's<00:02:27.330> what's<00:02:27.540> happening

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
the audio and that's what's happening

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.690 
the audio and that's what's happening
essentially<00:02:28.680> there's<00:02:28.860> too<00:02:29.040> much<00:02:29.130> audio<00:02:29.460> and

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
essentially there's too much audio and

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.540 
essentially there's too much audio and
it<00:02:30.390> can't<00:02:30.570> handle<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.870> there's<00:02:30.990> no<00:02:31.110> limitation

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
it can't handle it there's no limitation

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.910 
it can't handle it there's no limitation
so<00:02:32.550> that<00:02:33.180> being<00:02:33.360> said<00:02:33.450> this<00:02:34.350> only<00:02:34.620> cost<00:02:34.800> me

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
so that being said this only cost me

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.630 
so that being said this only cost me

video the fan from the computer that i'm

it's<00:03:17.280> convenient<00:03:17.550> for<00:03:17.700> me<00:03:17.820> to<00:03:17.910> use<00:03:18.060> here

starts<00:03:20.070> kicking<00:03:20.850> in<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.330> so<00:03:21.840> that<00:03:22.440> this

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
starts kicking in and so that this

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.199 
starts kicking in and so that this
microphone<00:03:23.310> is<00:03:23.490> so<00:03:23.580> good<00:03:23.760> it<00:03:23.850> picks<00:03:24.030> up<00:03:24.090> the

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
microphone is so good it picks up the

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.350 
microphone is so good it picks up the
fan<00:03:24.360> noise<00:03:24.540> in<00:03:24.780> fact<00:03:25.190> this<00:03:26.190> mike<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.670> probably

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
fan noise in fact this mike is probably

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.390 
fan noise in fact this mike is probably
also<00:03:27.510> picking<00:03:27.870> up<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:28.050> fan<00:03:28.200> noise<00:03:28.350> but<00:03:28.709> not<00:03:29.160> as

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
also picking up the fan noise but not as

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.520 
also picking up the fan noise but not as
much<00:03:29.700> as<00:03:29.760> this<00:03:30.300> particular<00:03:30.480> Mike<00:03:30.930> would<00:03:31.410> be

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
much as this particular Mike would be

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.520 
much as this particular Mike would be
picking<00:03:31.800> up<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:31.980> fan<00:03:32.130> noise<00:03:32.780> you<00:03:33.780> know<00:03:33.810> I've

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
picking up the fan noise you know I've

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.920 
picking up the fan noise you know I've
tried<00:03:34.980> different<00:03:35.190> equipment<00:03:35.930> expensive

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
tried different equipment expensive

ultimately if it produces something of

ultimately if it produces something of
