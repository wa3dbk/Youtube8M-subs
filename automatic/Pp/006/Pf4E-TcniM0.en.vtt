00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 and good to all girls and boys of 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.870
 youtube welcome to the first tutorial 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.730
 of the channel in this case let's start 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.040
 with a simple and easy thing to 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.719
 use and basically it depends on a 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.759
 page on which you get internet 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.130
 I will record everything that comes out in the 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.080
 desktop or at the bottom of the screen 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.680
 of our client 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.540
 that is to say that java is needed and that 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.160
 you need to download simply put 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.680
 the page then I'll put it on the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.080
 link is necessary that you put it here 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.480
 from google and it was already law opens a 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.930
 screen 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:39.700
 the page is called screen you almost give it 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.700
 here and matic 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.239
 ok and it's the first 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.790
 the first page that comes out this what 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.559
 out in the description bar you what 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.340
 I'll put in the link and you can 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.340
 enter from there from 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.650
 recording 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.380
 in one of those two 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:04.920
 and it will come out is to say that java is needed 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.920
 ok that's what you'll give him 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.960
 and we will not give it to you later 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.799
 because if we give it to stop the video in 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.930
 the one because right now we're 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.729
 recording you will have to give 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.650
 what you get is worth as you can 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.180
 update but do not give him to block 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.950
 because then no later or 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.990
 update if we and we 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.280
 we give now it blocks then this what 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.430
 let's remove what we're going to leave in a 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.330
 side 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.330
 we do not give anything 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:33.770
 Well basically you will get a 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.300
 a square that will cover the entire screen 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.550
 is to enlarge with a few squares 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:42.680
 small ones that will go to the edges 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.970
 this has come out for us 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.100
 Y 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.890
 You can basically enlarge it and I do not know 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.230
 yes down in the bottom corner 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.830
 left you will leave the break in 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.600
 microphone and the pause that you are recording 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.010
 jump a red button and you will have to 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.050
 give right now I'm using 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.650
 microphone I do not know if it's being recorded 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:08.640
 right now what about this this is small 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.869
 help that puts us and you give me you 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.299
 leave 15 minutes maximum 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.950
 and can record any kind of thing 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.629
 it may be that depending on the 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.840
 speed and the megabytes that our 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:21.930
 computer go slow have the young and 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.359
 the rest 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.790
 and well, nothing else, this is 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.959
 basically everything has no more 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.920
 complication by leaving in the description 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.630
