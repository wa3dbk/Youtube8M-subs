00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.490
 You may smoke first 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.940

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:41.350
 In this way and take 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:46.050
 It is designed to be able to take Celtic things that are included 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.050
 This key has stab here and say where to interpolate 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.780
 But it does not change too much 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:01:00.840

 Such axis 5 key takes out 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.439
