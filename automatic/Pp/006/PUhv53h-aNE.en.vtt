00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:05.629
 hi dear brides and lendin women 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.010
 wedding organizer 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.260
 glory to god so that most of our 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.639
 brides already know who is 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.240
 wedding coordinator 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.289
 and say honestly working on the sites in 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.100
 as coordinator 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.410
 I can not imagine a wedding without 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.410
 coordination seems to me that now it 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.230
 it is simply unrealistic that all efforts are all 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.060
 cares that make the coordinator will 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.700
 lie either on the shoulders of the bride or on 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.850
 shoulders close some relatives in 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.950
 our time is simply unacceptable 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.649
 today we'll talk not about coordinators but 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.570
 talk about a man like hosted 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.420
 who is this why is he needed 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.610
 there is a very big misconception many 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.980
 consider that the coordinator should perform 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.899
 we have a hostess function 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.350
 I will disappoint you I will say that this is far from 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.050
 So 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.309
 hot ice is separate and special 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.699
 trained person 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.250
 his duties include meeting guests 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.049
 ear to become usually already has before 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.949
 a certain seating plan he 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.439
 helps guests 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.260
 read this seating plan if 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.760
 need to take them to their place 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.930
 hold if we have any 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.830
 certain areas for example we have 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.229
 photozone 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.700
 the hottest brings the guests tell 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.180
 about what works here and now 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.909
 photozone and you can basically get 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.860
 photo for memory 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:32.009
 further if we have buffet tables 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.990
 buffet area is hosted again 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.200
 brings guests tells and 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.140
 shows that we have here 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.150
 There is a buffet area very 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.220
 popular doing lounge zones 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.329
 This is a recreation area where guests can 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.799
 sit quietly relax chat 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.540
 again 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.110
 Duties precisely hostess enters 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.930
 arrange guests in the lounge area 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.240
 if we have will recognize the ceremony you 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.430
 can look in my block on u tube 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.140
 there are several commercials about what 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.399
 does the coordinator during the exit 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.530
 registration 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.579
 Office principle accompanies guests until 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.909
 the most exit registration and still wanted 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:20.730
 pay attention to what if you 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:23.540
 the coordinator works then in charge 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.799
 Coordinator includes a meeting 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.980
 show placement programs control 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:31.829
