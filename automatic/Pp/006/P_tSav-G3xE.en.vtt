 thank you 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:26.849
 then especially for critics and the public beatles rock band 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.880
 return home on TV try again with this green day rock band group 

00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:33.489
 especially loved by the youngest 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.070
 we see our videorecensione if the film will be of 50 replies answers dell 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.070
 latest edition 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.019
 the fight continues with exclusive hits from the musical genre rock band 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:53.819
 two titles that by now monopolize the scene of that jerry playing games 

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:57.410
 reproduce in an increasingly obsessive way and the experience that is found on the sea in 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:00.409
 a group 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.320
 deposit andosilla license of the beatles where he produced what to ours 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.870
 opinion has become the term of comparison on how i 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.650
 dedicated titles of a single band reaching the right balance between it 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.210
 commercial exploitation prestigious and satisfaction of 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.579
 players grace content and mechanics of quake game play and beautiful his home 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.640
 difficult that many of those who are watching this video review do not 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.149
 we know who the green days are 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.509
 but for those who are wondering what I may have brought to dedicate a 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.399
 whole chapter of rock bands to a band and relatively young I can say that 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.549
 Billy Joe Armstrong, the singer of the members, to re-launch punk 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.179
 world-class rock first for the success of other bands like blinks 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:46.450
 182 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.640
 more than 15 million records sold worldwide, many critics' awards 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.140
 since the group started from a simple punk rock with corn and how 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.180
 basketball starting 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.549
 highly popular musical ferries 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.899
 if over time turned into something more 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.979
 spokesman of a social conscience 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.630
 culminated with the end of the United States buscemeyes era 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.630
 and embraced by millions of boys around the world 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.790
 empty green day rock band around the refectory of the group with a selection 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.439
 of songs taken from a handful of albums 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.979
 covering three stages of the band's career or with 47 songs for concerts 

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:42.590
 recreated quite faithfully, above all from the point of view of 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:45.359
 expressions that of the movements of the three musicians 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.479
 whereas, however, in the game dedicated to the beatles the group's history had 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:52.469
 Developers permission to indulge themselves with creative text echoes 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:56.490
 up to the creation of videos in computer graphics imaginary settings 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.840
 to build children of the emotions of the career of a group that made the 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.889
 history of the people 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.499
 the fact remains that this is a child who started playing in t-shirts 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:05.290
 extruch inter 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.609
 and that within 10 years shirts and ties have passed 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.590
 however, the structure of the music and the structure of the group have always remained the same 

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:13.239
 same 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.709
 have not yet had occasion to leave cultural marks in the rally 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.000
 how many the developers have been able to draw from it 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.650
 cue to be able to give substance game above all variety 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:31.770
 there are only three concerts to play 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.310
 but the differences are only marginally appreciable and are all available 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.599
 right from the start as well as the group's repertoire 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.620
 this seems normal to more avid supporters of the band 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.430
 but if there were no written dates next to the three concerts there would be no 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.489
 another element to indicate the flow of time, the evolution of the group 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.190
 since there are no videos that - the three phases 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.190
 building materials created specifically for the game 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.709
 in each stage there are servants sets of songs to play to unlock the sets 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:07.680
 later 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.480
 depending on the number of stars obtained 1 or 2 photos are unlocked 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.690
 from the band's archive 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.840
 and finished 7 of accumulated credits songs you can spend per 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.359
 unlock some challenges 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.190
 that allow you to get videos of the life of the group in tour today like shoes 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:27.060
 the whole, however, lacks organicity, the photos themselves are a simple gallery 

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:29.930
 of images without any bibliographic introduction 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.930
 who says player where the picture was taken on which occasion 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.670
 leading to a simple succession of funny faces 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.330
 they tear a few smudges stains quickly run out of their charm 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.330
 the interest for those who start a green day fetishist 

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:48.849
 then coming to the game mechanics in the strict sense 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:52.259
 the being green day rock band all focused around repertoire of everything 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:53.919
 highlight the limits 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.810
 since our three heroes pool party cheetah very fast tracks very short 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.050
 come to pack more complex songs rather than the conceptual album 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.930
 articulated 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.039
 it makes modern rock instant belt-breaking force 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:08.370
 that works great live in concert 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.300
 stain motorcycle - charm having to care about with guitars and drums 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.300
 plastic 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.270
 the tracks are all quite similar in structure as a construction 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.100
 rhythmics 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.089
 except for some very notable exceptions 

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:27.450
 and those who have really played bands already 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.450
 the challenge as a whole with keystrokes last a little stimulating 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.639
 easily tameable rather than ppt 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:38.280
 the first discourse of adepts of the musical games that will be able to be different 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.960
 go with some practice even at an expert level 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.960
 precisely because of a rather accessible level of challenge 

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:14.419
 certainly the offer for enthusiasts is still interesting also because i 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:17.790
 tracks can be exported to other rock band routes 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.330
 the letter patterns are really faithful with alt facial emotions that 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.970
 they reproduce a wry wink for those who have followed a minimum the group 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.970
 recognize the world 

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:53.559
 difficult to rate green day empty rock band that tears perplexes 

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:56.480
 make the very big file cad affect a group 

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.660
 that from a simple punk band it has become an icon of the rock of the 

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.759
 our days 

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:04.180
 just thinking about this aspect we reach the sufficiency adobe e 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.990
 evaluate the last harmonix test for what it is like a musical game 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.740
 the dish really too poor, not well looked after 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.320
 this year those who are looking for an easy title could start to try their hand at 

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:15.389
 this kind 

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:18.400
 but reluctantly it is necessary to warn called the beatles 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.729
 that of the creativity that sprang from a minute of that experience is not here 

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:23.780
 almost remained traces
