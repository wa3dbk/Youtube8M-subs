00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
hello everyone this is a boot up and

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.700 
hello everyone this is a boot up and
benchmark<00:00:02.939> comparison<00:00:03.510> between<00:00:03.689> s3<00:00:04.259> mini<00:00:04.410> and

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
benchmark comparison between s3 mini and

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.980 
benchmark comparison between s3 mini and
s4<00:00:05.220> mini<00:00:05.370> and<00:00:05.640> in<00:00:05.970> this<00:00:06.120> review<00:00:06.299> we<00:00:06.450> are<00:00:06.600> going

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
s4 mini and in this review we are going

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.930 
s4 mini and in this review we are going
to<00:00:07.109> restart<00:00:07.560> these<00:00:07.770> devices<00:00:08.250> together<00:00:08.460> as

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
to restart these devices together as

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.450 
to restart these devices together as
well<00:00:09.269> as<00:00:09.300> we<00:00:09.870> will<00:00:10.290> boot<00:00:10.620> these<00:00:11.010> devices

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
well as we will boot these devices

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.980 
well as we will boot these devices
together<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:12.090> see<00:00:12.300> which<00:00:12.570> one<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.900> better

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
together to see which one is a better

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.460 
together to see which one is a better
device<00:00:13.440> when<00:00:13.769> we<00:00:13.920> are<00:00:14.040> trying<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.460> restart<00:00:14.910> and

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:15.470 
device when we are trying to restart and

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.800 
device when we are trying to restart and
boot<00:00:16.470> them<00:00:16.710> up<00:00:16.859> so<00:00:17.850> guys<00:00:18.029> let's<00:00:18.330> start<00:00:18.690> this

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
boot them up so guys let's start this

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:27.890 
boot them up so guys let's start this
review<00:00:19.109> by<00:00:19.350> restarting<00:00:19.830> these<00:00:20.160> devices<00:00:26.900> now

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
review by restarting these devices now

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.040 
review by restarting these devices now
both<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.170> them<00:00:28.529> have<00:00:28.830> restart<00:00:29.429> option<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:29.820> them

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.560 

so<00:00:34.050> guys<00:00:34.260> s4<00:00:34.800> mini<00:00:34.920> has<00:00:35.190> got<00:00:35.399> 1.7<00:00:36.300> gigahertz

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
so guys s4 mini has got 1.7 gigahertz

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.920 
so guys s4 mini has got 1.7 gigahertz
dual-core<00:00:37.020> processor<00:00:37.649> with<00:00:38.489> 1.5<00:00:39.420> gigabytes

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
dual-core processor with 1.5 gigabytes

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.080 
dual-core processor with 1.5 gigabytes
of<00:00:40.050> RAM<00:00:40.320> on<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.530> other<00:00:40.739> hand<00:00:41.040> on<00:00:41.250> s3<00:00:41.520> mini<00:00:41.820> we

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
of RAM on the other hand on s3 mini we

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.450 
of RAM on the other hand on s3 mini we
have<00:00:42.270> got<00:00:42.480> 1<00:00:43.050> gigahertz<00:00:43.410> dual-core<00:00:43.860> processor

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
have got 1 gigahertz dual-core processor

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.869 
have got 1 gigahertz dual-core processor
with<00:00:45.420> 1<00:00:45.719> gigabytes<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.320> RAM<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:47.430> here<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.730> can

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
with 1 gigabytes of RAM so here you can

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.670 
with 1 gigabytes of RAM so here you can
see<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.239> rs3<00:00:48.450> Mini<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.930> responding<00:00:49.469> quicker

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
see the rs3 Mini is responding quicker

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.010 
see the rs3 Mini is responding quicker
than<00:00:50.010> s4<00:00:50.760> mini<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.539> little<00:00:51.780> bit

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
than s4 mini so this is little bit

00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:09.260 
than s4 mini so this is little bit
surprising<00:00:52.559> for<00:00:52.710> me

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.510 

so<00:01:09.840> as<00:01:09.990> snow<00:01:10.200> meeting<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.590> running<00:01:10.920> on<00:01:11.100> Android

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
so as snow meeting is running on Android

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.359 
so as snow meeting is running on Android
4.2.2

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
4.2.2

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.670 
4.2.2
and<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.610> think<00:01:14.670> s3<00:01:15.180> mini<00:01:15.330> has<00:01:15.630> restarted<00:01:16.110> before

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
and I think s3 mini has restarted before

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.240 
and I think s3 mini has restarted before
as<00:01:16.830> for<00:01:17.040> many<00:01:17.690> now<00:01:18.690> as<00:01:19.050> so<00:01:19.409> many<00:01:19.619> has<00:01:19.860> responded

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
as for many now as so many has responded

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.700 
as for many now as so many has responded
for<00:01:20.520> us<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.420> has<00:01:21.570> taken<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.960> long<00:01:22.170> time<00:01:22.229> to

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
for us so it has taken a long time to

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:32.270 
for us so it has taken a long time to
respond<00:01:23.130> now<00:01:29.930> it's<00:01:30.930> restarting<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.710> system<00:01:32.070> for

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
respond now it's restarting a system for

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.820 
respond now it's restarting a system for
us<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:34.070> as<00:01:35.070> free<00:01:35.280> mini<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.729> well<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.330> hat<00:01:36.830> from

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
us and as free mini is well a hat from

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:46.149 
us and as free mini is well a hat from
s4<00:01:38.640> mini

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.740 

now<00:01:46.760> even<00:01:47.090> power<00:01:47.390> of<00:01:47.659> these<00:01:47.840> devices<00:01:49.750> now

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
now even power of these devices now

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.390 
now even power of these devices now
let's<00:01:50.990> see<00:01:51.170> which<00:01:51.320> one<00:01:51.500> is<00:01:51.620> going<00:01:51.800> to<00:01:51.920> power<00:01:52.190> up

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
let's see which one is going to power up

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:02.399 
let's see which one is going to power up
quickly<00:01:52.640> for<00:01:52.790> us<00:01:54.640> there<00:01:55.640> you<00:01:55.700> go

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.399 

so<00:02:03.009> again<00:02:03.280> has<00:02:03.460> three<00:02:03.670> many<00:02:03.880> power<00:02:04.210> of<00:02:04.479> quickly

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
so again has three many power of quickly

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.380 
so again has three many power of quickly
in<00:02:05.619> comparison<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.549> as<00:02:06.969> for<00:02:07.659> meaning<00:02:07.930> but<00:02:09.390> we

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
in comparison to as for meaning but we

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.170 
in comparison to as for meaning but we
are<00:02:10.509> looking<00:02:10.810> for<00:02:11.080> these<00:02:11.230> lights<00:02:11.819> so<00:02:12.819> as<00:02:12.970> three

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
are looking for these lights so as three

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.600 
are looking for these lights so as three
many<00:02:13.360> has<00:02:13.540> power<00:02:13.810> of<00:02:14.050> quickly<00:02:14.440> in<00:02:14.650> comparison

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
many has power of quickly in comparison

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.970 
many has power of quickly in comparison
to<00:02:15.640> as<00:02:16.030> for<00:02:16.900> many<00:02:18.390> as<00:02:19.390> for<00:02:19.720> many<00:02:19.870> is<00:02:20.560> is<00:02:20.800> still

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
to as for many as for many is is still

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.190 
to as for many as for many is is still
trying<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:21.519> power<00:02:21.819> off<00:02:22.030> a<00:02:22.150> system<00:02:25.080> here<00:02:26.080> you

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
trying to power off a system here you

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.089 
trying to power off a system here you
can<00:02:26.410> see<00:02:26.620> capacitative<00:02:27.489> lights

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.650 

so<00:02:33.099> as<00:02:33.220> for<00:02:33.459> meaning<00:02:33.700> is<00:02:33.819> still<00:02:34.150> trying<00:02:34.390> to

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
so as for meaning is still trying to

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:43.750 
so as for meaning is still trying to
power<00:02:34.930> off<00:02:35.170> itself

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.699 

now<00:02:44.330> it<00:02:44.540> is<00:02:44.660> completely<00:02:44.840> off<00:02:47.349> now<00:02:48.349> we<00:02:48.410> are

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
now it is completely off now we are

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.710 
now it is completely off now we are
going<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:48.980> power<00:02:49.310> on<00:02:49.580> these<00:02:49.879> devices<00:02:50.180> together

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
going to power on these devices together

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.540 
going to power on these devices together
to<00:02:50.959> see<00:02:51.170> which<00:02:51.349> one<00:02:51.560> is<00:02:51.680> a<00:02:51.709> better<00:02:51.950> device<00:02:52.250> when

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
to see which one is a better device when

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.250 
to see which one is a better device when
we<00:02:52.700> are<00:02:52.819> trying<00:02:53.060> to<00:02:53.150> boot<00:02:53.420> up<00:02:53.540> these<00:02:53.720> devices

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
we are trying to boot up these devices

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
we are trying to boot up these devices
so<00:02:55.900> when<00:02:56.900> you<00:02:57.019> press<00:02:57.260> power<00:02:57.560> on<00:02:57.800> and<00:02:57.980> off<00:02:58.040> key

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
so when you press power on and off key

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.240 
so when you press power on and off key
you<00:02:58.400> will<00:02:58.580> see<00:02:58.970> that<00:02:59.530> s3<00:03:00.530> mini<00:03:00.650> is<00:03:00.860> going<00:03:01.130> to

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
you will see that s3 mini is going to

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.920 
you will see that s3 mini is going to
respond<00:03:01.610> quicker<00:03:01.849> for<00:03:02.090> you<00:03:04.480> but<00:03:05.480> now<00:03:05.630> let's

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
respond quicker for you but now let's

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.570 
respond quicker for you but now let's
see<00:03:06.140> which<00:03:06.349> one<00:03:06.530> is<00:03:06.650> going<00:03:06.860> to<00:03:06.980> boot<00:03:07.459> up

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
see which one is going to boot up

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:22.449 
see which one is going to boot up
quickly<00:03:07.790> for<00:03:07.940> us

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.240 

so<00:03:23.180> I<00:03:23.209> think<00:03:23.359> here<00:03:23.840> asks<00:03:24.260> for<00:03:24.379> many<00:03:24.620> wins<00:03:24.920> from

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
so I think here asks for many wins from

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.610 
so I think here asks for many wins from
as<00:03:25.489> three<00:03:25.700> mini<00:03:25.879> so<00:03:26.510> in<00:03:26.659> booting<00:03:26.989> up<00:03:27.140> s4<00:03:27.530> mini

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
as three mini so in booting up s4 mini

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.089 
as three mini so in booting up s4 mini
is<00:03:27.739> better<00:03:28.040> than<00:03:28.310> s3<00:03:28.670> mini<00:03:29.650> but<00:03:30.650> when<00:03:30.829> you<00:03:30.980> are

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
is better than s3 mini but when you are

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:37.860 
is better than s3 mini but when you are
trying<00:03:31.280> to<00:03:31.459> restore<00:03:31.640> a<00:03:31.909> system<00:03:35.290> as<00:03:36.290> three<00:03:37.250> mini

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
trying to restore a system as three mini

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.949 
trying to restore a system as three mini
takes<00:03:38.870> a<00:03:39.079> lead<00:03:39.500> from<00:03:39.799> s4<00:03:40.280> mini<00:03:40.510> so<00:03:41.510> both<00:03:41.780> of

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
takes a lead from s4 mini so both of

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.709 
takes a lead from s4 mini so both of
these<00:03:42.109> devices<00:03:42.319> have<00:03:42.650> restarted<00:03:43.340> now<00:03:43.719> they

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:44.719 
these devices have restarted now they

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:46.869 
these devices have restarted now they
are<00:03:44.870> ready<00:03:45.139> to<00:03:45.230> get<00:03:45.500> em<00:03:45.709> to<00:03:45.950> an<00:03:46.189> end<00:03:46.549> to<00:03:46.760> the

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:52.839 
are ready to get em to an end to the
benchmark<00:03:50.590> so<00:03:51.590> here<00:03:51.799> you<00:03:51.920> can<00:03:52.099> see<00:03:52.370> little<00:03:52.609> bit

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849
