00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:23.949 
like this so it kind of looks like a

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.349 
like this so it kind of looks like a
really<00:00:24.250> stylized<00:00:24.970> stretched<00:00:25.660> out<00:00:25.900> letter<00:00:26.289> s

really stylized stretched out letter s
I'm<00:00:28.359> gonna<00:00:28.570> draw<00:00:29.279> another<00:00:30.279> curve<00:00:30.609> that's
