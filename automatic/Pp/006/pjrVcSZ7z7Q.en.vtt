00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.850
 Y 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.890
 hello youtube friends answered 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:21.440
 notice that today we are going to make a drink 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:26.480
 with roses to give that little detail 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:31.220
 special to some friend to the bride to the 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:34.760
 mom to grandma this cup I leave the 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:38.420
 link at the top how to do it 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.920
 we are going to occupy dehydrated flowers that 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.270
 I also leave the link as 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.010
 Dehydrate them in the microwave 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:50.010
 We are going to occupy two dehydrated roses 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.739
 we're going to cut it to size 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.589
 of the cup where you want 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.699
 put the truth at the height they want 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:01.289
 that the roses and the leaves remain 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.299
 we're going to have to stick with silicone 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.190
 a little bit higher because then no no 

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:09.030
 they will be up 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.950
 if we are going to cut one more one more 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.910
 girl that the other but in the end they are going to 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.680
 be the same size on the stick that 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:20.910
 we're going to grab them 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.750
 we are going to hit them so they fit well 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.750
 we put liquor 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.320
 Y 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.310
 we hit it yes 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:42.069
 remember that these roses are given a 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:45.469
 spray to prevent them from filling with dust 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:49.959
 or that they break after dehydrating 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:54.890
 this is ok about two or three tapas 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:57.170
 apart from that it gives shine to its flowers 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.780
 good since they did this is going to stay 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:05.470
 as well as a little branch and we are going to stick it 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:09.459
 inside what is this our cup 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:12.370
 but we're also going to put these 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:15.610
 dried flowers that are the 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.470
 foliage that come in the flowers if you 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.890
 They gave up on mothers day 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.930
 of those that were fabulous already 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.680
 dehydrated I hope they have 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:30.590
 Dehydrated when the video passes 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:34.880
 This is what we are going to put 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:39.190
 we are going to put a little silicon 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.700
 so that it sticks to the base 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.700
 down 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.190
 let's try to make sure that we have this 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:52.480
 what to do calmly without despair 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.480
 so that they are well done 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.970
 you are going to be even more 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.069
 nice because they will do it with more 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:04.340
 calm 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.340
 without worrying about the weather 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.970
 and we will go hitting 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.880
 everything as if it were around so that in 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.880
 half the roses remain 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.080
 this is also what dehydrated in the 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.710
 microwave oven 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:30.160
 if they did not see this video This tutorial 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:32.550
 I'll leave you remember in the part of 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.550
 above 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.459
 since it is stuck then if we already go 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:43.220
 to put our roses we are going to put 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.709
 this silicone that are well stuck together 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.440
 with another one I'm going to put it here in 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.170
 the bottom part so that for not 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.090
 is going to undo us at the time of 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.420
 put it true that we undo the 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.420
 bouquet 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:05.470
 and we're going to put a lot of silicone 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.470
 yes enough liquor 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.140
 so that it is 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:16.329
 very pretty and well attached 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:20.319
 we are going to crush him a little bit 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:22.810
 so that the roses are well attached 

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:26.069
 they remove all silicon threads 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.069
 that are going to stay there 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.380
 and they do not know how nice this one is going to look 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.980
 layer can also do it in a cup 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.080
 of glass 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.580
 if you do not want to do it in this kind of 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:48.479
 blame that was made with 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:48.479
 with this bottle and a cd 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:55.920
 and golden chevron if you do not want to do it 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:58.610
 so they can use a cup and put 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.060
 the dehydrated roses 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:05.139
 they can put him if they are going to give him 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:08.499
 can put chocolates 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:10.949
 in the little chocolatitos or the 

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:10.949
 chocolates 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:17.770
 and here I have them in garlic for 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.770
 give an idea 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.040
 can put you in this type of 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:27.670
 chocolates around 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:30.270
 that look very pretty or give the pure glass 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.270
 now too 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.580
 That's because you decision 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:47.009
 but it's a nice detail that you 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:50.279
 can give them to the person who 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:55.069
 want that it is not clear that it is very 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:59.789
 economic and they are very nice details 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:06:02.939
 I hope you liked this idea and 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:08.710
 if you liked it, pick up the little hand and tell me 

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:11.710
