00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
and I am with my dogs I don't know why

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.060 
and I am with my dogs I don't know why
that<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.930> don't<00:00:54.989> know<00:00:55.170> why<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.379> dogs<00:00:55.710> aren't

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
that is I don't know why the dogs aren't

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.060 
that is I don't know why the dogs aren't
as<00:00:56.160> effective<00:00:56.489> as<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.199> mean<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.289> swarm<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.770> way

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
as effective as I mean the swarm is way

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.740 
as effective as I mean the swarm is way
more<00:00:59.370> effective<00:00:59.460> than<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.000> dogs<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.539> then

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
more effective than the dogs and then

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.000 
more effective than the dogs and then
really<00:01:00.899> like<00:01:01.050> an<00:01:01.199> extra<00:01:01.440> two<00:01:01.590> kills<00:01:01.800> higher

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
really like an extra two kills higher

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.939 
really like an extra two kills higher
but<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.149> think<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.870> swarm<00:01:04.290> I'm<00:01:04.439> averaging<00:01:04.799> like

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
but I think the swarm I'm averaging like

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.649 
but I think the swarm I'm averaging like
nine<00:01:05.189> kills<00:01:05.519> with<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.060> dogs<00:01:06.299> I'm<00:01:06.510> only

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
nine kills with and the dogs I'm only

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.539 
nine kills with and the dogs I'm only
averaging<00:01:07.049> like<00:01:07.170> five<00:01:07.530> kills<00:01:07.890> with<00:01:08.100> per<00:01:08.310> dog

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
averaging like five kills with per dog

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.580 
averaging like five kills with per dog
and<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.299> lodestar<00:01:09.750> mavar<00:01:10.049> Jinglei<00:01:10.350> eight

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
and the lodestar mavar Jinglei eight

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.830 
and the lodestar mavar Jinglei eight
kills<00:01:10.920> with<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.490> yeah<00:01:12.210> I'm<00:01:12.420> gonna<00:01:12.540> probably

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840
