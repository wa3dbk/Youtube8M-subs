00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.450 
going to do a tech tip today we're going
to<00:00:12.389> go<00:00:12.509> over<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.719> governor's<00:00:13.139> on<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.410> 700r4

the actual governor that will cause you

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.080 
the actual governor that will cause you
shifting<00:00:25.800> problems<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:26.430> if<00:00:26.519> you're<00:00:26.640> not<00:00:26.760> going

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
shifting problems so if you're not going

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.300 
shifting problems so if you're not going
into<00:00:27.330> your<00:00:27.510> newly<00:00:28.140> installed<00:00:28.470> 700r4

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
into your newly installed 700r4

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.730 
into your newly installed 700r4
correctly<00:00:30.240> in<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.420> second<00:00:30.810> gear<00:00:30.990> maybe<00:00:31.500> your

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
correctly in the second gear maybe your

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.200 
correctly in the second gear maybe your
problem<00:00:32.189> if<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.610> guys<00:00:32.730> would<00:00:33.000> do<00:00:33.090> it

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
problem if you guys would do it

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.610 
problem if you guys would do it
yourselfers<00:00:33.780> you're<00:00:33.960> doing<00:00:34.170> on<00:00:34.290> your<00:00:34.320> back

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
yourselfers you're doing on your back

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
maybe you don't have a lift it is quite

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.479 
maybe you don't have a lift it is quite
possible<00:00:37.410> for<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.680> dirt<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:37.980> debris<00:00:38.129> from

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
possible for that dirt and debris from

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.880 
possible for that dirt and debris from
your<00:00:38.579> hands<00:00:39.090> your<00:00:39.210> tools<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:40.260> atmosphere<00:00:40.800> and

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
your hands your tools the atmosphere and

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.619 
your hands your tools the atmosphere and
the<00:00:40.980> floor<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.700> actually<00:00:42.030> suck<00:00:42.239> up<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.540> the

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
the floor to actually suck up in the

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.930 
the floor to actually suck up in the
transmission<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.649> cause<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> problem<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.760> we

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
transmission and cause a problem so we

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.130 
transmission and cause a problem so we
want<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.149> make<00:00:45.270> sure<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.660> governor<00:00:46.020> is

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
want to make sure that the governor is

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.200 
want to make sure that the governor is
actually<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> free<00:00:47.039> clear<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:48.000> fully

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
actually a free clear and it's fully

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.180 
actually a free clear and it's fully
functioning<00:00:48.840> it's<00:00:49.410> only<00:00:49.590> about<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.890> five<00:00:50.129> to

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
functioning it's only about a five to

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.619 
functioning it's only about a five to
ten<00:00:50.340> minute<00:00:50.520> procedure<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.329> we're<00:00:51.449> going<00:00:51.539> to

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
ten minute procedure so we're going to

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.139 
ten minute procedure so we're going to
go<00:00:51.690> ahead<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.930> show<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.079> live<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.620> one<00:00:52.770> shot

there
alright<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.750> governor

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
alright so this is the governor

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.849 
alright so this is the governor
now<00:01:39.420> this<00:01:39.630> isn't<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.079> type<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.289> governor<00:01:40.710> you

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:40.859 
now this isn't the type of governor you

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:43.700 
now this isn't the type of governor you
should<00:01:40.890> have<00:01:41.219> in<00:01:41.429> your<00:01:41.509> 704<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:43.289> is<00:01:43.499> very

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
should have in your 704 this is very

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.120 
should have in your 704 this is very
dirty<00:01:44.039> rusty<00:01:44.490> used<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.539> abused<00:01:45.899> if<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.979> can

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
dirty rusty used and abused if you can

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.749 
dirty rusty used and abused if you can
actually<00:01:47.310> see<00:01:47.549> here<00:01:49.009> these<00:01:50.009> are<00:01:50.069> the<00:01:50.280> teeth<00:01:50.549> on

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
actually see here these are the teeth on

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.749 
actually see here these are the teeth on
the<00:01:51.450> governor<00:01:51.869> these<00:01:52.020> are<00:01:52.200> called<00:01:52.409> gears<00:01:53.340> or<00:01:53.670> a

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
the governor these are called gears or a

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.130 
the governor these are called gears or a
governor<00:01:54.240> gear<00:01:54.630> what<00:01:54.869> they're<00:01:55.020> actually

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
governor gear what they're actually

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.929 
governor gear what they're actually
teeth<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.859> these<00:01:55.979> are<00:01:56.130> plastics<00:01:56.700> or

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
teeth and these are plastics or

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.029 
teeth and these are plastics or
polyurethane<00:01:57.299> they're<00:01:57.899> hard<00:01:58.109> plastic<00:01:58.619> so

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
polyurethane they're hard plastic so

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.620 
polyurethane they're hard plastic so
what<00:01:59.159> happens<00:01:59.459> is<00:01:59.609> they<00:01:59.759> get<00:01:59.880> chewed<00:02:00.179> up<00:02:00.299> over

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
what happens is they get chewed up over

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.449 
what happens is they get chewed up over
time<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:01.259> couple<00:02:01.679> things<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.069> want<00:02:02.099> to<00:02:02.310> check

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:02.459 
time a couple things you want to check

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:04.999 
time a couple things you want to check
besides<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.200> visible<00:02:04.200> damage<00:02:04.380> on<00:02:04.709> the<00:02:04.829> gear

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
besides the visible damage on the gear

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.889 
besides the visible damage on the gear
itself<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.909> want<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.149> see<00:02:06.270> if<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.659> valve

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
itself is you want to see if the valve

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.990 
itself is you want to see if the valve
moves<00:02:07.229> up<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.530> down<00:02:07.679> inside<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:08.910> if

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
moves up and down inside of this so if

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.180 
moves up and down inside of this so if
you<00:02:09.090> turn<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.390> upside<00:02:09.690> down<00:02:09.720> gravity<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.920> your

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
you turn it upside down gravity is your

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.250 
you turn it upside down gravity is your
friend<00:02:11.459> in<00:02:11.579> this<00:02:11.700> situation<00:02:12.329> the<00:02:12.870> other<00:02:12.900> thing

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
friend in this situation the other thing

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.569 
friend in this situation the other thing
that<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.440> want<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.680> check<00:02:13.860> for<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.129> that<00:02:14.400> these

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.579 
that you want to check for is that these

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:17.000 
that you want to check for is that these
weights<00:02:14.879> or<00:02:15.090> butterfly's<00:02:15.629> wings<00:02:15.959> are<00:02:16.440> opening

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
weights or butterfly's wings are opening

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.979 
weights or butterfly's wings are opening
up<00:02:17.190> now<00:02:17.670> again<00:02:17.940> it<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:18.090> gravity<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:18.810> when<00:02:18.900> you

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
up now again it is gravity so when you

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.069 
up now again it is gravity so when you
turn<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.290> upside<00:02:19.590> down<00:02:19.620> they<00:02:20.069> should<00:02:20.250> open<00:02:20.519> up

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079 
turn it upside down they should open up

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:23.210 
turn it upside down they should open up
and<00:02:22.079> this<00:02:22.200> is<00:02:22.410> actually<00:02:22.739> what<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:22.890> should<00:02:23.190> look

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
and this is actually what it should look

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.850 
and this is actually what it should look
like<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:24.060> can<00:02:24.209> actually<00:02:24.360> see<00:02:24.780> all<00:02:25.049> the<00:02:25.379> teeth

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
like you can actually see all the teeth

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.670 
like you can actually see all the teeth
on<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.280> gear<00:02:26.310> are<00:02:27.060> not<00:02:27.329> bent<00:02:27.690> cracked<00:02:28.140> damaged

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
on the gear are not bent cracked damaged

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.259 
on the gear are not bent cracked damaged
warp<00:02:29.010> or<00:02:29.190> anything<00:02:29.519> wrong<00:02:29.700> with<00:02:29.879> them<00:02:30.000> at<00:02:30.120> all

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
warp or anything wrong with them at all

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.539 
warp or anything wrong with them at all
and<00:02:30.540> then<00:02:31.170> also<00:02:31.560> if<00:02:31.799> you<00:02:31.920> do<00:02:32.040> your<00:02:32.190> gravity

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
and then also if you do your gravity

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.640 
and then also if you do your gravity
test<00:02:32.760> turn<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.180> upside<00:02:33.480> down<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:34.200> weights<00:02:34.440> are

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
test turn it upside down the weights are

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.140 
test turn it upside down the weights are
opening<00:02:35.010> we'll<00:02:35.340> do<00:02:35.459> it<00:02:35.549> a<00:02:35.609> little<00:02:35.670> bit<00:02:35.879> slower

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
opening we'll do it a little bit slower

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.900 
opening we'll do it a little bit slower
or<00:02:36.709> your<00:02:37.709> butterfly<00:02:38.129> wings<00:02:38.370> as<00:02:38.549> they<00:02:38.670> call

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
or your butterfly wings as they call

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.789 
or your butterfly wings as they call
them<00:02:39.060> now<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.450> valves<00:02:39.930> also<00:02:40.109> moving<00:02:40.530> up<00:02:40.620> and

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
them now the valves also moving up and

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.890 
them now the valves also moving up and
down<00:02:40.859> inside<00:02:41.400> if<00:02:41.879> you<00:02:41.940> can<00:02:42.120> see<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.569> you<00:02:42.720> might

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
down inside if you can see it you might

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.140 
down inside if you can see it you might
be<00:02:42.930> able<00:02:43.049> to<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.470> might<00:02:43.620> not<00:02:43.829> but<00:02:44.790> those<00:02:45.000> are

the things that you want to check very

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.140 
the things that you want to check very
simple<00:02:46.859> for<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.160> governor<00:02:47.519> make<00:02:47.819> sure<00:02:48.000> it's

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
simple for the governor make sure it's

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.960
