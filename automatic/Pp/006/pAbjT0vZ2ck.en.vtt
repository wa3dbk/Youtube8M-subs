sharp<00:01:36.540> plasticky<00:01:37.229> edges<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.770> guess<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.100> could

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
sharp plasticky edges I guess you could

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.560 
sharp plasticky edges I guess you could
say<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.729> if<00:01:39.720> we<00:01:39.869> look<00:01:39.990> at<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.290> guy<00:01:41.450> so<00:01:42.450> the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
closure on this is a little basically

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.280 
closure on this is a little basically
there's<00:01:48.119> nothing<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.479> really<00:01:48.659> holding<00:01:48.990> it

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
there's nothing is really holding it

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.560 
there's nothing is really holding it
close<00:01:49.320> other<00:01:50.009> than<00:01:50.280> friction<00:01:50.790> really<00:01:51.329> but

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
close other than friction really but

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.310 
close other than friction really but
it's<00:01:52.110> got<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.409> kind<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.829> little<00:01:53.130> um<00:01:54.320> this

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
it's got this kind of little um this

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.910

better but that this material is like a

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.570 
better but that this material is like a
soft<00:02:26.880> red<00:02:27.270> fabric<00:02:27.800> which<00:02:28.800> is<00:02:29.010> not<00:02:29.190> going<00:02:29.430> to

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
away in this sgp case so I've heard this

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.570 
away in this sgp case so I've heard this
is<00:03:07.049> a<00:03:07.080> very<00:03:07.290> tight<00:03:07.650> fit<00:03:08.040> but<00:03:08.069> I<00:03:08.430> you<00:03:08.489> know

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
is a very tight fit but I you know

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.339 
is a very tight fit but I you know
people<00:03:09.000> tend<00:03:09.239> to<00:03:09.330> exaggerate<00:03:09.599> these<00:03:10.080> things

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
people tend to exaggerate these things

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.580 
people tend to exaggerate these things
in<00:03:10.590> my<00:03:11.010> experience<00:03:11.549> so<00:03:11.790> we'll<00:03:11.910> see<00:03:12.500> so<00:03:13.500> I'm

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
in my experience so we'll see so I'm

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.280 
in my experience so we'll see so I'm
just<00:03:13.739> pushing<00:03:13.980> on<00:03:14.280> these<00:03:14.430> corners<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:16.040> I

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
just pushing on these corners and I

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.509 
just pushing on these corners and I
think<00:03:19.290> that's<00:03:19.500> about<00:03:19.650> as<00:03:19.950> in<00:03:20.100> as<00:03:20.250> it's<00:03:20.400> going

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
think that's about as in as it's going

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.660 
think that's about as in as it's going
to<00:03:20.579> get<00:03:20.820> and<00:03:21.680> that<00:03:22.680> took<00:03:22.920> pretty<00:03:23.190> much<00:03:23.280> no

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
to get and that took pretty much no

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
to get and that took pretty much no
effort<00:03:24.030> at<00:03:24.150> all<00:03:25.609> and<00:03:29.000> it's<00:03:30.000> in<00:03:30.239> there<00:03:31.190> very

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
effort at all and it's in there very

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.650 
effort at all and it's in there very
sharp-looking<00:03:33.690> case<00:03:34.440> and<00:03:35.209> you<00:03:36.209> can<00:03:36.359> kind<00:03:36.540> of

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
sharp-looking case and you can kind of

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.840 
sharp-looking case and you can kind of
see<00:03:36.900> from<00:03:37.140> all<00:03:37.319> show<00:03:37.920> you<00:03:37.980> all<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.519> angles

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
see from all show you all the angles

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.580 
see from all show you all the angles
here<00:03:39.180> if<00:03:39.329> I<00:03:39.450> can<00:03:39.690> on<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:39.959> video<00:03:40.819> so<00:03:42.440> you<00:03:43.440> know<00:03:43.560> I

lip<00:03:57.840> here<00:03:58.260> all<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:59.250> way<00:03:59.280> around<00:03:59.519> you<00:04:00.269> know<00:04:00.389> the

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
lip here all the way around you know the

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.370 
lip here all the way around you know the
controls<00:04:00.900> could<00:04:01.260> get<00:04:01.470> hit<00:04:02.660> but<00:04:03.660> i<00:04:03.989> have<00:04:04.139> to<00:04:04.170> say

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
controls could get hit but i have to say

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.530 
controls could get hit but i have to say
that<00:04:04.889> you<00:04:05.220> know<00:04:05.250> fears<00:04:05.760> of<00:04:06.000> this<00:04:06.120> thing<00:04:06.359> being

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
that you know fears of this thing being

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.740 
that you know fears of this thing being
exposed<00:04:07.280> our<00:04:08.280> little<00:04:08.579> unfounded<00:04:09.209> in<00:04:09.329> my<00:04:09.480> view

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
exposed our little unfounded in my view

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.789 
exposed our little unfounded in my view
and<00:04:12.139> so<00:04:13.139> if<00:04:13.290> we<00:04:13.350> just<00:04:13.650> pop<00:04:13.859> it<00:04:14.040> open<00:04:14.130> again<00:04:14.370> here

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
and so if we just pop it open again here

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.440 
and so if we just pop it open again here
you<00:04:16.799> know<00:04:16.889> it<00:04:17.220> takes<00:04:17.579> a<00:04:17.729> little<00:04:17.880> bit<00:04:18.030> of<00:04:18.090> effort

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
you know it takes a little bit of effort

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.099 
you know it takes a little bit of effort
to<00:04:18.720> open<00:04:19.410> it<00:04:19.530> up<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:20.419> but<00:04:21.419> it's<00:04:21.539> in<00:04:21.720> there<00:04:21.930> and

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
to open it up and but it's in there and

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.980 
to open it up and but it's in there and
you<00:04:22.919> can<00:04:23.010> see<00:04:23.250> it's<00:04:23.400> not<00:04:23.760> falling<00:04:24.270> out<00:04:24.450> you

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
you can see it's not falling out you

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.969 
you can see it's not falling out you
know<00:04:25.080> i<00:04:25.110> don't<00:04:25.320> know<00:04:25.349> how<00:04:25.470> it<00:04:25.500> will<00:04:25.680> hold<00:04:25.830> up

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
know i don't know how it will hold up

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:26.370 
know i don't know how it will hold up
over

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
over

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.580 
over
as<00:04:26.620> it<00:04:26.800> gets<00:04:27.330> loosened<00:04:28.330> up<00:04:28.480> but<00:04:28.720> man<00:04:29.140> this<00:04:29.380> has
