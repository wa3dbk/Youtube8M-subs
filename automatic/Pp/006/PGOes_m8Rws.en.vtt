you know if at first glance you're
saying<00:00:33.480> okay<00:00:34.260> what's<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.770> well<00:00:35.610> just

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
saying okay what's that well just

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.550 
saying okay what's that well just
remember<00:00:36.060> what<00:00:36.330> channel<00:00:36.720> you're<00:00:36.870> on<00:00:36.990> yeah

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:37.560 
remember what channel you're on yeah

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.040 
remember what channel you're on yeah
it's<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.040> knife<00:00:39.530> this<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:41.040> knife<00:00:41.220> by<00:00:41.970> a<00:00:42.390> man

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
it's a knife this is a knife by a man

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.160 
it's a knife this is a knife by a man
named<00:00:43.320> Darrell<00:00:43.950> Caston<00:00:46.400> and<00:00:47.809> I<00:00:48.809> believe<00:00:49.050> he

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
named Darrell Caston and I believe he

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.520 
named Darrell Caston and I believe he
calls<00:00:49.470> it<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.700> square<00:00:51.540> head<00:00:51.780> dog<00:00:52.230> tag

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
calls it the a square head dog tag

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.770 
calls it the a square head dog tag
folder<00:00:53.040> and<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.760> about<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.120> size<00:00:54.330> of<00:00:54.660> a

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
folder and it is about the size of a

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.600 
folder and it is about the size of a
standard<00:00:54.840> military<00:00:55.320> dog<00:00:55.830> tag<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.340> little

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
standard military dog tag a little

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.080 
standard military dog tag a little
bigger<00:00:57.890> particularly<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.070> corners<00:01:02.090> let's

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
bigger particularly in the corners let's

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:11.060 
bigger particularly in the corners let's
open<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.420> up<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:09.000> handles<00:01:09.360> titanium<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
open it up the handles titanium and the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.340 
open it up the handles titanium and the
blade<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.820> cts<00:01:12.750> xhp<00:01:13.740> steel<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.960> he<00:01:15.960> told<00:01:16.200> me

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
blade is cts xhp steel and he told me

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.460 
blade is cts xhp steel and he told me
it's<00:01:16.470> hardened<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.820> rockwell<00:01:18.690> hardness<00:01:19.110> of

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
it's hardened to a rockwell hardness of

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:28.010 
it's hardened to a rockwell hardness of
63<00:01:20.280> which<00:01:20.550> is<00:01:20.759> very<00:01:21.630> hard<00:01:21.930> for<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.410> blade<00:01:27.020> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
63 which is very hard for a blade the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.719 
63 which is very hard for a blade the
locking<00:01:28.410> mechanism<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:28.979> quite<00:01:29.190> interesting

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
locking mechanism is quite interesting

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.760 
locking mechanism is quite interesting
it's<00:01:29.910> sort<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.990> frame<00:01:31.229> lock<00:01:33.560> has<00:01:34.560> this

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
it's sort of a frame lock has this

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.500 
it's sort of a frame lock has this
little<00:01:35.100> area<00:01:35.810> that<00:01:37.190> pops<00:01:38.190> up<00:01:38.430> into<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> notch<00:01:39.120> in

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
little area that pops up into a notch in

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.660 
little area that pops up into a notch in
the<00:01:39.600> back<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:39.990> blade<00:01:40.170> near<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.530> pivot<00:01:40.860> to

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
the back of the blade near the pivot to

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.100 
the back of the blade near the pivot to
lock<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.000> open<00:01:43.040> and<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.370> does<00:01:44.520> have<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:45.110> quite

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
lock it open and it does have a quite

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.440 
lock it open and it does have a quite
strong<00:01:46.380> detent<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.220> keep<00:01:47.400> it<00:01:47.549> closed<00:01:47.880> until

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
strong detent to keep it closed until

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.350 
strong detent to keep it closed until
you<00:01:48.690> want<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:48.960> open<00:01:51.860> and<00:01:52.860> it's<00:01:53.760> one<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.299> those

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
you want it open and it's one of those

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.260 
you want it open and it's one of those
minimalist<00:01:54.840> designs<00:01:55.290> with<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:56.070> one<00:01:56.880> handle

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.840 
minimalist designs with just one handle
piece<00:01:57.510> and<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.500> blade<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.010> that's<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.430> and

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
piece and the blade and that's it and

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.580 
piece and the blade and that's it and
it's<00:02:00.420> obviously<00:02:00.570> there<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.320> there's<00:02:01.530> a

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
it's obviously there so that there's a

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.740 
it's obviously there so that there's a
overhang<00:02:02.189> lip<00:02:02.490> here<00:02:05.119> that<00:02:06.119> protects<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.659> edge

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
overhang lip here that protects the edge

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.840 
overhang lip here that protects the edge
of<00:02:06.900> the<00:02:06.960> blade<00:02:07.140> or<00:02:07.670> actually<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.700> should

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
of the blade or actually I should

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.940 
of the blade or actually I should
probably<00:02:09.360> say<00:02:09.720> protects<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.410> from<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.739> edge

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
probably say protects you from the edge

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.539 
probably say protects you from the edge
of<00:02:11.100> the<00:02:11.250> blade<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:13.620> machining<00:02:14.070> is<00:02:14.190> quite

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
of the blade the machining is quite

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.660 
of the blade the machining is quite
precise<00:02:15.000> because<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.890> edge<00:02:17.010> isn't<00:02:17.280> resting

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
precise because the edge isn't resting

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.440 
precise because the edge isn't resting

on the frame it's away from it by about

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.289 
on the frame it's away from it by about
the<00:02:21.660> thickness<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.290> sheet<00:02:22.320> of<00:02:22.500> paper<00:02:22.620> and

in the open position is again that
overhang<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:54.520> sits<00:02:54.730> there<00:02:56.430> very

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
overhang and it sits there very

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
anything quite like it I mean I've seen

you<00:04:18.220> folks<00:04:18.549> how<00:04:18.790> it<00:04:18.910> turned<00:04:19.120> out

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.350 

and<00:04:28.820> here<00:04:29.240> it<00:04:29.330> is<00:04:30.640> he<00:04:31.640> asked<00:04:31.880> me<00:04:32.000> to<00:04:32.030> do<00:04:32.330> a

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
and here it is he asked me to do a

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:40.960 
and here it is he asked me to do a
acid-etched<00:04:33.340> spatter<00:04:34.340> pattern<00:04:34.790> on<00:04:34.970> it<00:04:39.970> and

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
acid-etched spatter pattern on it and

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.170 
acid-etched spatter pattern on it and
I'm<00:04:41.390> I've<00:04:41.810> done<00:04:42.440> this<00:04:42.590> before<00:04:42.650> on<00:04:43.370> larger

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
I'm I've done this before on larger

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.360 
I'm I've done this before on larger
blades<00:04:44.450> like<00:04:44.840> three<00:04:45.170> and<00:04:45.290> a<00:04:45.320> half<00:04:45.500> four<00:04:46.040> inches

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
blades like three and a half four inches

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.600 
blades like three and a half four inches
long<00:04:46.780> but<00:04:47.780> this<00:04:47.930> little<00:04:48.170> guy<00:04:48.380> it's<00:04:48.800> an<00:04:49.370> inch

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
long but this little guy it's an inch

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.330 
long but this little guy it's an inch
and<00:04:49.820> a<00:04:49.880> quarter<00:04:50.090> basically<00:04:50.900> from<00:04:51.230> tip<00:04:51.620> to<00:04:52.130> the

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
and a quarter basically from tip to the

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.640 
and a quarter basically from tip to the
back<00:04:52.940> of<00:04:53.120> the<00:04:53.180> blade<00:04:53.390> maybe<00:04:54.080> an<00:04:54.320> inch<00:04:54.440> and<00:04:54.620> a

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
back of the blade maybe an inch and a

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.960 
back of the blade maybe an inch and a
half<00:04:54.680> if<00:04:55.190> you<00:04:55.220> count<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:56.020> Tang<00:04:57.020> area<00:04:57.970> and

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
half if you count the Tang area and

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.500 
half if you count the Tang area and
there's<00:04:59.600> this<00:04:59.750> big<00:04:59.960> old<00:05:00.170> hole<00:05:00.410> in<00:05:00.590> it<00:05:00.740> so<00:05:01.510> I

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
there's this big old hole in it so I

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.570 
there's this big old hole in it so I
figured<00:05:02.690> the<00:05:03.110> bit<00:05:03.260> so<00:05:03.590> well<00:05:03.950> we<00:05:04.130> figured<00:05:04.460> the

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
figured the bit so well we figured the

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.280 
figured the bit so well we figured the
big<00:05:04.730> spatters<00:05:05.210> would<00:05:05.540> probably<00:05:05.990> kind<00:05:06.200> of

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
big spatters would probably kind of

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.000 
big spatters would probably kind of
overwhelm<00:05:06.770> it<00:05:08.290> so<00:05:09.290> I<00:05:09.320> had<00:05:09.560> to<00:05:09.620> make<00:05:09.770> him<00:05:09.890> really

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
overwhelm it so I had to make him really

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:15.400 
overwhelm it so I had to make him really
tiny<00:05:10.310> which<00:05:10.850> is<00:05:11.000> what<00:05:11.150> I<00:05:11.180> did<00:05:14.110> here's<00:05:15.110> the<00:05:15.230> back

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
tiny which is what I did here's the back

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.010 
tiny which is what I did here's the back
sorry<00:05:16.070> I'm<00:05:16.190> kind<00:05:16.430> of<00:05:16.540> bouncing<00:05:17.540> around<00:05:17.630> here

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.650 
really fine grit sanding sponge to take
off<00:05:46.430> all<00:05:46.640> the<00:05:46.790> gunk<00:05:47.000> from<00:05:47.180> the<00:05:47.360> etching

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
off all the gunk from the etching

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.170 
off all the gunk from the etching
process<00:05:48.170> you<00:05:49.040> can<00:05:49.160> polish<00:05:49.370> these<00:05:49.610> up<00:05:49.670> a<00:05:49.970> little

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
process you can polish these up a little

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.720 
process you can polish these up a little
more<00:05:50.420> they'll<00:05:50.960> always<00:05:51.770> be<00:05:52.070> a<00:05:52.100> little<00:05:52.280> bit<00:05:52.460> dark

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:52.730 
more they'll always be a little bit dark

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.050 
more they'll always be a little bit dark
but<00:05:53.600> I<00:05:54.260> think<00:05:54.740> it<00:05:54.860> actually<00:05:54.980> suits<00:05:55.550> this<00:05:55.790> knife

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
but I think it actually suits this knife

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.480 
but I think it actually suits this knife
because<00:05:56.690> it<00:05:56.720> basically<00:05:57.020> matches<00:05:57.860> the<00:05:58.160> matte

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
because it basically matches the matte

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:08.610 
because it basically matches the matte
look<00:05:58.760> of<00:05:59.060> the<00:05:59.750> handle

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:16.360 

so<00:06:10.750> there<00:06:11.750> we<00:06:11.930> go

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:22.659 

that<00:06:17.740> is<00:06:19.419> my<00:06:20.419> acid<00:06:20.930> etching<00:06:21.080> on<00:06:21.440> a<00:06:22.100> knife<00:06:22.310> by
