00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.870

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.960
 we will choose all this in a few colors 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.100
 that we like and combine us to 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.430
 perform the heart 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.489
 we will also use about 50 centimeters 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.900
 of nylon yarn or nimo of 0 20 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.450
 millimeters thick 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.460
 and we can place a piece of string 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.700
 to make the necklace with the heart 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.399
 let's see how it is done 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.860
 I already have cut the 50 centimeters 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:19.140
 of thread in this case I will use slime 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.270
 in black so you can see how 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.700
 I do it but you can use nylon 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.560
 transparent, the first thing we do is 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.750
 thread a rock and one of the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.390
 ends and take it to the center of 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.670
 thread and then in row we give a 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.250
 tubing by the two ends of the thread to 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.369
 that we stay like this, I now place the 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.069
 needles to help me work better and 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.600
 by the needle on the right he turned two 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:44.600
 Rockers of the number 11 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:54.820
 and a super group account 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.820
 and placed him in his position 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.820
 and by the thread on the left we're going to 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:07.770
 sharpen again two rocks of number 11 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.770
 a super duo account 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.180
 and now we will go through the thread again 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.180
 the other hole of the super tube count 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.950
 we are like that, we lined up a rock of the 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.900
 number 11 and we passed the thread on the other 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.870
 hole of the first account super bock 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.969
 we had lined up in this way we are going to 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.450
 get to make the bottom of the 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:37.450
 heart 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.120
 there we have it and now let's start 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.120
 make the heart shape 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.109
 For this we are going to take a pebble 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.450
 of the number 11 for each end of the thread 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:02.450
 and a super duo account for both 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.530
 we will repeat this step in 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.530
 six occasions 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.930
 I already have it, I've done it six times and 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:44.000
 I can place it on your site 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.000
 you see the beginning of the heart 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.870
 and now what we are going to address is a 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.030
 rockery of number 8 by the thread of the 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.760
 right 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.630
 and a pebble of the number 15 by the thread 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.630
 from the left 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.930
 and we have had a super had for the 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.930
 two extremes 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.459
 and this step we are going to repeat in eight 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.459
 occasions 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.120
 here I have it we are going to place it in its 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.500
 position and you're going to see how the heart 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.500
 is taking its form 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.689
 there you see it is already curving 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.569
 what are we going to do now let's sharpen 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.910
 a pebble of the number 11 for each 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:11.040
 end of the thread 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.210
 and in the thread on the right we're going to 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:17.729
 thread a thick swarovski 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:20.039
 and another rock area of ​​number 11 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:22.259
 and in the thread on the left we're going to 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:24.210
 to thread a ring I leave it now 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:26.100
 placed to then be able to do the 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.340
 pendant 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:32.060
 and we take everything to its position 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:36.050
 and now we are going to monitor a super duo 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.050
 by the two extremes 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:41.650
 and in a row we will make a pebble of the number 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.689
 8 by the thread on the left and one 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.259
 rockery of number 15 by the thread of the 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:46.259
 right 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.510
 and we will repeat this eight times 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.380
 when we have it, we take everything to 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.720
 your site 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.540
 and you see we only have to perform the 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.380
 final part of the heart for it we go 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.690
 to thread 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:19.630
 a super duo by the two ends of 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:22.630
 the centuries and a pebble of the number 11 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:25.680
 for each end and we will repeat it in 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.680
 six occasions 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.210
 and now we can put the ends together 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.190
 from the heart 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:38.289
 For this we passed the threads through 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.289
 first super bock we had placed 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.650
 and we would have it now simply 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.500
 let's do what we do whenever 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:05.260
 is to join the threads to give a pair of knots 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:05.260
 and hide and cut them 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.990
 I already have them hidden I can 

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:22.729
 cut and we would have ready this 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.430
