 Renan people, I'll go there today, I'll go 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.790
 bring a quick tutorial here for you 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.689
 how to fill your pond or pool in the 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.860
 minecraft then no more scrolling let's 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.230
 over there 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.320
 first you will 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.849
 I'll show you that I did one. 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:33.750
 example is not too big of the lake 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:38.190
 that if everyone here has four blocks and 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.320
 depth here and I did the others 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.519
 two here to demonstrate to you of the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.580
 way the wrong way to do it. 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:50.580
 then a lot of people do the following makes 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:55.440
 the format that the depth of the 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:59.070
 your home is and integrates the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.229
 water and begins to fill here do to 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:10.710
 you will see 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:13.380
 I put here to fill the team winning until 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.490
 underneath it's beauty 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.590
 only when the guy who finishes 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.980
 put the wing here 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.990
 he came here with a hole in the middle and 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.280
 This hole is not going to fill 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.680
 of water 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.230
 so what is the correct way to do it? 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.920
 this you will first make the 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:38.340
 depth and width here is the format 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.350
 It's what you want and when it's time to fill 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.690
 with water will do the following will tell 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:48.570
 a block the second goal here you go 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:54.659
 ask for certain land until later with certainty 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:02:00.330
 I left ground here you will do the 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:02.370
 I just catch the water noise in Xis 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.690
 here can be in any way can be 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.690
 the glory 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:10.350
 any place as long as water does not 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.120
 stay with any type of chain is 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.740
 that the water stopped here 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:20.250
 Then after I left nothing here, it's not 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:23.310
 just do one thing break this block 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.580
 you put here and automatic is also the 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.340
 that is underneath it will fill with water 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:32.580
