00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
up my cancer treatments and one of the

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:53.740 
up my cancer treatments and one of the

that<00:00:53.869> I<00:00:53.930> was<00:00:54.080> on<00:00:54.110> that<00:00:54.290> made<00:00:54.650> me<00:00:54.799> real

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:54.979 
that I was on that made me real

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:58.170 
that I was on that made me real
sensitive<00:00:55.430> to<00:00:55.640> cold<00:00:55.879> and<00:00:56.239> I<00:00:57.049> bought<00:00:57.320> this

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
sensitive to cold and I bought this

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.219 
sensitive to cold and I bought this
thinking<00:00:59.180> that<00:00:59.360> it<00:00:59.659> would<00:00:59.780> help<00:00:59.900> with<00:00:59.989> my

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
thinking that it would help with my

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.130 
thinking that it would help with my
hands<00:01:00.680> and<00:01:00.830> and<00:01:01.070> anything<00:01:02.059> else<00:01:02.210> because<00:01:02.900> that

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
hands and and anything else because that

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.299 
hands and and anything else because that
was<00:01:03.260> one<00:01:03.409> of<00:01:03.470> the<00:01:03.559> areas<00:01:03.830> that<00:01:03.860> I<00:01:04.010> was<00:01:04.159> having

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
was one of the areas that I was having

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.609 
was one of the areas that I was having
some<00:01:04.549> issues<00:01:04.640> with<00:01:05.030> and<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:06.170> side<00:01:06.350> effects

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
some issues with and the side effects

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:07.990 
some issues with and the side effects
actually<00:01:06.770> went<00:01:07.070> away<00:01:07.130> fairly<00:01:07.430> quickly<00:01:07.580> with

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
actually went away fairly quickly with

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.700 
actually went away fairly quickly with
my<00:01:08.119> hands<00:01:08.360> and<00:01:08.600> didn't<00:01:08.750> have<00:01:08.840> to<00:01:09.049> worry<00:01:09.590> about

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
my hands and didn't have to worry about

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.289 
my hands and didn't have to worry about
that<00:01:09.979> and<00:01:10.189> so<00:01:10.369> I<00:01:10.399> just<00:01:10.429> never<00:01:10.789> have<00:01:10.939> used<00:01:11.149> it

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
that and so I just never have used it

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.690 
that and so I just never have used it

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
going to give it a try today and see

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:52.899 
going to give it a try today and see
what<00:01:50.689> happens<00:01:51.079> it<00:01:51.770> looks<00:01:52.189> like<00:01:52.340> a<00:01:52.369> big<00:01:52.609> Zippo

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
what happens it looks like a big Zippo

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.830 
what happens it looks like a big Zippo
lighter<00:01:53.920> you<00:01:54.920> know<00:01:54.979> it<00:01:55.130> has<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:55.609> the<00:01:56.389> holes<00:01:56.600> on

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
lighter you know it has the the holes on

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.749 
lighter you know it has the the holes on
the<00:01:56.960> side<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.469> 16<00:01:57.889> holes<00:01:58.100> they've<00:01:58.399> got<00:01:58.549> those

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
the side the 16 holes they've got those

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.550 
the side the 16 holes they've got those
there<00:01:59.090> and<00:01:59.359> on<00:02:00.200> that<00:02:00.409> side<00:02:00.679> like<00:02:01.249> the<00:02:01.490> event<00:02:02.560> or

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
there and on that side like the event or

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.499 
there and on that side like the event or
the<00:02:03.649> chimney<00:02:03.979> on<00:02:04.069> the<00:02:04.219> Zippo<00:02:04.490> lighter<00:02:04.729> has

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
the chimney on the Zippo lighter has

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.139 
the chimney on the Zippo lighter has
some<00:02:06.319> ventilation<00:02:06.530> holes<00:02:07.009> and<00:02:07.789> I'm<00:02:07.880> sorry

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
some ventilation holes and I'm sorry

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.580 
some ventilation holes and I'm sorry
this<00:02:08.300> is<00:02:08.450> Chrome<00:02:08.780> so<00:02:09.020> it's<00:02:09.140> a<00:02:09.170> little<00:02:09.350> harder

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590

to look at has some ventilation holes

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.450 
to look at has some ventilation holes
there<00:02:11.209> and<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:12.080> this<00:02:12.230> this<00:02:12.830> gets<00:02:13.040> pretty<00:02:13.190> warm

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
the the catalytic converter that thing

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.200 
the the catalytic converter that thing
will<00:02:50.180> focus<00:02:50.950> there<00:02:51.950> we<00:02:52.070> go<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:52.880> you<00:02:52.940> know<00:02:53.150> you

these<00:03:07.580> converters<00:03:08.390> I<00:03:08.750> bought<00:03:09.350> an<00:03:09.470> extra<00:03:09.560> one

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
these converters I bought an extra one

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.260 
these converters I bought an extra one
when<00:03:10.100> I<00:03:10.130> bought<00:03:10.340> this<00:03:10.490> and<00:03:10.670> I<00:03:10.700> bought<00:03:10.880> this<00:03:11.060> off

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
when I bought this and I bought this off

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.720 
when I bought this and I bought this off
the<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.780> Zippo<00:03:12.080> website<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:12.800> knew<00:03:13.430> I<00:03:13.460> could

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
the the Zippo website I knew I could

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.170 
the the Zippo website I knew I could
probably<00:03:13.970> find<00:03:14.450> it<00:03:14.800> off<00:03:15.800> of<00:03:16.220> Amazon<00:03:16.730> or<00:03:16.970> Ebay

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
probably find it off of Amazon or Ebay

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.420 
probably find it off of Amazon or Ebay
probably<00:03:18.170> cheaper<00:03:18.440> but<00:03:18.710> I<00:03:18.740> just<00:03:18.950> I<00:03:19.130> don't<00:03:19.280> like

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
probably cheaper but I just I don't like

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.200 
probably cheaper but I just I don't like
using<00:03:20.230> eBay<00:03:21.430> I'd<00:03:22.430> rather<00:03:22.610> just<00:03:22.790> go<00:03:22.940> direct

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
using eBay I'd rather just go direct

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.210 
using eBay I'd rather just go direct
with<00:03:23.360> the<00:03:23.420> company<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:23.930> buy<00:03:24.320> it<00:03:24.380> there<00:03:24.650> that

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
with the company and buy it there that

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.180 
with the company and buy it there that
way<00:03:25.340> I<00:03:25.370> know<00:03:25.460> I'm<00:03:25.640> getting<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:26.030> good<00:03:26.450> product

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
way I know I'm getting the good product

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.400 
way I know I'm getting the good product
but<00:03:28.190> that's<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:28.790> catalytic<00:03:29.210> converter

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
but that's the catalytic converter

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.990 
but that's the catalytic converter
it<00:03:30.620> took<00:03:30.800> me<00:03:30.950> twice<00:03:31.220> to<00:03:31.460> get<00:03:31.580> this<00:03:31.700> lit

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
it took me twice to get this lit

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.650 
it took me twice to get this lit
probably<00:03:32.570> won't<00:03:32.750> be<00:03:32.900> a<00:03:32.930> problem<00:03:33.230> next<00:03:33.650> time

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
probably won't be a problem next time

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.000 
probably won't be a problem next time
but<00:03:35.660> using<00:03:35.930> my<00:03:36.020> Zippo<00:03:36.290> lighter<00:03:36.500> you<00:03:36.680> just<00:03:36.860> put

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
but using my Zippo lighter you just put

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.500 
but using my Zippo lighter you just put
that<00:03:37.130> in<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:37.340> flame<00:03:37.580> until<00:03:37.910> it<00:03:37.970> lights<00:03:38.180> up<00:03:38.390> and

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
that in the flame until it lights up and

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.720 
that in the flame until it lights up and
you<00:03:38.600> can<00:03:38.810> tell<00:03:39.020> I<00:03:39.290> think<00:03:40.070> I<00:03:40.130> put<00:03:40.310> it<00:03:40.370> in<00:03:40.460> a<00:03:40.490> bag<00:03:40.700> a

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
you can tell I think I put it in a bag a

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.640 
you can tell I think I put it in a bag a
little<00:03:40.940> too<00:03:41.150> quick<00:03:41.450> and<00:03:41.630> didn't<00:03:42.140> didn't<00:03:42.530> get

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.730 
going good but of course like I said

seven after 70 80 times you need to

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.939 
seven after 70 80 times you need to
start<00:04:42.900> looking<00:04:43.199> at<00:04:43.289> it<00:04:43.470> see<00:04:43.650> if<00:04:43.680> it<00:04:43.830> still

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
start looking at it see if it still

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.550 
start looking at it see if it still
going<00:04:44.039> to<00:04:44.099> work<00:04:44.310> so<00:04:44.639> I<00:04:44.870> bought<00:04:45.870> one<00:04:45.900> extra<00:04:46.440> one

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:49.409 
and that will probably last quite a
