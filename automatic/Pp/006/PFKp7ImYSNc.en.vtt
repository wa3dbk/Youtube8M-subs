out hold it this way I think to go up
and<00:02:00.430> then<00:02:01.270> you<00:02:01.360> twist<00:02:01.690> it<00:02:01.930> and<00:02:02.140> go<00:02:02.260> out<00:02:02.500> that

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
and then you twist it and go out that

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:12.670 
and then you twist it and go out that
way<00:02:02.830> so
