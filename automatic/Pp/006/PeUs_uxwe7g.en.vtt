little demo here my name's Sam wanker
I'm<00:00:30.300> with<00:00:30.419> the<00:00:30.540> coppell<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.050> liquid<00:00:31.290> fella<00:00:31.439> is

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
I'm with the coppell the liquid fella is

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.290 
I'm with the coppell the liquid fella is
a<00:00:31.649> water-repellent<00:00:32.160> formulation<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.090> we've

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
a water-repellent formulation that we've

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.580 
a water-repellent formulation that we've
created<00:00:33.540> taking<00:00:34.050> about<00:00:34.200> two<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.470> a<00:00:34.530> half

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
created taking about two and a half

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.450 
created taking about two and a half
years<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.100> create<00:00:35.340> basically<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.690> was

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
years to create basically I was

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.549 
years to create basically I was
a<00:00:37.520> pressurized<00:00:38.420> chamber<00:00:38.600> a<00:00:38.930> special<00:00:39.440> machine

a pressurized chamber a special machine
built<00:00:40.040> by<00:00:40.190> Liquipel<00:00:40.670> basically<00:00:41.420> you<00:00:41.540> stick

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
built by Liquipel basically you stick

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.780 
built by Liquipel basically you stick
the<00:00:41.899> device<00:00:42.140> inside<00:00:42.559> the<00:00:42.710> machine<00:00:43.040> for<00:00:43.489> 20

pumps<00:00:47.960> down<00:00:48.140> into<00:00:48.829> the<00:00:48.949> actual<00:00:49.190> device

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
pumps down into the actual device

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.759 
pumps down into the actual device
permeating<00:00:50.180> the<00:00:50.239> entire<00:00:50.629> device<00:00:50.989> inside<00:00:51.500> and

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
permeating the entire device inside and

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:54.549 
permeating the entire device inside and
out<00:00:51.980> once<00:00:52.640> it's<00:00:52.790> actually<00:00:53.120> created<00:00:53.659> the<00:00:54.290> force

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
out once it's actually created the force

out once it's actually created the force
data<00:00:54.739> matter<00:00:55.040> comes<00:00:55.339> on<00:00:55.489> plasma<00:00:56.390> plasma

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
data matter comes on plasma plasma

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.960 
data matter comes on plasma plasma
actually<00:00:57.440> binds<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:57.949> coating<00:00:58.339> to<00:00:58.519> the<00:00:58.670> device

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
actually binds the coating to the device

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.759 
actually binds the coating to the device
on<00:00:59.239> a<00:00:59.269> molecular<00:00:59.570> level<00:00:59.870> so<00:01:00.470> it<00:01:00.559> becomes

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
on a molecular level so it becomes

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.799 
on a molecular level so it becomes
actually<00:01:01.339> part<00:01:01.699> of<00:01:01.760> the<00:01:01.820> structure<00:01:02.360> of<00:01:02.390> the

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
actually part of the structure of the

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.560 
actually part of the structure of the
device<00:01:03.079> so<00:01:03.620> it's<00:01:03.920> inside<00:01:04.369> and<00:01:04.729> outside<00:01:04.940> and<00:01:05.479> it

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
device so it's inside and outside and it

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.749 
device so it's inside and outside and it
becomes<00:01:06.229> the<00:01:06.560> structure<00:01:07.009> so<00:01:07.190> you<00:01:07.280> can't<00:01:07.520> see

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
becomes the structure so you can't see

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:09.370 
becomes the structure so you can't see
it<00:01:07.880> you<00:01:07.909> can't<00:01:08.090> feel<00:01:08.540> it<00:01:08.570> it<00:01:08.840> doesn't<00:01:09.020> affect

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
it you can't feel it it doesn't affect

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.860 
it you can't feel it it doesn't affect
the<00:01:09.470> functionality<00:01:09.860> of

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
the functionality of

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.900 
the functionality of
so<00:01:11.260> this<00:01:11.470> this<00:01:11.830> beam<00:01:12.100> axis<00:01:12.400> treated<00:01:12.700> with<00:01:12.820> the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
so this this beam axis treated with the

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.340 
so this this beam axis treated with the
same<00:01:12.940> technology<00:01:13.630> that<00:01:13.660> is<00:01:13.870> inside<00:01:14.230> the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
same technology that is inside the

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.070 
same technology that is inside the
device<00:01:14.620> as<00:01:15.400> you<00:01:15.550> can<00:01:15.670> see<00:01:15.790> look<00:01:16.210> the<00:01:16.360> same<00:01:16.540> feel

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
device as you can see look the same feel

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.070 
device as you can see look the same feel
the<00:01:17.260> same<00:01:17.470> same<00:01:18.130> properties<00:01:18.730> however<00:01:19.690> when

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
the same same properties however when

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.570 
the same same properties however when
water<00:01:20.320> does<00:01:20.560> come<00:01:20.800> in<00:01:20.920> contact<00:01:21.100> with<00:01:21.370> this

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
water does come in contact with this

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.490 
water does come in contact with this
Phoenix<00:01:22.000> it<00:01:22.450> sits<00:01:22.690> on<00:01:22.840> top<00:01:23.050> of<00:01:23.110> the<00:01:23.320> surface

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
Phoenix it sits on top of the surface

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.550 
Phoenix it sits on top of the surface
and<00:01:23.950> does<00:01:24.100> not<00:01:24.240> soak<00:01:25.240> in<00:01:25.480> and<00:01:25.720> does<00:01:26.440> not

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
and does not soak in and does not

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.520 
and does not soak in and does not
corrode<00:01:26.920> or<00:01:27.220> absorb<00:01:28.180> it<00:01:28.750> actually<00:01:29.110> is<00:01:29.260> so

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
corrode or absorb it actually is so

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.900 
corrode or absorb it actually is so
repellent<00:01:29.890> that<00:01:30.100> it<00:01:30.280> will<00:01:30.370> follow<00:01:30.670> your

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
repellent that it will follow your

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.360 
repellent that it will follow your
finger<00:01:31.500> because<00:01:32.500> they<00:01:32.590> want<00:01:32.800> to<00:01:32.890> get<00:01:33.010> off<00:01:33.130> so

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
finger because they want to get off so

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.880 
finger because they want to get off so
bad<00:01:33.610> so<00:01:34.180> as<00:01:34.300> you<00:01:34.420> can<00:01:34.510> see<00:01:34.660> here<00:01:34.930> still<00:01:35.590> dry

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
bad so as you can see here still dry

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.790 
bad so as you can see here still dry
even<00:01:36.400> when<00:01:36.520> I<00:01:36.610> try<00:01:36.640> to<00:01:36.820> dunk<00:01:37.120> it<00:01:37.800> stays

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
even when I try to dunk it stays

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.710 
even when I try to dunk it stays
completely<00:01:39.250> drive<00:01:39.580> so<00:01:39.880> the<00:01:39.970> same<00:01:40.150> technology

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
completely drive so the same technology

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.600 
completely drive so the same technology
that<00:01:40.750> is<00:01:40.990> in<00:01:41.020> on<00:01:41.470> this<00:01:41.650> v-neck<00:01:41.860> in<00:01:42.250> this<00:01:42.370> pump

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
that is in on this v-neck in this pump

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.430 
that is in on this v-neck in this pump
if<00:01:43.090> you<00:01:43.210> want<00:01:43.450> to<00:01:43.510> go<00:01:43.570> in<00:01:43.660> the<00:01:43.750> sauna<00:01:43.960> or<00:01:44.350> you

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
if you want to go in the sauna or you

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.660 
if you want to go in the sauna or you
have<00:01:44.560> accident<00:01:45.130> you<00:01:45.280> drop<00:01:45.490> through<00:01:45.640> the
