here<00:02:06.840> there's<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.320> smaller<00:02:08.160> cow<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.729> have

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
here there's a smaller cow that I have

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.460 
here there's a smaller cow that I have
on<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.060> piece<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.450> paper<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:09.929> guess<00:02:10.140> it's<00:02:10.319> over

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
on that piece of paper I guess it's over

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.010 
on that piece of paper I guess it's over
here<00:02:10.950> on<00:02:11.580> this<00:02:11.819> one<00:02:12.030> there's<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.510> count<00:02:12.870> you

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
here on this one there's that count you

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.270 
here on this one there's that count you
can

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
can

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.490 
can
going<00:02:13.580> that<00:02:13.790> way<00:02:14.030> you<00:02:14.720> can<00:02:14.870> turn<00:02:15.020> around<00:02:15.080> have

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
going that way you can turn around have

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.800 
going that way you can turn around have
been<00:02:15.620> going<00:02:15.860> that<00:02:16.010> way<00:02:16.310> so<00:02:17.000> it's<00:02:17.150> an<00:02:17.270> easy<00:02:17.390> way

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
been going that way so it's an easy way

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.020 
been going that way so it's an easy way
to<00:02:17.840> add<00:02:18.290> a<00:02:18.319> little<00:02:18.530> animals<00:02:19.220> or<00:02:19.490> things<00:02:19.819> if

birds to be I cut out a paper the little
birds<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.510> I'll<00:02:38.510> lay<00:02:38.780> them<00:02:39.080> on<00:02:39.230> there<00:02:40.090> so<00:02:41.090> I

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
birds and I'll lay them on there so I

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.970 
birds and I'll lay them on there so I
did<00:02:41.630> this<00:02:41.780> one<00:02:42.020> because<00:02:42.140> I<00:02:42.380> thought<00:02:42.530> this<00:02:42.739> is<00:02:42.950> a

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
did this one because I thought this is a

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.590 
did this one because I thought this is a
good<00:02:43.190> center<00:02:43.489> of<00:02:43.580> interest<00:02:43.940> back<00:02:44.150> there<00:02:44.390> so<00:02:44.540> I

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
good center of interest back there so I

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.800 
good center of interest back there so I
could<00:02:44.660> have<00:02:44.870> one<00:02:44.930> bird<00:02:45.459> kind<00:02:46.459> of<00:02:46.640> down<00:02:47.030> low<00:02:47.450> and

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
could have one bird kind of down low and

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.620 
could have one bird kind of down low and
one<00:02:48.290> maybe<00:02:48.830> a<00:02:48.980> PI<00:02:49.370> right<00:02:49.670> behind<00:02:50.060> him<00:02:50.269> or<00:02:50.420> back

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
one maybe a PI right behind him or back

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.650 
one maybe a PI right behind him or back
here<00:02:51.019> so<00:02:51.830> I<00:02:51.860> have<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.190> two<00:02:52.370> birds<00:02:52.640> coming<00:02:53.120> into

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
going to have to do it again because it

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.140 
going to have to do it again because it
didn't<00:03:33.019> come<00:03:33.230> out<00:03:33.260> that<00:03:33.650> well<00:03:34.190> on<00:03:34.489> this<00:03:34.790> paper

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
didn't come out that well on this paper

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.199 
didn't come out that well on this paper
but<00:03:35.480> that's<00:03:35.630> pretty<00:03:35.840> well<00:03:36.579> let<00:03:37.579> me<00:03:37.700> dry<00:03:37.910> this<00:03:37.970> a

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
but that's pretty well let me dry this a

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.860 
but that's pretty well let me dry this a
little<00:03:38.540> bit<00:03:39.610> both<00:03:40.610> sides<00:03:40.940> put<00:03:41.390> it<00:03:41.480> back<00:03:41.630> over

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
little bit both sides put it back over

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.849 
little bit both sides put it back over
there<00:03:43.600> just<00:03:44.600> like<00:03:44.810> that<00:03:44.870> and<00:03:45.440> then<00:03:45.620> I'm<00:03:45.739> going

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
there just like that and then I'm going

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:52.720 
there just like that and then I'm going
to<00:03:45.950> do<00:03:46.100> it<00:03:46.220> again<00:03:50.650> there<00:03:51.650> we<00:03:51.890> go<00:03:52.100> now<00:03:52.489> then

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
to do it again there we go now then

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.000 
to do it again there we go now then
that's<00:03:52.970> better<00:03:53.299> that's<00:03:54.049> not<00:03:54.290> a<00:03:54.320> bad<00:03:54.590> bird<00:03:54.859> at

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
that's better that's not a bad bird at

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.490 
that's better that's not a bad bird at
all<00:03:55.130> is<00:03:55.400> it<00:03:55.430> and<00:03:56.269> we'll<00:03:56.570> put<00:03:56.750> a<00:03:56.780> smaller<00:03:57.140> bird

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
all is it and we'll put a smaller bird

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.470 
all is it and we'll put a smaller bird
right<00:03:57.769> up<00:03:57.920> here<00:03:58.130> in<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:58.370> sky<00:04:01.180> we<00:04:02.180> probably

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
right up here in the sky we probably

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.270 
right up here in the sky we probably
have<00:04:02.930> to<00:04:03.079> know<00:04:03.350> I<00:04:03.380> think<00:04:03.590> it's<00:04:03.890> going<00:04:03.980> to<00:04:04.100> work

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
have to know I think it's going to work

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.759 
have to know I think it's going to work
just<00:04:04.310> fine<00:04:04.760> I<00:04:05.060> started<00:04:05.930> say<00:04:06.049> we<00:04:06.200> may<00:04:06.380> have<00:04:06.620> to

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
just fine I started say we may have to

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.310 
just fine I started say we may have to
paint<00:04:07.070> around<00:04:07.370> it<00:04:07.609> a<00:04:07.730> little<00:04:07.880> bit<00:04:08.180> but<00:04:08.390> I<00:04:08.630> don't

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
paint around it a little bit but I don't

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.229 
paint around it a little bit but I don't
believe<00:04:09.590> we<00:04:09.890> will<00:04:10.130> right<00:04:10.640> there's<00:04:10.970> going<00:04:11.180> to

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
believe we will right there's going to

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.319 
believe we will right there's going to

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
stronger it probably wouldn't work I can

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
also so that gives me a center of

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.870 
also so that gives me a center of
interest<00:05:09.020> is<00:05:09.500> the<00:05:09.620> works<00:05:09.830> good<00:05:10.370> that<00:05:10.640> way
