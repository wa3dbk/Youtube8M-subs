00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
early in the pre spawn and once they

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.240 
early in the pre spawn and once they
move<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.200> little<00:00:34.320> bit<00:00:34.469> shallower<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.160> they

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
move a little bit shallower and they

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.940 
move a little bit shallower and they

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
pattern and they have a defense

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.950 
pattern and they have a defense
mechanism<00:00:40.460> to<00:00:41.460> chase<00:00:42.000> any<00:00:42.239> blue<00:00:42.450> gills<00:00:42.690> off

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
mechanism to chase any blue gills off

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.420 
mechanism to chase any blue gills off
that<00:00:43.140> come<00:00:43.320> near<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:43.770> that's<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.040> good<00:00:44.190> color

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
that come near so that's a good color

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.310 
that come near so that's a good color
once<00:00:45.180> they<00:00:45.329> move<00:00:45.510> up<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.690> little<00:00:45.840> bit<00:00:45.960> shallower

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
once they move up a little bit shallower

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.529 
once they move up a little bit shallower
and<00:00:46.590> then<00:00:47.219> also<00:00:47.370> if<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.730> ever<00:00:48.000> come<00:00:48.420> across
