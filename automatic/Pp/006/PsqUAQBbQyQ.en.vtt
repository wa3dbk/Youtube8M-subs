moments of truth where we go ahead and
put<00:00:20.539> the<00:00:20.930> table<00:00:21.289> top<00:00:21.560> on<00:00:22.750> the<00:00:24.039> carcass<00:00:25.039> and

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
put the table top on the carcass and

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.100 
put the table top on the carcass and
line<00:00:25.730> it<00:00:25.910> up<00:00:26.060> so<00:00:27.610> yeah<00:00:28.610> if<00:00:28.849> this<00:00:29.539> is<00:00:29.750> the<00:00:29.840> last

line it up so yeah if this is the last

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.779 
line it up so yeah if this is the last
video<00:00:30.380> you<00:00:30.560> see<00:00:30.950> of<00:00:31.070> me<00:00:31.099> it's<00:00:31.460> been<00:00:31.609> nice

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
video you see of me it's been nice

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.479

knowing you and you know love and kisses
to<00:00:34.519> all<00:00:34.670> my<00:00:35.230> family<00:00:40.150> so<00:00:41.150> essentially<00:00:41.510> I<00:00:41.629> had<00:00:41.809> to

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
to all my family so essentially I had to

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.590 
to all my family so essentially I had to
just<00:00:42.440> put<00:00:42.620> some<00:00:42.800> filler<00:00:43.790> in<00:00:44.030> there<00:00:44.059> just<00:00:44.449> to

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
just put some filler in there just to

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.420 
just put some filler in there just to
keep<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:44.900> table<00:00:45.260> up<00:00:45.470> support<00:00:46.250> it<00:00:46.309> up

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
keep the table up support it up

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.190 
keep the table up support it up
somewhere<00:00:46.730> take<00:00:46.970> those<00:00:47.120> off<00:00:47.300> first<00:00:48.910> actually

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
somewhere take those off first actually

00:00:50.200 --> 00:01:25.350 
somewhere take those off first actually
now<00:00:51.200> I'm<00:00:51.350> going<00:00:51.530> to<00:00:51.620> lock<00:00:51.770> it<00:00:51.800> down<00:00:52.100> first

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.970 

okay<00:01:26.360> so<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.600> next<00:01:26.780> step<00:01:26.960> is<00:01:27.170> go<00:01:27.470> ahead<00:01:27.590> and

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
okay so the next step is go ahead and

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.190 
okay so the next step is go ahead and
throw<00:01:28.520> some<00:01:28.550> glue<00:01:29.060> on<00:01:29.090> here<00:01:29.660> and<00:01:29.840> screw<00:01:30.110> it

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
throw some glue on here and screw it

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.530 
throw some glue on here and screw it
down<00:01:30.230> and<00:01:31.070> I<00:01:31.670> just<00:01:31.760> thought<00:01:32.060> I'd<00:01:32.180> show<00:01:32.360> this

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
down and I just thought I'd show this

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.580 
down and I just thought I'd show this
because<00:01:32.780> I<00:01:32.840> thought<00:01:33.050> that<00:01:33.110> was<00:01:33.470> pretty

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
because I thought that was pretty

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.300 
because I thought that was pretty
ingenious<00:01:33.800> of<00:01:34.310> me<00:01:35.380> being<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.620> solitary

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
ingenious of me being the solitary

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.240 
ingenious of me being the solitary
worker<00:01:37.580> here<00:01:37.940> I<00:01:38.410> was<00:01:39.410> able<00:01:39.560> to<00:01:39.800> lift<00:01:40.010> this<00:01:40.190> up

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
worker here I was able to lift this up

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.700 
worker here I was able to lift this up
and<00:01:40.640> so<00:01:40.790> what<00:01:40.910> I'm<00:01:41.000> going<00:01:41.090> to<00:01:41.180> do<00:01:41.360> is

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
and so what I'm going to do is

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.590 
and so what I'm going to do is
essentially<00:01:42.710> spray<00:01:43.070> spread<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.670> glue<00:01:44.270> along

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
essentially spray spread the glue along

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.560 
essentially spray spread the glue along
the<00:01:44.660> base<00:01:44.990> line<00:01:45.230> here<00:01:45.650> on<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.190> underside

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
the base line here on the underside

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.450 
the base line here on the underside
using<00:01:48.370> some<00:01:49.780> just<00:01:50.780> a<00:01:50.930> little<00:01:51.620> wire<00:01:51.770> brush<00:01:51.800> and

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
using some just a little wire brush and

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.870 
using some just a little wire brush and
it<00:01:53.420> may<00:01:53.630> be<00:01:53.690> able<00:01:54.080> to<00:01:54.290> get<00:01:54.410> me<00:01:54.680> get<00:01:54.860> be<00:01:55.400> able<00:01:55.610> to

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
it may be able to get me get be able to

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.820 
it may be able to get me get be able to
get<00:01:56.000> glue<00:01:56.240> around<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:56.630> entire<00:01:56.960> edge<00:01:57.170> then

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
get glue around the entire edge then

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.600 
get glue around the entire edge then
lift<00:01:58.280> this<00:01:58.580> up<00:01:58.810> pull<00:01:59.810> this<00:01:59.960> out<00:02:00.250> tip<00:02:01.250> it<00:02:01.400> to<00:02:01.490> the

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
lift this up pull this out tip it to the

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.450 
lift this up pull this out tip it to the
other<00:02:01.760> side<00:02:02.000> pull<00:02:02.510> the<00:02:02.600> other<00:02:02.720> one<00:02:02.870> out<00:02:02.900> and

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
other side pull the other one out and

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.920 
other side pull the other one out and
it'll<00:02:04.460> see<00:02:04.670> down<00:02:04.880> and<00:02:05.150> then<00:02:05.330> we'll<00:02:05.420> glue<00:02:05.630> it

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
it'll see down and then we'll glue it

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.800 
it'll see down and then we'll glue it
and<00:02:06.200> once<00:02:06.440> the<00:02:06.770> set<00:02:07.580> there<00:02:07.790> we'll<00:02:08.000> put<00:02:08.240> some

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
and once the set there we'll put some

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.030 
and once the set there we'll put some
screws<00:02:08.990> in<00:02:09.110> it<00:02:09.350> and<00:02:09.530> I<00:02:09.590> think<00:02:09.679> we'll<00:02:09.920> be<00:02:10.010> ready

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
screws in it and I think we'll be ready

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.010 
screws in it and I think we'll be ready
to<00:02:10.340> go<00:02:12.430> alright<00:02:13.430> so<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:14.300> next<00:02:14.480> part<00:02:14.690> of<00:02:14.900> this

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
to go alright so the next part of this

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.280 
to go alright so the next part of this
is<00:02:15.230> going<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.530> be<00:02:15.650> to<00:02:16.030> cut<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.270> backing<00:02:17.900> for

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
is going to be to cut the backing for

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.250 
is going to be to cut the backing for
the<00:02:18.740> dust<00:02:19.010> chute<00:02:19.790> so<00:02:20.680> my<00:02:21.680> measurement<00:02:22.640> about

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
the dust chute so my measurement about

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.740 
the dust chute so my measurement about
11<00:02:24.260> by<00:02:24.470> 16<00:02:24.530> and<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.040> half<00:02:25.250> of<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.490> back<00:02:25.670> so<00:02:26.390> I'm

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
11 by 16 and a half of the back so I'm

00:02:26.750 --> 00:03:17.420 
11 by 16 and a half of the back so I'm
going<00:02:26.990> to<00:02:27.050> go<00:02:27.110> ahead<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.410> start<00:02:27.920> cutting

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.590 

okay<00:03:18.430> give<00:03:18.640> you<00:03:18.730> an<00:03:18.820> idea<00:03:19.060> what's<00:03:19.240> going<00:03:19.450> on

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
okay give you an idea what's going on

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.810 
okay give you an idea what's going on
here<00:03:19.990> now<00:03:20.520> so<00:03:21.520> I've<00:03:21.760> got<00:03:22.740> the<00:03:23.740> dust<00:03:24.490> collection

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
here now so I've got the dust collection

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.900 
here now so I've got the dust collection
been<00:03:25.810> there<00:03:26.110> and<00:03:26.380> so<00:03:26.950> next<00:03:27.580> step<00:03:27.880> is<00:03:28.090> I<00:03:28.570> cut<00:03:29.320> a

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
been there and so next step is I cut a

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.460 
been there and so next step is I cut a
piece<00:03:30.910> of<00:03:31.650> MDF<00:03:32.650> quarter<00:03:33.430> inch<00:03:33.550> MDF

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
piece of MDF quarter inch MDF

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.550 
piece of MDF quarter inch MDF
this<00:03:35.470> fits<00:03:36.010> up<00:03:36.160> flush<00:03:36.459> around<00:03:37.180> there<00:03:37.390> then<00:03:38.320> put

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
this fits up flush around there then put

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.350 
this fits up flush around there then put
a<00:03:38.590> hinge<00:03:38.890> or<00:03:39.190> a<00:03:39.250> handle<00:03:39.700> something<00:03:39.910> fits

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
a hinge or a handle something fits

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.610 
a hinge or a handle something fits
nicely<00:03:41.080> actually

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
nicely actually

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.600 
nicely actually
and<00:03:42.060> so<00:03:43.060> this<00:03:43.630> will<00:03:43.900> trap<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.560> dust<00:03:45.280> inside

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
and so this will trap the dust inside

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.420 
and so this will trap the dust inside
here<00:03:45.940> and<00:03:46.060> I'm<00:03:46.209> going<00:03:46.360> to<00:03:46.420> next<00:03:47.110> cut<00:03:47.380> a<00:03:47.410> hole<00:03:47.680> or

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
here and I'm going to next cut a hole or

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.630 
here and I'm going to next cut a hole or
square<00:03:48.850> actually<00:03:49.090> to<00:03:49.600> accommodate<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:52.230> port

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
square actually to accommodate the port

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:02.070 
square actually to accommodate the port
for<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:54.880> dust<00:03:55.060> collector<00:04:00.300> all<00:04:01.300> right<00:04:01.480> so<00:04:01.690> I

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
for the dust collector all right so I

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.660 
for the dust collector all right so I
finally<00:04:02.290> got<00:04:02.440> the<00:04:02.560> back<00:04:02.709> back<00:04:03.160> cover<00:04:03.400> on<00:04:03.489> the

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
finally got the back back cover on the

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.310 
finally got the back back cover on the
port<00:04:04.030> I<00:04:04.209> was<00:04:04.480> trying<00:04:04.690> to<00:04:04.750> come<00:04:04.870> up<00:04:04.930> with<00:04:05.020> a

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
port I was trying to come up with a

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.229 
port I was trying to come up with a
couple<00:04:05.739> of<00:04:05.890> different<00:04:06.250> ideas<00:04:06.400> on<00:04:06.970> how<00:04:07.180> to

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
couple of different ideas on how to

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.620 
couple of different ideas on how to
attach<00:04:07.780> it<00:04:08.140> just<00:04:08.730> put<00:04:09.730> the<00:04:09.760> hinges<00:04:10.270> or

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
attach it just put the hinges or

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.949 
attach it just put the hinges or
something<00:04:10.840> like<00:04:10.959> that<00:04:11.170> and<00:04:11.530> I<00:04:12.630> just<00:04:13.630> found<00:04:13.750> out

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
something like that and I just found out

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.740 
something like that and I just found out
it<00:04:14.050> was<00:04:14.170> just<00:04:14.290> a<00:04:14.500> little<00:04:14.590> too<00:04:14.890> complicated<00:04:15.750> so

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
it was just a little too complicated so

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.729 
it was just a little too complicated so
what<00:04:17.620> I<00:04:17.650> managed<00:04:18.130> to<00:04:18.160> do<00:04:18.600> is<00:04:19.600> just<00:04:19.840> create<00:04:19.959> a

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
what I managed to do is just create a

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:27.630 
what I managed to do is just create a
sliding<00:04:21.640> door<00:04:21.850> and<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:25.470> port<00:04:26.470> that<00:04:27.220> I<00:04:27.340> have<00:04:27.490> on

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
sliding door and the port that I have on

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.159 
sliding door and the port that I have on
here<00:04:28.090> I<00:04:28.870> simply<00:04:29.620> just<00:04:29.830> cut<00:04:30.190> a<00:04:30.220> hole<00:04:31.020> there<00:04:32.020> yeah

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
here I simply just cut a hole there yeah

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.500 
here I simply just cut a hole there yeah
get<00:04:32.530> it<00:04:32.650> on<00:04:32.710> the<00:04:32.800> screen<00:04:32.890> area<00:04:33.370> for<00:04:34.150> the<00:04:34.210> port<00:04:34.450> I

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
get it on the screen area for the port I

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.570 
get it on the screen area for the port I
just<00:04:34.690> simply<00:04:34.960> cut<00:04:35.140> a<00:04:35.169> hole<00:04:35.440> has<00:04:35.979> some<00:04:36.190> screws

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
just simply cut a hole has some screws

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.570 
just simply cut a hole has some screws
and<00:04:38.130> for<00:04:39.130> the<00:04:39.220> screws<00:04:39.550> I<00:04:39.790> actually<00:04:40.080> did<00:04:41.080> a

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
and for the screws I actually did a

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.670 
and for the screws I actually did a
countersink<00:04:42.580> in<00:04:42.790> there<00:04:43.000> so<00:04:43.300> they'll<00:04:43.680> it's

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
countersink in there so they'll it's

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.810 
countersink in there so they'll it's
flush<00:04:45.100> across<00:04:46.030> here<00:04:46.300> and<00:04:46.770> to<00:04:47.770> attach<00:04:48.160> it<00:04:48.430> all

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
flush across here and to attach it all

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:56.670 
flush across here and to attach it all
you<00:04:48.940> got<00:04:49.090> to<00:04:49.180> do<00:04:49.470> just<00:04:55.050> slide<00:04:56.050> it<00:04:56.290> into<00:04:56.380> place

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
you got to do just slide it into place

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.100 
you got to do just slide it into place
and<00:04:56.950> I<00:04:57.520> just<00:04:57.700> put<00:04:57.850> a<00:04:57.880> essentially<00:04:58.840> just<00:04:59.050> a

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
and I just put a essentially just a

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.290 
and I just put a essentially just a
little<00:04:59.320> cleat<00:04:59.560> here<00:04:59.950> I'm<00:05:00.669> here<00:05:00.910> to<00:05:01.030> hold<00:05:01.180> it

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
little cleat here I'm here to hold it

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.020 
little cleat here I'm here to hold it
into<00:05:01.390> place<00:05:01.540> then<00:05:02.410> put<00:05:02.620> one<00:05:02.770> here<00:05:03.160> because<00:05:03.370> you

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
into place then put one here because you

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.230 
into place then put one here because you
won't<00:05:04.090> be<00:05:04.240> able<00:05:04.300> to<00:05:04.479> slide<00:05:04.720> it<00:05:04.780> and<00:05:05.669> the<00:05:06.669> side

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
won't be able to slide it and the side

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:14.400 
won't be able to slide it and the side
of<00:05:07.270> the<00:05:07.950> port<00:05:08.950> itself<00:05:09.370> X<00:05:10.360> is<00:05:10.690> the<00:05:11.500> stop<00:05:12.190> so<00:05:13.410> that

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
of the port itself X is the stop so that

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.840 
of the port itself X is the stop so that
should<00:05:14.530> hold<00:05:14.970> all<00:05:15.970> right<00:05:17.040> well<00:05:18.040> here<00:05:18.520> we<00:05:18.640> have

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
should hold all right well here we have

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.680 
should hold all right well here we have
it<00:05:19.090> I've<00:05:19.270> got<00:05:19.540> my<00:05:19.780> table<00:05:20.620> done<00:05:21.010> the<00:05:21.610> table<00:05:22.030> saw

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
it I've got my table done the table saw

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.800 
it I've got my table done the table saw
mounted<00:05:23.349> on<00:05:23.500> top<00:05:23.800> of<00:05:23.830> it<00:05:24.220> it's<00:05:25.150> not<00:05:25.270> complete

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
mounted on top of it it's not complete

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.200 
mounted on top of it it's not complete
but<00:05:26.110> its<00:05:26.349> end<00:05:26.919> of<00:05:27.039> the<00:05:27.099> day<00:05:27.250> so

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
but its end of the day so

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.029 
but its end of the day so
I'm<00:05:28.569> gonna<00:05:28.840> go<00:05:28.990> ahead<00:05:29.080> and<00:05:29.229> wrap<00:05:29.470> it<00:05:29.680> up<00:05:29.830> for

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
I'm gonna go ahead and wrap it up for

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:33.210 
I'm gonna go ahead and wrap it up for
now<00:05:30.160> but<00:05:30.490> so<00:05:30.970> give<00:05:31.330> you<00:05:31.419> an<00:05:31.539> idea<00:05:31.690> of<00:05:32.220> what's

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
now but so give you an idea of what's

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.820 
now but so give you an idea of what's
going<00:05:33.280> on<00:05:33.580> here<00:05:34.060> we've<00:05:34.539> got<00:05:34.690> the<00:05:34.900> tables<00:05:35.680> all

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
going on here we've got the tables all

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.909 
going on here we've got the tables all
set<00:05:35.860> up<00:05:36.520> here<00:05:36.819> I've<00:05:37.180> got<00:05:37.560> plenty<00:05:38.560> of<00:05:38.710> room<00:05:38.860> for

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
set up here I've got plenty of room for

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.379 
set up here I've got plenty of room for
storage<00:05:39.720> on<00:05:40.720> this<00:05:41.110> end<00:05:41.440> I'm<00:05:42.190> probably<00:05:42.910> going

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.389 
storage on this end I'm probably going

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:47.999 
storage on this end I'm probably going
to<00:05:43.479> put<00:05:43.630> my<00:05:44.500> router<00:05:45.270> table<00:05:46.270> or<00:05:46.860> develop<00:05:47.860> that

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:48.009 
to put my router table or develop that

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:52.550 
to put my router table or develop that
for<00:05:48.190> a<00:05:48.220> router<00:05:48.430> table<00:05:49.800> it<00:05:50.880> slides<00:05:51.880> around

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
for a router table it slides around

00:05:52.560 --> 00:06:00.900 
for a router table it slides around
beautifully<00:05:55.289> and<00:05:59.130> in<00:06:00.130> the<00:06:00.310> back<00:06:00.580> we've<00:06:00.880> got

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
beautifully and in the back we've got

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.129 
beautifully and in the back we've got
the<00:06:01.169> dust<00:06:02.169> port<00:06:02.500> dust<00:06:02.860> collection<00:06:03.930> I've<00:06:04.930> got

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:05.139 
the dust port dust collection I've got

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:08.400 
the dust port dust collection I've got
this<00:06:05.740> area<00:06:05.979> here<00:06:06.580> is<00:06:06.759> is<00:06:07.030> open<00:06:07.419> and<00:06:08.020> I've<00:06:08.289> been

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
this area here is is open and I've been

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.409 
this area here is is open and I've been
trying<00:06:08.680> to<00:06:08.770> figure<00:06:08.979> out<00:06:09.039> a<00:06:09.130> way<00:06:09.340> to<00:06:09.370> bring<00:06:10.090> you

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
trying to figure out a way to bring you

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:14.610 
trying to figure out a way to bring you
know<00:06:10.509> make<00:06:10.720> that<00:06:10.900> not<00:06:11.080> open<00:06:11.650> so<00:06:12.570> yeah<00:06:13.570> I<00:06:14.080> don't

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
know make that not open so yeah I don't

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.339 
know make that not open so yeah I don't
know<00:06:14.830> what<00:06:14.949> to<00:06:15.039> do<00:06:15.190> there<00:06:15.430> but<00:06:15.729> I<00:06:16.000> might<00:06:16.960> just<00:06:16.990> I

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:17.349 
know what to do there but I might just I

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:19.499 
know what to do there but I might just I
just<00:06:17.620> leave<00:06:17.800> it<00:06:17.860> open<00:06:18.160> or<00:06:18.280> put<00:06:18.520> a<00:06:18.550> entire<00:06:19.210> box

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:19.509 
just leave it open or put a entire box

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:23.219 
just leave it open or put a entire box
around<00:06:19.900> it<00:06:20.169> so<00:06:20.889> and<00:06:21.520> I<00:06:21.759> left<00:06:21.970> a<00:06:22.150> tall<00:06:22.360> area<00:06:22.750> on

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:23.229 
around it so and I left a tall area on

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:27.899 
around it so and I left a tall area on
this<00:06:23.680> side<00:06:23.949> so<00:06:24.669> that<00:06:24.970> I<00:06:25.270> I've<00:06:26.229> got<00:06:26.530> my<00:06:27.069> sleds

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:27.909 
this side so that I I've got my sleds

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:30.360 
this side so that I I've got my sleds
and<00:06:28.210> and<00:06:28.659> whatnot<00:06:29.020> that<00:06:29.229> I<00:06:29.289> use<00:06:29.560> on<00:06:29.770> here<00:06:30.069> so

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
and and whatnot that I use on here so

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.300 
and and whatnot that I use on here so
over<00:06:31.150> all<00:06:31.300> in<00:06:31.630> all<00:06:31.750> I<00:06:31.780> think<00:06:32.199> it's<00:06:32.349> a<00:06:32.500> pretty

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
over all in all I think it's a pretty

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.550 
over all in all I think it's a pretty
solid<00:06:33.520> build<00:06:33.940> it's<00:06:34.720> got<00:06:34.870> a<00:06:34.900> little<00:06:35.199> bit<00:06:35.349> of<00:06:35.470> a

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
solid build it's got a little bit of a

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.200 
solid build it's got a little bit of a
vibration<00:06:35.770> when<00:06:36.639> it's<00:06:36.789> when<00:06:36.909> it's<00:06:37.090> locked

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210 
vibration when it's when it's locked

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.409 
vibration when it's when it's locked
down<00:06:37.449> so<00:06:38.250> I<00:06:39.250> think<00:06:39.520> if<00:06:39.610> I<00:06:39.699> were<00:06:39.820> doing<00:06:39.909> it<00:06:40.060> again

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:40.419 
down so I think if I were doing it again

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:44.540 
down so I think if I were doing it again
I<00:06:40.449> might<00:06:40.750> put<00:06:40.990> some<00:06:42.419> rubber<00:06:43.419> shock-absorbing

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
I might put some rubber shock-absorbing

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.270 
I might put some rubber shock-absorbing
and<00:06:45.550> the<00:06:45.729> base<00:06:45.940> but<00:06:46.840> it's<00:06:47.710> it's<00:06:48.009> not<00:06:48.159> gonna

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 
and the base but it's it's not gonna

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.209 
and the base but it's it's not gonna
rattle<00:06:48.580> apart<00:06:49.030> by<00:06:49.240> any<00:06:49.389> means<00:06:49.919> all<00:06:50.919> right<00:06:51.070> well

00:06:51.209 --> 00:06:51.219 
rattle apart by any means all right well

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:52.560 
rattle apart by any means all right well
that<00:06:51.370> pretty<00:06:51.610> much<00:06:51.729> wraps<00:06:51.880> it<00:06:52.030> up<00:06:52.120> for<00:06:52.180> tonight

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:52.570

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:05.560 
table-saw cabinet workstations that I've

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.740 
table-saw cabinet workstations that I've
seen<00:07:05.740> online<00:07:05.919> that<00:07:06.610> were<00:07:07.150> sort<00:07:07.599> of<00:07:07.659> the

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:07.750

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.670 
seen online that were sort of the
inspiration<00:07:07.960> for<00:07:08.530> this<00:07:08.710> and<00:07:09.930> next<00:07:10.930> one<00:07:11.110> is

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 
inspiration for this and next one is

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.499 
inspiration for this and next one is
either<00:07:12.159> going<00:07:12.370> to<00:07:12.430> be<00:07:12.520> photography<00:07:13.090> related

either going to be photography related

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:15.779 
either going to be photography related
or<00:07:13.690> I<00:07:13.719> might<00:07:14.080> continue<00:07:14.740> building<00:07:15.039> out<00:07:15.400> on<00:07:15.610> this

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:15.789 
or I might continue building out on this

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:26.439 
or I might continue building out on this
alright<00:07:16.509> thanks<00:07:17.080> a<00:07:17.139> lot<00:07:17.289> bye
