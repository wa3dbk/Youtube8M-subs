00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
about is the odds test itself now if you

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.780 
about is the odds test itself now if you
look<00:00:33.090> up<00:00:33.239> aisles<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:34.170> any<00:00:34.860> internet<00:00:35.340> search

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
look up aisles on any internet search

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.680 
look up aisles on any internet search
engine<00:00:36.149> for<00:00:36.840> example<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.829> google<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.690> what

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
engine for example you google it what

you see is that it is a it is an
international<00:00:45.239> standardized<00:00:45.840> test<00:00:46.230> that's

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
international standardized test that's

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.860

can understand meaning that it's the

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.350 
can understand meaning that it's the

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
show is that it has a system that works

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.440 
show is that it has a system that works
for<00:01:20.240> everybody

anywhere in the world now if you know
history<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.070> Isles<00:01:26.369> obviously<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.909> has

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
history of Isles obviously it has

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.450 
history of Isles obviously it has
changed<00:01:27.990> over<00:01:28.229> time<00:01:28.409> but<00:01:28.650> for<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.159> last<00:01:29.340> few

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
changed over time but for the last few

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.789 
changed over time but for the last few
years<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:30.000> hasn't<00:01:30.329> changed<00:01:30.530> what<00:01:31.530> does<00:01:31.770> that

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
years it hasn't changed what does that

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.649 
years it hasn't changed what does that
tell<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.689> it<00:01:33.689> tells<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:35.369> test<00:01:35.670> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
tell you it tells you that the test the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.830 
tell you it tells you that the test the
system<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.650> in<00:01:37.890> place<00:01:38.270> has<00:01:39.270> been<00:01:39.479> working

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
system that is in place has been working

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.630 
system that is in place has been working
for<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.439> last<00:01:40.619> few<00:01:40.799> years<00:01:40.860> otherwise<00:01:41.460> it

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
for the last few years otherwise it

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.399 
for the last few years otherwise it
would<00:01:41.729> have<00:01:41.850> changed<00:01:41.909> if<00:01:42.329> there<00:01:43.020> was<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> system

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
would have changed if there was a system

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.740 
would have changed if there was a system
to<00:01:43.770> build<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.130> system<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:45.270> would've<00:01:45.600> worked

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
to build the system it would've worked

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.980 
to build the system it would've worked
if<00:01:45.990> there<00:01:46.079> was<00:01:46.409> any<00:01:46.649> tricks<00:01:47.070> as<00:01:47.990> some

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
if there was any tricks as some

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.670 
if there was any tricks as some
Institute's<00:01:49.979> might<00:01:50.399> promote<00:01:51.360> if<00:01:51.869> those

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
Institute's might promote if those

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.520 
Institute's might promote if those
tricks<00:01:53.250> would<00:01:53.850> have<00:01:54.000> worked<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.600> freaking<00:01:55.409> the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
tricks would have worked in freaking the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.999 
tricks would have worked in freaking the
system<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.790> get<00:01:57.119> someone<00:01:57.659> as<00:01:57.869> core<00:01:58.710> higher

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
system to get someone as core higher

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.069 
system to get someone as core higher
than<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.520> they<00:02:00.500> they<00:02:01.640> should<00:02:02.640> get<00:02:03.079> what

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
than that they they should get what

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.440 
than that they they should get what
would<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.320> happen<00:02:04.469> is<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.280> Isles<00:02:05.640> authorities

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
would it happen is the Isles authorities

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.380 
would it happen is the Isles authorities
would<00:02:06.659> have<00:02:06.780> changed<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.799> system<00:02:08.220> but<00:02:09.060> the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
would have changed the system but the

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.809 
would have changed the system but the
test<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:09.929> in<00:02:10.080> place<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.530> structure<00:02:11.009> it

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
test that is in place the structure it

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.490 
test that is in place the structure it
hasn't<00:02:12.120> changed

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
hasn't changed

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.900 
hasn't changed
the<00:02:12.590> last<00:02:12.740> few<00:02:12.950> years<00:02:12.980> that<00:02:13.520> means<00:02:13.670> it's

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
the last few years that means it's

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.970 
the last few years that means it's
working<00:02:14.330> right<00:02:15.050> so<00:02:16.480> if<00:02:17.480> you<00:02:18.410> are<00:02:18.560> thinking

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
working right so if you are thinking

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.950 
working right so if you are thinking
that<00:02:19.270> you<00:02:20.270> would<00:02:21.170> be<00:02:22.070> able<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:22.670> learn<00:02:23.030> few<00:02:23.600> tips

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
that you would be able to learn few tips

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.740 
that you would be able to learn few tips
and<00:02:24.110> tricks<00:02:24.170> and<00:02:24.680> you'll<00:02:25.430> be<00:02:25.640> able<00:02:25.730> to<00:02:26.030> beat

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
and tricks and you'll be able to beat

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.070 
and tricks and you'll be able to beat
the<00:02:26.930> system<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:27.530> get<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:27.980> higher<00:02:28.220> score<00:02:29.080> that

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
the system and get a higher score that

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.890 
the system and get a higher score that
is<00:02:30.320> unlikely<00:02:31.160> to<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.610> unlikely<00:02:32.450> to<00:02:32.570> happen<00:02:32.810> in

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
is unlikely to the unlikely to happen in

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.670 
is unlikely to the unlikely to happen in
the<00:02:32.990> sense<00:02:33.200> that<00:02:34.180> if<00:02:35.180> you<00:02:35.540> are<00:02:35.870> at<00:02:36.470> a<00:02:36.500> level

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
the sense that if you are at a level

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.770 
the sense that if you are at a level
where<00:02:37.360> you<00:02:38.360> would<00:02:38.900> probably<00:02:39.320> get<00:02:39.470> 5<00:02:40.160> or<00:02:40.600> 5.5<00:02:41.600> in

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
where you would probably get 5 or 5.5 in

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.440 
where you would probably get 5 or 5.5 in
Al's<00:02:41.950> you<00:02:42.950> can't<00:02:43.190> really<00:02:43.580> learn<00:02:43.910> some<00:02:44.240> tricks

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
Al's you can't really learn some tricks

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.240 
Al's you can't really learn some tricks
and<00:02:44.660> get<00:02:44.900> 7.5<00:02:45.560> you<00:02:46.130> know<00:02:46.250> what<00:02:46.340> I<00:02:46.400> mean<00:02:46.580> so<00:02:48.250> let
