00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
both front and back now looking first at

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.689 
both front and back now looking first at
the<00:00:41.469> front<00:00:41.710> you<00:00:41.829> can<00:00:41.859> see<00:00:42.010> that<00:00:42.489> there's<00:00:42.640> a

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699 
the front you can see that there's a

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:44.189 
the front you can see that there's a
front<00:00:43.030> facing<00:00:43.239> camera<00:00:43.629> in<00:00:43.719> the<00:00:43.809> top<00:00:43.989> right

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
front facing camera in the top right

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:46.290 
front facing camera in the top right
corner<00:00:44.410> we've<00:00:45.129> got<00:00:45.280> a<00:00:45.309> cut<00:00:45.579> out<00:00:45.609> for<00:00:45.940> that<00:00:45.969> i'll

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
corner we've got a cut out for that i'll

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.849 
corner we've got a cut out for that i'll
give<00:00:46.449> it<00:00:46.480> a<00:00:46.629> still<00:00:46.899> image<00:00:46.929> of<00:00:47.260> that<00:00:47.289> for<00:00:47.710> you

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:49.929 
also have a cut out for this earpiece at

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:52.200 
also have a cut out for this earpiece at
the<00:00:50.019> top<00:00:50.260> and<00:00:50.530> then<00:00:51.010> you<00:00:51.129> get<00:00:51.339> a<00:00:51.399> cutout<00:00:51.820> also

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
the top and then you get a cutout also

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.819 
the top and then you get a cutout also
for<00:00:52.420> these<00:00:52.510> sensors<00:00:52.899> in<00:00:53.019> the<00:00:53.109> top<00:00:53.289> left<00:00:53.499> corner

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
for these sensors in the top left corner

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:55.979 
for these sensors in the top left corner
i<00:00:54.070> believe<00:00:54.730> there<00:00:54.879> is<00:00:54.999> a<00:00:55.030> light<00:00:55.390> sensor<00:00:55.660> and

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
i believe there is a light sensor and

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.450 
i believe there is a light sensor and
possibly<00:00:56.440> a<00:00:56.530> motion<00:00:56.920> sensor<00:00:57.070> out<00:00:57.309> there

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
possibly a motion sensor out there

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.860 
possibly a motion sensor out there
there's<00:00:57.640> two<00:00:57.789> sensors<00:00:58.210> that<00:00:58.359> you<00:00:58.480> get<00:00:58.600> a<00:00:58.629> cut

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
there's two sensors that you get a cut

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.529 
there's two sensors that you get a cut
out<00:00:58.899> around<00:00:59.230> right<00:01:00.010> there<00:01:00.239> also<00:01:01.239> looking<00:01:01.510> at

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
out around right there also looking at

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.689 
out around right there also looking at
the<00:01:01.929> front<00:01:02.230> it<00:01:02.440> is<00:01:02.710> interesting<00:01:03.339> to<00:01:03.370> note<00:01:03.519> that

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
the front it is interesting to note that

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.670

the<00:01:04.059> the<00:01:04.600> glass<00:01:04.870> here<00:01:05.140> on<00:01:05.230> the<00:01:05.320> front<00:01:05.560> is

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
the the glass here on the front is

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.980 
the the glass here on the front is
tapered<00:01:06.190> or<00:01:06.400> rounded<00:01:06.909> on<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:07.270> right<00:01:07.750> and<00:01:07.930> left

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.140 
tapered or rounded on the right and left
edges<00:01:08.320> and<00:01:08.710> that<00:01:08.770> that's<00:01:09.760> going<00:01:09.909> to<00:01:09.970> mean<00:01:10.090> that

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
edges and that that's going to mean that

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.969 
edges and that that's going to mean that
you'll<00:01:10.420> need<00:01:10.570> a<00:01:10.630> good<00:01:11.140> screen<00:01:11.470> predictor<00:01:11.799> that

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
you'll need a good screen predictor that

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.469 
you'll need a good screen predictor that
has<00:01:12.130> adhesive<00:01:12.520> on<00:01:12.820> it<00:01:12.850> that's<00:01:13.119> going<00:01:13.270> to<00:01:13.360> be

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
has adhesive on it that's going to be

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.330 
has adhesive on it that's going to be
able<00:01:13.600> to<00:01:13.810> adhere<00:01:13.960> over<00:01:14.619> that<00:01:14.770> tapered<00:01:15.189> edge

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
able to adhere over that tapered edge

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.960 
able to adhere over that tapered edge
and<00:01:15.610> this<00:01:16.180> protector<00:01:16.780> does<00:01:16.960> that<00:01:17.170> flawlessly

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
and this protector does that flawlessly

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.920 
and this protector does that flawlessly
turning<00:01:18.970> over<00:01:19.060> to<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:19.360> back<00:01:19.509> you<00:01:19.750> can<00:01:19.780> see

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
turning over to the back you can see

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.810 
turning over to the back you can see
that<00:01:20.140> we've<00:01:20.740> got<00:01:20.950> a<00:01:20.979> piece<00:01:21.189> of<00:01:21.220> glass<00:01:21.399> here

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
that we've got a piece of glass here

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.940 
that we've got a piece of glass here
that<00:01:21.970> has<00:01:22.119> a<00:01:22.149> speaker<00:01:22.780> hole<00:01:23.049> in<00:01:23.229> it<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:23.469> we

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
that has a speaker hole in it and we

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.410 
that has a speaker hole in it and we
have<00:01:24.009> a<00:01:24.070> cut<00:01:24.310> out<00:01:24.430> for<00:01:24.610> that<00:01:24.700> speaker<00:01:25.060> bowl<00:01:25.240> so

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
have a cut out for that speaker bowl so

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.090 
have a cut out for that speaker bowl so
it<00:01:25.509> doesn't<00:01:25.750> muffle<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.049> noise<00:01:26.290> and<00:01:26.500> then

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
it doesn't muffle the noise and then

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.770 
it doesn't muffle the noise and then
you've<00:01:27.250> also<00:01:27.369> got<00:01:27.700> a<00:01:27.729> cutout<00:01:28.000> for<00:01:28.360> the<00:01:28.420> LED

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
you've also got a cutout for the LED
