00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
and vice versa vice versa because you

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.550 
and vice versa vice versa because you
get<00:02:11.459> he<00:02:11.640> would<00:02:11.790> switch<00:02:12.000> people<00:02:12.260> so<00:02:13.260> while<00:02:13.470> he

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
get he would switch people so while he

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.860 
get he would switch people so while he
was<00:02:13.650> such<00:02:13.800> as<00:02:13.950> targets<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.370> mean<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:14.840> then<00:02:15.840> a

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
was such as targets I mean and then a

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.259 
was such as targets I mean and then a
further<00:02:16.739> into<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.250> round<00:02:17.430> what<00:02:17.730> happens<00:02:18.030> is

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
further into the round what happens is

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.270 
further into the round what happens is
that<00:02:18.300> they<00:02:19.080> get<00:02:19.319> into<00:02:19.530> actually<00:02:19.980> towards<00:02:20.220> the

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
that they get into actually towards the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.589 
that they get into actually towards the
end<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.489> round<00:02:20.640> they<00:02:20.819> end<00:02:21.000> up<00:02:21.150> getting<00:02:21.480> on

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
end of the round they end up getting on

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.040 
end of the round they end up getting on
a<00:02:21.630> turret<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.459> they<00:02:23.459> have<00:02:23.610> snarky<00:02:24.090> kind<00:02:24.989> of

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
a turret and they have snarky kind of

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.410 
a turret and they have snarky kind of
lead<00:02:25.200> him<00:02:25.290> in<00:02:25.440> and<00:02:25.800> getting<00:02:26.610> charged<00:02:27.030> up<00:02:27.269> and

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
lead him in and getting charged up and

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.180 
lead him in and getting charged up and
then<00:02:27.599> country<00:02:28.140> literally<00:02:28.440> just<00:02:28.680> lays<00:02:28.950> into

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
then country literally just lays into

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.800 
then country literally just lays into
him<00:02:29.400> with<00:02:29.489> his<00:02:29.640> turn<00:02:29.819> I<00:02:30.000> mean<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.269> so<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.750> was

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
him with his turn I mean it so it was

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.250 
him with his turn I mean it so it was
probably<00:02:31.110> like<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:32.340> took<00:02:32.489> a<00:02:32.640> good<00:02:33.140> six<00:02:34.140> or

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
probably like it took a good six or

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.900 
probably like it took a good six or
seven<00:02:34.590> minutes<00:02:34.860> probably<00:02:35.010> well<00:02:35.430> probably

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
seven minutes probably well probably

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.720 
seven minutes probably well probably
closer<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.299> 10<00:02:36.569> minutes<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.959> fight<00:02:37.140> him<00:02:37.730> now

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
closer to 10 minutes to fight him now

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.460 
closer to 10 minutes to fight him now
