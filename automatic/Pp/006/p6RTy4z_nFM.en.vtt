00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.140
 hi to all of you today I do this to you 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:10.809
 short video where I show you adv 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:14.000
 lancer on the acer iconia tablet a500 one 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:17.150
 as he had already seen 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.950
 in other videos we have also installed 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.910
 go launcher 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:27.560
 spb shell 3d at the time when i was 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:29.890
 update or with 3.0.1 adv 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.810
 lancer wasn't going so well 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.079
 today 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.239
 I have to think again and this launch 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.510
 turns out to be really fluid indeed 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:43.809
 now I 'd put it on top of the lancers 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.460
 to be installed on the italy suite tablet 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.150
 let's see this launcher 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:53.640
 moment the speed of traditions 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:55.710
 of the screens and really fast 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.909
 I didn't have any slowdown 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.940
 in the opening of various applications and ho 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:05.420
 could see 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.960
 personalization 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.620
 really high of this launcher 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.000
 own words 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:17.790
 we will have in the sidebar at the top 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.510
 all the options we need to 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.100
 example here at the top left we will have the 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.600
 possibility to enter the menu of 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.650
 landscape with all ours 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.720
 applications 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:33.000
 we could also set the method of 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.890
 display in this case set 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.720
 vertical 4d which I think I like 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.990
 we can also set the various ones a lot 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.210
 eg opening effects 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.890
 of the duty application in this case 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.470
 put the effect fades but we could also 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.620
 set other slices as the effect 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.780
 the best fades 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.510
 nothing we could even go set 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.500
 various gestures now in this case 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:07.290
 set the gesture that if we do 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.979
 a scroll down 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:14.540
 we do display or we could 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.790
 display the dock bar below 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.900
 dockbar very useful to put all the 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.740
 our fast connections 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.100
 nothing to enter the settings 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.500
 of the launcher we will have to push this 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.230
 small button in the upper right corner where ce 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.160
 we will have the adv settings as 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.170
 you can see in each in each item of 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.690
 menu we have so many things to 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.090
 set by icons from doc to 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.060
 screen preferences the effects of 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.570
 we could also transition and so high 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.920
 download themes and select some 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.709
 themes 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:57.900
 let's say maybe the issues in my opinion 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.260
 they are not really optimized to the maximum 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.900
 for tablet in my opinion it is better to keep 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.489
 the one that already offers us by default 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.290
 we could also set all the various 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.750
 behaviors as already mentioned at the beginning 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.430
 for example the transition effects i 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:17.070
 gesture and also system preferences 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.080
 I do I leave you want to find out all 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.540
 and all the various settings but maybe 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.590
 this ep from the system preference ve 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.720
 It notes that the one thing that I think is 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.820
 excellent set the transition of 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.299
 smoke opening because type su 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.940
 enlarge scrolls maybe a little is a 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.510
 shaggy hair we say instead with this 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.510
 effect here 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.030
 It looks a lot like everyone knows much more 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.620
 fast even when we're going to open 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.200
 whatever it goes for example 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:54.680
 to open the browser 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:58.520
 he is now loading the pages, however, like 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.960
 you can see the application itself yes 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.400
 opens very quickly 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.540
 now it also depends on the connection 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.000
 right because we are here I show 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.510
 even a moment the fluidity of the browser 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.540
 which I think is very good too 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.410
 seeing other tablets 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.410
 let's see the pinch to zoom 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.850
 as you can see very responsive though 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.710
 you want we can also go to see a 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.280
 site a little heavier since we are 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:32.780
 here it was either among the favorites or even 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:38.000
 republic since it is one of the sites with 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:39.740
 which tests are performed now also depends 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.990
 from the connection however just to see 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:47.440
 when we are connected the fluidity of 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.440
 content 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.889
 we are in the desktop version 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.360
 Hey 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.810
 right now he is downloading 

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:10.810
 also a video on youtube 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:27.180
 here is how you see it is loading everyone 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:31.460
 contents however you can see that the 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:36.890
 fluidity and very good however not 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:41.450
 no stiffness in the scrolla 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.450
 not even when we reach the end of the race 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.240
 let's see the pinch to zoom for a moment 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.630
 as you can see also here is a lot 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.730
 reactive 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.040
 nothing but back a moment adv lancer 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:58.710
 since the main theme is this 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:04.840
 just to show you that anyway 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:06.850
 everything works very well nothing 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.010
 I wanted to make this short video right 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.990
 to see the good flow 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:13.600
 of this launch you are my second warning 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.729
 me is the fastest and most is 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:19.550
 optimized for tablet differences of 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:24.310
 galan if that's all for now 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.310
 I greet you and the next hello
