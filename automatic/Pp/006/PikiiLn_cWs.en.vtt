 clocked in 1 gig 2 so it is still 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.110

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.100
 million pixels still with our 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.229

 equipped with a flash obviously a camera 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.479
 in front of 2 million pixels and the 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.250
 big feature is it's still 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.149
 the hd screen which is at home also a 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.770
 revolution 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.390

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.160

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.780
 sign five at what price 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.780
 we will be around 200 euros then 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.759
 behind you the two other novelties 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.399
 announced here in monaco is first of all 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.959
 this smartphone 2 5 inches the stairway 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.489
 technical characteristics of this 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:02.110
 device the biggest peculiarity 

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:04.569
 is a design term 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.090
 the frame of the product is completely 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:09.160
 aluminum which is also a 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.840
 revolution in our products but 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.300
 especially in our price range 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.069
 since we are on a finish that even 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.739
 the big brands do not do or very 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.220
 rarely the second big ones 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.050
 developments 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.269
 we're still on a slab in ni ps 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.709
 in hd we continue on the same line and 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:28.330
 a quad core in 1 gigabyte a gigabyte 2 a 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.860
 romance 16 giga which is still what 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.520
 which is not nothing a device 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.350
 photo in 13 million pixels 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.780
 outdoors for 5 million pixels 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.140
 in front, so a real big climb 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.900
 in range 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.480
 the stated goal of going to touch our friends 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.010
 the geeks again but but 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.240
 is it for a price always apricot 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.860
 and then we see little things 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.630
 nice as the smile destexhe 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.700
 enough for Africa any affection from 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.980
 quite the gorilla glass also 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.360
 which is the most screen specificity 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.490
 resistant on the market today 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.870
 and then the usbo tg is actually the usb 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.090
 host did exactly 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.670
 so it plugs in to plug in 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.380
 via a usb key a usb key right away 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.240
 use it as one like a space of 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.640
 storage will say branch directly his 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:11.780
 usb key or its hard drive ok go on 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.600
 so goes to the top of the top it's the 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.730
 big brother the dark side with a screen 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.380
 of 5.7 then we find a new 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.340
 time the peculiarity of aluminum 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.020
 but this time on the back shell 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.120
 so we're on a bath finish rather 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.560
 qualitative the size of the screen is 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.870
 quite particular particular because 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.490
 that we are on 5.7 inches and we 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.640
 always finds the specificities that 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.410
 its quad-core HD screen in 1 gig of the 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.590
